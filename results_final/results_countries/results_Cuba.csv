.In its communications, the complainant provides new information on the specific violations of public freedoms of ASIC union officials and members.
.The complainant alleges, firstly, that  workers,  of which are employed by the State and  are self-employed, remain in prison, some of whom have already received heavy sentences, after having taken part in the peaceful social protests of  and  July . The list of  workers was drawn up by ASIC and its officials, including the provincial secretary of Holgun, Mr Ramn Zamora Rodrguez, who had received threats for publishing it. The complainant indicates in this regard that many international bodies have spoken out against the violations committed by the State on those days, including the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs. The complainant alleges, in addition, that two ASIC members, Mr Yunier Herrera Rodrguez and Mr Humberto Bello Laffita, were arrested [in April ] after taking part in the  peaceful demonstrations. It alleges in this respect that: (i) Mr Yunier Herrera Rodrguez was violently arrested on  July , after peacefully demonstrating to reclaim the trade union rights constantly being violated by the regime. During the arrest, he was violently beaten, during which he lost a number of teeth. In prison, he is being bullied by prison guards who are trying to subjugate him; (ii) Mr Humberto Bello Laffita was arrested after responding to the peaceful call to demonstrate on  November . He was sentenced to a one-year prison term for the alleged offence of  spreading an epidemic'  He is being held in prison ' ' in the San Miguel del Padrn district in Havana, kept in isolation in a punishment cell without electricity or drinking water (communication dated  April ).
.In numerous communications, the complainant alleges that ASIC members and officials are constantly subjected to threats and to frequent brief but arbitrary and intimidating arrests by state security agencies. It alleges specifically that:On  February , the trade union activist, Mr Juan Alberto de la Nuez Ramrez, and brother of the independent ASIC member Mr Brbaro de la Nuez Ramrez, was arrested in Cienfuegos province while returning from a visit to the city of Coln in Matanzas province. Mr Juan Alberto de la Nuez Ramrez was taken in a police car to the provincial unit s technical investigations department of the Departamento de Seguridad del Estado (DSE) (Department of State Security) in the city of Cienfuegos, where he was interrogated for four hours by an official of the secret political police about his visit to Matanzas province and his meeting with the ASIC general secretary. During the interrogation, the official accused him of  mercenary activity'  allegedly for receiving funds from a foreign power for the purpose of  subverting internal order'  He warned him that, in addition to the fact that no trade unionist will be allowed to travel from one province to another for work meetings and that, with the new Criminal Code, any persons who accept financial assistance from abroad, including mobile phone top-ups, will be imprisoned (communication dated  February ).Mr Leonardo Hernndez Camejo, an activist affiliated to ASIC s Havana provincial secretariat, was stopped in the early hours of  March  by a police car as he was leaving his home in the capital s Centro Habana municipality and arbitrarily arrested. He was taken to the Zanja police unit in the same municipality, where he was placed in a cell and interrogated by a DSE agent about his trade union activities. He was released the same day after  p.m. and issued serious threats and warnings (communication dated  March ). He was also threatened by the police during a subsequent interrogation in August  (communication dated  September ).On  February , three state security agents arrested ASIC s general secretary in Holgun province, Mr Ramn Zamora Ricardo Rodrguez, at his home and took him to the criminal prosecution unit in Pedernales, where they issued him with a warning for his posts on social media networks, warning him that if he continued, he would be prosecuted for the offences of  enemy propaganda' and  dissemination of fake news'  Mr Ramn Zamora Ricardo Rodrguez, his two sons Yisan Zamora Ricardo (ASIC youth secretary) and Lisan Zamora Ricardo, and his wife, Ms Mailn Ricardo, were victims of fresh attacks on  October . They were arrested after demonstrating peacefully the previous day in front of their home, banging pots and pans to protest against the continuous and prolonged power cuts, in a simultaneous demonstration with neighbours in the area. Department of State Security agents raided the home of Mr Ramn Zamora Ricardo Rodrguez, seizing all telephones, computer equipment and printed trade union training material, as well as documents relating to his responsibilities as ASIC s national trade union leader. The family was subsequently transferred to the centre for criminal and police investigations in Holgun province for public order offences. The wife was released the same night, and the other family members four",-1,2016,Cuba
1,"days later, without any explanation and with total disregard for their human and procedural rights (communications dated  and  October ).On Sunday  October , ASIC provincial secretary, Mr Ibn Guerra Hernndez, and his wife, Ms Kety Martnez, were summoned to the police unit in the municipality of Santa Cruz del Norte, Mayabeque province. During the interrogation by a DSE agent, the latter threatened the trade unionist with imprisonment and gave him a warning. In the case of his wife, who is not an ASIC member, the police officer interrogated her separately and warned her that her husband would go to prison for his activism and especially for his comments on social media (communication dated  October ).Also subjected to threats from DSE agents, in the province of Cienfuegos in November , were ASIC national executive member, Mr Carlos Roberto Reyes (a victim of similar threats on other occasions), and ASIC representative in the aforementioned province, Ms Consuelo Rodrguez Hernndez, and her husband Mr Lzaro Roberto Aguiar Mendoza (who were subjected to harassment in the street and threats at work). A DSE agent took the opportunity to send an intimidating message through Mr Lzaro Roberto Aguiar Mendoza to Mr Carlos Roberto Reyes Consuegras, ASIC executive member, to stop him from continuing to register complaints and send them to ASIC s general secretary, Mr Ivn Hernndez Carrillo (communication dated  December ).On  December , trade unionists Mr Lzaro Roberto Aguiar Mendoza and Mr Carlos Roberto Reyes Consuegras were arrested in the municipality of Cruces. After agents of the National Revolutionary Police and an unidentified DSE agent searched their belongings, they were warned that they could not leave the municipality of Cruces until after  December. On that date, ASIC provincial secretary, Ms Yorsi Kelin Snchez Perdign, was arrested at her home in Sancti Spritus and taken to the police unit in the city, where she was detained for three days. According to relatives, the arrest followed a call for a national strike. On the same day, several trade unionists were kept under house arrest and not allowed to leave: in the municipality of Caibarin, Mr Ismael Castro Valentn and Ms Dania Marit Noriega Castriz; in Havana, trade union journalist Ms Yunia Figueredo Cruz; in the municipality of Cruces, Mr Carlos Reyes Consuegras; and in Coln, Mr Ivn Hernndez Carrillo, ASIC general secretary, was kept under close guard in and around his home. On  December , another ASIC member, Mr Yolsdan Armenteros Vzquez, was summoned to the rd police unit in Santa Clara, where he was threatened with conviction under the new Criminal Code ' which increases the number of crimes that carry life imprisonment and the death penalty ' if he continued to post news on social media (communication dated  December ).Seven ASIC activists and officials were arrested in early February : activists Mr Luis Orlando Len Randich, Mr Ulises Gonzlez, Mr Leonardo Hernndez Camejo, Ms Yaquelin Dalis Caballero, Mr Felipe Carrera Hernndez, as well as provincial secretaries Mr Reinaldo Cosano Aln and Mr Emilio Gottardi Gottardi, who had previously been briefly arrested on  February  by a police unit while on his way to the home of an opposition activist in the Santo Surez neighbourhood (communication dated  March ). During the arrests, in addition to the persistent threats of judicial sanctions and the attempt to implicate general secretary Mr Ivn Hernndez Carrillo in an offence, an accusation of a heinous crime was recorded for the first time: DSE agents told the detainees that there was a  suspicion' that ASIC members might be involved in the  poisoning of the water in los crculos infantiles [children s day-care centres]'  which, according to the agents, was under investigation (communication dated  February ). Furthermore, during interrogations on  February, the DSE agents added the serious accusation that they considered ASIC to be  a terrorist organization' (communication dated  February ).ASIC general secretary, Mr Ivn Hernndez Carrillo, is particularly targeted by threats. The complainant recalls that he was one of the  prisoners of the  Black Spring' of March , sentenced to an arbitrary and excessive -year prison term, of which he served eight years and six months. In  he was granted a licencia extrapenal [parole], meaning that the sentence still hangs over him and he could be sent to prison to serve the remainder of his sentence without any judicial proceedings (communications dated  September  and  February ). On Tuesday,  February , he was arrested as he left the El Focsa building in Havana, together with another independent trade unionist, Ms Maybell Padilla Prez, and was taken away in a police car. Around  officers from the political and national police took part in the operation led by two DSE agents. The reason for his arrest centred on the ban on visiting Havana. Mr Ivn Hernndez Carrillo was kept locked in a patrol car for four hours, with the outside temperature at  degrees Celsius, before being taken to an interrogation office, where he was stripped completely naked in order to humiliate him. During the interrogation, in addition to the persistent threats of judicial sanctions and that his parole would be revoked, he was also banned from visiting the capital so as to prevent him from carrying out his trade union work (communication dated  February ). The political police officers who interrogated him behaved aggressively and violently throughout. The other trade unionist also suffered the same consequences.On  April , the independent trade unionists Mr Leonardo Hernndez Camejo and Mr Luis Orlando Len Randich were interrogated by DSE agents about their work, as well as, in the same police station in Centro Habana, ASIC provincial secretary Mr Emilio Gottardi Gottardi. On the same day, in a police unit in the municipality of Habana Vieja, independent trade unionist Ms Yaquelin Snchez Batista was also interrogated about her trade union work. The aforementioned events are yet another example of the continued repressive actions of Ministry of the Interior institutions to prevent the normal development of the organization s trade union activities, and show that the aim of the escalation of repression is, as the officials of this institution have stated,  to dismantle ASIC and make it disappear' (communication dated  April ).Independent trade unionists Mr Emilio Gottardi Gottardi and Mr Charles Rodrguez were subjected to unlawful and arbitrary treatment by the political police on their return to the island after attending international events on defending human and labour rights in Panama City in the space of a week. On  May , at around . p.m., on arrival in Havana, from the flight from Panama City, the trade unionists were subjected to an arbitrary search of their luggage and to a  conversation' with the political police ' in reality an interrogation ' about their trade union activities, the names of the leaders with whom they had met and the main issues they had discussed. This unlawful procedure lasted around three hours between the search and the detention, so that they remained at the airport until . a.m., being the last passengers to leave the airport (communication dated  May ).On the occasion of the commemoration of the second anniversary of the mass protests that shook the country on  July , in order to pre-empt potential peaceful protests, in the days leading up to the date the regime arrested, threatened and interrogated a dozen independent trade unionists, Mr Alexis Gmez Rodrguez, Mr Carlos Javier Gmez Guevara, Mr Rodolfo Aparicio Alemn, ASIC provincial secretary Mr Emilio Gottardi Gottardi, and general secretary Mr Ivn Hernndez Carrillo. Similarly, the homes of several ASIC activists were kept under surveillance by DSE agents: the homes of provincial secretary Mr Livn Monteagudo Rivero, independent trade unionists Ms Yunia Figueredo Cruz, Ms Yaquelin Daly Caballero, Mr Ulises Gonzlez Moreno and Mr Emilio Gottardi Gottardi remained under siege throughout the day by police or DSE agents in civilian clothes (communication dated  July ).
.The complainant once again alleges that the harassment also includes a travel ban. Thus, on  March , ASIC s deputy general secretary, Mr Alejandro Snchez Zaldvar, was refused a passport and notified of a ban on travel outside the country. This action is due to the fact that Alejandro visited the ILO headquarters for the th Session of the International Labour Conference, where he denounced the anti-union practices of the Cuban regime. Since then, he has been banned from leaving the national territory, making it impossible for him to attend international events, including seminars, trade union congresses and events held in support of Cuban workers (communication dated  March ).
.Lastly, the complainant alleges that the authorities continue to use the new repressive weapon of cutting off communications. Thus, on  September , trade union and civil society organizations from several countries in the Americas met in the city of San Jos, Costa Rica, for the regional forum on solidarity with Cuban",-1,2016,Cuba
2,"workers. The virtual participation of ASIC leaders was planned. However, the internet connections were individually and selectively cut off to prevent their participation (communications dated  and  September ).
.As regards recommendation (a) of the Committee s last report (recognition and free operation of ASIC), the Government once again states, in its communication dated  October , that: (i) the members of the organization that calls itself ASIC are neither workers nor employers; they do not belong to any labour collective and therefore have not been elected or appointed by the members as trade union representatives; they do not have the objective of promoting or defending workers' interests, nor do they have the genuine support of the membership or any labour collective; and (ii) its supposed members answer to a foreign government, which provides them with funds in the political aim of subverting the internal order legitimately established by the Cuban people. The complainants operate under the agendas of the International Group for Corporate Social Responsibility in Cuba and the American organization National Endowment for Democracy to engage in internal subversion that constitutes an affront to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law, particularly the principles of sovereignty, self-determination and non-interference in internal affairs.
.Regarding recommendation (b) (investigations into the allegations of acts of aggression and restrictions on public freedoms with respect to certain union activists and officials), the Government indicates in its communication dated  October  that: (i) as undertaken each time a communication is received from the ILO or another United Nations mechanism, an investigative action plan was devised and implemented immediately, coordinated by different entities and using the necessary measures and established procedures, in order to verify each of the allegations against the individuals mentioned in the recommendation; and (ii) action taken included: searches in Ministry of the Interior automated records used for monitoring detained persons and other persons prosecuted in connection with alleged criminal acts; use of data intelligence procedures to establish the identity of persons; consultation of databases of bodies such as the Ministry of Justice; locating persons in places of residence; and interviews. The investigations involved heads and specialists from different bodies of the Ministry of the Interior, the General Prosecutor's Office, the People s Supreme Court and the Ministry of Labour and Social Security. The Government reiterates that: (i) none of the persons arrested were genuine trade unionists, let alone trade union leaders; (ii) none of them were tried or sentenced for any act or activity relating to the defence of workers' interests and, less still, with the exercise of trade union freedoms; (iii) the criminal proceedings brought against these individuals were in response to activities constituting offences provided for and sanctioned under the Cuban Criminal Code in force at the time; and (iv) the Cuban legal system, in particular the Constitution, protects and respects the guarantees of due process. Trials are public, oral and adversarial and in accordance with criminal procedural law, and final rulings are communicated to the public prosecutor and the accused person or his or her counsel, who are also provided with a copy. Each of the complainants could provide the Committee with these rulings, if they really have an interest in having them reviewed by the Committee.
.While considering that sufficient information has been provided to refute the reported allegations of attacks, harassment, disrespect for freedoms and restrictions against these persons, the Government indicates that: (i) some of the citizens mentioned in recommendation (b) no longer reside in the national territory. One of their main objectives in engaging in activities against the Cuban constitutional order has been precisely to obtain the corresponding  endorsement' in order to be able to emigrate and more easily obtain immigration status to reside in the United States of America in particular; and (ii) investigations have shown on several occasions that some of these persons have never been subjected to police or any other type of action. They simply fabricate unsubstantiated allegations that the Government is then required to respond to and prove to be false, when they did not even occur. In its communication dated  October , the Government reports on each of the individuals mentioned in recommendation (b):() Mr lvn Hernndez Carrillo: The Committee has been informed on several occasions that this person has no employment relationship and that he has engaged in making false accusations to the ILO supervisory bodies in order to denigrate the country s record on labour and trade union rights. It has been reported on numerous occasions that this citizen has been granted parole and is currently serving the remainder of his sentence in freedom, which ends in the first half of . This means that, under existing criminal legislation in the country, he must comply with certain obligations imposed by law.() Mr Osvaldo Arcis Hernndez: The investigation reiterated that he had been declared  unfit to work' by the Expert Occupational Medical Examination Commission owing to his schizophrenia. His social and moral behaviour is despised by society and he lacks any support in his community.() Mr Brbaro Tejeda Snchez: He displays appalling social behaviour and has been prosecuted on  occasions for the offences of theft, leaving the national territory illegally, public disorder, making threats, speculation, hoarding and handling stolen goods. He left Cuba for Nicaragua in  and has not returned.() Mr Pedro Scull: He has had no employment relationship and no links to ASIC since . It has been reported that this person died in .() Mr Felipe Carrera Hernndez: His activities have been aimed at seeking financial gain, with no credibility in his area of operation.

Since , she has made eight trips abroad, including three to Colombia, two to Panama, two to Peru and one to France. On  June , she left the country for Guyana, to make the journey to settle permanently in the United States. No police action was ever taken against her.() Ms Hilda Ayln Lpez Salazar: She has been living abroad since  April . Between  and  she made four trips abroad, three to Panama and one to the United States.() Mr Pavel Herrera Hernndez: He has been living abroad since  June  and was previously the subject of a criminal prosecution for the offence of theft.() Mr Emilio Gottardi Gottardi: Several allegations have been received by the Committee about this citizen, which have been answered after the corresponding investigations.() Mr Ral Domingo Zerguera Borren: He has not been subjected to measures of any kind, nor has any regulation been imposed on his movements outside the territory. He has complete freedom of movement, precisely because he works as a taxi driver. He is not linked to ASIC at the moment, as he is focused on his arrangements for leaving the country, as he was accepted in the  visa lottery' of the United States embassy.() Mr Reinaldo Cosano Aln: He is unemployed due to his advanced age. No police action has been taken against him. From  to date he has made three trips to Panama and two to Colombia.() Mr Lzaro Ricardo Prez: Since , he has made ten trips to Colombia and Mexico, three to Panama and five to the United States. Since  he has lived in the United States with his family.() Mr Hiosvani Pupo: He currently resides outside Cuba. During his stay in the country, he worked as a bicycle taxi driver in the municipalities of Centro Habana and Habana Vieja, illegally and without applying for the required licence.() Mr Daniel Perea Garca: On  August  he was charged with the offence of receiving and selling electrical transformer oil. He currently has no links with ASIC. He has not been subjected to threats or harassment.() Mr Yisan Zamora Ricardo: He was arrested on  July , charged with the offence of public disorder for holding demonstrations obstructing the public highway. After  hours, he was released, with no other charges against him.() Mr Willian Cruz Delgado: He has an extensive criminal record, which has been previously reported to the Committee. Between  and  he was sanctioned for the offences of assault, making threats, contempt of court and public disorder. On  August , he was fined for contravening the provisions of Decree Law No. / and failing to carry with him his personal identification papers. Between  and , he was reported on four occasions for less serious injury, contempt and public disorder; he was also taken on nine occasions to a National Revolutionary Police station for engaging in the illicit sale of goods and foreign currency. It was ascertained that this person has never been prosecuted for",-1,2016,Cuba
3,"exercising his labour or trade union rights.() Mr Yuvisley Roque Rajadel: He now resides permanently abroad. During his stay in the country he remained unemployed.() Ms Yadislandia Hurtado Bicet: She is not linked to any trade union association in Cuba, nor is she linked to ASIC. The link that has been established is related to the support she receives from Mr Ivn Hernndez Carrillo, for personal interests that are unrelated to labour or trade union matters.() Mr Dannery Gmez Galeto: He now resides permanently abroad. During his stay in the country he remained unemployed.() Mr Roque lvn Martnez Beldarran: This is a person with a long criminal record, which has already been reported to the Committee. He was dismissed from the Port of Cienfuegos due to repeated indiscipline associated with unjustified absences, lateness, mistreatment and disrespect towards co-workers and superiors, for which he was repeatedly summoned by members of his trade union branch and workplace management, who then terminated his contract in accordance with the established procedures.() Mr Alejandro Snchez Zaldvar: This person has no employment relationships. Investigations have shown that there is no record of any police action or complaint against him in .() Mr Jefferson Ismael Polo Mezerene: He has no links to ASIC. He and his mother, Ms Anairis Dania Mezerene, were arrested and taken to the national police unit in Holgun at . p.m. on  July  for a breach of public order during disturbances on that day. Polo Mezerene was held there for  hours and subsequently released with an administrative fine.() Mr Ramn Zamora Rodrguez and Mr Yisan Zamora Ricardo: Information on these two citizens has been sent to the Committee in the past following relevant investigations.() Mr Lisan Zamora Ricardo: No police action has been taken against him, let alone any kind of harassment.() Mr Ulises Rafael Hernndez Lpez: This is a person who displays anti-social behaviour, with three official warnings issued for such behaviour, for not looking after his children and for breach of public order.() Mr Humberto Jos Bello Laffita: Detailed information on this person was sent to the Committee in response to two communications received during the period.() Ms Aime de las Mercedes Cabrera lvarez: No police action has been taken against this citizen.

She has no employment relationship.() Ms Consuelo Rodrguez Hernndez: No police action has been taken against this citizen.() Ms Maln Ricardo Gngora: No police action has been taken against this citizen either. As far as is known, she has no links with any trade union group or with ASIC.
.Regarding recommendation (c) (conducting an investigation into the allegations of acts of aggression and restrictions on public freedoms raised in the communication dated  December , namely concerning Mr Ivn Hernndez Carrillo, ASIC general secretary), the Government refers to the information that it provided relating to recommendation (b).
.With regard to recommendation (d) (alleged restrictions imposed on the capacity of ASIC members to participate in international activities in connection with their trade union work), the Government reiterates in its communication dated  October  that in Cuba the right of every person to leave the country and return from abroad is protected and guaranteed. Current migration legislation determines the grounds on which the authorities may restrict the right of a person to leave the country and this is regulated clearly and precisely in article  of Decree Law No.  of , amending Act No.  of , the  Migration Act'  This power is exercised in a non-arbitrary manner, in accordance with the law and respecting the guarantees provided. The Government reiterates that the restriction of access to virtual platforms is related to technical obsolescence resulting from the policy of sanctions imposed by the United States' Government on Cuba (communication dated  March ). Attempting to use the argument of the impossibility of participating in a virtual forum through a platform prohibited in Cuba, holding the Cuban Government responsible and not the Government imposing such restrictions, demonstrates the complainants' real objective.
.With reference to recommendation (e) (restrictions on the freedom of movement of ASIC officials in national territory), the Government reiterates that the alleged restrictions by the national authorities are false.
.Regarding recommendation (f) (alleged anti-union dismissals), the Government provides information on the situation of Mr Ismael Valentn Castro and Ms Dania Marit Noriega Castriz, stating that the complainants are untruthful when they allege that the dismissals of Mr Ismael Valentn Castro and Ms Dania Noriega Castriz are politically motivated in connection with their apparent  trade union activism'  However, Cuba's willingness to cooperate with the ILO supervisory bodies led to a thorough investigation resulting in clarification of the true nature of the facts: in the context of the COVID- pandemic, isolation centres were created, such as in the province of Villa Clara, where the  Brisas del Mar' basic business unit for accommodation and catering services was set up in the municipality of Caibarin. In the aforementioned entity, violations of the prices established for the products on offer were detected, for which disciplinary measures and financial sanctions were applied against all those responsible. In the case of Ms Dania Noriega Castriz, she was fined under article (h) of Decree No.   On personal offences, sanctions, measures and procedures to be applied for the violation of the rules governing the pricing and tariff policy' of the Council of Ministers of  January . The corresponding inspection report of the Integral Supervision Directorate states the reasons why these sanctions were applied. As a result of this measure, her husband, Mr Ismael Castro Valentn, voluntarily asked to be relieved of his position in the enterprise (communications dated  March and  October ).
.With regard to recommendation (g) (proposed direct contacts mission), the Government reports that it is still considering the proposed direct contacts mission.
.In its communications, the Government rejects ASIC's new allegations and reiterates that the complainants are not trade unionists and are not acting independently. It reiterates that they are persons funded by foreign governments, with the aim of presenting themselves as independent trade union activists, inventing violations of workers' rights by the Government and denouncing them without evidence. The Government reiterates once again in this regard that Mr Ivn Hernandez Carrillo is a Cuban citizen with no employment relationship, who has engaged in making false accusations to the ILO supervisory bodies in order to denigrate the country s record on labour and trade union rights (communications dated  July and  October , and  October ).
.The Government once again stresses that the Cuban authorities, including the security and law enforcement agencies and their officers, must adhere strictly to the law and are in no circumstances permitted to threaten or intimidate citizens; should such acts occur, there are mechanisms to report them and to adopt the necessary internal disciplinary and criminal measures.
.With regard to the facts and persons mentioned in the new allegations, the Government reports the following, in its communications of  and  August , and  April,  and  October : (i) Mr Juan Alberto de la Nuez Ramrez: it is false to claim that he was arrested on  February . There is no evidence in any police record of this citizen having been arrested, let alone detained in a Ministry of the Interior facility; (ii) Mr Ramn Zamora Rodrguez: neither he, nor his children or wife, have been victims of threats, persecution or harassment, but rather they committed acts designated as breaches of public order (communication dated  February ); (iii) Mr Emilio Gottardi Gottardi: on  February , he was fined  Cuban pesos under Decree Law No. (h) for attempting to breach a security measure on the public highway. There is no evidence of any other action against this person; (iv) Mr Alejandro Snchez Zaldvar: he has had no employment relationship since , he is neither a leader nor representative of any trade union organization and there is no evidence of police surveillance against him; (v) Mr Leonardo Hernndez Camejo: relevant investigations were carried out and no link to ASIC was established in respect of this citizen. However, it was known that this was a person with numerous previous convictions. There is no evidence in any police records that any action was taken to detain him on  March  or on  April , as indicated in the allegations; (vi) Mr Humberto Bello Laffita: following investigations, it has been established that this citizen has had no links to ASIC. This person was the subject of sanctions in November  for failing to comply with the measures ordered by the health authorities to curb the COVID- pandemic. He was the subject of a criminal prosecution in Case No. /, acknowledging his responsibility for the acts for which he was charged. The trial was held with all the guarantees established by criminal law and, at",-1,2016,Cuba
4,"the time of sentencing, the court took into account the previous conduct of the accused who had been prosecuted for the offences of illegal currency trafficking, theft, contempt and resistance. He was also officially warned about conduct likely to encourage prostitution. It is false to claim that he is in solitary confinement. Mr Humberto Bello Laffita enjoys the conditions required for Cuban prisons, including the '  ' facility where he is serving his sentence. He has electricity, water and the possibility of making telephone calls and receiving visits from family members; (vii) Mr Yunier Herrera Rodrguez: it is false to state that he was arrested for peacefully claiming trade union rights. He was arrested when found inebriated on the public highway shouting abusive phrases, totally unrelated to labour or trade union matters; (viii) lastly the Government denies the allegations that seven ASIC activists and officials were arrested in early February  and rejects the allegations of interrogation or detention concerning Luis Orlando Len Randich and Yaqueln Snchez Batista.
.With regard to the disturbances that occurred on  July , referred to in the allegation letter, the Government indicates, in its communication dated  October , that: (i) peace was disturbed for the deliberate purpose of subverting the constitutional order. There was a very serious incitement to violence in the country, causing injuries and endangering collective security and the lives of citizens, officials and law enforcement officers. Property and facilities were damaged and destroyed; (ii) no one was arrested or punished for exercising their constitutionally recognized rights, including their labour and trade union rights; and (iii) the ILO complaints mechanism cannot be used to settle issues unrelated to alleged violations of freedom of association. There is an attempt to make people believe that there is a  wave of repression' in the country against alleged independent trade unionists, which is doubly false, given that there is neither repression nor are the persons mentioned in the allegation submitted trade unionists.
.The Government indicates that, since the receipt of the communication of  April , a thorough investigation has been conducted into the list of persons submitted as an annex. There is no evidence of the dissemination of this alleged list of workers, let alone that anyone has been threatened because of it or because it was drawn up. In particular, the alleged threats to Mr Ramn Zamora Rodrguez have not been proven.
.The Committee recalls that this complaint concerns several allegations of acts of aggression, harassment, persecution, arrests, assault and restrictions on the free movement of trade union officials and members while carrying out their functions by state security forces. The complainant also denounces its non-recognition by the Government.
.As regards recommendation (a) (recognition and free operation of ASIC), the Committee notes that the Government once again stresses that: (i) ASIC is not a trade union organization; ASIC members do not have employment relationships, do not belong to any labour collective and therefore have not been elected or appointed by the members as trade union representatives; they do not have the objective of promoting or defending workers' interests, nor do they have the genuine support of the membership or any labour collective; and (ii) its supposed members answer to a foreign government, which provides them with funds in the political aim of subverting the legitimately established internal order.
.In this regard, the Committee firstly recalls that, for several decades, it has been examining allegations of non-recognition and interference by the Government in the free operation of trade union organizations not affiliated to the Confederation of Workers of Cuba [see Cases Nos , , ,  and  of the Committee on Freedom of Association]. The Committee also recalls that the right to official recognition through legal registration is an essential facet of the right to organize since this is the first step that workers' or employers' organizations must take in order to be able to function efficiently, and represent their members adequately; and a long registration procedure constitutes a serious obstacle to the establishment of organizations and amounts to a denial of the right of workers to establish organizations without previous authorization. It further recalls that freedom of association implies the right of workers and employers to elect their representatives in full freedom and to organize their administration and activities without any interference by the public authorities [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , paras ,  and ]. Considering that, according to the information provided by the complainant, some trade union members and officials mentioned in the complaint were self-employed workers, and that others had been dismissed for anti-union reasons, the Committee secondly recalls that that the criterion for determining the persons covered by the right to organize is not based on the existence of an employment relationship. Workers who do not have employment contracts should have the right to form the organizations of their choosing if they so wish [see Compilation, para. ]. The Committee reiterates that in its initial examination of this case, it had noted that ASIC, in its founding declaration of principles, advocates trade union autonomy in the framework of the rule of law, aims to promote full compliance with ILO international labour standards and proclaims that it will not compromise or associate itself with party-political activities. In its union constitution, ASIC states that its key objectives include grouping together independent trade unions and reporting violations of international labour standards. Moreover, ASIC members' duties as set out in the union constitution include defending workers' claims and benefits. It is in this context that the Committee observes that the elements of ASIC s declaration of principles and union constitution fall within the scope of action and definition of a workers' organization. The Committee can only regret that there has been no progress since its last examination of this case and therefore once again refers to its previous conclusions and once more strongly urges the Government to ensure that ASIC is given recognition, and that it can freely operate and carry out its trade union activities.
.Regarding recommendation (b) (investigations into the allegations of acts of aggression and restrictions on public freedoms with respect to certain union activists and officials), the Committee notes that the Government, in its communication dated  October , provides information about the members identified in the said recommendation, indicating or reiterating that the persons in question: (i) do not have, or have not had, employment relationships (Mr Ivn Hernndez Carrillo, Ms Ariadna Mena, Mr Ral Domingo Zerguera Borren, Mr Reinaldo Cosano Aln, Mr Daniel Perea Garca, Mr Yuvisley Roque Rajadel, Ms Yadislandia Hurtado Bicet, Mr Dannery Gmez Galeto, Mr Alejandro Snchez Zaldvar, Mr Jefferson Ismael Polo Mezerene); (ii) continue to engage in inappropriate social behaviour and/or have committed offences, including public order offences (Mr Osvaldo Arcis Hernndez, Mr Brbaro Tejeda Snchez, Mr Felipe Carrera Hernndez, Mr Pavel Herrera Hernndez, Mr Daniel Perea Garca, Mr Yisan Zamora Ricardo, Mr Willian Cruz Delgado, Mr Roque Ivn Martnez Baldarran, Mr Jefferson Ismael Polo Mezerene, Ms Anairis Dania Mezerene, Mr Ulises Rafael Hernndez Lpez); (iii) have never been subject to police action, such as arrests, ill treatment and isolation, or any other kind of action such as travel restrictions (Mr Felipe Carrera Hernndez, Mr Ral Domingo Zerguera Borren, Mr Reinaldo Cosano Aln, Mr Daniel Perea Garca, Mr Lisan Zamora Ricardo, Ms Aime de las Mercedes Cabrera lvarez, Ms Consuelo Rodriguez Hernndez, Ms Mailn Ricardo Gngora); (iv) reside overseas (Ms Hilda Aylin Lpez Salazar, Mr Pave Herrera Hernndez, Mr Lzaro Ricardo Prez, Mr Hiosvani Pupo, Mr Yuvisley Roque Rajadel, Mr Dannery Gmez Galeto, Ms Aime de las Mercedes Cabrera lvarez); (v) have died (Mr Pedro Scull); and/or (vi) have already been subject to comments by the Government (Mr Ivn Hernndez Carrillo, Mr Emilio Gottardi Gottardi, Mr Willian Cruz Delgado, Mr Ramn Zamora Rodrguez, Mr Yisan Zamora Ricardo, Mr Humberto Jos Bello Laffita).
.While taking due note of the Government s reply, the Committee cannot fail to observe the numerous additional allegations made by the complainant regarding the commission of new acts of anti-union discrimination, in particular arbitrary arrests, threats of deprivation of liberty and various acts of harassment against ASIC members and officials. The Committee notes that ASIC even reports intensified repression by state security agencies against its union officials and activists, with the declared objective of putting an end to ASIC.
.The Committee notes in this respect that, in the numerous communications received since its last examination of the present case, the complainant alleges that ASIC members and officials are constantly subjected to threats and to frequent brief but arbitrary and intimidating arrests by state security agencies, including: the trade union activist Mr Juan Alberto de la Nuez Ramrez; the activist Mr Leonardo Hernndez Camejo; ASIC general secretary in the province of Holgun and his family; ASIC provincial secretary, Mr Ibn Guerra Hernndez, and his wife Ms Kety Martnez; ASIC national executive member, Mr Carlos Roberto Reyes Consuegras; ASIC representative Ms Consuelo Rodrguez Hernndez and her husband Mr",-1,2016,Cuba
5,"Lzaro Roberto Aguiar Mendoza; ASIC provincial secretary, Mr Yorsi Kelin Snchez Perdign; members Mr Ismael Castro Valentn and Ms Dania Marit Noriega Castriz; trade union journalist Ms Yunia Figueredo Cruz; another ASIC member, Mr Yolsdan Armenteros Vzquez; activists Mr Luis Orlando Len Randich, Mr Ulises Gonzlez, Ms Yaquelin Dalis Caballero, Mr Felipe Carrera Hernndez, as well as provincial secretaries Mr Reinaldo Cosano Aln and Mr Emilio Gottardi Gottardi; and ASIC general secretary, Mr Ivn Hernndez Carrillo; the independent trade unionist Ms Maybell Padilla Prez; independent trade unionists Mr Leonardo Hernndez Camejo, Mr Charles Rodriguez; Ms Yaquelin Snchez Batista; Mr Alexis Gmez Rodrguez, Mr Carlos Javier Gmez Guevara, Mr Rodolfo Aparicio Alemn; and provincial secretary Mr Livn Monteagudo Rivero (see paragraph , subparagraphs (a) to (k) above).
.With regard to the persons referred to specifically in the new allegations, the Committee notes that the Government provides the following: (i) Mr Juan Alberto de la Nuez Ramrez: it is false to claim that he was arrested on  February . There is no evidence in any police record that this citizen was arrested, let alone detained in a Ministry of the Interior facility; (ii) Mr Ramn Zamora Rodrguez: neither he, nor his children or wife, have been victims of threats, persecution or harassment, but rather they committed acts designated as breaches of public order (communication dated  February ); (iii) Mr Emilio Gottardi Gottardi: on  February  he was fined an amount of  Cuban pesos, under paragraph (h) of Decree Law No. , for attempting to breach a security measure on the public highway. There is no evidence of any other action against this person; (iv) Mr Alejandro Snchez Zaldvar: he has not had an employment relationship since , he is neither a leader nor representative of any trade union organization and there is no evidence of police surveillance against him; (v) Mr Leonardo Hernndez Camejo: relevant investigations were carried out and no link to ASIC was established in respect of this citizen. According to the Government, it was known that this was a person with numerous previous convictions. There is no evidence in any police records that any action was taken to detain him on  March  or on  April , as indicated in the allegations; (vi) Mr Humberto Bello Laffita: following investigations, it has been established that this citizen has had no links to ASIC. This person was the subject of sanctions in November  for failing to comply with the measures ordered by the health authorities to curb the COVID- pandemic. He was the subject of a criminal prosecution in case No. /, acknowledging his responsibility for the acts for which he was charged. The trial was held with all the guarantees established by criminal law and, at the time of sentencing, the court took into account the previous conduct of the accused who had been prosecuted for the offences of illegal currency trafficking, theft, contempt and resistance. He was also officially warned about conduct likely to encourage prostitution. It is false to claim that he is in solitary confinement. Mr Humberto Bello Laffita enjoys the conditions required for Cuban prisons, including the ' ' facility where he is serving his sentence. He has electricity, water and the possibility of making telephone calls and receiving visits from family members; (vii) Mr Yunier Herrera Rodrguez: it is false to state that he was arrested for peacefully claiming trade union rights. He was arrested when found inebriated on the public highway shouting abusive phrases, totally unrelated to labour or trade union matters; lastly, (viii) the Government denies the allegations that seven ASIC activists and officials were arrested in early February  and rejects the allegations of interrogation or detention concerning Luis Orlando Len Randich and Yaqueln Snchez Batista.
.The Committee cannot fail to once again note the diverging versions of events of the Government and the complainant and the fact that the Government continues to deny the alleged acts.
.While the Government continues to list the offences or details of previous legal proceedings against various persons (including illicit economic activities, handling stolen goods, causing damage, public disorder, antisocial behaviour) mentioned both in recommendation (b) of the last report on the present case and in ASIC s new allegations, the Committee regrets to note that it has still not provided information on the commission of such offences, nor has it annexed documents on the relevant investigations or copies of rulings, as the Committee noted in previous conclusions concerning the present case. The Committee recalls in this regard that on numerous occasions where the complainants alleged that trade union officials or workers had been arrested for trade union activities, and the governments' replies amounted to general denials of the allegation or were simply to the effect that the arrests had been made for subversive activities, for reasons of internal security or for common law crimes, the Committee has always followed the rule that the governments concerned should be requested to submit further and as precise information as possible concerning the alleged arrests, particularly in connection with the judicial proceedings instituted as a result thereof, and the outcome of such proceedings, in order to be able to make a proper examination of the allegations. It also recalls that in many cases, it has asked the government concerned to communicate the texts of any judgments that have been delivered together with the grounds adduced therefor [see Compilation, paras  and ]. In these circumstances, in order to be able to examine the allegations in full knowledge of the facts, the Committee again requests the Government to provide the outcome of the investigations carried out and, if applicable, the court rulings concerning the union members or officials in respect of whom the Government states that they are engaged in inappropriate social behaviour and/or have committed offences, including public order offences, in particular: Mr Osvaldo Arcis Hernndez, Mr Brbaro Tejeda Snchez, Mr Felipe Carrera Hernndez, Mr Pavel Herrera Hernndez, Mr Daniel Perea Garca, Mr Yisan Zamora Ricardo, Mr Willian Cruz Delgado, Mr Roque Ivn Martnez Baldarran, Mr Jefferson Ismael Polo Mezerene, Ms Anairis Dania Mezerene, Mr Ulises Rafael Hernndez Lpez, and Mr Leonardo Hernndez Camejo.
.The Committee also deeply regrets that the Government once again refuses to send a copy of the court ruling handed down against Mr Humberto Bello Laffita sentencing him to a one-year prison term. The Committee requests the Government to do so without further delay. The Committee requests the Government to ensure that no workers are arrested for their trade union activities.
.Regarding recommendation (c) (conducting an investigation into the allegations of acts of aggression and restrictions on public freedoms) raised in the communication dated  December , referring to the situation of Mr Ivn Hernndez Carrillo, ASIC general secretary, threatened by the DSE that his parole would be revoked and that he would be charged with mercenary activity, the Committee notes that the Government refers to the information it provided on recommendation (b), in other words merely recalling that Mr Ivn Hernndez Carrillo is currently serving the remainder of his sentence in freedom, meaning that under existing criminal legislation he must fulfil certain obligations. Noting both this information and the complainant's repeated allegations about the many restrictions to which Mr Ivn Hernndez Carrillo is allegedly subject, the Committee requests the Government to ensure that Mr Hernndez Carrillo can freely carry out his legitimate trade union activities.
.Regarding recommendation (d) (alleged restrictions on travelling outside the country to participate in international activities in connection with their trade union work), the Committee observes that the Government once again denies the existence of restrictions, repeating what it had already indicated to the Committee. While noting the diverging versions of events of the Government and the complainant, the Committee observes that the complainant reports new restrictions on travelling (as in the case of ASIC deputy general secretary, Mr Alejandro Snchez Zaldvar, for denouncing the Government s anti-union practices at the th Session of the International Labour Conference (communication dated  March ). The Committee also notes that, in its most recent allegations, the complainant reports that the authorities continue to use the repressive weapon of cutting off communications to prevent ASIC trade unionists from participating in international online events with other trade union organizations (communications dated  and  September ). The Committee observes in this regard that the Government also stresses that these are false allegations and unfounded accusations, and that the restrictions on access to the internet and information technology are due to the blockade imposed on the country.
.In light of the foregoing and the complainant s new allegations in the case, the Committee recalls that it has highlighted that trade unionists, just like all persons, should enjoy freedom of movement and that, in particular, they should enjoy the right, subject to national legislation, which should not be such so as to violate freedom of association principles, to participate in trade union activities abroad [see Compilation, para. ]. The Committee strongly urges the Government to ensure",-1,2016,Cuba
6,"that the right of ASIC officials and members to organize and freely carry out their trade union activities are not restricted, including when these activities are conducted outside the country, or when they involve participation in international online forums.
.With reference to recommendation (e) (restrictions on the freedom of movement of ASIC officials in the national territory), the Committee notes that the Government reiterates that the alleged restrictions by the national authorities on the right to freedom of movement are false. While once again noting that the Government s and complainant s versions of events differ, the Committee observes that the complainant reports new restrictions on freedom of movement such as, for example, the ban on ASIC general secretary Mr Ivn Hernndez Carrillo from entering the capital (communication dated  February ) or the surveillance of the homes of trade unionists to pre empt potential peaceful protests during the commemoration of the second anniversary of the mass protests that shook the country on  July  (communication dated  July ). While recalling in this regard that the right to peaceful demonstration to defend the occupational interests of workers is a fundamental aspect of trade union rights, the Committee firmly urges the Government to fully ensure that ASIC officials have the freedom of movement in the national territory to carry out their trade union activities, including participation in demonstrations to defend the interests of their members, without Government interference.
.Regarding recommendation (f) (alleged anti-union dismissals), the Committee regrets that the Government simply provides information on the situation of Mr Ismael Valentn Castro and Ms Dania Marit Noriega Castriz, stating that these dismissals are related to violations of labour discipline and are not politically motivated in connection with their apparent  trade union activism'  without providing a copy of the outcome of the investigations carried out in this regard. It deeply regrets that the Government has not provided the outcome of the corresponding investigations into the dismissals of Mr Kelvin Vega Rizo and Mr Pavel Herrera Hernndez either. The Committee requests the Government to provide a copy of the outcome of the investigations into the dismissals of Mr Ismael Valentn Castro and Ms Dania Marit Noriega Castriz, as well as that of Mr Kelvin Vega Rizo and Mr Pavel Herrera.
.Lastly, seven years after receiving the first communication concerning the present case, the Committee regrets that the situation has reached such a point that the complainant continues to submit new allegations and that the Government continues to systematically reject them without providing the additional information necessary for an informed examination by the Committee. In these circumstances, given the lack of information in some instances and the lack of progress in others, the Committee once again invites the Government to accept a direct contacts mission to gather further information, facilitate dialogue between the parties and encourage the application of its recommendations.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee once again strongly urges the Government to ensure that the Independent Trade Union Association of Cuba (ASIC) is given recognition and that it can freely operate and carry out its trade union activities.(b) The Committee requests the Government to provide information on the outcome of the investigations carried out and, if applicable, the relevant court rulings in respect of the following union members or officials: Mr Osvaldo Arcis Hernndez, Mr Brbaro Tejeda Snchez, Mr Felipe Carrera Hernndez, Mr Pavel Herrera Hernndez, Mr Daniel Perea Garca, Mr Yisan Zamora Ricardo, Mr Willian Cruz Delgado, Mr Roque Ivn Martnez Baldarran, Mr Jefferson Ismael Polo Mezerene, Ms Anairis Dania Mezerene, Mr Ulises Rafael Hernndez Lpez and Mr Leonardo Hernndez Camejo.(c) The Committee requests the Government to send a copy of the court ruling handed down against Mr Humberto Bello Laffita without further delay. The Committee requests the Government to ensure that no workers are arrested for their trade union activities.(d) The Committee requests the Government to ensure that ASIC general secretary, Mr Ivn Hernndez Carrillo, is able to freely carry out his trade union activities without interference.(e) The Committee strongly urges the Government to ensure that the right of ASIC officials and members to organize and freely carry out their trade union activities are not restricted, including when these activities are conducted outside the country, or when they involve participation in international online forums.(f) The Committee firmly urges the Government to fully ensure that ASIC officials have the freedom of movement in the national territory to carry out their trade union activities, including participation in demonstrations to defend the interests of their members, without Government interference.(g) The Committee requests the Government to provide a copy of the outcome of investigations into the dismissals of Mr Ismael Valentn Castro and Ms Dania Marit Noriega Castriz, and of Mr Kelvin Vega Rizo and Pavel Herrera Hernndez.(h) Given the lack of information in some instances and the lack of progress in others, the Committee invites the Government to accept a direct contacts mission to gather further information, facilitate dialogue between the parties and encourage the implementation of its recommendations.
.The Committee last examined this case (presented in December ) at its March  meeting, when it presented an interim report to the Governing Body [see rd Report, approved by the Governing Body at its st Session (March ), paras ' ].
.The complainant organization submitted new allegations in its communications dated  April,  May, , ,  and  July,  September,  November and  and  December .
.The Government submitted its observations in communications dated  July,  and  September,  October,  December  and  February and  March .
.Cuba has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Workers' Representatives Convention,  (No. ).
.During its previous examination of the case in March , the Committee made the following recommendations [see rd Report, para. ]:(a)	The Committee once again strongly urges the Government to ensure that the Independent Trade Union Association of Cuba (ASIC) is given recognition and that it can freely operate and carry out its trade union activities.(b)	The Committee once again urges the Government to send a copy, without further delay, of the criminal convictions against Mr Ivn Hernndez Carrillo, Mr Carlos Reyes Consuegras, Mr Jorge Anglada Mayeta, Mr Vctor Manuel Domnguez Garca, Mr Alejandro Snchez Zaldvar, Mr Wilfredo lvarez Garca, Mr Brbaro de la Nuez Ramrez, Mr Alexis Gmez Rodrguez, Mr Roberto Arsenio Lpez Ramos, Mr Charles Enchris Rodrguez Ledezma, Mr Eduardo Enrique Hernndez Toledo, Mr Yoanny Limonta Garca, Mr William Esmrido Cruz Delgado and Ms Yorsi Kelin Snchez, and to keep the Committee informed of the outcome of the administrative and judicial proceedings awaiting decision.(c)	The Committee once again urges the Government to ensure that an investigation is made into all the allegations of acts of aggression and restrictions on public freedoms raised with respect to Mr Osvaldo Arcis Hernndez, Mr Brbaro Tejeda Snchez, Mr Pavel Herrera Hernndez, Mr Emilio Gottardi, Mr Ral Zerguera Borrell, Mr Reinaldo Cosano Aln, Mr Felipe Carrera Hernndez, Mr Pedro Scull, Mr Lzaro Ricardo Prez, Mr Hiosvani Pupo, Mr Daniel Perea Garca, Mr Dannery Gmez Galeto, Mr William Esmrido Cruz, Mr Roque Ivn Martnez Beldarrain, Mr Yuvisley Roque Rajadel, Mr Yakdislania Hurtado Bicet, Ms Aime de las Mercedes Cabrera lvarez, Ms Ariadna Mena Rubio and Ms Hilda Aylin Lpez Salazar, and to provide the Committee with detailed information with respect to each of them and on the outcome (with copies of decisions or rulings) of any administrative or judicial proceedings instituted in relation to the above-mentioned allegations.(d)	With regard to the alleged restrictions imposed on ASIC members on travelling outside the country to participate in international activities in connection with their trade union work, the Committee strongly urges the Government to refrain from unduly restricting the right of ASIC officials and members to organize and carry out their trade union activities freely, including when these activities are held outside the country.(e)	The Committee firmly expects the Government to fully ensure that ASIC officials have the freedom of movement in the national territory required to carry out their trade union activities without Government interference.(f)	With regard to the alleged anti-union dismissals, the Committee requests the Government to send a copy of the outcome of the corresponding investigations. The Committee also requests the complainant to confirm whether complaints against the dismissals have been lodged with the competent judicial authority.(g)	The Committee firmly expects the Government to fully ensure adequate protection for ASIC officials against any acts of interference in their trade union activities, including in the circumstances described by the Government.
.In its communications, the complainant organization alleges the proliferation of anti-union harassment with the aim, as reportedly stated by police officers, of supressing and eliminating ASIC. The complainant organization specifically alleges:The anti-union dismissal of two members of ASIC (trade union activist, Mr Ismael Valentn Castro, and the head of Mujeres Trabajadoras (Women Workers)",-1,2016,Cuba
7,"in the province of Villa Clara, Ms Dania Noriega), following inspections conducted at the end of March  by officials from the Department of State Security (DSE) at their workplace, the Brisas del Mar hotel complex, in the municipality of Caibarin, in the Villa Clara province. The complainant organization reports that: (i) three officials dressed as civilians approached Mr Valentn Castro and told him that they knew who he was and advised him to leave and to stop working in order to avoid any further issues; (ii) Ms Noriega received an audit which resulted in a fine of , Cuban pesos (equivalent to a monthly minimum wage) ' although they told her that they knew she was an opponent and that if she handed in her resignation, nothing would happen and that they would not apply the fine, which, in the end, was imposed and paid through the ASIC solidarity fund'  and (iii) subsequently, the DSE officials forced the administration to dismiss both trade unionists and to disguise the dismissals as the result of restructuring. The complainant organization notes that no explanation is provided as to the legal grounds on which the dismissal was based, other than a vague reference to legislation, applied by the employer in a discretionary manner. It also states that this is a common practice against ASIC activists and officials: when they are found to be participating in trade union activities, they are penalized or removed from their posts without justification (communication dated  April ).The increased harassment, surveillance and persecution of the ASIC general secretary, Mr Ivn Hernndez Carrillo, by the police, to the point where he feared for his physical safety and life. The complainant organization reports that: (i) Mr Hernndez s home is strictly monitored and every time that he leaves, he is overtly followed (with close physical contact) by State security agents; (ii) the situation has worsened, with the receipt of anonymous messages on social media making death threats against him, which, ASIC states, come from police intelligence agencies for the purpose of harassment and intimidation; and (iii) as has now become customary, these measures were accompanied by threats to send him back to prison (the general secretary served eight and a half of the  years to which he was sentenced as part of the spring repression of , and was granted parole (licencia extrapenal) (communication of  May ).The cyber lockout experienced by the ASIC general secretary on  June  when attempting to access the webinar organized by the International Group for Corporate Social Responsibility in Cuba (GIRSCC) and the French Democratic Confederation of Labour, on the subject of bilateral relations between the European Union and Cuba, the current status of labour relations in Cuba and fundamental labour rights. The complainant organization alleges that: (i) the ASIC general secretary attempted on several occasions to connect to Zoom to attend the aforementioned event but was prevented from accessing it by an error message; (ii) in anticipation of this situation, he had made a pre-recording of his statement, which was transmitted to the meeting, although this did not allow for any interaction with the meeting; (iii) this was not a technical error, as other less exposed activists were able to connect to the event, and Mr Hernndez was able to connect to a different event; and (iv) this appears to be a new method to limit the freedom of action of ASIC and its officials (the Government controls the activities in which the general secretary can participate and continues to prohibit him from leaving the country), and is additional evidence of cyber espionage carried out by the Cuban Government against ASIC activists (communication of  July ).The direct intimidation and exposure to public scorn faced by ASIC deputy general secretary, Mr Alejandro Snchez Zaldvar, during a press conference broadcast by the national television network on  July . During the press conference, the Chancellor presented a list of Twitter accounts, including the account of the deputy general secretary, and described them as instruments of the Government of the United States of America, used to destabilize the Cuban regime, an accusation which could result in serious charges against him, such as being in the service of a foreign power and treason, which carry heavy penalties including the death sentence. ASIC considers that, following the indiscriminate repression carried out by State security agencies, special forces and paramilitary gangs, during which they broke down doors and stormed houses, and beat, shot and arrested individuals involved in the protests, the accusations made by the Chancellor are clearly extremely dangerous for Mr Snchez and his family (communication of  July ).The violent repression against ASIC trade unionists in the context of the protests held on  July , as part of the widespread repression across the island, which was followed by persecution, harassment, illegal raids of homes and targeted arrests of the most prominent protesters and dissidents. The complainant organization specifically reports: (i) the brutal beatings by the police and paramilitary brigades, and, in some cases, arrests, of six ASIC members in the Holgun province. The complainant organization refers to a detailed report on the assault of and injuries sustained by Mr Ramn Zamora Rodrguez (ASIC secretary in the Holgun province) and Mr Yisan Zamora Ricardo (secretary of the Jvenes Trabajadores (Young Workers) of ASIC in Holgun), and by Ms Anairis Dania Mezerene Snchez, Mr Jefferson Ismael Polo Mezerene, Ms Mailn Ricardo Gngora, Mr Lisan Zamora Ricardo and Mr Ulises Rafael Hernndez Lpez (ASIC members in Holgun) (communication of  July), and (ii) the temporary detention and intimidation of, and threats against the ASIC provincial delegate in Cruces, Ms Consuelo Rodrguez Hernndez, and the summons of trade unionist, Ms Ketya Capote Gracias, to warn her that she was linked to a political prisoner on parole (communication of  July ).The arbitrary detention, beating, harassment of, and further threats against trade unionist, Mr Ramn Zamora Rodrguez and his son, Mr Yisan Zamora Ricardo. The complainant organization alleges that, on  July, Mr Zamora Ricardo was arrested and transferred to the DSE centre known as  Pedernales' (a centre denounced by opponents for the severe and brutal physical and psychological torture to which detainees are subjected). ASIC alleges that, at the DSE centre, Mr Zamora Ricardo was subjected to a variety of cruel, inhumane and degrading forms of treatment (he was punched, slapped, stripped naked and forced to squat, insulted and intimidated), and that, afterwards, both individuals were transferred to dark windowless cells, where there were known to be prisoners who had COVID , with the intention of them contracting the illness, which is what happened (communications of  September ).The sabotage of the participation of  ASIC trade unionists in an online training seminar hosted by the Colombian National Institute of Social Studies. It is alleged that the State entity providing the Internet service, which is controlled by the Ministry of Communications, cut off the communications and connections of all  registered trade unionists who were trying to participate from various locations on the island (communications of  September ).The repression of ASIC activists and officials the day before, during and after the demonstration organized by civil society groups on  November . ASIC provides detailed allegations of: (i) visits by DSE officials to the homes of seven ASIC members to warn them not to leave their homes on  November, with threats to arrest and detain them; (ii) the summons of an ASIC activist to report to the police unit in Cruces, where she was interrogated and warned about the demonstration; (iii) the arrest of trade unionist, Mr Humberto Bello Lafita, on  November , as he was leaving his home, and his transferral to the detention centre known as  El Vivac' in Havana, where he was given a one-year prison sentence following a rigged and unfair summary trial held in secret. He was then transferred to the Valle Grande prison in Havana; (iv) the arrest of ASIC provincial secretary in Santiago de Cuba, Mr Daniel Perera Garca, who was taken to the DSE s headquarters, Palma Soriano, in Santiago de Cuba, where he was beaten, insulted and offended. He was then handcuffed and transported to the municipal police station, where he was given a warning; (v) the detention, on  November  in Holgun, of ASIC provincial secretary, Mr Ramn Zamora Rodrguez, together with his wife and son, who were arrested and taken by two DSE officers to the El Anillo police station, where he received warnings and was subjected to intimidation. On the afternoon of  November, and the morning of  November, DSE officers had gone to Mr Zamora s home and told him that he and his son, in particular, could not leave their home or they would be confronted by rapid response groups. During these two days, members of the rapid response groups continued to besiege his home and family (these allegations are described in detail in the communication",-1,2016,Cuba
8,"dated  December ); and (vi) the harassment and victimization of  other trade unionists at their homes, including the ASIC general secretary, on  and  November, by police officers and paramilitary mobs (communication of  November ); andFurther assault of the ASIC general secretary, Mr Ivn Hernndez Carrillo, by DSE officials, and the receipt of serious threats following a police summons issued on  November  with only three hours' notice to comply. ASIC alleges that: (i) the authorities informed him that he had been summoned to discuss the offence of mercenarism, which he had allegedly committed by drafting a list of persons arrested on  July to be used to contact the families of those arrested; (ii) none of the activities covered by this offence correspond to the peaceful activities of trade union and civil activism carried out by the ASIC general secretary; in Cuba, where due process does not exist, mercenarism carries heavy penalties, including the death penalty, (Mr Hernndez Carrillo was already convicted once in a summary trial in ); (iii) he was threatened that if he reoffended, his parole (licencia extrapenal) would be revoked, he would be imprisoned and an additional case would be opened against him for mercenarism; and (iv) he was ordered not to leave the municipality of Coln without prior authorization by State security (communication of  December ).
.In its communications, the Government provides its observations on the allegations in the present case. The Government considers that the Committee has not taken due consideration of the extensive information provided by the Cuban authorities. It reiterates, in general, that the complainants seek to manipulate the ILO bodies to their advantage, by reporting false facts, and by presenting anti-social persons, who have been convicted of committing common offences, as defenders of human rights, when, in fact, these persons are acting as part of an agenda to bring about a regime change coordinated and funded from abroad. The Government also expresses its willingness to promote constructive tripartite dialogue as the only way to promote respect for the rights of workers' and employers' organizations in law and in practice.
.As regards recommendation (a) of the Committee s last report (recognition and free operation of ASIC), the Government reiterates that: (i) it considers that the request for recognition is contrary to Articles  and  of Convention No. ; (ii) the members of the organization that calls itself ASIC do not have employment relationships, are not employers or workers, have not been elected or appointed by the members as workers' representatives, and may not in practice establish and join organizations of their own choosing in full freedom; (iii) ASIC does not qualify a trade union organization and its purpose falls outside the scope of workers' rights; (iv) its  officials and members' display questionable social and criminal behaviour and serve illegitimate interests which are publicly financed and orchestrated from abroad, and which seek to subvert the legal order and violate Cuban law in terms of the promotion and protection of workers' rights; and (v) these persons present themselves as trade union activists and critics of the Government in exchange for money to denounce human rights violations of workers that do not exist.
.Regarding recommendation (b) (submission of copies of criminal convictions and the outcome of the administrative and judicial proceedings awaiting decision), the Government states that it once again regrets that the Committee has not taken note of the information provided in previous replies regarding the list of identified citizens, and that the Committee renews its request for the submission of the criminal convictions handed down. The Government reiterates in this regard that: (i) that the criminal proceedings brought against these individuals were in response to socially dangerous activities constituting offences provided for and sanctioned under the Cuban Criminal Code in force; (ii) in no case were they politically motivated or connected to trade union activities or the exercise of the right to organize; (iii) the Cuban legal system protects and respects the criminal procedural guarantees that inform due process; and (iv) it is not appropriate to send copies of the rulings, as they include personal information of interest which concerns not only the defendants, but also the victims and witnesses, and which the Government is obliged to protect under section  of the Cuban Civil Code in force (with regard to the violation of rights inherent to personality).
.Regarding recommendation (c) (investigations into the allegations of acts of aggression and restrictions on public freedoms), the Government generally reiterates that those who report acts of aggression and restrictions on public freedoms do not have employment relationships and are not trade unionists, and even less so trade union officials; and that the nature of the offences committed by those who have been prosecuted does not fall within the ambit of the ILO, and is not related to the defence of workers' interests or the exercise of trade union freedoms. Concerning the individual cases mentioned by the complainant organization, the Government repeats the same information previously provided, stating that:Mr Osvaldo Arcis Hernndez was arrested, prosecuted and tried for acts that disturbed the peace of foreign nationals between  and  and was declared  unfit for work' by the Expert Occupational Medical Examination Commission owing to his schizophrenia.Mr Pavel Herrera Hernndez was dismissed for a workplace disciplinary infraction and was the subject of criminal prosecution for the crime of theft. It is untrue that he was the subject of an anti-union dismissal.Mr Dannery Gmez Galeto, Mr William Esmrido Cruz Delgado, Mr Roque Ivn Martnez Beldarrain, Mr Yuvisley Roque Rajadel and Mr Yakdislania Hurtado Bicet were arrested and taken to the National Revolutionary Police station in the Coln municipality: (i) they were charged with subversive propaganda under current criminal legislation; (ii) the money confiscated was returned in full, and it is untrue that the individuals were threatened; (iii) Mr William Esmrido Cruz Delgado, Mr Roque Ivn Martnez Beldarrain and Mr Yuvisley Roque Rajadel received official warnings; (iv) Mr William Esmrido Cruz Delgado was fined for violating the provisions of Legislative Decree No. / and for failing to carry his personal identification, and (v) alleged trade unionists, Mr Yuvisley Roque Rajadel and Mr Dannery Gmez Galeto, currently live abroad, and were unemployed during their stay in Cuba.Mr Roque Ivn Martnez Beldarrain has been prosecuted for the crimes of theft (), causing injury (,  and ), speculation and hoarding (), making threats () and handling stolen goods ().With regard to Mr William Esmrido Cruz Delgado: (i) between  and , he was convicted of the crimes of causing injury, making threats, contempt and public disorder; (ii) between  and , he received official warnings on six occasions for his continued antisocial behaviour; (iii) between  and , he received eight sanctions for various criminal acts that posed a low risk to society; between  and , he received two fines for violations of Legislative Decree No.  of  on individual violations of the regulations governing self-employment; (iv) in October , he was sentenced to one year s imprisonment for two acts of contempt; and (v) between  and , he was reported on four occasions for less serious injury, contempt and public disorder, and was taken on nine occasions to the National Revolutionary Police station for engaging in the illicit sale of goods and currency.Mr Emilio Alberto Gottardi was not arrested, threatened or harassed; he was simply summoned to the Zanja police station in Havana with the aim of analysing the  false reports' of alleged trade union violations that he had made during the ILO Centenary celebrations.It is untrue that Mr Daniel Perea Garca was a victim of harassment, arbitrary arrest and threats: (i) in February , he received an official warning regarding his duty to refrain from destabilizing, dissident and disconcerting activity; and (ii) in August , he was charged with handling stolen goods (reports Nos / and /).It is untrue that the freedom of movement around the country of Mr Emilio Alberto Gottardi, Mr Ral Zerguera Borrell, Mr Lzaro Ricardo Prez and Ms Aime de las Mercedes Cabrera lvarez has been restricted; Mr Ral Zerguera Borrell works as a private carrier and makes unlimited journeys around the national territory. He has been convicted on several occasions of crimes including damage and disturbing public order; Mr Lzaro Ricardo Prez travelled to the United States of America on  January ; and Ms Aime de las Mercedes Cabrera lvarez does not have an employment relationship.Mr Brbaro Tejeda Snchez, Mr Felipe Carrera Hernndez, Mr Pedro Scull, Mr Reinaldo Cosano Aln, Ms Ariadna Mena Rubio and Ms Hilda Aylin Lpez Salazar do not have employment relationships; Mr Brbaro Tejeda Snchez has been prosecuted on  occasions for the crimes of theft, leaving the national territory illegally, public disorder, making threats, speculation, hoarding, and handling stolen goods; Mr Pedro Scull and Mr Felipe Carrera Hernndez were involved in subversive activities in the national territory for economic gain; Ms Ariadna Mena Rubio left the organization",-1,2016,Cuba
9,"that calls itself ASIC and no longer has any link to it; and Ms Hilda Aylin Lpez Salazar has lived outside the country since .
.With regard to recommendation (d) (alleged restrictions imposed on ASIC members on travelling outside the country to participate in international activities in connection with their trade union work), the Government reiterates that: (i) it defends and guarantees the right of all persons to leave the country and to return; (ii) the claims that the Cuban police authorities prohibit travel abroad for participation in international activities connected to trade union work are untrue; and (iii) the Migration Act (Act No.  of , amended by Legislative Decree No.  of ) clearly and concisely establishes the grounds on which the authorities may restrict the right to leave the country, and this power is exercised by the relevant authorities in a non-arbitrary manner and respecting the legal guarantees set out.
.With reference to recommendation (e) (alleged restrictions on the freedom of movement of ASIC officials to carry out their trade union activities without Government interference), the Government once again disagrees with the alleged restrictions on the freedom of movement of officials and members of the organization that calls itself ASIC in the national territory; and the alleged ban on travel through some parts of the country with the aim of carrying out  trade union activities'  In this regard, the Government reiterates that: (i) article  of the Constitution provides for the right to free movement and, therefore, the freedom of individuals to enter, remain in, travel through and leave the national territory without any restrictions beyond those set out in law is recognized; (ii) Cuban legislation fully guarantees, protects and recognizes the exercise and enjoyment of labour and trade union rights, and does not limit the exercise and enjoyment of these rights, unless the practise thereof violates legal provisions; and (iii) in accordance with national legislation, individuals who are defendants in criminal proceedings or respondents in civil proceedings, and those who are serving a criminal sentence or who have been granted licencia extrapenal, suspended sentences or parole, are restricted in their freedom of movement, including within the national territory.
.Concerning recommendation (f) (request for a copy of the outcome of the investigations carried out in relation to the alleged anti-union dismissals of Mr Kelvin Vega Rizo and Mr Pavel Herrera Hernndez), the Government reiterates that: (i) officials from the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, together with officials from the Municipal Directorates of Labour and Social Security, visited the respective entities, where they found that the disciplinary measures imposed were in response to labour discipline violations; (ii) for there to have been an anti-union dismissal, the individuals would have had to be exercising trade union activities, which was not the case, as they are not trade unionists; and (iii) it was found that Mr Kevin Vega and Mr Pavel Herrera Hernndez did not file any complaint with the Lower Labour Justice Body.
.Regarding recommendation (g) (full guarantee of adequate protection for ASIC officials against any acts of interference in their trade union activities), the Government states that it will continue to respect the free exercise of trade union rights and activities, and reaffirms its commitment to the effective promotion and protection of the labour rights and trade union freedoms of all its workers.
.With regard to the new allegations made by the complainant organization, the Government states the following:Concerning the allegation of police harassment and persecution against Mr Ivn Hernndez Carrillo on  May , the Government states that it is untrue that the life and freedom of Mr Hernndez Carrillo are under threat from law enforcement officials, or that Mr Hernndez Carrillo was subjected to: measures involving detention or restricted movement; police action at his home; harassment, surveillance or persecution by police, or administrative or criminal penalties during the pandemic. Contrary to what is alleged, the Government states that the citizen adopted self-protective behaviour to avoid contagion. The Government highlights that this individual, who is pretending to be a trade unionist, has no employment relationship and has an extensive criminal record, and that he was convicted in  for acts against the independence and territorial integrity of the State, following a fair trial, and was granted parole (licencia extrapenal) from March  (thereby serving the remainder of his sentence in freedom, although, since then, he has been prosecuted on several occasions and the corresponding contraventions provided for in the Criminal Code have been applied). The Government states that the allegations concerning an apparent increase in continued serious violations by the police forces against alleged activists from the organization that calls itself ASIC, are also untrue, and that it is unfounded and absurd to accuse the Government of sending anonymous messages by text and on social media, in which Mr Hernndez Carrillo was allegedly threatened.Concerning the allegations of violations of the public freedoms and trade union rights of Mr Ramn Zamora Rodrguez, the Government states that: (i) the allegation that he was kidnapped from his home on  July  is false; (ii) there is no official record of any action having been taken by police authorities against this citizen on the above-mentioned date; (iii) it is also false that he was subjected to manipulation, death threats and psychological pressure for having exercised his freedom of expression on social media; (iv) Mr Zamora Rodrguez was arrested on  July for the offence of public disorder provided for by and punished under section  of the Criminal Code, and was then transferred to the police unit where he was detained for  hours; and (v) on  July, he received an official warning from the competent police authority and was later released.The Government states that it is also untrue that Ms Consuelo Rodrguez Hernndez was a victim of harassment, intimidation, threats, persecution and repression by police authorities. Citizens Ms Consuelo Rodrguez and Ms Ketya Capote Gracias participated in meetings that violated the sanitary and epidemiological measures currently in force to address and control the COVID- pandemic. As a result, they were summoned by the head of sector of the National Revolutionary Police and were given an official warning by the criminal investigator, with no other charges brought against them. During the proceedings, Ms Rodrguez Hernndez refused to sign the record and Ms Capote Gracias recognized the measure applied and expressed regret. It is also false that these individuals were the subject of any police action. There is no indication in the files and records of our authorities that any such measures were applied to them.As regards the allegation that the authorities are blocking the access to virtual platforms of individuals who claim to be  trade union leaders' to prevent them from participating in international trade union training meetings and events, the Government states that: (i) this allegation is false and that making unfounded accusations against the Government of cyber espionage directed at alleged trade unionists is, to say the least, inconsistent and absurd; and (ii) restrictions on access to the Internet and information technology are due to the economic, trade and financial blockade imposed on the country, as a result of which a large number of free websites and services, including Zoom, are totally or partially blocked for Cuba, which makes it difficult for the country to participate in events online. It states that cyberspace is utilized to attempt to subvert the political system of the country, as has been recognized by Special Rapporteurs of the Human Rights Council (the Government sends examples of technological services referred to above, which include Cuba on the list of restricted countries).Regarding the alleged harassment of Mr Alejandro Snchez Zaldvar, the Government states that: (i) it is untrue that he was the subject of intimidations during the press conference of  July , in which the destabilization campaign waged against Cuba through the use of lies and data manipulation was denounced in front of the national and international press; (ii) the Twitter account of the citizen concerned (Mr Alejandro Snchez Zaldvar) is active and it is possible to see the degrading and hateful messages that he shares, and the fake news that he spreads, which demonstrates that there are no limitations of resources for the use of his account; and (iii) it rejects the accusations of repression in Cuba that allegedly create an insecure and dangerous situation for Mr Snchez Zaldvar and his relatives.The Government also rejects the allegations made by the complainants, in which they report acts of repression, persecution, harassment, victimization, illegal raids on homes, excessive use of force against protesters by police and military officers, and targeted arrests of the indicated persons for their participation in the unrest of July . The Government reiterates that these individuals are not trade union leaders, do not have recognized employment relationships and display reprehensible social behaviour, and that some of these individuals have received criminal convictions for common offences. The Government indicates in particular that: (i) Ms Anairis Dania Mezerene Snchez and Mr Jefferson",-1,2016,Cuba
10,"Ismael Polo Mezerene were arrested and transferred to the Criminal Investigation Body in Holgun on  July  and received a charge of public disorder, on the grounds of which they were issued a fine of , Cuban pesos (approximately US$); (ii) Mr Ramn Zamora Rodrguez was arrested and transferred to the Criminal Investigation Body in Holgun on  July  and was charged with the offence of public disorder; it is false that he was arrested and threatened by law enforcement officers; and there is no record that he was subject to any measures by police authorities; (iii) Mr Yisan Zamora Ricardo is not connected to the work of ASIC; he was arrested and transferred to the Criminal Investigation Body in Holgun on  July, with a charge of public disorder; it is untrue that he was dismissed from his workplace for being associated with political motivations, and that he did not have access to recruitment forums due to the activities of security bodies; and (iv) all the allegations relating to the humiliating treatment of Ms Mailn Ricardo Gngora, Mr Lisn Zamora Ricardo and Mr Ulises Rafael Hernndez Lpez are false; they were not linked to ASIC, were not detained, and no measures were applied to them, despite their involvement in the events of  July.Regarding the allegations of repression of ASIC activists the day before, during and after the demonstration organized by civil society groups on  November  (contained in the communication from ASIC on  November ), the Government: (i) states that these are crude fabrications that seek to discredit the actual situation in Cuba in terms of the promotion and protection of human rights, and to manipulate the ILO supervisory bodies for political purposes, and underscores that it is becoming increasingly difficult to reply to the Committee regarding events that have not even taken place, and states that the Committee should request the complainants to demonstrate the veracity of the information that they provide; (ii) reiterates that these individuals are not trade union leaders, do not have employment relationships and display reproachable social behaviour, and that some have received criminal convictions for committing common offences; (iii) indicates that, of the above-mentioned persons, police and court records show only that Mr Humberto Jos Bello Lafita was arrested on  November , with the charge of spreading an epidemic and failing to comply with penalties, and received a one-year prison sentence, which is to be served at the correctional facility No. ; and (iv) states that there is no evidence that the other individuals referred to above were the subject of any police action on the days prior to  November , that it is untrue that police authorities visited the homes of the individuals on the indicated dates and that arbitrary detentions or arrests were carried out against these persons.Regarding the additional allegations of harassment to Mr Zamora, his home and family in November  (contained in the complainant's communication of  December ), the Government asserts that these are false and indicates: (i) that Mr Zamora is not a union leader nor is he known to have any labour ties; (ii) that neither he, nor his son, nor his wife have been victims of threats, detentions, harassment, persecution or harassment; (iii) that this citizen is a repeat offender of false accusations against the Cuban authorities; and (iv) that it is increasingly difficult for the Government to be able to respond to the Committee on facts that have not even occurred, and the complainants should be asked to demonstrate the veracity of the information they transmit to the Committee.
.The Committee recalls that this complaint concerns several allegations of acts of aggression, harassment, persecution, arrests, assault, and restrictions on the free movement of trade union officials and members while carrying out their functions by State security forces. The complainant organization also denounces its non-recognition by the Government.
.The Committee notes that, once again, the Government objects to the Committee s examination of the present case. In this regard, the Committee once again recalls that, within the terms of its mandate, it is empowered to examine the extent to which the exercise of trade union rights may be affected in cases of allegations of the infringement of public freedoms. The Committee also recalls that it is not competent to consider purely political allegations; it can, however, consider measures of a political character taken by governments in so far as these may affect the exercise of trade union rights. Furthermore, the Committee considers that Organizations responsible for defending workers socio-economic and occupational interests should be able to use strike action to support their position in the search for solutions to problems posed by major social and economic policy trends which have a direct impact on their members and on workers in general, in particular as regards employment, social protection and standards of living. While purely political strikes do not fall within the scope of the principles of freedom of association, trade unions should be able to have recourse to protest strikes, in particular where aimed at criticizing a government s economic and social policies [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, paras , ,  and ].
.Regarding the recognition of ASIC, and its free operation and exercise of trade union activities (recommendation (a)), the Committee notes that the Government reiterates that: (i) ASIC cannot be considered as a trade union organization and that its purpose falls outside the scope of workers' rights; (ii) that its  officials and members' display questionable social and criminal behaviour, and serve illegitimate interests which are publicly financed and orchestrated from abroad, and which seek to subvert the legal order; and (iii) these individuals present themselves as trade union activists and critics of the Government in exchange for money to denounce human rights violations of workers that do not exist.
.In this regard, the Committee firstly recalls that, for several decades, it has been examining allegations of non-recognition and interference by the Government in the free operation of trade union organizations not affiliated to the Confederation of Workers of Cuba [see Cases Nos , , ,  and  of the Committee on Freedom of Association]. The Committee also recalls that the right to official recognition through legal registration is an essential facet of the right to organize since this is the first step that workers' or employers' organizations must take in order to be able to function efficiently, and represent their members adequately; and a long registration procedure constitutes a serious obstacle to the establishment of organizations and amounts to a denial of the right of workers to establish organizations without previous authorization. It further recalls that freedom of association implies the right of workers and employers to elect their representatives in full freedom and to organize their administration and activities without any interference by the public authorities [see Compilation, paras ,  and ]. Considering that, according to the information provided by the complainant organization, some trade union members and officials mentioned in the complaint were self-employed workers, and that others had been dismissed for anti-union reasons, the Committee secondly recalls that that the criterion for determining the persons covered by the right to organize is not based on the existence of an employment relationship. Workers who do not have employment contracts should have the right to form the organizations of their choosing if they so wish [see Compilation, para. ]. The Committee reiterates that in its initial examination of this case, it noted that ASIC, in its founding declaration of principles, advocates trade union autonomy in the framework of the rule of law, aims to promote full compliance with ILO international labour standards and proclaims that it will not compromise or associate itself with party-political activities. In its union constitution, ASIC states that its central objectives include grouping together independent trade unions and reporting violations of international labour standards. Moreover, ASIC members' duties as set out in the union constitution include defending workers' claims and benefits. It is in this context that the Committee observes that the elements of ASIC s declaration of principles and union constitution fall within the scope of action and definition of a workers' organization. The Committee can only regret that there has been no progress since its last examination of this case and therefore once again refers to its previous conclusions and, once again, strongly urges the Government to ensure that ASIC is given recognition, and that it can freely operate and carry out its trade union activities.
.Regarding the alleged violations and restrictions of civil liberties, the Committee recalls that, in its previous examinations of the case, the complainant organization had reported, inter alia, arbitrary arrests, harassment and acts of aggression, raids and prosecutions [see st Report of the Committee, paras -; and rd Report, paras ' ]. In this regard, the Committee has been requesting the Government to investigate these allegations. The Committee observes with concern that, in its further allegations,",-1,2016,Cuba
11,"the complainants report new violations of civil liberties, including arbitrary arrests, assault, threats and harassment, as well as persecution and, in one case, a criminal conviction, by the public authorities, against the following trade union officials and members: Ms Anairis Dania Mezerene Snchez, Ms Consuelo Rodrguez Hernndez and Ms Mailn Ricardo Gngora; and Mr Ivn Hernndez Carrillo, Mr Alejandro Snchez Zaldvar, Mr Jefferson Ismael Polo Mezerene, Mr Ramn Zamora Rodrguez, Mr Yisan Zamora Ricardo, Mr Lisan Zamora Ricardo, Mr Humberto Bello Lafita and Mr Ulises Rafael Hernndez Lpez. The Committee recalls that the rights of workers' and employers' organizations can only be exercised in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind against the leaders and members of these organizations, and it is for governments to ensure that this principle is respected. The Committee further recalls that the detention of trade unionists for reasons connected with their activities in defence of the interests of workers constitutes a serious interference with civil liberties in general and with trade union rights in particular [see Compilation, paras  and ].
.As regards its recommendation (b), the Committee deeply regrets that the Government once again refuses to send copies of the court rulings requested. In this regard, the Committee must emphasize that the right to a fair and public hearing implies the right for the ruling or decision to be made public and that the publicizing of decisions is an important safeguard in the interest of the individual and of society at large. The Committee also hopes that the Government will understand that, given the contradictory information received from the parties, and the fact that it has been denied access to the relevant court rulings, it cannot abandon its examination of the allegations concerned. The Committee recalls in this regard, that, on numerous occasions where the complainants alleged that trade union officials or workers had been arrested for trade union activities, and the governments' replies amounted to general denials of the allegation or were simply to the effect that the arrests were made for subversive activities, for reasons of internal security or for common law crimes, the Committee has always followed the rule that the governments concerned should be requested to submit further and as precise information as possible concerning the arrests, particularly in connection with the legal or judicial proceedings instituted as a result thereof, and the outcome of such proceedings, in order to be able to make a proper examination of the allegations [see Compilation, paras  and ].
.Furthermore, the Committee expresses its deep concern about the serious allegations of the arrest and one-year prison sentence following a summary trial, of trade unionist, Mr Humberto Bello Lafita, at the end of . The Committee notes the Government s indication that Mr Bello Lafita was charged with spreading an epidemic and failing to comply with penalties, and received a one-year prison service, which he is serving at a correctional facility. It requests the Government to provide it with a copy of the conviction and to ensure that no workers are arrested for their trade union activity.
.Regarding recommendation (c) (request for an investigation into all allegations of acts of aggression and restrictions on public freedoms reported by the complainant organization), the Committee notes that the Government reiterates previously submitted statements, according to which Mr Osvaldo Arcis Hernndez, Mr Brbaro Tejeda Snchez, Mr Pavel Herrera Hernndez, Mr Emilio Gottardi, Mr Ral Zerguera Borrell, Mr Reinaldo Cosano Aln, Mr Felipe Carrera Hernndez, Mr Pedro Scull, Mr Lzaro Ricardo Prez, Mr Hiosvani Pupo, Mr Daniel Perea Garca, Mr Dannery Gmez Galeto, Mr William Esmrido Cruz, Mr Roque Ivn Martnez Beldarrain, Mr Yuvisley Roque Rajadel, Mr Yakdislania Hurtado Bicet, Ms Aime de las Mercedes Cabrera lvarez, Ms Ariadna Mena Rubio and Ms Hilda Aylin Lpez Salazar are not truly trade unionists and were not tried or convicted for activities relating to the exercise of trade union freedoms.
.The Committee also observes that the above-mentioned further allegations made by the complainant organization warn of continuing violations of the public freedoms of trade unionists, and that, in this regard, the Government once again rejects the allegations of repression, persecution, harassment, victimization, illegal raids on homes and targeted arrests, indicating that these individuals are not trade union leaders and that, in some cases, these citizens were arrested for common offences, and accusing ASIC and its officials of serving foreign interests to bring about a regime change. The Committee also observes that it has yet to receive information on ASIC s allegations contained in its communication dated  December . The Committee requests the Government to provide its observations in this regard.
.While it notes the continuing discrepancies between the allegations made and the complete denial of these allegations by the Government, the Committee once again recalls that, while persons engaged in trade union activities or holding trade union office cannot claim immunity in respect of the ordinary criminal law, trade union activities should not in themselves be used by the public authorities as a pretext for the arbitrary arrest or detention of trade unionists. The apprehension and systematic or arbitrary interrogation by the police of trade union leaders and unionists involves a danger of abuse and could constitute a serious attack on trade union rights [see Compilation, paras  and ]. The Committee also recalls that all appropriate measures should be taken to guarantee that, irrespective of trade union affiliation, trade union rights can be exercised in normal conditions with respect for basic human rights and in a climate free of violence, pressure, fear and threats of any kind [see Compilation, para. ].
.In light of the above, the Committee deplores that the Government has not taken the necessary measures, beyond the information that it provides, for the investigation of all the allegations of acts of aggression and restrictions on public freedoms regarding the aforementioned individuals, including the new allegations made by the complainant organization since the last examination of the case. The Committee once again strongly urges the Government to carry out the investigation in question, and requests it to provide further detailed information regarding each of the above-mentioned individuals and on the outcome (with copies of decisions or rulings) of any administrative or judicial proceedings instituted in relation to the above-mentioned allegations.
.Regarding recommendation (d) (alleged restrictions imposed on ASIC members on travelling outside the country to participate in international activities in connection with their trade union work), the Committee observes that the Government once again denies the existence of restrictions and repeats what it had already indicated to the Committee. The Committee also notes that, in its most recent allegations, the complainant organization reports cyber sabotage carried out by the public authorities to prevent ASIC trade unionists from participating in international online events with other trade union organizations. The Committee observes in this regard that the Government also considers that these are false allegations and unfounded accusations, and that the restrictions on access to the Internet and information technology are due to the blockade imposed on the country. The Committee also notes that the complainant organization alleges that the reported restrictions cannot be considered as limitations on access that apply to all persons in the country, and emphasizes that such limitations were targeted at specific events and individuals, and that in other cases, there were no problems in accessing these Internet communication services.
.While the Committee reiterates that trade unionists, just like all persons, should enjoy freedom of movement and that, in particular, they should enjoy the right, subject to national legislation, which should not be such so as to violate freedom of association principles, to participate in trade union activities abroad [see Compilation, para. ], it reminds the Government that the right of ASIC officials and members to organize and freely exercise their trade union activities, including when these activities are conducted outside the country or when they involve participation in international online forums.
.Concerning recommendation (e) (alleged restrictions on the right to the freedom of movement of ASIC officials and members in Cuban territory), the Committee notes that the Government once again disagrees with the allegations of restrictions on the right to free movement. While noting the diverging versions of events of the Government and the complainant organization, the Committee observes that the complainant organization reports new restrictions on the exercise of freedom of association in this regard (for example, allegations of threats and orders for some trade unionists not to leave their homes in the context of a demonstration organized by civil society groups on  November ). In this regard, the Committee must recall that the right to demonstrate peacefully in order to defend the occupational interests of workers is a fundamental aspect of trade union rights. The Committee therefore firmly urges the Government to fully ensure that ASIC officials have the freedom of movement in the national territory to carry out their trade union activities, including participation in demonstrations to defend the interests of their members, without Government interference.
.As regards the anti-union dismissals of Mr",-1,2016,Cuba
12,"Kelvin Vega Rizo and Mr Pavel Herrera Hernndez, the Committee notes that the Government reiterates the information previously provided, stating that the competent authorities found that the disciplinary measures imposed were in response to serious labour discipline violations; and that the persons concerned did not file any complaint with the Lower Labour Justice Body. The Committee deeply regrets that the Government did not comply with its request to send a copy of the outcome of the investigations carried out by the authorities. The Committee reiterates its request in this respect.
.The Committee further notes that the Government s observations do not respond to the allegations of the anti-union dismissals of two ASIC members, contained in the communication of  April  from the complainant organization. The Committee urges the Government to investigate these allegations and to provide its observations in this respect.
.In light of the above, the Committee notes that, despite the conclusions and recommendations adopted after having examined the complaint on multiple occasions, the Government, while reiterating its willingness to cooperate with the ILO supervisory bodies, continues to consider that this case is completely outside of the Committee s mandate, and once again focuses on stating that the allegations are false and purely politically motivated, and do not concern the exercise of freedom of association. The Committee notes with deep regret the consequent lack of progress. Given the lack of information in some instances and the lack of progress in others, the Committee invites the Government to accept a direct contacts mission to gather further information, facilitate dialogue between the parties and encourage the application of its recommendations, which are reproduced below.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee once again firmly urges the Government to ensure that the Independent Trade Union Association of Cuba (ASIC) is given recognition and that it can freely operate and carry out its trade union activities.(b)	The Committee once again strongly urges the Government to ensure that an investigation is made into all the allegations of acts of aggression and restrictions on public freedoms raised with respect to Mr Ivn Hernndez Carrillo, Mr Osvaldo Arcis Hernndez, Mr Brbaro Tejeda Snchez, Mr Pavel Herrera Hernndez, Mr Emilio Gottardi Gottardi, Mr Ral Zerguera Borrell, Mr Reinaldo Cosano Aln, Mr Felipe Carrera Hernndez, Mr Pedro Scull, Mr Lzaro Ricardo Prez, Mr Hiosvani Pupo, Mr Daniel Perea Garca, Mr Dannery Gmez Galeto, Mr William Esmrido Cruz, Mr Roque Mr Ivn Martnez Beldarrain, Mr Yuvisley Roque Rajadel, Mr Yakdislania Hurtado Bicet, Mr Alejandro Snchez Zaldvar, Mr Jefferson Ismael Polo Mezerene, Mr Ramn Zamora Rodrguez, Mr Yisan Zamora Ricardo, Mr Lisan Zamora Ricardo, Mr Ulises Rafael Hernndez Lpez, Mr Daniel Perea Garca, Mr Humberto Bello Lafita, Ms Aime de las Mercedes Cabrera lvarez, Ms Ariadna Mena Rubio, Ms Hilda Aylin Lpez Salazar, Ms Anairis Dania Mezerene Snchez, Ms Consuelo Rodrguez Hernndez and Ms Mailn Ricardo Gngora; and to provide the Committee with further detailed information on the outcome (copies of decisions or rulings) of any administrative or judicial proceedings instituted in relation to the above-mentioned allegations, and to include a copy of the conviction against Mr Humberto Bello Lafita. The Committee requests the Government to ensure that no workers are arrested for their trade union activities.(c)	The Committee also requests the Government to send its observations on the allegations by ASIC, contained in its communication dated  December , and ensure that an investigation is conducted into the allegations of acts of aggression and restrictions on public freedoms made in the above-mentioned communications.(d)	Regarding the alleged restrictions on the capacity of ASIC members to participate in international activities related to their trade union work, the Committee reminds the Government that it must not restrict the right of ASIC officials and members to organize and freely exercise their trade union activities, including when these activities are conducted outside the country, or when they involve participation in international online forums.(e)	The Committee firmly urges the Government to fully ensure that ASIC officials have the freedom of movement in the national territory to carry out their trade union activities without Government interference.(f)	With regard to the alleged anti-union dismissals, the Committee requests the Government to send a copy of the outcome of the investigations into the dismissals of Mr Kelvin Vega Rizo and Mr Pavel Herrera. The Committee also urges the Government to investigate and send its observations on the new allegations of the anti-union dismissals of Mr Ismael Valentn Castro and Ms Dania Noriega, contained in the communication from ASIC dated  April .(g)	Given the lack of information in some instances and the lack of progress in others, the Committee invites the Government to accept a direct contacts mission to gather further information, facilitate dialogue between the parties and encourage the application of its recommendations.
.The Committee last examined this case (submitted in December ) at its October  meeting, when it presented an interim report to the Governing Body [see st Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (October ), paras ' ].
.The complainant sent further allegations on  October and  November , and  January,  July and  December .

.Cuba has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Workers' Representatives Convention,  (No. ).
.During its previous examination of the case in October , the Committee made the following recommendations [see st Report, para. ]:(a)	Referring to its previous conclusions, the Committee urges the Government to ensure that the Independent Trade Union Association of Cuba (ASIC) is given recognition and that it can freely operate and carry out its trade union activities.(b)	The Committee urges the Government to send a copy, without further delay, of the criminal convictions against Mr Ivn Hernndez Carrillo, Mr Carlos Reyes Consuegras, Mr Jorge Anglada Mayeta, Mr Vctor Manuel Domnguez Garca, Mr Alejandro Snchez Zaldvar, Mr Wilfredo lvarez Garca, Mr Brbaro de la Nuez Ramrez, Mr Alexis Gmez Rodrguez, Mr Roberto Arsenio Lpez Ramos, Mr Charles Enchris Rodrguez Ledezma, Mr Eduardo Enrique Hernndez Toledo and Mr Yoanny Limonta Garca, and to keep the Committee informed of the outcome of the administrative and judicial proceedings awaiting decision.(c)	The Committee urges the Government to ensure, in light of the decisions mentioned in its conclusions, that an investigation is made into all the allegations of acts of aggression and restrictions on public freedoms with respect to Mr Osvaldo Arcis Hernndez, Mr Brbaro Tejeda Snchez, Mr Pavel Herrera Hernndez, Mr Emilio Gottardi, Mr Ral Zerguera Borrell, Mr Aime de las Mercedes Cabrera lvarez, Mr Reinaldo Cosano Aln, Mr Felipe Carrera Hernndez, Mr Pedro Scull, Mr Lzaro Ricardo Prez, Mr Hiosvani Pupo, Mr Daniel Perea Garca, Mr Dannery Gmez Galeto, Mr Willian Esmrido Cruz, Mr Roque Ivn Martnez Beldarrain, Mr Yuvisley Roque Rajadel, Mr Yakdislania Hurtado Bicet, Ms Ariadna Mena Rubio and Ms Hilda Aylin Lpez Salazar, and to provide the Committee with detailed information with respect to each of the persons mentioned above and on the outcome (with copies of decisions or rulings) of any administrative or judicial proceedings instituted in relation to the above-mentioned allegations.(d)	With regard to the alleged restrictions imposed on ASIC members on travelling outside the country to participate in international activities in connection with their trade union work, including ILO meetings and invitations, the Committee expects the Government to refrain from unduly restricting the right of ASIC officials and members to organize and carry out their union activities freely, including when these are held outside the country.(e)	With regard to the alleged restrictions on the right to free movement of ASIC officials and members in Cuban territory, the Committee firmly expects that the Government will fully ensure that ASIC officials have the freedom of movement in the national territory required to carry out their trade union activities.(f)	Concerning the alleged anti-union dismissals of Mr Kelvin Vega Rizo and Mr Pavel Herrera Hernndez, the Committee once again requests the Government to send its observations in this respect as soon as possible.(g)	With regard to the dismissal of Ms Omara Ruz Urquiola, the Committee requests the complainant to provide further information about its alleged anti-union nature.(h)	With respect to the alleged infiltration by the Government into the trade union movement and acts of interference, the Committee urges the Government to provide its observations in that regard without further delay.(i)	Regarding the exercise of the right to strike, the Committee trusts that the Government will guarantee the exercise of this right in practice.
.In its communications, the complainant reports new violations of the public freedoms of ASIC officials and members. The complainant alleges that harassment, repression, arbitrary arrests and threats against ASIC officials and members by the state police forces are still ongoing, in addition to restrictions on their right travel to participate in international activities in connection",-1,2016,Cuba
13,"with their trade union work, without explanation or just cause.With regard to Mr Ivn Hernndez Carrillo, ASIC general secretary, the complainant alleges specifically that: (i) on  January  he was arrested by state security agents in Havana, taken arbitrarily and without charge to a police station in the capital, subjected to physical aggression and threats and then taken to the Coln municipality, in the Matanzas province, where he lives. His belongings and documents, including his mobile telephone and the Committee s latest interim report, were confiscated, and he was confined to his house under penalty of detention. The confiscation of his mobile telephone effectively blocked all forms of communication, both within the country and internationally, and his access to the internet. Upon leaving his home, he was arrested three times and taken back to his house under threat. During these brief periods of detention, the authorities withheld his whereabouts from his family and colleagues; (ii) on  June  the police surrounded his home, and on  June , while attempting to leave his home to participate in ASIC meetings, he was arrested and taken to the police station in Coln, where he was detained for three hours. Before being released, he was charged with the offence of incitement to commit crime and warned that he would not be permitted to engage in any public activity; (iii) on  November , together with Mr Carlos Orlando Olivera Martnez and Mr Lzaro Daz Snchez, he was subjected to a violent arrest by police officers patrolling the area around his house. After being transferred to the police station in Coln, he was interrogated and threatened for almost five hours. Before being released, he was issued with a warning for alleged public disorder; (iv) on  November , he was arrested and transferred to the police station in Coln, where he was interrogated and threatened for two and a half hours. Before being released, he was issued with a warning for allegedly disturbing public order and fined  pesos for breaching the security cordon; (v) the political police maintained a police cordon in the area around his house, intimidating him and warning him not to leave; and (vi) he received death threats and threats to return him to prison. The official in question is serving a -year prison sentence under a legal concept known as licencia extrapenal [parole completed at home] and may be returned to prison to serve the rest of his sentence.With regard to Mr Willian Esmrido Cruz Delgado, secretary of labour and trade union affairs at the ASIC Municipal Secretariat, the complainant alleges specifically that: (i) he was subjected to a violent arbitrary arrest on  October ; (ii) he was deemed a risk to society and placed in pretrial detention; (iii) on  October  he was sentenced to one year s imprisonment at a summary trial for alleged contempt; and (iv) he was refused a self-employment licence for political reasons.With regard to Ms Yorsi Kelin Snchez, ASIC secretary in the Sancti Spritus province, the complainant alleges specifically that: (i) on  October , she was arrested violently and in degrading conditions at a police station, without being formally charged; (ii) she was transferred to the pretrial detention facility in Sancti Spritus where she was subjected to psychological abuse and deprived of sleep and of visits from her family; and (iii) she received threats relating to her family, including a threat to remove her daughter from her custody. She was asked to work for state security.With regard to Mr Alejandro Snchez, Mr Emilio Gottardi, Mr Charles Rodrguez and Mr Felipe Carreras, ASIC officials, the complainant reports that they were prohibited from travelling to Panama City to attend a trade union training course at the University of Latin American Workers (UTAL) and that, specifically: (i) on  September , Mr Alejandro Snchez and Mr Emilio Gottardi were prevented from boarding their flight at Jos Mart International Airport; and (ii) on  November , Mr Felipe Carreras was arrested and transferred to a police station, then released without charge after having missed his flight to Panama.
.Furthermore, the complainant expresses its concern at the dissemination of false reports, defamation and rumours targeting ASIC officials and members through a blog entitled Top de la Disidencia Cubana (Top Dissidents in Cuba) run by the state security bodies. The complainant also states that the health crisis brought about by COVID- has served as an excuse to maintain pressure on ASIC officials and members, who have been threatened pre-emptively with being accused of spreading an epidemic, a crime set out in article  of the Criminal Code (Act No.  of ), if they leave their homes to meet, particularly in Havana. That crime carries a sentence of  to  years' imprisonment. Lastly, the complainant expresses its general concern at the redoubled efforts to repress ASIC officials and members identified in the Committee s reports.
.In its communications, the Government provides its observations on the allegations in the present case. In general, the Government states that: (i) as with the allegations considered previously in relation to this case, these new allegations are false, baseless and lack legitimacy; (ii) the allegations form part of externally organized and financed campaigns of political manipulation to discredit Cuba under the agenda to bring about a regime change, in contravention of the principles of sovereignty, self-determination and non-interference in domestic affairs; (iii) the complainant does not aim to promote and protect workers' rights and trade union freedoms; (iv) the exercise of the right to freedom of association is not limited; rather, under article  of the Constitution, such exercise must respect public order and comply with the requirements set out in national legislation; (v) the accusation that degrading practices intensify on dates surrounding the approval of the Committee s reports is false; and (vi) the recommendations made by the Committee in its previous examination of the case are a reflection of the persistence of selective practices and political manipulation in the ILO s working methods and supervisory bodies against developing countries. The Government considers that these practices go against the spirit of dialogue and cooperation for the effective promotion of workers' rights, undermine tripartism and do not help improve the situation of workers in the world. Furthermore, it considers that these negative practices are inconsistent with the principles of objectivity, impartiality and non-selectiveness that should prevail in the handling of trade union freedoms. The Government therefore anticipates that it will be possible, on the basis of the elements submitted in its observations, to dismiss all of the allegations relating to the present case as baseless.
.With regard to the allegations that the COVID- pandemic is serving as a pretext for maintaining the restrictions supposedly imposed on ASIC officials and members, the Government states that: (i) the measures implemented by the competent authorities to control and reduce the spread of COVID- and safeguard the lives of all persons in the country, in accordance with the country s legal system, were not adopted with the purpose of maintaining pressure on the supposed trade union leaders and trade unionists; (ii) the restrictions on movement between provinces are intended to prevent the spread of the pandemic, in accordance with article  of the Constitution which provides that an individual s exercise of his or her rights is limited only by the rights of others, collective security, general well-being and respect for public order, for the Constitution itself and for legislation; and (iii) the crime of spreading an epidemic, and the relevant sanctions, are set out in article () of the Criminal Code.
.With regard to recommendation (a) of the Committee s last report, the Government states once again that ASIC is not a trade union organization, given that: (i) it does not have the objective of promoting or defending workers' interests; (ii) it does not have the genuine support of any labour collective and is not a grouping of Cuban workers; (iii) it does not enjoy legal or social recognition; (iv) the supposed leaders or activists referred to in the complaint do not represent labour collectives and are not workers themselves, as they do not have fixed employment relationships with entities or employers in Cuba; (v) the Government of the United States, through the International Group for Corporate Social Responsibility and the American organization National Endowment for Democracy, funds ASIC leaders to engage in internal subversion that constitutes an affront to the legitimate constitutional and legal order of Cuba, as well as to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law; (vi) legitimate trade union officials and representatives exercise their functions normally, enjoy all the necessary legal safeguards and are protected by the provisions of the Labour Code (Act No.  of ), the Criminal Code and the Criminal Procedure Act (Act No.  of ); (vii) the trade union organizations that make up the Confederation of Workers of Cuba (CTC) are autonomous and their members approve their own statutes",-1,2016,Cuba
14,"and regulations, discuss and reach agreements democratically, and elect or dismiss their executives; (viii) national unions have ,, members and . per cent of Cuban workers are unionized; and (ix) Cuban workers are the beneficiaries of participatory and democratic social dialogue at all decision-making levels.
.With regard to recommendation (b), the Government regrets that the Committee has not taken note of the information sent in its previous replies, in which it explains in detail that the activities and acts for which the persons mentioned were charged and sentenced constitute crimes provided for and sanctioned under the Criminal Code. The Government states that: (i) the crimes have no connection whatsoever to trade union activities and the exercise of the right to organize; (ii) the legal system provides full protection and respect for the procedural safeguards required in criminal proceedings and that inform due process; (iii) trials are public, oral and adversarial, and final sentences are communicated to the public prosecutor and the accused person or his or her counsel, in accordance with the provisions of article  of the Criminal Procedure Act; (iv) sentences take into account private affairs that are protected under article  of the Civil Code; and (v) sending copies of sentences is not considered relevant.
.The Committee recalls that this complaint concerns a number of allegations of assault, harassment, persecution, arrests, acts of aggression and restrictions on the free movement of union officials and members while carrying out their functions by State security forces. The complainant also alleges that the State recognizes only one trade union federation, which is controlled by the State.
.The Committee notes that, once again, the Government objects to the Committee s examination of this case. In particular, it notes that the Government reiterates that the allegations put forward by the complainant are part of campaigns of political manipulation to discredit Cuba, financed externally and in contravention of the principles of sovereignty; and that the Committee s conclusions in the previous examination of the case are a reflection of the persistence of selective practices and political manipulation in the ILO s working methods and supervisory bodies against developing countries. In this respect, the Committee wishes to recall that, within the terms of its mandate, it is empowered to examine to what extent the exercise of trade union rights may be affected in cases of allegations of the infringement of civil liberties [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , para. ]. The Committee also recalls that it is not competent to consider purely political allegations; it can, however, consider measures of a political character taken by governments in so far as these may affect the exercise of trade union rights [see Compilation, para. ].
.With regard to the recognition of ASIC, and its ability to operate freely and carry out its trade union activities, the Committee notes that the Government reiterates that: (i) ASIC is not a trade union organization; (ii) it does not have the support of any labour collective; (iii) the supposed trade union officials of the organization in question have reportedly not entered into any employment relationship with any entities or employers in Cuba and, furthermore, they have not been elected by the workers to represent them; (iv) the right to organize and to establish trade unions freely is enshrined in the Constitution, adopted in , and in the  Labour Code; and (v) certain ASIC union members and officials do not have an employment relationship.
.While taking due note of the Government s reply, the Committee observes, firstly, that for several decades it has been examining allegations of non-recognition and interference by the Government in the free operation of trade union organizations not affiliated to the CTC [see Cases Nos , , ,  and  of the Committee on Freedom of Association]. The Committee recalls that the right to official recognition through legal registration is an essential facet of the right to organize since that is the first step that workers' or employers' organizations must take in order to be able to function efficiently, and represent their members adequately. It further recalls that freedom of association implies the right of workers and employers to elect their representatives in full freedom and to organize their administration and activities without any interference by the public authorities [see Compilation, paras  and ]. Considering that, according to the information provided by the complainant, some trade union members and officials mentioned in the complaint were self-employed workers and that others had been dismissed for anti-union reasons, the Committee recalls that all workers, regardless of their status, should be guaranteed their freedom of association rights so as to avoid the possibility of having their precarious situation taken advantage of [see Compilation, para. ]. The Committee recalls that in its initial examination of this case, it noted that ASIC, in its founding declaration of principles, advocates trade union autonomy in the framework of the rule of law, aims to promote full compliance with ILO international labour standards and proclaims that it will not compromise or associate itself with party-political activities. In its union constitution, ASIC states that its central objectives include grouping together independent trade unions and reporting violations of international labour standards. Moreover, ASIC members' duties as set out in the union constitution include defending workers' claims and benefits. It is in this context that the Committee observes that the elements of ASIC s declaration of principles and union constitution fall within the scope of action and definition of a workers' organization. The Committee therefore refers to its previous conclusions and, once again, strongly urges the Government to ensure that ASIC is given recognition, and that it can freely operate and carry out its trade union activities.
.With regard to the alleged restrictions on civil liberties, the Committee recalls that, in its last examination of the case, the complainant had reported acts of anti-union discrimination, including arbitrary arrests, harassment, raids and prosecutions [see the Committee s st Report, paras ' ] and had requested the Government to ensure that an investigation was made into those allegations. The Committee also notes that, in its new allegations, the complainant reports arbitrary arrests, harassment and criminal prosecutions by the public authorities against the following trade union leaders: Mr Ivn Hernndez Carrillo, Mr Willian Esmrido Cruz Delgado and Ms Yorsi Kelin Snchez.
.In that regard, the Committee notes that the Government states that: (i) in Cuba, no one is arrested, persecuted, harassed, intimidated or imprisoned for exercising his or her trade union rights; (ii) the public authorities must adhere strictly to the law and are in no circumstances permitted to threaten or intimidate citizens; (iii) the mentioned persons were tried and convicted for various activities classified as offences under Cuban legislation, with no connection whatsoever to their trade union activities; and (iv) those persons enjoyed all due process guarantees. The Committee also observes that: (i) the Government has not provided a copy of the court rulings handed down to the above-mentioned persons or to those mentioned in recommendation (b) of its previous report; (ii) while the Government lists the offences or details of previous legal proceedings against these persons, it does not provide any evidence on the commission of those offences; (iii) the nature of the offences attributed to ASIC members and affiliated unions are very similar to those examined by the Committee in Case No. , following a complaint filed in  by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU); (iv) the situation of Mr Ivn Hernndez Carrillo, ASIC general secretary, and Mr Vctor Manuel Domnguez Garca, director of the National Trade Union Training Centre (CNCS), was already examined by the Committee in Case No. ; and (v) in the case mentioned above, the Government did not provide a copy of the conviction of Mr Ivn Hernndez Carrillo and denied the existence of legal or other action against Mr Vctor Manuel Domnguez Garca.
.The Committee recalls that, on numerous occasions, where the complainants alleged that trade union leaders or workers had been arrested for trade union activities, and the governments' replies amounted to general denials of the allegation or were simply to the effect that the arrests were made for subversive activities, for reasons of internal security or for common law crimes, the Committee has requested the Governments concerned to submit further and as precise information as possible concerning the arrests, particularly in connection with the legal or judicial proceedings instituted as a result thereof and the result of such proceedings, in order to be able to make a proper examination of the allegations. It also recalls that in many cases, it has asked the Government concerned to communicate the texts of any judgments that have been delivered together with the grounds adduced therefor [see Compilation, para. ]. The Committee regrets deeply the absence of a response from the Government to its request for specific information. Referring to its previous conclusions, the Committee once again urges the Government to send a copy, without further delay, of the",-1,2016,Cuba
15,"criminal convictions against Mr Ivn Hernndez Carrillo, Mr Carlos Reyes Consuegras, Mr Jorge Anglada Mayeta, Mr Vctor Manuel Domnguez Garca, Mr Alejandro Snchez Zaldvar, Mr Wilfredo lvarez Garca, Mr Brbaro de la Nuez Ramrez, Mr Alexis Gmez Rodrguez, Mr Roberto Arsenio Lpez Ramos, Mr Charles Enchris Rodrguez Ledezma, Mr Eduardo Enrique Hernndez Toledo, Mr Yoanny Limonta Garca, Mr Willian Esmrido Cruz Delgado and Ms Yorsi Kelin Snchez. The Committee urges the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the administrative and judicial proceedings awaiting decision.
.With regard to its request that an investigation is made into all the allegations of aggression and restrictions on civil liberties reported by the complainant, the Committee notes the Government s reply that Mr Osvaldo Arcis Hernndez, Mr Brbaro Tejeda Snchez, Mr Pavel Herrera Hernndez, Mr Emilio Gottardi, Mr Ral Zerguera Borrell, Mr Aime de las Mercedes Cabrera lvarez, Mr Reinaldo Cosano Aln, Mr Felipe Carrera Hernndez, Mr Pedro Scull, Mr Lzaro Ricardo Prez, Mr Hiosvani Pupo, Mr Daniel Perea Garca, Mr Dannery Gmez Galeto, Mr Willian Esmrido Cruz, Mr Roque Ivn Martnez Beldarrain, Mr Yuvisley Roque Rajadel, Mr Yakdislania Hurtado Bicet, Ms Ariadna Mena Rubio and Ms Hilda Aylin Lpez Salazar are not truly trade unionists and were not tried or convicted for activities relating to the exercise of trade union freedoms.
.The Committee recalls that, while persons engaged in trade union activities or holding trade union office cannot claim immunity in respect of the ordinary criminal law, trade union activities should not in themselves be used by the public authorities as a pretext for the arbitrary arrest or detention of trade unionists. The apprehension and systematic or arbitrary interrogation by the police of trade union leaders and unionists involves a danger of abuse and could constitute a serious attack on trade union rights [see Compilation, paras  and ]. While observing that the Government s reply makes no reference to the alleged restriction of movement of Mr Reinaldo Cosano Aln and Mr Hiosvani Pupo, the Committee regrets that the Government has not adopted the measures necessary to make an investigation into all the allegations of acts of aggression and restrictions on public freedoms with respect to the aforementioned persons. The Committee strongly urges the Government to ensure that the investigation in question is made and requests it to provide detailed information with respect to each of the persons mentioned and on the outcome (with copies of decisions or rulings) of any administrative or judicial proceedings instituted in relation to the above-mentioned allegations.
.With regard to the alleged restrictions on travelling outside the country to participate in international activities connected to trade union work, the Committee notes the complainant s new allegations that Mr Alejandro Snchez, Mr Emilio Gottardi, Mr Charles Rodrguez and Mr Felipe Carreras, ASIC officials, were prohibited from travelling to Panama City to attend a trade union training course at UTAL. On the other hand, the Committee notes that the Government states that: (i) it is untrue that in the exercise of their functions, the Cuban authorities arbitrarily infringe citizens' freedom to travel; (ii) the Migration Act determines the grounds on which the authorities may restrict the right to leave the country; and (iii) this power is exercised by the relevant authorities in a non-arbitrary manner and respecting the legal guarantees set out.
.Recalling that it has highlighted that trade unionists, just like all persons, should enjoy freedom of movement and that, in particular, they should enjoy the right, subject to national legislation, which should not be such so as to violate freedom of association principles, to participate in trade union activities abroad [see Compilation, para. ], the Committee strongly urges the Government to refrain from unduly restricting the right of ASIC officials and members to organize and carry out their union activities freely, including when these are held outside the country.
.With regard to the alleged restrictions on the right to free movement of ASIC officials and members in Cuban territory, the Committee notes that the Government disagrees with the allegations of restrictions on the right to free movement. While noting the diverging versions of events of the Government and complainant, the Committee is bound to recall that the restriction of a person s movements to a limited area, accompanied by the prohibition of entry into the area in which his or her union operates and in which he or she normally carries on trade union functions, is inconsistent with the normal enjoyment of the right to association and with the exercise of the right to carry on trade union activities and functions [see Compilation, para. ]. The Committee therefore firmly expects the Government to fully ensure that ASIC officials have the freedom of movement in the national territory required to carry out their trade union activities without Government interference.
.With respect to the alleged anti-union dismissals of Mr Kelvin Vega Rizo and Mr Pavel Herrera Hernndez, the Committee notes the information provided by the Government according to which: (i) commissions of inquiry were formed; (ii) the disciplinary measures were imposed in response to serious labour discipline violations (unjustified absences and unauthorized abandonment of the workplace); and (iii) the workers concerned did not lodge any complaint with the Lower Labour Justice Body. The Committee requests the Government to send a copy of the outcome of the investigations. The Committee also requests the complainant to confirm whether complaints against the dismissals in question have been lodged with the competent judicial authority.
.With regard to the dismissal of Ms Omara Ruz Urquiola, in relation to which the Committee had requested further information from the complainant about its alleged anti-union nature, the Committee notes the information provided by the Government according to which the disciplinary measures were imposed in response to serious labour discipline violations (unjustified absences). Noting the absence of additional information from the complainant, the Committee will not pursue its examination of this allegation.
..	Lastly, with respect to the alleged infiltration by the Government into the trade union movement and acts of interference, the Committee notes that the complainant alleges that its members continue to be subject to pressure during arbitrary arrests with the aim of persuading them to become informants. On the other hand, the Committee notes that the Government denies the allegations of interference by the police or criminal investigation bodies. Furthermore, with respect to the allegations that the COVID- pandemic is serving as a pretext for maintaining the restrictions supposedly imposed on ASIC officials and members, the Committee notes that the Government indicates that the measures implemented were not adopted with the purpose of maintaining pressure on the supposed trade union leaders and members. While noting the diverging versions of events of the Government and complainant, the Committee recalls the importance of adequate protection against any acts of interference in the establishment, functioning or administration of workers' and employers' organizations and firmly expects the Government to fully ensure adequate protection for ASIC officials against any acts of interference in their trade union activities, including in the circumstances described by the Government.
.In light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee once again strongly urges the Government to ensure that the Independent Trade Union Association of Cuba (ASIC) is given recognition and that it can freely operate and carry out its trade union activities.(b) The Committee once again urges the Government to send a copy, without further delay, of the criminal convictions against Mr Ivn Hernndez Carrillo, Mr Carlos Reyes Consuegras, Mr Jorge Anglada Mayeta, Mr Vctor Manuel Domnguez Garca, Mr Alejandro Snchez Zaldvar, Mr Wilfredo lvarez Garca, Mr Brbaro de la Nuez Ramrez, Mr Alexis Gmez Rodrguez, Mr Roberto Arsenio Lpez Ramos, Mr Charles Enchris Rodrguez Ledezma, Mr Eduardo Enrique Hernndez Toledo, Mr Yoanny Limonta Garca, Mr Willian Esmrido Cruz Delgado and Ms Yorsi Kelin Snchez, and to keep the Committee informed of the outcome of the administrative and judicial proceedings awaiting decision.(c) The Committee once again urges the Government to ensure that an investigation is made into all the allegations of acts of aggression and restrictions on public freedoms raised with respect to Mr Osvaldo Arcis Hernndez, Mr Brbaro Tejeda Snchez, Mr Pavel Herrera Hernndez, Mr Emilio Gottardi, Mr Ral Zerguera Borrell, Mr Aime de las Mercedes Cabrera lvarez, Mr Reinaldo Cosano Aln, Mr Felipe Carrera Hernndez, Mr Pedro Scull, Mr Lzaro Ricardo Prez, Mr Hiosvani Pupo, Mr Daniel Perea Garca, Mr Dannery Gmez Galeto, Mr Willian Esmrido Cruz, Mr Roque Ivn Martnez Beldarrain, Mr Yuvisley Roque Rajadel, Mr Yakdislania Hurtado Bicet, Ms Ariadna Mena Rubio and Ms Hilda Aylin Lpez Salazar, and to provide the Committee with detailed information with respect to each of them and on the outcome (with copies of decisions or rulings) of any administrative or judicial proceedings instituted in relation to the above-mentioned allegations.(d) With regard to the alleged restrictions imposed on ASIC members on travelling outside the country to participate in international activities in connection with their trade union work, the Committee strongly urges the Government to",-1,2016,Cuba

The Committee also requests the complainant to confirm whether complaints against the dismissals have been lodged with the competent judicial authority.(g) The Committee firmly expects the Government to fully ensure adequate protection for ASIC officials against any acts of interference in their trade union activities, including in the circumstances described by the Government.
.The Committee last examined this case (submitted in December ) at its June  meeting, when it presented an interim report to the Governing Body [see th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its rd Session (June ), paras ' ].

.During its previous examination of the case in June , the Committee made the following recommendations [see th Report, para. ]:(a)	The Committee requests the Government to ensure that ASIC is given recognition and that it can freely operate and carry out its trade union activities, in accordance with the principles of freedom of association.(b)	The Committee requests the Government to ensure, in the light of the decisions applying the principles of freedom of association mentioned in its conclusions, that an investigation is made into all the allegations of aggression and other forms of anti-union discrimination made in the complaint and, should these be proven, to ensure that penalties that act as a deterrent are imposed and appropriate compensatory measures are taken, and to provide the Committee with detailed information on this matter and on the outcome (with copies of decisions or rulings) of any administrative or judicial proceedings instituted in relation to the allegations, including those brought against the trade unionists referred to above and the judicial proceedings reportedly brought against Mr Reyes Consuegras.(c)	The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed regarding the exercise of the right to strike in practice, including as regards any discrimination or disadvantage in employment that may have been applied in practice against workers for peacefully exercising the right to strike.

On  November , he was summoned to the Cotorro police unit, in Havana, transferred to a  special house'  questioned about his independent trade unionism work and attempts were made to persuade him to collaborate with the DSE;(j)	on  January , Mr Jorge Anglada Mayeta, an ASIC member, was tried in the Municipal People s Court of Diez de Octubre for an alleged attack and given a two year suspended sentence. According to the complainant, the allegations arise from an incident that occurred on  May , during which the trade unionist intervened to stop a plain-clothes police officer arresting a self-employed worker;(k)	on  February and  March , Mr Roberto Arsenio Lpez Ramos, president of the Association of Independent Educationalists of Cuba (CPIC), was summoned by the police and on both occasions questioned about the cooperation existing between ASIC and his organization;(l)	on  March , Mr Charles Enchris Rodrguez Ledzema, vice-president of the CPIC, was summoned to DSE headquarters in Gines and attempts were made to persuade him to become an informant;(m)	Mr Eduardo Enrique Hernndez Toledo, an ASIC member and self-employed worker (taxi driver), was subjected to harassment and criminal prosecution: (i) state inspectors harassed him and withdrew his taxi driver s licence because of his ASIC membership; (ii) on  September , under the direction of a public prosecutor, a group of neighbours carried out acts of provocation, in response to which the activist is alleged to have countered the provocation with the words  down with Ral'  (iii) because of that act, he was arrested and sentenced to a one-year prison term for contempt for authority; and (iv) the union member is reportedly serving his sentence in the  Pianni' forced labour camp;(n)	on  October , Mr Mateo Moreno Ramn and Mr Leandro Vladimir Aguilera Pea, members of the Cuban Association of Small Entrepreneurs (ACPE), an organization affiliated to ASIC, were arrested by DSE security officers in Pinar del Ro, where they were due to meet with self-employed workers to inform them about their rights, and were forced to return to Havana;(o)	Ms Magela Garcs Ramrez, a gallery worker and art critic, employed by the Ministry of Culture, was removed from her post in the Servando Cabrera gallery in Havana on  December  after the publication in the ART OnCuba magazine of a text entitled '  questions on Cuban art'  As a disciplinary measure, she was transferred to a lower-grade post with less pay and different working conditions.

Since , he has been subjected to continued assaults, arbitrary detentions and threats; specifically, on  February,  April and  June  he was subjected to threats by a DSE agent known as  Adolfo'  because of the statements the trade unionist had made on social networking sites about violations committed against medical professionals in the  Mais Mdicos' (More Doctors) programme in Brazil. The trade unionist has filed a complaint with the public prosecutor s office with regard to the threats but has not received any response from the authorities;(t)	on  August , Mr Emilio Alberto Gottardi Gottardi, ASIC provincial secretary in Havana, was arrested when leaving his house by the joint forces of the national police and state security, interrogated about his trade union activities, in particular about the union s latest meeting, and threatened with legal action;(u)	on  August , following a meeting in the home of ASIC general secretary in the Matanzas province, the trade unionists Dannery Gmez Galeto, Willian Esmrido Cruz, Roque Ivn Martnez Beldarrain and Yuvisley Roque Rajadel were arrested, interrogated, threatened and had their belongings confiscated (including ASIC documents and a letter from the ILO Secretariat to the trade union), and the money that they had on them was taken. Subsequently, in the early hours of  August, the aforementioned trade unionists, as well as trade unionist Yakdislania Hurtado Bicet, were arbitrarily detained for nine hours and freed after being issued with a warning not to meet with people posing a  social danger'  In addition, Mr Roque Rajadel and Mr Martnez Beldarrain were asked to work for state security.
.The complainant states that, due to the Venezuelan crisis and the threat of the collapse of the alliance between the two countries' regimes, the public authorities have stepped up repressive acts against independent trade unions, as well as arbitrary detentions, and the number of activists subjected to persecution and harassment has increased. The complainant alleges that: (i) there has been a significant increase in the cutting of the telephone services and tapping of telephone conversations of ASIC members, and in the blocking of their social media network services; (ii) the police force s new tactic is to blackmail detainees to coerce them into becoming informants; (iii) to date, approximately  trade unionists have been questioned and threatened; and (iv) the purpose of the Government s actions is to have the ASIC general secretary returned to prison on the pretext that he has violated his parole conditions; indeed, the persons questioned have been told that the general secretary receives money from the United States Central Intelligence Agency (known in English by its acronym CIA) and that if this allegation is proven he would return to prison. It was emphasized that he has only avoided imprisonment so far because of national and international pressure.
.In its further allegations, the complainant expresses concern about the public authorities' interference in the independent trade union movement. The complainant reiterates that its members continue to be strongly pressured by the DSE during the arbitrary detentions to which they are subjected by the regime to become informants, with promises they will be granted amnesty and no longer be subjected to harassment.
.Lastly, the complainant reports the continuing practice of the Cuban authorities of prohibiting independent union officials from leaving the country when they are travelling to carry out their trade union functions, including attending conferences and training courses.
.The Government provides its observations in its communications of  September and  November , and  March,  May,  and  September .
.The Government states that, as with the allegations considered during the last examination of the case, these new allegations are false and part of externally organized and financed campaigns of political manipulation to discredit Cuba under the agenda to bring about a regime change and the desire to see a foreign power take control of the country, which was in contravention of the principles of sovereignty, self-determination and non-interference in domestic affairs. The Government indicates that the recommendations made by the Committee in its previous examination of the case are a reflection of the persistence of selective practices and political manipulation in the ILO s working methods and supervisory bodies against developing countries. The Government considers that these practices go against the spirit of",-1,2016,Cuba
18,"dialogue and cooperation for the effective promotion of workers' rights, undermine tripartism and do not help improve the situation of workers in the world. Furthermore, it considers that these negative practices are inconsistent with the principles of objectivity, impartiality and non-selectiveness that should prevail in the handling of trade union freedoms. The Government therefore anticipates that it will be possible, on the basis of the elements submitted in its observations, to dismiss all of the allegations relating to the present case as baseless.
.With regard to recommendation (a), the Government states once again that ASIC is not a trade union organization, given that: (i) it does not have the objective of promoting or defending workers' interests; (ii) it does not have the genuine support of any labour collective and is not a grouping of Cuban workers; (iii) the supposed leaders or activists referred to in the complaint do not represent labour collectives and are not workers themselves, as they do not have fixed employment relationships with entities or employers in Cuba, thus they do not come within the purview of the ILO, and the labour laws are therefore not applicable to them; (iv) the Government of the United States, through the International Group for Corporate Social Responsibility and the American organization National Endowment for Democracy, funds ASIC leaders, who, in exchange for a sum of money, have to pose as independent trade union activists, dissidents or critics of the Government and report false violations of workers' rights; (v) the  Labour Code (Act No.  of ) includes as its fundamental principles the right of workers to organize voluntarily and establish trade unions; (vi) the trade union organizations that make up the Confederation of Workers of Cuba (CTC) are autonomous and their members approve their own statutes and regulations, discuss and reach agreements democratically, and elect or dismiss their executives; (vii) national unions have ,, members and . per cent of Cuban workers are unionized; and (viii) Cuban workers are the beneficiaries of participatory and democratic social dialogue at all decision-making levels.
.With regard to recommendation (b), the Government indicates that the persons mentioned in the complaint have engaged in antisocial and criminal behaviour. It denies that any arbitrary or temporary detentions or arrests are carried out because these are effected in conformity with the criminal procedure in force and are strictly in line with the guarantees of due process that are recognized in the domestic legal system. It further indicates that institutions and security forces perform their duties in strict accordance with the law and it is not their practice to repress, intimidate, harass, torture or mistreat citizens. It recalls that the internal system provides procedures and resources to punish any authority or official overstepping its powers.
.Concerning the individual cases mentioned by the complainant, the Government states that:(a)	it is untrue that Mr Ivn Hernndez Carrillo is a political prisoner: (i) the chamber for crimes against state security of the People s Provincial Court of Havana found him guilty in  of the offence of acts against the independence and territorial integrity of the State, provided for in the Act on the Protection of National Independence and the Economy of Cuba (Act No.  of ), and sentenced him to  years' imprisonment; (ii) on  March , he was granted parole (his conviction will expire in the first half of ); (iii) he cannot travel outside the country under article (b) of the Migration Act (Act No.  of , as amended by Decree Law No.  of ); and (iv) in July , September  and March , three charges were brought against him for disobedience, incitement to commit a crime and contempt, which are offences provided for in the Criminal Code (Act No.  of ), which the Cuban authorities decided to handle as minor offences (with the imposition of administrative measures, including fines and specific obligations and prohibitions);(b)	Mr Carlos Reyes Consuegras, who also has no employment relationship, was prosecuted for illegal gambling and administrative proceedings were also filed against him for the illegal rental of a home and a fine imposed for the illegal possession of psychotropic substances. In addition, he was twice prosecuted for illicit economic activities. With regard to action taken against him by the immigration authorities, this was because of his past record of antisocial and criminal behaviour. He has never been arrested, but simply interviewed, fully respecting the guarantees provided by law;(c)	Mr Jorge Anglada Mayeta was not beaten up by a police officer while trying to defend a self-employed worker. Mr Anglada pounced on and assaulted a police officer carrying out his duties without prior warning or legitimate cause, which constitutes an offence in criminal legislation throughout the world. On  February , the Municipal People s Court of La Habana Vieja, having respected all guarantees of due process, found him guilty of assault and sentenced him to two years' imprisonment with a restriction of liberty order for an equal period of time;(d)	Mr Vctor Manuel Domnguez Garca, Mr Wilfredo lvarez Garca, Mr Brbaro de la Nuez Ramrez, Mr Alexis Gmez Rodrguez, Mr Roberto Arsenio Lpez Ramos and Mr Charles Enchris Rodrguez Ledezma were prosecuted following allegations relating to acts classified as offences under Cuban legislation (illicit economic activities, illegal gambling, possession of psychotropic substances, speculation and hoarding, possession, production and sale of instruments for the purpose of committing crimes, usurpation of public office, handling stolen goods, contempt, causing serious injury, damage, forgery of documents and public disorder). Given that domestic legislation allows for conduct of low risk to society to be subject to administrative proceedings, the authorities handled the above as minor offences;(e)	criminal proceedings were not instituted against Mr Eduardo Enrique Hernndez Toledo because he was allegedly exercising his trade union rights, and neither did the authorities commit any acts of persecution or harassment against him. The aforementioned person is not a trade union leader and has never been subjected to harassment or pressure by the authorities. He was prosecuted by the People s Municipal Court of Trinidad for contempt and sentenced to a one-year prison term with custodial hard labour, and is currently out on parole;(f)	Mr Yoanny Limonta Garca, who is also not a union official and has no employment relationship, was subjected to police checks because of his repeated commission of acts classified as offences and other antisocial behaviour (in  for speculation, in  for possession, production and sale of instruments for the purpose of committing crimes, and in  for usurpation of public office);(g)	Mr Mateo Moreno Ramn and Mr Leandro Vladimir Aguilera Pea were not arrested; they simply received warnings from the relevant authorities, in strict compliance with the law, to prevent them from carrying out their criminal intentions;(h)	the restrictions on the right to free movement of Mr Osvaldo Rodrguez Daz and Mr Alejandro Snchez Zaldvar were implemented in accordance with current migration legislation. Mr Snchez Zaldvar has had no employment relationship since  and has a long history of violation of existing rules, regulations and laws, including allegations of illegal economic activities and disobedience. The allegations of threats and harassment against him and his wife are also untrue. Mr Snchez Zaldvar has participated in several trade union events and workshops abroad funded by a foreign power. In , as part of his activities against Cuba, he travelled to Geneva in the context of the th International Labour Conference. During the current year, his freedom to travel has not been arbitrarily restricted and the authorities have acted only in accordance with migration law(i)	Ms Magela Garcs Ramrez wrote and disseminated an article in which she made serious and groundless accusations against a significant number of artists and art institutions and, given the seriousness of the allegations, her employer decided that she should work for a different art collection, which is why she decided to resign from her post; and(j)	Ms Sara Cuba Delgado was not subjected to surveillance and harassment by state officials.
.With respect to the restrictions on ASIC members and officials travelling and participating in international events, the Government indicates that current migration legislation determines the grounds on which the authorities may restrict the right of a citizen to leave the country and this power is exercised by the relevant authorities in a non-arbitrary manner and respecting legal guarantees. It also denies preventing certain persons from leaving their homes during the  May celebrations or imposing house arrests.
.With regard to recommendation (c) concerning the exercise of the right to strike in practice, the Government states that current legislation does not include any prohibition of this right and that criminal legislation does not provide for any penalty for exercising this right. The fact that workers do not use this mechanism is not due to a legislative prohibition but to the fact that they have the option of resorting to other more effective means at their disposal, including a number of different forms of meaningful participation and the exercise of genuine decision-making power on matters that concern them. Furthermore, the protection of trade",-1,2016,Cuba
19,"union officials against any acts of anti-union discrimination, including with respect to the exercise of the right to strike, is governed by section  of the  Labour Code, which provides that trade union officials have all the guarantees necessary to carry out their functions and ensures their protection against transfers, disciplinary action, anti-union dismissals or other measures affecting their working conditions imposed on them because of their trade union work.
.The Government expects that, once all the information provided has been taken into account, the allegations that gave rise to this case will be dismissed because they are based on false grounds and are the result of fabrications that have nothing to do with the protection of workers.
.The Committee recalls that this complaint concerns a number of allegations of assault, harassment and persecution against union officials and members of ASIC and its affiliated unions, with arrests and acts of aggression and restrictions on the free movement of union officials and members while carrying out their functions, and other acts of discrimination and interference by the public authorities. The complainant also alleges that only one trade union federation is recognized by the State and that there is no recognition of the right to strike.
.The Committee notes the Government s objections regarding the Committee s examination of this case. In particular, it notes that the Government considers that the allegations put forward by the complainant are part of campaigns of political manipulation to discredit Cuba, financed externally and in contravention of the principles of sovereignty, self determination and non-interference in domestic affairs; and that the Committee s conclusions in the previous examination of the case are a reflection of the persistence of selective practices and political manipulation in the ILO s working methods and supervisory bodies against developing countries. In this respect, the Committee wishes to recall that, within the terms of its mandate, it is empowered to examine to what extent the exercise of trade union rights may be affected in cases of allegations of the infringement of civil liberties [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , para. ]. The Committee also recalls that it is not competent to consider purely political allegations; it can, however, consider measures of a political character taken by governments in so far as these may affect the exercise of trade union rights [see Compilation, op. cit., para. ].
.With regard to the recognition of ASIC, and its ability to operate freely and carry out its trade union activities, the Committee notes that the Government reiterates that: (i) ASIC is not a trade union organization; (ii) it does not have the support of any labour collective; (iii) the supposed trade union officials of the organization in question have reportedly not entered into any employment relationship with any entities or employers in Cuba and, furthermore, they have not been elected by the workers to represent them; (iv) the right to organize and to establish trade unions freely is enshrined in the  Labour Code; and (v) certain ASIC union members and officials do not have an employment relationship. While taking due note of the Government s reply, the Committee observes, firstly, that for several decades it has been examining allegations of non-recognition and interference by the Government in the free operation of trade union organizations not affiliated to the CTC [see Case Nos , , ,  and  of the Committee on Freedom of Association]. The Committee recalls that the right to official recognition through legal registration is an essential facet of the right to organize since that is the first step that workers' or employers' organizations must take in order to be able to function efficiently, and represent their members adequately. It further recalls that freedom of association implies the right of workers and employers to elect their representatives in full freedom and to organize their administration and activities without any interference by the public authorities [see Compilation, op. cit., paras  and ]. Considering that, according to the information provided by the complainant, some trade union members and officials mentioned in the complaint were self-employed workers and that others had been dismissed for anti-union reasons, the Committee recalls, secondly, that the criterion for determining the persons covered by the right to organize is not based on the existence of an employment relationship. Workers who do not have employment contracts should have the right to form the organizations of their choosing if they so wish [see Compilation, op. cit., para. ]. In light of the foregoing, the Committee refers to its previous conclusions and urges the Government to ensure that ASIC is given recognition, and that it can freely operate and carry out its trade union activities.
.With regard to the alleged restrictions on public freedoms, the Committee recalls that, in its last examination of the case, the complainant had reported acts of anti-union discrimination, including arbitrary arrests, harassment, raids and prosecutions [see the Committee s th Report, para. ] and had requested the Government to ensure that an investigation was made into those allegations. The Committee notes the numerous additional allegations made by the complainant regarding the commission of new acts of anti-union discrimination, in particular arbitrary arrests, harassment, criminal prosecutions and interference by the public authorities, and restrictions on the right to free movement of ASIC union officials and members, and the Government s reply regarding  specific cases of the  allegations.
.On the one hand, the Committee notes the Government s indications that Mr Ivn Hernndez Carrillo, Mr Carlos Reyes Consuegras, Mr Jorge Anglada Mayeta, Mr Vctor Manuel Domnguez Garca, Mr Alejandro Snchez Zaldvar, Mr Wilfredo lvarez Garca, Mr Brbaro de la Nuez Ramrez, Mr Alexis Gmez Rodrguez, Mr Roberto Arsenio Lpez Ramos, Mr Charles Enchris Rodrguez Ledezma, Mr Eduardo Enrique Hernndez Toledo and Mr Yoanny Limonta Garca, who had allegedly been subjected to arbitrary arrests, had been tried and convicted for various activities classified as offences under Cuban legislation, with no connection whatsoever with their trade union activities, and that they enjoy all due process guarantees. With regard to the specific situation of the trade unionists Mr Mateo Moreno Ramn and Mr Leandro Vladimir Aguilera Pea, the Government states that authorities are acting in compliance with the law in order to prevent them from carrying out their criminal intentions, and denies that Ms Sara Cuba Delgado has been subjected to surveillance and harassment by state officials.
.The Committee also observes that: (i) the Government has not provided a copy of the court rulings handed down to the above-mentioned persons; (ii) while the Government lists the offences or details of previous legal proceedings against these persons (illicit economic activities, illegal gambling, possession of psychotropic substances, speculation and hoarding, possession, production and sale of instruments for the purpose of committing crimes, usurpation of public office, handling stolen goods, contempt, damage, forgery of documents, public disorder, disobedience, antisocial behaviour through the possession, production and sale of instruments for the purpose of committing crimes), it does not provide any evidence on the commission of those offences; (iii) the nature of the offences attributed to ASIC members and affiliated unions are very similar to those examined by the Committee in Case No. , following a complaint filed in  by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU); (iv) the situation of Mr Ivn Hernndez Carrillo, ASIC general secretary, and Mr Vctor Manuel Domnguez Garca, CNCS director, was already examined by the Committee in Case No. ; and (v) in the case mentioned above, the Government did not provide a copy of the conviction of Mr Ivn Hernndez Carrillo and denied the existence of legal or other action against Mr Vctor Manuel Domnguez Garca.
.The Committee recalls that, on numerous occasions, where the complainants alleged that trade union leaders or workers had been arrested for trade union activities, and the governments' replies amounted to general denials of the allegation or were simply to the effect that the arrests were made for subversive activities, for reasons of internal security or for common law crimes, the Committee has always followed the rule that the governments concerned should be requested to submit further and as precise information as possible concerning the arrests, particularly in connection with the legal or judicial proceedings instituted as a result thereof and the result of such proceedings, in order to be able to make a proper examination of the allegations. It also recalls that in many cases, it has asked the government concerned to communicate the texts of any judgments that have been delivered together with the grounds adduced therefor. [see Compilation, op. cit., paras  and ]. Taking into account the different previous cases presented to the Committee concerning the harassment and arrests of trade unionists of independent trade union organizations of the CTC, the Committee urges the Government to send without delay a copy of the criminal convictions handed down against Mr Ivn Hernndez Carrillo, Mr Carlos Reyes Consuegras, Mr Jorge Anglada Mayeta, Mr Vctor Manuel Domnguez Garca, Mr",-1,2016,Cuba
20,"Alejandro Snchez Zaldvar, Mr Wilfredo lvarez Garca, Mr Brbaro de la Nuez Ramrez, Mr Alexis Gmez Rodrguez, Mr Roberto Arsenio Lpez Ramos, Mr Charles Enchris Rodrguez Ledezma, Mr Eduardo Enrique Hernndez Toledo and Mr Yoanny Limonta Garca and, with regard to the administrative and judicial proceedings awaiting decision, to keep it informed of their outcome.
.On the other hand, the Committee regrets to note that the Government has not provided specific information regarding Mr Osvaldo Arcis Hernndez (arbitrary detention), Mr Brbaro Tejeda Snchez (raids on his home and the confiscation of personal belongings), Mr Pavel Herrera Hernndez (arbitrary arrest and anti-union dismissal), Mr Emilio Gottardi (restriction of movement and threats), Mr Ral Zerguera Borrell (restriction of movement), Mr Aime de las Mercedes Cabrera lvarez (restriction of movement), Mr Reinaldo Cosano Aln (restriction of movement), Mr Felipe Carrera Hernndez (arbitrary detention), Mr Pedro Scull (threats), Mr Lzaro Ricardo Prez (restriction of movement), Mr Hiosvani Pupo (restriction of movement), Mr Daniel Perea Garca (threats and raids on his home), Mr Dannery Gmez Galeto (arbitrary detention), Mr Willian Esmrido Cruz (arbitrary detention), Mr Roque Ivn Martnez Beldarrain (arbitrary detention), Mr Yuvisley Roque Rajadel (arbitrary detention), Mr Yakdislania Hurtado Bicet (arbitrary detention), Ms Ariadna Mena Rubio (arbitrary detention) and Ms Hilda Aylin Lpez Salazar (arbitrary detention). The Committee recalls that, while persons engaged in trade union activities or holding trade union office cannot claim immunity in respect of the ordinary criminal law, trade union activities should not in themselves be used by the public authorities as a pretext for the arbitrary arrest or detention of trade unionists. The apprehension and systematic or arbitrary interrogation by the police of trade union leaders and unionists involves a danger of abuse and could constitute a serious attack on trade union rights [see Compilation, op. cit., paras  and ]. The Committee therefore urges the Government to ensure, in the light of the decisions mentioned in its conclusions, that an investigation is made into all the allegations of aggression and restrictions on public freedoms made in relation to the above-mentioned persons and to provide the Committee with detailed information on each of these matters and on the outcome (with copies of decisions or rulings) of any administrative or judicial proceedings instituted in relation to the aforementioned allegations.
.With regard to the alleged restrictions on the right to free movement, the Committee notes that, according to the complainant, it has become common practice for the Cuban authorities to prohibit ASIC union officials and members from leaving the country when travelling to participate in international activities in connection with their trade union work, including during the ILC. It also emerges from the allegations communicated by the complainant that the public authorities had imposed restrictions on the right to free movement on members of ASIC and affiliated unions with a view to preventing their participation in trade union meetings or public demonstrations in the national territory.
.With regard to the alleged restrictions on ASIC members travelling outside the country to participate in activities connected to their trade union work including ILO meetings and invitations, the Committee notes that, according to the Government: (i) current migration legislation determines the grounds on which the authorities may restrict the right of an individual to leave the country and this power is exercised in a non-arbitrary manner; (ii) pursuant to this legislation, Mr Osvaldo Rodrguez Daz and Mr Alejandro Snchez Zaldvar were prohibited from leaving the country; (iii) Mr Ivn Hernndez Carrillo, ASIC general secretary, is serving a criminal conviction; and (iv) Mr Carlos Reyes Consuegras has an antisocial and criminal past, which prohibits him from travelling outside the country. The Committee observes that subsections (d), (e), (f) and (h) of article  of the Migration Act (Act No.  of , as amended by Decree Law No.  of ), which prohibit persons from leaving national territory ' d) when national defence and security render it advisable; (e) [when] they have obligations with respect to the Cuban State or civil responsibilities, provided that these have been expressly stipulated by the relevant authorities; (f) [when] they do not have the required authorization, pursuant to the laws aimed at maintaining a qualified workforce for the country s economic, social, technical and scientific development, and for the security and protection of official information, ' (h) when for other reasons of public interest the competent authorities so decide'  grant a broad discretionary power to the public authorities to determine whether a person can travel outside the country, which could have an impact on the right of union officials of ASIC and other trade unions not affiliated to the CTC to organize and carry out their trade union activities freely. The Committee has highlighted that trade unionists, just like all persons, should enjoy freedom of movement. In particular, they should enjoy the right, subject to national legislation, which should not be such so as to violate freedom of association principles, to participate in trade union activities abroad [see Compilation, op. cit., para. ]. The Committee recalls the special importance it attaches to the right of workers' and employers' representatives to attend and to participate in meetings of international workers' and employers' organizations and of the ILO [see Compilation, op. cit., para. ]. Regretting the Government s indication that the presence of a trade union leader at the International Labour Conference in  constitutes an act of this leader against the Cuban Government,, the Committee expects the Government to refrain from unduly restricting the right of ASIC officials and members to organize and carry out their union activities freely, including when these are held outside the country.
.With regard to the alleged restrictions on the right of ASIC union officials and members to free movement in Cuban territory, the Committee notes that the Government denies imposing house arrests and preventing ASIC members from leaving their homes during the  May celebrations and that the complainant states that several of these restrictions were intended to prevent their participation in trade union meetings and to restrict their freedom of expression. While noting the diverging versions of events of the Government and complainant, the Committee is bound to recall that the restriction of a person s movements to a limited area, accompanied by the prohibition of entry into the area in which his or her union operates and in which he or she normally carries on trade union functions, is inconsistent with the normal enjoyment of the right to association and with the exercise of the right to carry on trade union activities and functions [see Compilation, op., cit. para. ]. The Committee therefore firmly expects the Government to fully ensure that ASIC officials have the freedom of movement in the national territory required to carry out their trade union activities without Government interference.
.With respect to the alleged anti-union dismissals of Mr Kelvin Vega Rizo and Mr Pavel Herrera Hernndez, the Committee once again requests the Government to send its observations in this respect as soon as possible. Concerning the transfer of Ms Magela Garcs Ramrez, in the absence of any evidence establishing her membership of a trade union organization, or that her transfer had an anti-union motive, the Committee will not pursue its examination of this allegation. With regard to the dismissal of Ms Omara Ruz Urquiola, the Committee requests the complainant to provide further information about its alleged anti-union nature.
.Lastly, with respect to the alleged infiltration by the Government into the trade union movement and acts of interference, the Committee notes that the complainant alleges that the Government continues to interfere in the independent trade union movement and that its members continue to be subjected to strong pressure by the DSE during arbitrary arrests with the aim of persuading them to become informants. Noting the absence of a response from the Government, the Committee urges the Government to provide its observations in that regard without further delay.
.With regard to recommendation (c) of the Committee regarding the exercise in practice of the right to strike, the Committee notes that the Government states that: (i) current legislation does not prohibit this right and criminal legislation does not provide for any penalty for exercising this right; (ii) in practice, workers do not use this mechanism because there are more effective dispute settlement mechanisms; and (iii) trade union officials are protected by article  of the  Labour Code, which protects against transfers, the imposition of disciplinary measures or anti-union dismissals. Recalling that the right to strike by workers and their organizations is a legitimate means of defending their economic and social interests [see Compilation, op. cit., para. ], the Committee trusts that the Government will guarantee the exercise of this right in practice.
.In light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	Referring to its previous conclusions, the Committee urges the Government to ensure that the Independent Trade Union Association of Cuba (ASIC) is given recognition and that it can freely operate and carry out its trade union activities.(b)	The Committee",-1,2016,Cuba

.The complaint is contained in communications from the Independent Trade Union Association of Cuba (ASIC) dated  December  and  January,  February,  March and  April .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  September .
.Cuba has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Workers' Representatives Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communications of  December  and  January,  February,  March and  April , ASIC reports numerous specific cases of anti-union discrimination and interference on the part of the authorities (including harassment, persecution, arrests and assaults) against independent trade union activists, alleges that the Government recognizes only one single trade union federation, and asserts that there is no collective bargaining or legal recognition of the right to strike in the country.
.ASIC indicates that it was established on  October , to replace the Independent Trade Union Coalition of Cuba (CSIC). It provides copies of its constituent instrument, structure, declaration of principles and union constitution, in which it is stated that ASIC is the result of the amalgamation of the Single Council of Cuban Workers (CUTC), the Cuban Confederation of Independent Workers (CTIC) and the Independent National Workers' Confederation of Cuba (CONIC). In its declaration of principles, ASIC advocates trade union autonomy in the framework of the rule of law, promotes full compliance with ILO international labour standards and proclaims that it will not compromise or associate itself with party-political activities. It also asserts the importance of strengthening ties of fraternity and solidarity with workers in other parts of the world, without embracing their ideology or religion. ASIC s objectives in its constitution include grouping together the country s independent trade unions and reporting violations of international standards. Members' duties as set out in the union constitution include defending workers' claims and benefits. ASIC provides details of its organization chart and elected offices, and emphasizes that it is represented in all provinces of the country.
.ASIC alleges that the Government recognizes only one single trade union federation in the country ' the Cuban Workers' Federation (CTC) ' controlled by the State and the Communist Party. It indicates that the Labour Code maintains the monopoly of the CTC through ambiguous wording. It considers that the text of the Code aims at formal compliance with international standards but has nothing to do with the actual world of work in Cuba. In this regard, ASIC highlights the fact that section  of the Code establishes that workers have the right to organize voluntarily and to establish trade unions,  in conformity with fundamental unitary principles'  It also considers that Act No.  concerning foreign investment and the provisions governing the Mariel Special Development Zone (ZEDM) are contrary to the principles of freedom of association. In this context, ASIC alleges that the police and state security authorities, as well as those exercising authority within workplaces, relentlessly repress any autonomous or independent industrial action, whether individual or collective in nature, and do not recognize any form of representation outside the official trade union movement.
.In that respect, ASIC reports in detail in its complaint on anti-union aggression, interference and discrimination on the part of the authorities against independent trade union activists, as a result of which the latter are obliged to carry out their activities in an extremely hostile and repressive environment. The alleged aggression includes arrests of trade unionists, threats of prosecution, physical assaults, raids on private houses, trials and convictions of union leaders, dismissals, cases of short-term but systematic detention, travel bans, as well as the use of legal proceedings involving the constant threat of imprisonment, the confiscation of trade union property and the dismissal of workers for their union activities, including just for attendance at union training sessions. The specific allegations by ASIC can be summarized as follows:(a)	On  November , Mr Kelvin Vega Rizo, the secretary of the Independent Mine Workers Union affiliated to the CTIC, was dismissed from his post at the former  Ren Ramos Latour' nickel processing plant, where he had worked as a plumber for over  years. According to Mr Vega Rizo, officials of the Department of State Security (DSE) ordered the company management to dismiss him following his attendance at a trade union training course at the University of Latin American Workers (UTAL) in Panama.(b)	On  December , plain-clothes officers from the secret political police arrested Mr Osvaldo Arcis Hernndez, an independent trade unionist belonging to the Escambray Independent Trade Union, in the municipality of Trinidad and took him into custody. Nine days later he was tried in summary judicial proceedings and sentenced to two years' imprisonment further to the charge of being a danger to society. He was denied any choice of defence counsel and the authorities provided him with a court-appointed lawyer instead. Before his arrest, he had been physically assaulted and received written threats of imprisonment if he did not give up his independent trade union activities. He was granted conditional release on Friday,  August  and was warned that he faced further imprisonment if he continued his independent trade union activities.(c)	On  January , the joint authorities of the Ministry of the Interior and the DSE raided the residence of independent trade unionist Mr Brbaro Tejeda Snchez in Holgun. The police conducted a thorough search of the property and confiscated a laptop, a mobile phone, a flash memory device and a camera, without issuing a certificate of confiscation. The Government has not responded to the complaint lodged by the trade union member.(d)	Repeated acts of repression were committed by DSE agents against Mr Pavel Herrera Hernndez, an independent trade unionist, including constant surveillance of his movements and arbitrary detention for short periods (with threats of termination of employment if he did not give up his anti-establishment activities), culminating in dismissal from his post. On  April , he was dismissed from his job as a dockworker which he had performed for over eight years, with the management alleging unjustified absences, specifically on  and  March , even though both of these absences were the result of",-1,2016,Cuba
22,"being arrested by DSE agents as he was leaving home to go to work (on  March, the final day of the visit of the President of the United States, he was held in police custody).(e)	During and prior to the visit of the President of the United States, several CTIC activists were arrested, threatened and beaten up: (i) on  March , the general secretary of the Catering Workers' Union, Mr Alexis Gmez Rodrguez, was arrested by DSE officials and police officers as he was leaving his house for work and was taken into police custody. He was released after . p.m., having been warned to stay at home for the duration of the US President s visit; (ii) on  March , Mr Ivn Hernndez Carrillo, the CTIC general secretary, was arrested in Coln by nearly a dozen police officers, who kicked him to the ground, damaged his clothes and shoes, and forcibly took him into police custody. They later issued a warning for an alleged disturbance of public order and released him on payment of a fine. The following day, they arrested him again and warned him that during the visit of the US President his freedom of movement was restricted; and (iii) other trade union activists, including Mr Emilio Gottardi Gottardi and Mr Ral Zerguera Borrell, were issued official warnings and placed under temporary house arrest.(f)	On  July , on his return to Cuba after a work-related trip, Mr Ivn Hernndez Carrillo (now ASIC general secretary) was arrested with force at the airport, taken into police custody and reportedly accused of the offence of contempt, before being released without charge the following day. Many of his belongings had been inspected, some damaged and others stolen, including a radio,  compact discs containing ILO Conventions and other ILO documents, as well as t-shirts and stickers considered by the regime to be  enemy propaganda'  In the wake of this situation, a number of international bodies ' including the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) ' publicly called for an end to these abuses.(g)	On  September , several trade union activists from CONIC, the CUTC and the CTIC were arrested and others were kept under house arrest by the secret police to prevent them from holding a peaceful assembly aimed at establishing a broad independent trade union coalition. Those arrested included: (i) CUTC general secretary Mr Alejandro Snchez Zaldvar, who was arrested in the early hours on the same day as he was leaving his house, taken to a judicial office and questioned by DSE officials before being dropped off far from home; (ii) Ms Ariadna Mena Rubio (of the CTIC), who was held in police custody and released eight hours later, following intensive questioning; (iii) Ms Hilda Aylin Lpez Salazar (CONIC), who was taken to Police Unit No.  of Havana and subjected to heavy interrogation; and (iv) trade unionists Ms Aime de las Mercedes Cabrera lvarez (CUTC), Mr Reinaldo Cosano Aln (CONIC) and Mr Vctor Manuel Domnguez Garca (National Trade Union Training Centre ' CNCS) were prohibited from leaving their homes, having been informed that they would otherwise face arrest.(h)	On  September , CTIC activist Mr Felipe Carrera Hernndez was arrested at home by the national police and taken to a police station, where he was questioned for two hours by plain-clothes secret police officers about his work-related and trade union activities. He was released after being subjected to serious threats.(i)	On  November , Mr Emilio Gottardi Gottardi, an ASIC member, was arrested by DSE officials and the police as he was leaving home, and was then questioned and threatened because of his trade union training activities, before finally being released around midday.(j)	On  December , police officers went to the homes of various ASIC members (Mr Pedro Scull, Ms Aime Cabrera and Mr Alejandro Snchez) in Havana to warn them that they would not allow the ASIC meeting planned by the secretariat to go ahead, and that general secretary Mr Ivn Hernndez Carrillo (who lives in Coln, some  kilometres from Havana) would be imprisoned if he travelled to the capital. One of the police officers who went to the home of Mr Alejandro Snchez warned him that he had direct orders from President Ral Castro not to allow further activities by the opposition.(k)	On  December , two secret police officers stopped independent trade union member Mr Mateo Moreno Ramn in the street and proceeded to intimidate him and inquire into his trade union activities.(l)	On the night of  December , ASIC general secretary Mr Ivn Hernndez Carrillo, on returning to his home in Coln from Havana with Ms Caridad Burunate Gmez, a member of the Damas de Blanco (ladies in white) opposition movement, was subjected to an attempted violent robbery and brutal assault by four secret police officers, who reportedly identified themselves just afterwards. Both activists were subsequently detained, subjected to a thorough body search and inspection of their belongings, and later released without charge. In the afternoon of the same day, trade union activist Mr Felipe Carrera Hernndez was arrested and released two hours later.(m)	On  December , Mr Emilio Alberto Gottardi Gottardi, an ASIC provincial delegate in Havana, was visited at home by two plain-clothes secret police officers to warn him about his activities and restrict his movements during the New Year festivities.(n)	On  January , the immigration authorities, alleging a breach of migration regulations, placed a travel ban on Mr Ral Domingo Zerguera Borrell, a trade unionist who had been invited to UTAL for a seminar on the current situation and outlook for the organization of workers in the informal economy. The trade unionist was ordered in a threatening tone, allegedly by an officer of the secret police, to leave the area, and was arrested on his return to Havana and held for an hour at a police station in central Havana.(o)	On the morning of  January , the home of independent trade unionist Mr Carlos Roberto Reyes Consuegras was raided without warning in a joint operation by the Ministry of the Interior and the DES, which conducted a painstaking search, resulting in the confiscation of two laptops, a camera, a typewriter, a mobile phone and various written complaints to the State, as well as other documents of the organization. Ultimately, the independent trade union member was taken into custody and held for six hours at an office of the Ministry of the Interior in the town of Cruces. Here he was subjected to intense interrogation about his trade union activities and his free legal advisory service relating to labour issues, in which he advises citizens on the drafting of complaints in accordance with their constitutional rights. The authorities opened a judicial file against the trade unionist for alleged abuse of public office, an offence which he was told is punishable with imprisonment of one to three years. He was finally released and warned that his freedom of movement was restricted until the pre-trial hearing.(p)	On  February , ASIC general secretary Mr Ivn Hernndez Carrillo was beaten up and then detained after attempting to take photos as state security personnel arrested his mother, Dama de Blanco member Ms Asuncin Carrillo Hernndez. They handcuffed him and took him to Coln police station. He was released four hours later with a fine, reportedly having been accused of causing public disorder and issued with a warning.(q)	On  February , independent trade unionists Mr Lzaro Ricardo Prez (a member of the ASIC leadership) and Mr Hiosvani Pupo were prohibited from travelling to Havana, thereby preventing their attendance at ASIC meetings.(r)	On  March , state security personnel and police officers raided the home of independent trade union journalist Mr Yoanny Limonta Garca. Following a thorough search, he was arrested and taken to the municipal police station, where he was questioned and later released after being warned that he faced imprisonment if he continued his activities.(s)	On  March , ASIC general secretary Mr Ivn Hernndez Carrillo was arrested during his trip to Havana and placed in a small police cell with deplorable sanitary conditions, where he was held for ten hours without charge. The police report states that he was arrested for opposition activities. He was finally released but the police kept his identity documents in their possession.
.Lastly, ASIC alleges that there is an absence of collective bargaining and no legal recognition of the right to strike.
.In its communication of  September , the Government provides its observations on the complaint. The Government states that its reply was formulated in consultation with the CTC and the National Organization of Cuban Employers, as representative organizations of workers and employers respectively, to which a copy of the reply was sent.
.First, the Government states that the allegations contained in the complaint are false and are part of externally organized and financed campaigns of political manipulation, which seek to discredit the country.",-1,2016,Cuba
23,"The Government denounces as unacceptable the attempt to use the ILO supervisory bodies for political purposes.
.Second, the Government states that ASIC is not a trade union organization, emphasizing in this respect that: (i) it does not have the objective of promoting or defending workers' interests; (ii) it does not have the genuine support of any labour collective and is not a grouping of Cuban workers; and (iii) the supposed leaders and activists referred to in the complaint do not represent labour collectives and are not workers themselves as they do not have fixed employment relationships with entities or employers in Cuba, they do not come within the purview of the ILO, and the labour laws are therefore not applicable to them (the Government considers that the ILO has determined that the application of these legal standards is strictly conditional upon the existence of an employment relationship). The Government considers that, by not having an employment relationship or being part of any labour collective, these persons have not been elected by workers to represent them, and it considers this a prerequisite enshrined in Article  of Convention No.  for their recognition as representatives. The Government alleges that these persons work for the external entities financing them with the objective of subverting the legally established internal order, in line with foreign agendas for regime change. In this respect, the Government indicates that the supposed leaders are funded by the International Group for Corporate Social Responsibility in Cuba, which in turn receives funds from the National Endowment for Democracy in the United States. The Government also provides examples of the activities performed by several of the individuals referred to in the complaint, highlighting trips outside the country to receive funds and instructions, the perpetration of various types of common crimes, the submission of complaints regarding issues unrelated to labour, and the absence of employment relationships or of the application of disciplinary measures for repeated breaches of labour discipline or for declarations of unfitness for work.
.Third, the Government alleges that it is untrue that Cuban workers are not afforded guarantees relating to the exercise of their labour and trade union rights. In this regard, it indicates that the CTC and its  national sectoral unions represent the interests of a total of ,, members (. per cent of the workers) and that they have all the guarantees necessary to carry out their trade union work, such as not being obliged to register in order to secure recognition. The Government also states that the scope of the exercise of trade union rights is in full conformity with ILO Conventions Nos ,  and  and is much broader than in other countries. This is reflected in the recognition of the workers' right to organize voluntarily and to establish trade unions, in conformity with fundamental unitary principles and their own constitutions and rules, in the privileged role occupied by the trade unions in the political life of the country (recalling that the CTC has recognized authority to initiate legislative proposals), and in the legal protection afforded to the trade unions, with heavy penalties for any parties which seek to impede the proper exercise of labour rights. The Government also emphasizes that employment relationships in the context of foreign investment are governed by existing national legislative provisions and that workers in this sector, like all other workers in Cuba, have the right to organize and to bargain collectively, and that they exercise those rights fully. Furthermore, the Government states that Decree Law No.  of  concerning the ZEDM establishes that companies and users must respect the country s labour and social security provisions, and trade unions have therefore existed in the ZEDM since its creation (and it recalls that none of the supposed trade union activists or leaders referred to in the complaint have an employment relationship in the zone in question and therefore do not represent its workers).
.Fourth, the Government states that there are no legal provisions or laws prohibiting the right to strike and that the criminal legislation does not lay down any penalty for the exercise thereof. It indicates that it is the trade unions' prerogative to decide in this respect.
.Fifth, the Government affirms that: (i) it is untrue that arbitrary or temporary detentions or arrests are carried out in the country (it states that detentions are effected in conformity with criminal procedure and are strictly in line with the extensive guarantees of due process which are recognized in the domestic legal system, in accordance with international standards); (ii) trade union activists or leaders in the country are not subjected to acts of torture or to threats or harassment (as torture has been outlawed in Cuba since the triumph of the Revolution in ); and (iii) the national security forces and institutions perform their duties in strict accordance with the law and it is not their practice to repress, intimidate, harass, torture or mistreat citizens of the country (as impunity is not tolerated, and procedures and resources exist to punish any authorities or officials that exceed their powers).
.Sixth, the Government indicates that there is no consensus or international obligation regarding whether a unified trade union movement or trade union pluralism should exist and that the ILO supervisory bodies have determined that the trade union unity created voluntarily by the workers cannot be prohibited and should be respected. In this regard, it emphasizes that the recognition in practice of the CTC, which was established in , is fully compatible with the ILO Conventions, in view of its numerical superiority and its history of representation. This includes recognition of the representative role that it can play in collective bargaining, in consultations with the Government and in the appointment of delegates to international bodies.
.Seventh, the Government denies that collective labour agreements do not exist in the country or that they are not effective. In this respect, it reports that , collective labour agreements are in force, covering approximately ,, workers. The Government points out that through these agreements the trade union organization and the employer agree on matters relating to working conditions and also to reciprocal rights and obligations, and that such agreements must be discussed and approved in workers' assemblies in order to be valid.
.Eighth, the Government denies that it has caused or is causing mass dismissals. It reports that at the end of  a total of ,, persons were employed ( per cent in the public sector and  per cent in the non-public sector) and that the unemployment rate for that year was . per cent.
.Ninth, the Government states that it does not confiscate or destroy material or documents containing ILO Conventions and Recommendations (on the contrary, the Government works to disseminate and raise public awareness of these instruments).
.The Committee observes that the complaint is primarily concerned with numerous allegations of harassment and persecution, involving aggression, arrests and assaults, against independent trade unionists, and other acts of anti-union discrimination and interference on the part of the public authorities. In addition, the complainant organization alleges that only one single trade union federation is recognized by the Government, and that there is no collective bargaining or legal recognition of the right to strike.
.The Committee observes that the Government questions whether ASIC is a workers' organization and whether the individuals referred to as trade union activists in the complaint are workers' representatives. In this regard, while noting that the Government denies that the purpose of ASIC is to defend the workers' interests (alleging that its purpose is to subvert the legally established internal order), the Committee observes that, in its founding declaration of principles, ASIC advocates trade union autonomy in the framework of the rule of law, seeks to promote full compliance with ILO international labour standards and proclaims that it will not compromise or associate itself with party-political activities. Moreover, the Committee observes that ASIC declares in its constitution that its key objectives include unifying the independent unions and reporting violations of international labour standards. Its constitution also refers to the duty of ASIC members to defend workers' claims and benefits. Consequently, even though the Committee observes, on the one hand, that the Government questions the actions and representativeness of ASIC (describing it as an organization for political opposition and not for the defence or representation of the workers), the Committee duly notes, on the other hand, the activities that ASIC claims that its activist leaders undertake to promote the principles of freedom of association (through examples and specific situations described in the allegations of aggression and discrimination on account of union activities in various places in the country) and, with regard to the ASIC founding and regulatory documents, observes that the aspects of the ASIC declaration of principles and constitution referred to above come within the sphere of action and the definition of a workers' organization.
.Furthermore, the Committee notes that ASIC is the result of the amalgamation of several organizations which have been the subject of previous complaints similarly alleging not only",-1,2016,Cuba
24,"lack of recognition but also interference by the Government in their free operation (for example, it should be recalled that, in relation to the CUTC, one of the three founding organizations of ASIC, the Committee asked the Government to ensure that the CUTC can operate freely and that the authorities refrain from interfering in such a way as to restrict the organization s fundamental rights [see th Report, Case No. , Cuba (March ), para. ]).
.The Committee further notes that the Government denies that the leaders to which the complainant organization refers can be considered representatives of the workers (on the grounds that since these individuals do not have an employment relationship or are not part of any labour collective, they have not been elected by the workers to represent them). In this regard, the Committee, while observing the differences between the statements of the parties, is bound to recall the following: that both elected representatives and trade union representatives (namely, those appointed or elected by the unions or their members) may be considered representatives of the workers; that freedom of association is a right of all workers, and not just those who are in a specific employment relationship; and that workers and their organizations must have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom, so that the absence or disappearance of an employment relationship should not necessarily affect the status and functions of representatives from workers' organizations, unless the constitutions of the organizations specify differently; otherwise, the abovementioned right would be restricted, leaving such organizations without leadership should their representatives be dismissed. In this regard, the Committee observes that the allegations of harassment and persecution made in the complaint include allegations of anti-union dismissals.
.In the light of the above considerations, the Committee requests the Government to ensure that ASIC is given recognition and that it can freely operate and carry out its trade union activities, in accordance with the principles of freedom of association.
.As regards the allegations of aggression, harassment and persecution, with detentions, assaults and dismissals, against independent trade union activists, and other acts of anti-union discrimination, the Committee notes the Government s general statement that no arbitrary or temporary detentions or arrests are carried out in the country and trade union activists or leaders are not subjected to acts of torture or to threats or harassment, and that the national security forces and institutions perform their duties in strict accordance with the law and it is not their practice to repress, intimidate, harass, torture or mistreat citizens of the country. The Government also affirms that freedom of association is fully respected in the country and trade union activity is protected, including by criminal law. The Committee notes with regret that, apart from these general statements, the Government does not provide specific replies to the numerous detailed and serious allegations made repeatedly by the complainant organization. In this regard, the Committee is bound to recall that where cases of alleged anti-union discrimination are involved, the competent authorities dealing with labour issues should begin an inquiry immediately and take suitable measures to remedy any effects of anti-union discrimination brought to their attention. In addition, the Committee recalls the principle that the rights of workers' and employers' organizations can only be exercised in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind against the leaders and members of these organizations, and it is for governments to ensure that this principle is respected [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , paras  and ]. The Committee requests the Government to ensure, in the light of its decisions applying the principles of freedom of association referred to above, that an investigation is made into all the allegations of aggression and other forms of anti-union discrimination made in the complaint and, should these be proven, to ensure that penalties that act as a deterrent are imposed and appropriate compensatory measures are taken, and to provide the Committee with detailed information on this matter and on the outcome (with copies of decisions or rulings) of any administrative or judicial proceedings instituted in relation to the allegations, including those brought against the trade unionists referred to above and the judicial proceedings reportedly brought against Mr Reyes Consuegras.
.As regards the allegation that there is no collective bargaining in the country, the Committee notes the Government s statement that there are , collective labour agreements covering approximately ,, workers in the country. If the complainant organization does not send more detailed information in support of its general assertion that there is no collective bargaining in the country, the Committee will not pursue its examination of this allegation.
.As regards the allegation of lack of legal recognition of the right to strike, the Committee notes the Government s statement that there is no law or legal provision laying down any prohibition on the right to strike and that the criminal legislation does not establish any penalty for exercising this right, since it is a prerogative of the trade unions to take decisions in this regard. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed regarding the exercise of the right to strike in practice, including as regards any discrimination or disadvantage in employment that may have been applied in practice against workers for peacefully exercising the right to strike.
.As regards the allegation of official recognition of only one single trade union federation controlled by the State, the Committee observes that the Committee of Experts noted with satisfaction that, as follow-up to the supervisory bodies' recommendation on this matter, the previous reference to the CTC was removed from the Labour Code and the new Code contains no specific reference to any trade union organization. The Committee also notes the Government s statement that the recognition in practice of the CTC, which was established in , is based on its history of representation as well as its clear numerical superiority. This being the case, the Committee wishes to underline the importance given to previous conclusions ' particularly in the light of the allegations in the case ' in which the Committee recalled that the granting of exclusive rights to the most representative organization should not mean that the existence of other unions to which certain involved workers might wish to belong is prohibited. Minority organizations should be permitted to carry out their activities and at least to have the right to speak on behalf of their members and to represent them [see Compilation, op. cit., para. ].
.Lastly, having noted the conflicting allegations of the parties questioning the independence of workers' organizations in the country, the Committee wishes to recall the importance that it attaches to the resolution concerning the independence of the trade union movement adopted by the International Labour Conference in , which emphasizes that it is essential to preserve the freedom and independence of the trade union movement in all countries so that it can pursue its economic and social objectives regardless of any political changes.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee requests the Government to ensure that ASIC is given recognition and that it can freely operate and carry out its trade union activities, in accordance with the principles of freedom of association.(b)	The Committee requests the Government to ensure, in the light of the decisions applying the principles of freedom of association mentioned in its conclusions, that an investigation is made into all the allegations of aggression and other forms of anti-union discrimination made in the complaint and, should these be proven, to ensure that penalties that act as a deterrent are imposed and appropriate compensatory measures are taken, and to provide the Committee with detailed information on this matter and on the outcome (with copies of decisions or rulings) of any administrative or judicial proceedings instituted in relation to the allegations, including those brought against the trade unionists referred to above and the judicial proceedings reportedly brought against Mr Reyes Consuegras.(c)	The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed regarding the exercise of the right to strike in practice, including as regards any discrimination or disadvantage in employment that may have been applied in practice against workers for peacefully exercising the right to strike.",-1,2016,Cuba
25,".The ICFTU sent new allegations in a communication dated  December . The Government subsequently sent new observations in communications dated  September  and  March .
.Cuba has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) Taking into account the previous cases presented to the Committee relating to harassment and detention of members of trade unions which are independent of the established structure, and also taking into account the fact that the convictions of seven trade unionists were issued in the context of very brief summary proceedings and that for the third time the Government has failed to send the requested judgements containing these sentences, the Committee urges the Government to take steps to ensure the immediate release of the trade unionists referred to in the complaint (Pedro Pablo Alvarez Ramos (sentenced to  years' imprisonment), Carmelo Daz Fernndez ( years), Miguel Galvn ( years), Hctor Ral Valle Hernndez ( years), Oscar Espinosa Chepe ( years), Nelson Molinet Espino ( years), and Ivn Hernndez Carrillo ( years)), and to keep it informed in this respect.(b) The Committee considers that the statutes of the CTDC should not be an obstacle to registration of the organization and requests the Government to guarantee recognition thereof.(c) The Committee once again requests the complainant organizations to send the statutes of CONIC.(d) With regard to the allegations that: () on  September  CONIC held its second national assembly, amidst retaliation by the State; () a heavy-handed operation was conducted by the political police to prevent the annual trade union assembly being held; () the political police threatened the CONIC officials with possible charges of rebellion if any demonstration was held in the vicinity of the premises where the assembly was taking place; () they stopped all people trying to enter the building, checking their identity and the reason for their presence, and they also denied access to a number of trade unionists, violently ejecting them from the vicinity, the Committee requests the Government to carry out a detailed investigation into these allegations and keep it informed in this respect.(e) Recalling its previous conclusions concerning the imposition of a trade union monopoly by law, and other legislative issues (need for the adoption without delay of new provisions and measures fully to recognize in legislation and in practice the right of workers to establish the organizations they deem appropriate at all levels (in particular, organizations independent from the current trade union structure), and also the right of these organizations freely to organize their activities; removal of any reference by name to the existing Trade Union Central and permit the free establishment of trade unions, outside the existing structure, at all levels, if workers so desire; the amendment of legislation with regard to collective bargaining, to ensure that collective bargaining in labour centres can take place without recourse to binding compulsory arbitration prescribed by the legislation and without interference by the authorities, organizations at a higher level or the CTC; and assurances that the right to strike can be exercised in an effective manner in practice and that nobody will be discriminated against or prejudiced in their employment for peacefully exercising this right), the Committee requests the Government: () to take all necessary steps to ensure that no person is intimidated or harassed merely for being a union member, even if the union in question is not recognized by the State; and () to make the necessary amendments in respect of the pending legislative issues raised by the Committee.(f) The Committee can only express the firm hope that the Government will take steps to ensure a climate free of violence, pressures or threats of any kind so that trade union activities can be carried out freely, even by organizations which do not share the same economic and social objectives.(g) The Committee requests the Government to accept a direct contacts mission.
.The Committee examined this case at its November  meeting and submitted an interim report to the Governing Body [see nd Report, Case No. , paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November )].
.The Government sent further observations in communications dated  January,  February,  and  May .
.The World Confederation of Labour submitted a number of documents and information in a communication dated  March .
.Cuba has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee deeply regrets that the Government categorically rejects the possibility of a direct contacts mission. It further deplores that the Government has not sent the requested judgements with regard to the main issue in this case and therefore draws attention to the lack of will to cooperate fully in the proceedings.(b) The Committee urges the Government promptly to adopt new provisions and measures fully to recognize in legislation and in practice the right of workers to establish the organizations they deem appropriate at all levels (in particular, organizations independent from the current trade union structure), and also the right of these organizations freely to organize their activities. The Committee requests the Government to keep the Committee of Experts informed of progress in revising the Labour Code with regard to freedom of association and expects that this review will provide for the removal of any reference by name to the existing Trade Union Central and that it will provide for the establishment of trade unions, outside the existing structure, at all levels, if workers so desire.(c) The Committee urges the Government to take measures to amend legislation with regard to collective bargaining in the manner outlined in the conclusions, to ensure that collective bargaining in labour centres can take place without recourse to binding compulsory arbitration prescribed by the legislation and without interference by the authorities, organizations at a higher level or the CTC.(d) The Committee strongly expects that the Government will ensure that the right to strike can be exercised in an effective manner in practice and that nobody will be discriminated against or prejudiced in their employment for peacefully exercising this right.(e) Taking into account several earlier cases submitted to the Committee regarding harassment and detention of trade union members belonging to trade union organizations that are independent of the established structure, also taking into account the fact that the sentencing of seven trade union members was handed down in summary hearings of very short duration, and given that the Government has for the second time failed to send the requested copies of the criminal convictions handed down, the Committee urges the Government to take steps to release immediately the persons mentioned in the complaints: Pedro Pablo Alvarez Ramos ( years); Carmelo Daz Fernndez ( years); Miguel Galvn ( years); Hctor Ral Valle Hernndez ( years); Oscar Espinosa Chepe ( years); Nelson Molinet Espino ( years); and Ivn Hernndez Carrillo ( years) and to keep the Committee informed in this respect.(f) With regard to the allegations of the ICFTU, stating that Aleida de las Mercedes Godines, Secretary of CONIC, and Alicia Zamora Labrada, Director of the Trade Union Press, were two state security agents infiltrated into the trade union movement (the former for  years according to information received from the ICFTU), the Committee deplores the infiltration of security agents in the CONIC trade union organization or in a trade union press agency and urges the Government, in future, to comply with the principle of non-intervention or interference by the public authorities in the trade union activities embodied in Convention No. , Article .(g) The Committee requests the complainant organizations to send a copy of the statutes of CONIC and CDTC.(h) The Committee urges the Government to send detailed information on the following allegations, without delay:
.The complaints in the present case are contained in communications from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) ( April ) and the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) ( April ). The World Confederation of Labour (WCL) supported the complaint of CLAT in a communication dated  May . The Government sent its observations in communications dated  May and  June .
.Cuba has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  April , the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) states that the Cuban authorities only recognize one trade union central, the Central Organization of Cuban Trade Unions (CTC), which is under the strict control of the State and the Communist Party, which appoints its leaders. The Government prohibits independent trade unions. Collective bargaining does not exist.",-1,2003,Cuba
26,"The right to strike is not authorized by law and practically does not exist. The Government has not fulfilled any of its promises to reform the Labour Code. In reality, there are a number of independent trade unions, which carry out their activities in a very hostile environment. Workers who try to join these trade unions are persecuted and can lose their jobs.
.The ICFTU, looking back over what has happened with the independent trade unions, describes events that have taken place and that have harshly affected the activity of these trade unions with an escalation in arrests and harassment of those involved in  counter?revolutionary' activities since .
.In , the following events took place:' On  January, Lzaro Estanislao Ramos, a delegate from the Pinar del Ro branch of the Independent National Workers' Confederation of Cuba (CONIC), was threatened in his home by a state security employee, Captain Ren Godoy. The official warned him that his confederation had no future in Pinar del Ro and that penalties against opposition would worsen, culminating, if necessary, in the disappearance of the dissidents.' On  April, Lzaro Garca Farra, a trade union member of CONIC, who is currently in prison, was brutally assaulted by prison guards.' On  April, Georgis Pileta, another independent trade union member in prison was beaten by guards after he was sent to the punishment cells.' On  May, Jos Orlando Gonzles Bridn, Secretary-General of the independent trade union, Confederation of Democratic Workers of Cuba (CTDC) was sentenced to two years in prison for having  spread false information' ' On  July, Manuel Lantigua, a trade union member of the Single Council of Cuban Workers (CUTC) was beaten and stoned in the doorway of his home by members of the paramilitary group Rapid Response Brigades.' On  December, the homes of independent labour activists Cecilia Chvez and Jordanis Rivas were raided. Both were detained on a number of occasions by security forces and threatened with imprisonment if they continued their trade union activities.
.In , the following events took place:' On  February, Luis Torres Cardosa, trade union member and representative of CONIC was arrested by three policemen at his home in the province of Guantnamo and taken to Unit No.  of the National Revolutionary Police (PNR), where he was interrogated. He was detained as a result of his opposition, along with others, to an official eviction notice of a dwelling.' On  September, CONIC held its second national meeting, amidst retaliation by the State. A massive operation was carried out by the political police to prevent the annual trade union assembly being held. The political police threatened trade union officials with possible charges of rebellion if there was any protest in the areas surrounding the premises where the assembly was being held. Moreover, they stopped all people trying to enter the building, asking for their identification and the reason why they were coming to that place. They also prohibited various trade union members from entering the building and violently expelled them from the surrounding areas.
.With regard to , according to ICFTU sources, on  March, in the television programme  Round Table' transmitted by Cuban television, the main speaker, Ricardo Alarcn de Quesada, President of the National Assembly of People s Power (the Cuban Parliament) stated that  the counter-revolutionaries would be judged in accordance with Law No. , which relates to the protection of the national independence and economy of the Republic of Cuba, and the Criminal Code in force, which is Law No. '  A police operation, already organized against the political opposition, came into effect immediately following the programme and  people opposing the regime were arrested by state security agents. These detentions, now amounting to some  members, took place as a result of government accusations of treason and conspiracy with the United States Interests Section in Havana. The official government statement said that  they have been arrested by the relevant authorities and will be brought before the courts'  As well as the detentions that took place, all the books in the trade union library of CUTC were confiscated as was a computer, two fax machines, three typewriters and considerable documentation belonging to the trade union.
.According to the ICFTU, among the detained were the following:
.Furthermore, the ICFTU points out that Aleida de las Mercedes Godines, Secretary?General of CONIC, and Alicia Zamora Labrada, Director of the Trade Union Press Agency Lux Info Press, were two state security agents who were infiltrated into the independent trade union movement. They were identified by the Cuban Government itself in a public ruling against the dissidents. According to information received, Ms. Godines had been infiltrated into the independent trade union movement  years ago. She communicated on a number of occasions with both ORIT, the Inter-American Regional Organization of Workers of the ICFTU, and with the ICFTU to request persistently that CONIC be affiliated to both organizations. The ICFTU attaches a press clipping (Granma of  April ).
.In its communication of  April , the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) states that Pedro Pablo Alvarez, Secretary-General of CUTC and trade union members Oscar Espinosa Chepe and Carmelo Daz Fernndez, were detained and have been sentenced to ,  and  years' imprisonment, respectively, for having expressed openly, publicly and democratically their opinions, in legitimate use of their rights as workers and trade union officials, which shows, once again, the lack of trade union freedom in Cuba. The charges laid against the abovementioned trade union officials do not relate to reality (as is the case, for example, of their receiving funding from a certain country), nor are they, in general, criminal issues; they are arguments that hide a clear political intention, and in no way do they conflict with the responsibility of trade union officials in a free and democratic society. Furthermore, the repressive attitude of the Government of Cuba against CUTC and its officials is nothing new.
.CLAT also refers to the complaint presented by the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) on  March  in Case No. , which has already been examined by the Committee on Freedom of Association.
.In its communication of  May , the WCL supports the claim presented by CLAT on  April . The WCL highlights that a number of trade union officials belonging to CUTC, among whom was Pedro Pablo Alvarez, Secretary-General of CUTC, were wrongly detained and sentenced to a number of years in prison. The sentences applied to Pedro Pablo Alvarez, Oscar Espinosa Chepe and Carmelo Daz Fernndez, were for ,  and  years' imprisonment, respectively. Added to this is the confiscation of trade union materials found in the CUTC library. Harassment against members of CUTC, according to the WCL, is not a recent event. In Case No. , already examined by the Committee on Freedom of Association, there is abundant proof of this and of the arbitrary behaviour of the Government of Cuba against an independent trade union organization such as CUTC.
.In its communication of  May , the Government states that legislation in force and daily practice in all centres of labour activity in Cuba guarantee the full exercise of trade union activity and the widest enjoyment of the right of freedom of association. This is confirmed by the existence of  national trade unions, , trade union offices with , territorial trade union officials and , grass-roots trade union branches with , trade union officials.
.The existence of one trade union central has not been imposed by the Government, nor does it relate to any provision that has not been approved by the sovereign will of Cuban workers. The fight for unity in the trade union movement in Cuba has a long and respected tradition which dates back to the nineteenth century and which was strengthened in the difficult and bloody days of workers' demands in the first-half of the twentieth century. In  ' long before the triumph of the Cuban revolution and the popular referendum that established the socialist constitution of the country in  ' the Workers' Confederation of Cuba was established, through the free and democratic decision of Cuban workers of the time, which, in the following year, became the Central Organization of Cuban Trade Unions. The unity of the workers' movement has been a deciding factor in the history of the independence of the Cuban nation: first, in the fight against Spanish colonialism, subsequently, in the confrontation with North American neo-colonialism and, since , in defence of the Government, which, for the first time in the long history of the country, is exercised by Cuban workers.
.Following the triumph of the Cuban revolution, impostor trade union officials arrived and endeavoured to impose the Batista dictatorship. The strategic objective was to divide the Cuban trade union movement in order to destroy worker power in Cuba. This clearly subversive activity benefited from numerous resources flowing from official North American funds. There were those who tried to cover up their subversive activities",-1,2003,Cuba
27,"against the constitutional order freely given by Cuban workers by taking the guise of trade union officials, no less.
.Neither the Labour Code in force, nor complementary legislation, establish prerequisites or conditions for the establishment of trade unions. All Cuban workers have the right freely to join trade unions and to establish trade union organizations without need for prior authorization. All trade unions and the Central Organization of Cuban Trade Unions are fully independent of the Government, the employers and any other commitment that is not the defence of the interests of their worker members. The Government cannot interfere in their activities. They draw up and approve their statutes and regulations, adopt the structure of their organizations, their methods and ways of working, according to their interests, without any control, supervision or interference from any government or party department or employee. The workers belonging to each union nominate and elect their trade union officials at the various levels, from grass-roots workers' assemblies to the regularly held congresses, with the greatest respect for the most strict trade union democracy. Trade union representatives are democratically elected by the workers, they take part with broad powers in the management councils where decisions are taken that affect them, and this both at the basic enterprise level and at the level of the bodies and institutions of the central state administration itself.
.It is totally incorrect for the ICFTU to allege that there are no collective labour agreements in Cuba. These are agreed individually in all labour centres of the country, in accordance with the laws and regulations of the ILO, the practical application of which has been communicated in the framework of the reports on Convention No. . The Labour Code lays down the necessary guarantees for the full exercise of trade union activity in all labour centres of the country and for the broadest participation of workers and their representatives in the adoption of decisions that affect their widest interests.
.The right to strike is not prohibited in Cuban legislation. However, with the institutionalization of state power in which workers have a decisive influence in the executive, legislative and judicial functions, the exercise of the right to strike has not been necessary. Moreover, this has been possible, thanks to the effective development and implementation of a number of mechanisms to resolve labour disputes, in which trade union representatives have a broad capacity and mandate to speak and to vote. If, at any time, Cuban workers decided to have recourse to strike action, nothing would prevent them from exercising this right.
.Worker participation takes place in a normal and institutionalized manner. The effective and direct participation in the distribution and enjoyment of the wealth created by labour has enhanced the focus on collaboration and not on conflict. Cuban workers, collective owners of the basic means of production of the country, are aware that the resources of the country and the wealth that they create will not go to swell private, national or foreign bank accounts. They take part in social dialogue that is participatory and democratic, which enables them every day to better their working and living conditions, in spite of the impact of the blockade against Cuba.
.The Labour Code is regularly revised and improved from proposals received by the trade union representatives themselves. The most recent proposals for the revision of the Labour Code are currently being analysed and revised. The draft has been submitted to the trade unions and the Central Organization of Cuban Trade Unions for consultation. The latter, at its XVIIIth Congress, agreed to take the draft to the workers for consultation via meetings in labour centres where comments and proposals will be collected for the trade unions to discuss with government representatives. The changes to the Labour Code are not a  government promise' as stated by the ICFTU, neither is this an intellectual exercise in legal technique. This is a democratic and participatory process. The need to change the Labour Code arises out of the change in socio-economic conditions in which the productive activity of the country takes place. The Labour Code needs to reflect these realities and must provide a solution to the problems arising out of development. ILO technical cooperation activities are being implemented in the country. As can be seen, the Cuban Government fully respects the right of workers to be consulted with regard to the new Labour Code.
.Those people identified by the ICFTU as alleged  independent trade union members' are neither trade union members nor independent. These people have been recruited by the United States Interests Section in Havana to carry out subversive activities against the constitutional order established by the workers of Cuba. Their wages are paid by a foreign power, which is carrying out a policy that is hostile to the Cuban population and Cuban workers, from whose territory they carried out numerous attacks and terrorist activities with impunity that have cost the lives or have caused the permanent mutilation of almost , Cuban workers.
.These people have no labour link with any of the Cuban workers' collectives. They receive large amounts of money from the Government of the United States, which allows them to live without working, betraying the most valuable interests of Cuban workers.
.In recent months, in particular, the people mentioned by the ICFTU, following instructions from the United States Interests Section in Havana, have intensified their subversive activities in order to force provocation which serves to justify direct military aggression.
.The Helms-Burton Act, approved in  in clear violation of international law, among other issues, openly encourages the creation of and provides financial assistance to groups and individuals who carry out activities against Cuban constitutional order. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID), in accordance with this and other anti-Cuban laws, is used to channel funds for subversive activities in Cuba. In the year  alone, this agency allocated US$,, to this. This figure has reached US$ million in the past three years.
.Organizations of Cuban origin located in southern Florida, supported and protected by the United States Government, promote, finance and implement with impunity terrorist activities against the country, which have caused enormous human and material damage to workers. These activities include pressure and threats against foreign investors not to invest in Cuba to the detriment of economic development and the creation of employment in the country. In the face of the lack of support from among the Cuban people, the major priority has been to fabricate provocation that will encourage direct military attack by the United States against the island.
.In , Cuba, with as much right as any other country, and with more reason as the country that is assaulted and directly affected by the hostile policy of the United States, adopted Law No. , entitled  Law of Protection of National Independence and Cuban Economy'  This Law provides, among other issues:Article .. Those who seek information to be used in applying the Helms-Burton Law, the blockade and the economic war against our people, aimed at destroying internal order, destabilizing the country and to destroy the socialist state and the independence of Cuba, will be imprisoned.
.None of the charges attributed to any of those people identified by the ICFTU bears any relation to the right to establish trade unions or any other field of activity of the ILO. All the people mentioned were judged and sentenced with all guarantees of due process for their activities in the service of a foreign power that maintains a hostile policy towards Cuban workers.
.In the cases mentioned in the report of the ICFTU, summary or expedited proceedings were used in full accordance with the legislation in force and from the gravity of the crimes committed. This establishes the power of the President of the Supreme Court to shorten the period for enforcement of a sentence; this places no limitations on the guarantees of due process. This proceeding exists in the legislation of more than  countries throughout the world. In Cuba, the law on rules of legal procedure in criminal cases dates from ; it was enforced as the law on procedure up until , at which point new regulations were adopted that drew largely on this.
.All the defendants were aware of the charges being brought against them and had the opportunity to refute all that they considered relevant before the sentenced was passed. They were charged before the proceedings opened and they were given the opportunity, as are all those in Cuba, of presenting their explanations, considerations, opinions or any other element of interest relating to the charge.
.All the defendants exercised their right to professional representation by counsel for the defence who, according to Cuban legislation, can be chosen by the defendant or, failing that, by the court. Fifty-four defence counsel took part in the  proceedings. Of the  defence counsel,  ( per cent) were chosen by the defendants; ten were court?appointed lawyers.
.All the defendants exercised their right to have their hearing heard by already established courts. No special ' ad hoc",-1,2003,Cuba
28,"' court was established to try them. Their proceedings took place in the relevant provincial courts, according to Cuban law; they were tried by judges who had been nominated prior to charges being laid, judges who already existed and worked in those courts. No emergency judges were nominated, nor were special tribunals set up.
.All the defendants exercised their right to be heard by pre-existing courts and judges for their hearings; there was a hearing at which the defendant appeared, where he/she exercised the right to intervene to the end, where he/she replied to questions by the counsels for defence and prosecution, where witnesses and experts were called and heard, and were questioned by the counsel for the defence.
.There was a hearing because the law does not allow a court to make a decision without a hearing, in which, if the defendant pleads guilty or agreement is reached, a sentence can be handed down. In Cuba, hearings are compulsory. Nobody is judged through documentation or without having their opinions and statements and those of their lawyers heard. The hearings were also public. An average of  people took part in each hearing. In total, almost , people took part in  hearings, basically relations, as well as witnesses, experts and, on average, around  people per hearing.
.All the defendants and their lawyers exercised their right to present proof in their favour that, as well as the proof presented by the police, was taken into account by the Prosecutor s Office. Each defendant was able to present witnesses. The counsel for the defence presented  witnesses who had not previously been called by the Prosecutor s Office, of whom , the large majority, were authorized by the courts to stand as witnesses. The counsel for the defence had prior access to the file of the charge.
.Those who were sentenced have the right to appeal these sentences in a higher court than that in which they were sentenced, in this case the Supreme Court, and Cuban legislation respects that right scrupulously.
.The Government states that it has been most transparent and meticulous with regard to the physical security and the physical and moral integrity of each of the defendants at all stages of the process. There is not the least bit of evidence, the least suspicion, of coercion, pressure or threat, much less blackmail.
.The Government has the duty and the right to defend the independence of its people, using the legal means established in the country, within strict respect of national laws and ratified international instruments.
.The right to a legitimate defence is laid down in the United Nations Charter. Cuba continues to be assaulted by the United States on economic, political and propaganda levels. The person who collaborates with these aims is committing a serious crime. In the cases mentioned, there is the aggravating factor of having carried out these activities for money provided by the power that maintains a hostile and aggressive policy against the Cuban nation.
.The people mentioned by the ICFTU, as has been stated, were not detained or sentenced for being trade union members. To cite only one example, in the proceedings for Oscar Espinosa Chepe, false trade union official of the non-existent CUTC, irrefutable proof was submitted that from January  up until January , over just one year, he received from abroad US$, for his subversive activities. In his case, US$, was found in the lining of a suit, apart from the US$, he received during the year. This person has had no known labour connection for approximately ten years.
.The people mentioned were judged and punished for facts and behaviour that are typified in the legislation as crimes, with extensive proof, evidence from experts and witnesses and with procedural guarantees, the protection of criminal procedure Law No.  of  and article  of the Cuban Criminal Code, Law No.  of , which came in turn from the Spanish Criminal Code.
.This article has been part of Cuban criminal legislation since the time when Cuba was a Spanish colony and it appears almost verbatim in the criminal codes of other countries. It lays down:  Actions aimed at undermining the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the State. Any person who executes an action in the interest of a foreign State with a purpose of harming the independence of the Cuban State or the integrity of its territory shall incur a sentence of ten to  years of denial of liberty or death.' This clause has existed as such since the  Social Defence Code in Cuba, which came in its turn from the Spanish code.
.The Government states that from the comprehensive information that it has presented to the Committee on Freedom of Association, this body will be in a position to conclude its examination of Case No. .
.In its communication of  June , the Government reiterated that none of those detained, and mentioned by the ICFTU in its report, were deprived of their liberty or sentenced because they were trade union members, as none of them were carrying out trade union activities in any labour centre in the country. In fact, not one of them has any labour links because they have been expelled or removed from their workplaces. Far from defending the interests of Cuban workers, they unconditionally support the blockade.
.These people were judged and sentenced by competent courts for facts and behaviour typified in the laws of the country as crimes, with comprehensive material proofs, evidence from experts and witnesses. The proceedings against them fulfilled all criteria for guarantees of due process, which in Cuba are fully compatible with international norms in force on this subject. It states, moreover, that it has been most transparent and meticulous with regard to the physical and moral security of each one of the defendants at all stages of the proceedings and that there is not the least evidence or suspicion of coercion, pressure or threats.
.These activities were carried out in the legitimate exercise of the right of free will of the country and in defence of its national security. It reiterates that none of the charges laid against any of those people mentioned by the ICFTU bears any relation to the right of association or any other right that falls within the responsibility of the ILO.
.In addition to what has been previously stated, the Government states that in the searches carried out in the homes of those who were sentenced, documents, money, materials and means were confiscated that have no relationship to any trade union activity but are used in conspiracy activities to subvert Cuban constitutional order. The detention, household searches, confiscation of resources and materials, as well as the proceedings against each one of these people were carried out strictly within the law, as has always been done for this type of proceeding in the country.
.The claim in the report on Vctor Manuel Domnguez Garca is not true, as no type of legal or any other action has been carried out against this person.
.All the defendants made use of defence counsel services, and defence counsel had access to the documents that contained the prosecution files before the hearing, among other established procedural guarantees. All recognized the charges laid, duly signing their declarations before the acting body for judicial hearing. The charges were duly proven in the hearings, which were held on  and  April .
.None of the people mentioned had been elected  trade union official' by any collective labour body. All of them had a standard of living above the Cuban average and other incidental expenses without working. They received frequent supplies of cash and materials to carry out illegal and hostile activities against the established constitutional order.
.The inappropriately named  Single Council of Cuban Workers' (CUTC), and the other factions calling themselves  trade unions' and which only exist on the payroll of the United States Interests Section in Havana, far from defending the interests of Cuban workers, carried out activities in unconditional support for the economic, commercial and financial blockade criticized in successive resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly.
.The purported foreign representative of the non-existent  CUTC' is Ren Laureano Daz Gonzles, a resident of Miami, and President of the so-called  Trade Union Federation of Electric, Gas and Water Plant of Cuba in Exile'  who, before leaving the country, was directly involved in an explosives attack carried out in  against the Thermoelectric Power Station in Tallapiedra, Havana. He has taken part in a number of other terrorist activities against Cuban workers. He has personally funded and directed various terrorist organizations such as the  Rebel Army in Exile'  the  Comandos Elctricos' and the  Comandos Mambises'  Through the previously mentioned organizations, he has attempted to introduce false currency in Cuban territory to sabotage the economy and to recruit activists whom he has trained in carrying out acts of sabotage against the national electricity and energy system and assassination attempts on the life of the Cuban Head of",-1,2003,Cuba
29,"State.
.The Government also provides further information on the people mentioned in the complaint:' Pedro Pablo Alvarez Ramos, detained on  March , prosecuted under preliminary investigation file No. /, with a prosecution request for life imprisonment, based on article  of the Criminal Code, for  acts against the territorial independence or integrity of the State'  He was sentenced by the appropriate court to  years' imprisonment. The CUTC referred to, an illusory and non-existent organization, over which Mr. Alvarez was the self-styled president, has the singular characteristic that it does not form a group of workers. He does not work and he supports himself on financing received from terrorist organizations in Miami and from the Government of the United States. In spite of his known activities in conspiring against and subverting Cuban constitutional order, which includes public support for the blockade, he has close links with the illegal activities of the abovementioned terrorist Ren Laureano Daz Gonzles.' Oscar Espinosa Chepe, detained on  March , prosecuted under preliminary investigation file No. /, with a prosecution request for  years' imprisonment, based on Law No.  (already explained in the initial communication sent on  May ). This demand was upheld by the appropriate court. Mr. Chepe is a self-styled member of the national executive committee of the non-existent CUTC. Through Pedro Pablo Alvarez Ramos, he has similar links with the terrorist organizations of Cuban origin in Miami and with United States federal agencies, the intelligence services, among others. He is paid to fabricate false information against the Cuban political system and economy. He has actively worked to prevent foreign investment in Cuba. He took part in a number of meetings with employees from the United States Interests Section in Cuba from whom he received money and instructions for conspiring against Cuban constitutional order.' Carmelo Agustn Daz Fernndez, detained on  March , prosecuted under preliminary investigation file No. /, with a prosecution request for  years' imprisonment, based on article  of the Criminal Code for  acts against the territorial independence or integrity of the State'  and sentenced by the appropriate court to  years' imprisonment. He is the self-styled official of the non-existent  Independent Trade Union Press Agency'  His activities, ordered and financed by the United States Government, include fabrication and dissemination of false news, inciting public disorder and direct action, using any means possible, against the constitutional order of the country. Previously, he was expelled from another faction for taking, for his own personal ends, funds received by the faction, taking advantage of his position of  treasurer' in this faction. He has been employed by the purportedly named  Radio Mart' (a subversive service against Cuba of the official radio programme Voice of America) and by  Voice of the Foundation'  a peripheral service of the terrorist Cuban-American National Foundation. He has also maintained permanent links with employees of the United States Interests Section in Cuba, who have entrusted him with a number of subversive activities against Cuban constitutional order and the search for information relating to Cuban national security.' Hctor Ral Valle Hernndez, detained on  March , prosecuted under preliminary investigation file No. /, with a prosecution request for  years' imprisonment, based on article  of the Criminal Code for  acts against the territorial independence or integrity of the State'  and sentenced by the appropriate court to  years' imprisonment. He has a comprehensive history of anti-social behaviour and is involved in illegal activities such as the trafficking and sale of dollars and the illegal resale of products stolen from businesses in the country. All the activities that he has carried out have been aimed at justifying his inclusion in the  political refugees' programme established by the United States Interests Section in Cuba. His priority is to obtain a visa, by this means, to emigrate to the United States. He was involved in attempts to leave Cuba illegally in , , ,  and ; on the most recent occasion, he was returned by American coast guards. He received money for his purported function of  vice-president' of the non-existent  Confederation of Democratic Workers of Cuba'  He had links with terrorist organizations located outside of Cuba, such as the so-called  Free Homeland Foundation' and the  Democratic Party  November, Frank Pas' from which he received funding to recruit  new people' for subversive activities in Cuba and the organization of activities against the constitutional order.' Ivn Hernndez Carrillo, detained on  March , prosecuted under preliminary investigation file No. /, with a prosecution request for  years' imprisonment, based on Law No. , and sentenced by the appropriate tribunal to  years' imprisonment. He has a comprehensive record of anti-social activities. It is not known whether he has ever worked. He lived on payments from terrorist groups of Cuban origin in Miami and from the United States Government for his subversive activities against Cuban constitutional order. He was warned on a number of occasions, in accordance with Cuban legislation, by the appropriate authorities, with regard to his participation and organization of illegal and damaging activities against constitutional order, including a number of activities against public order. In , a file in the preliminary stages was opened on him for illegal activities in the service of the United States Interests Section in Havana. He has maintained systematic links with the United States Interests Section, from which he received funding to carry out subversive activities against the constitutional order of the country.' Miguel Galvn Gutirrez, detained on  March , prosecuted under preliminary investigation file No. /, with a prosecution request for life imprisonment, based on article  of the Criminal Code for  acts against the territorial independence or integrity of the State'  and sentenced by the appropriate court to  years' imprisonment. He worked for false information agencies created and financed by the Central Intelligence Agency, with the aim of disseminating false information about Cuban life. He swindled a number of people, to whom he offered  guarantees' that their requests to emigrate to the United States would be accepted in exchange for which he would use their signatures to support counter-revolutionary plans to subvert Cuban constitutional order, accepted in a referendum by more than  per cent of the Cuban population. He has regular links with members of terrorist organizations based in Miami and with employees of the United States Interests Section in Havana, from whom he received subversive materials, equipment and funding to carry out activities against the Government.' Nelson Molinet Espino, tried for an assassination attempt against a public official, under accusation No. /, preliminary investigation file No. /. He did not work. As the so-called secretary of the non-existent CTDC, which groups together a small number of people who have no labour links, he organized unrelated activities that had no bearing on protecting the rights of workers and that, on the contrary, were a threat to the physical security and integrity of Cuban workers. Among these should be mentioned support for aggressive raids on Cuban sovereign territory carried out by sea and by air by terrorist groups from Miami. He carried out a number of activities aimed at increasing the negative impact of the blockade. He maintained regular links with the United States Interests Section in Havana, from which he received materials and instructions for his subversive activities. He was detained on  March , with a prosecution request for  years' imprisonment, under article  of the Criminal Code, preliminary investigation file No. /. He was sentenced by the appropriate court.' Vctor Manuel Domnguez. The claim in the report is false as he enjoyed freedom of movement and activity and was not the subject of any type of legal proceedings or administrative proceedings of any other kind.
.The Government states that, as can be seen, the abovementioned people are not trade union members. They took instructions from the United States Interests Section in Havana. All of them supported the United States Government blockade against the Cuban people. They were all responsible for carrying out activities to promote and to justify military aggression against the Cuban people. The Committee on Freedom of Association should take into consideration that these were not trade union members carrying out their legitimate right to action to protect the interests of workers. Much less were they tried for activities defending workers. The Government believes that this information will be sufficient for any objective and impartial body to consider closed any examination of a communication based on false arguments, as is the case with the complaint against Cuba by the ICFTU, which has given rise to Case No. . The Government reiterates its full commitment to freedom of association and protection of the rights of workers. The Government will continue to refute false complaints put forward by false trade union officials against the great process of social transformation undertaken by Cuban workers.",-1,2003,Cuba
30,"The Government is always ready to cooperate with the Committee on Freedom of Association of the ILO as it carries out its mandate.
.The Committee notes that in the present complaint the complainant organizations have presented allegations referring to the following issues:The authorities recognize only one trade union central controlled by the State and by the Communist Party and prohibit independent trade unions, which have to carry out their activities in a very hostile environment; non-existence of collective bargaining; non-recognition of the right to strike; arrest and harassment of trade union members, threats of criminal penalties; physical violence, unlawful entry, trials and sentencing of trade union officials to long prison terms; confiscation of trade union property and infiltration of state agents into the independent trade union movement.The authorities recognize only one trade union centralcontrolled by the State and by the Communist Partyand prohibit independent trade unions, which haveto carry out their activities in a very hostile environment
.The Committee notes the Government s statements with regard to the allegations and, in particular, the Government s statement: () that the single trade union central in existence (that currently brings together  national trade unions, , trade union offices with , territorial trade union officials and , grass-roots trade union branches with , trade union officials) has not been imposed by the Government, is exclusively the result of the sovereign will of the workers, and dates back to before the revolution as it was established in  as the Workers' Confederation of Cuba which became, in the following year, the Central Organization of Cuban Trade Unions (CTC); () neither the Labour Code in force in Cuba, nor complementary legislation, lays down requirements or conditions for the establishment of trade unions; all Cuban workers have the right freely to join a trade union and to establish trade union organizations, without need for prior authorization; () the trade unions and the CTC are fully independent of the Government (which cannot interfere in their activities), employers and any other commitment that is not the protection of their worker members; () workers belonging to each trade union draw up and approve their statutes and regulations, adopt the structure of their organizations, their methods and ways of working, according to their interests, without any control, supervision or interference from any public official, government department or political party; they nominate and elect their trade union officials at the various levels, with absolute respect for the most strict trade union democracy; () the trade representatives democratically elected by the workers take part with broad powers in the management councils where decisions are taken that affect them, and this both at the basic enterprise level and at the level of the bodies and institutions of the central state administration.
.With regard to these allegations, the Committee is bound to take into account that in Cuba there is only one officially recognized trade union central that is mentioned in the legislation. On a number of previous occasions it has received complaints concerning the non-recognition of trade union organizations other than the officially recognized existing trade union structure, in particular, from the Confederation of Democratic Workers of Cuba (CTDC) (Case No. ) and from the Single Council of Cuban Workers (CUTC). (Case No. ), also mentioned in the present case. The Committee stresses that when national legislation designates a particular trade union or employers' organization for recognition it violates the intent and provisions of Conventions Nos.  and .
.In this respect, the Committee notes that in its last report adopted in , the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations referred to the need to remove from the Labour Code of  the reference to  Confederation of Workers'  The Committee emphasizes that trade union pluralism must remain possible in all cases and that the law should not institutionalize a de facto monopoly; even in a situation where at some point all workers have preferred to unify the trade union movement, they should still remain free to choose to set up unions outside the established structures should they so wish. The Committee stresses that when national legislation designates a particular trade union or employers' organization for recognition it violates the intent and provisions of Conventions Nos.  and .
.In these circumstances, the Committee emphasizes that in accordance with Convention No. , ratified by Cuba, workers should have the right to establish in full freedom the organizations that they consider necessary independently of whether they support or not the social and economic model of the Government, including the political model of the country, and that it is for these organizations to decide whether they shall receive funding for legitimate activities to promote and defend human rights and trade union rights. All trade union options that do not resort to violence should be able to exist and to express their views. Noting that the proposals for revision of the Labour Code are being studied, the Committee asks the Government to adopt without delay new provisions and measures to recognize fully in law and in practice the right of workers to establish the organizations that they consider necessary at all levels, and the right of these organizations freely to organize their activities. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.The Committee also notes the Government s statement that the CUTC is an illusory and non-existent organization that does not group together workers but rather a small number of people who do not work, and that it maintains itself by funding received from abroad. According to the Government, the so-called  Single Council of Cuban Workers' (CUTC) and the other factions that call themselves  trade unions' do not protect the interests of Cuban workers and support unconditionally the economic, commercial and financial blockade imposed against the Cuban people.
.The Committee also notes that according to the Government the foreign representative of the non-existent  CUTC' is the president of what is known as the  Trade Union Federation of Electric, Gas and Water Plant of Cuba in Exile' who, before leaving the country, was directly involved in an explosives attack carried out in  against the Thermoelectric Power Station in Tallapiedra, Havana, and has taken part in a number of other terrorist activities against Cuban workers.
.In this respect, the Committee must recall that, according to the ILO,  the term  organization' means any organization of workers or of employers for furthering and defending the interests of workers or of employers'  As the Committee has already indicated in its examination of Case No.  [see th Report, paras. -], the CUTC is affiliated to the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) and to the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), international trade union organizations, and it requested registration from the Ministry of Justice in . The Committee requests the complainant organizations to send a copy of the statutes of each of the organizations mentioned in the complaint (CUTC, CONIC and CTDC), so that it might examine this aspect of the case in full knowledge of the facts.Non-existence of collective bargaining
.The Committee notes the Government s statement that: () the allegation by the ICFTU that there are no collective labour agreements in Cuba is completely untrue. These are agreed on an individual basis in each of the labour centres of the country, in accordance with laws and regulations of the ILO, the practical application of which has been communicated in the framework of the reports on Convention No. ; and () the Labour Code establishes the necessary guarantees for the full exercise of trade union activity in all labour centres of the country and for the broadest participation of workers and their representatives in the adoption of decisions that affect their widest interests.
.The Committee requests the Government to provide detailed information on the various collective agreements signed in recent years (the parties to the agreements, the subject matter of the agreements, the number of workers covered in the private sector and in the public sector).Non-recognition of the right to strike
.The Committee notes the Government s statement that the right to strike is not prohibited in Cuban legislation; however, with the institutionalization of state power, in which workers have a decisive influence in the executive, legislative and judicial functions, the exercise of this right has been unnecessary. According to the Government, this has also been possible due to the effective development and implementation of a number of mechanisms for resolving labour disputes, in which trade union representatives have a broad capacity and mandate to speak and to vote. The Government emphasizes that, should Cuban workers decide to resort to strike action, nothing prevents them from exercising this right.
.In this respect, the Committee recalls that  it has always recognized the right to strike by workers and their organizations as a legitimate means of defending their economic and social interests [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. ]. The Committee requests the Government to take",-1,2003,Cuba
31,"measures to ensure the effective recognition of the right to strike and guarantee that no one will be discriminated against or suffer prejudice in their employment as a result of the peaceful exercise of the right to strike. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.Detention of trade union members; physical violence, trialsand sentencing of trade union officials to long prison terms
.The Committee notes with deep concern the allegations relating to the detention and the extremely harsh sentencing of trade union officials of CUTC, CONIC and CTDC. The Committee highlights, in particular, that the complainant organizations confirm that these people are trade union members. The allegations of the ICFTU, CLAT and WCL cover the following sentences: sentences of  to  years' imprisonment for trade union members Pedro Pablo Alvarez Ramos ( years, according to the Government), Carmelo Diaz Fernndez ( years, according to the Government), Miguel Galvn ( years, according to the Government), Hctor Ral Valle Hernndez ( years, according to the Government), Oscar Espinosa Chepe ( years, according to the Government) and Nelson Molinet Espino ( years, according to the Government); according to the ICFTU, there is also a prosecution request for  years' imprisonment for Ivn Hernndez Carillo (the Government states that he was sentenced to  years' imprisonment), who, moreover, has been beaten.
.The Committee also notes the Government s statements that none of the people mentioned by the ICFTU were trade union members, nor were they tried, deprived of their freedom or sentenced for being trade union members or for carrying out trade union activities in defence of workers; none of them carried out trade union activities at their labour centre and none of them had any labour links; none of these people had been elected  trade union official' in any centre of the country. The Government states that: () all of these people had a standard of living that was higher than the Cuban average and other incidental expenses without working with money that they received from abroad to carry out activities that were illegal and contrary to constitutional order; () none of the charges against them had any bearing on the right to association or any other area of activity falling under the purview of the ILO; () these people were tried and sentenced by courts for facts and conduct typified as crimes; () the searches of the homes of those who had been sentenced led to the confiscation of documents, money, materials and means that were used in conspiracy activities to subvert Cuban constitutional order; () all of the defendants recognized the charges against them, duly signing their declarations before the judicial body; the charges brought were duly tried in legal hearings.
.With regard to the reasons for the proceedings against those people mentioned in the complaints, the Committee notes the Government s statement that they were tried and sentenced for activities classified as crimes by Cuban legislation, and that the hearings and sentencing of these people were carried out in legitimate exercise of the right of free determination of the country and in defence of its national security; all those sentenced are responsible for carrying out activities aimed at promoting and justifying military aggression and restricting the right to free determination of the Cuban people. According to the Government, the people mentioned were tried and sentenced under the protection of Criminal Procedure Law No.  of  and article  of the Cuban Criminal Code, Law No.  of . Article  lays down:Acts against the territorial independence or integrity of the State. Whoever executes an action in the interest of a foreign State with the purpose of harming the independence of the Cuban State or the integrity of its territory shall incur a sentence of ten to  years of denial of liberty or death.
.The Committee notes the Government s statement that those who were sentenced enjoyed all the guarantees of due process (which it listed) although it acknowledged that this was a summary hearing (on the authority of the President of the Supreme Court) and stated that this in no way limited the guarantees of due process. The Committee notes the Government s statement that the detentions, search of houses and confiscation of resources and means were carried out within the law. The Committee notes the Government s information on detentions and sentencing of specific people referred to as trade union members by the complainant organizations (allegations relating to ) or on the records of these people. According to the cases, they are accused in the Government s reply of the following charges (mostly non-specific): funding by organizations that the Government qualifies as terrorist organizations, providing services to these organizations, subversive and conspiratorial activities, support for the blockade against Cuba, links with intelligence services in a foreign country (accepting money and instructions), fabrication of false information to support the blockade, obstructing foreign investment, acts against the territorial independence or integrity of the State, inciting public disorder, direct activities against constitutional order, links with foreign employees, the search for information relating to Cuban security, records of anti-social behaviour, trafficking and sale of dollars, illegal resale of products stolen from businesses in the country, receiving funding for recruitment of people to carry out subversive activities, activities against public order, being in the service of false information agencies, swindling various people to gain support for counter-revolutionary plans, receiving subversive material and funding for activities against the Government.
.However, the Committee notes that some of the charges or records indicated by the Government are too vague or are not necessarily criminal and can come under the definition of legitimate trade union activities, while the legislation cited by the Government envisages sentences that could include death.
.The Committee must remind the Government that detention and sentencing of trade union officials or members for reasons relating to activities to defend the interests of workers is a serious violation of public freedoms in general and trade union freedoms in particular. Taking into account the various cases presented to the Committee relating to harassment and detention of members of trade union organizations that are independent of the established structure, and also taking into account that the sentencing was handed down in summary hearings of very short duration, the Committee requests the Government to take steps to release immediately the people mentioned in the complaints. The Committee requests the Government to send copies of the criminal sentences handed down against these people and regrets that this has still not taken place in spite of the request to this effect made by the Office on  May  in the framework of the procedure in force.
.Finally, the Committee notes that the Government denies utterly that Vctor Manuel Domnguez Garca, Director of the National Centre for Training, had been the subject of any proceedings against his freedom of movement.Confiscation by the police in March  of books from the CUTC trade union library, a computer, two fax machines, three typewriters and numerous documentation
.The Committee regrets that the Government has made no reply to this allegation and urges it to send its observations without delay.Infiltration of State agents into the independenttrade union movement
.The Committee notes the allegations of the ICFTU, which state that Aleida de las Mercedes Godines, Secretary of CONIC, and Alicia Zamora Labrada, Director of the Trade Union Press Agency Lux Info Press, were two state security agents infiltrated into the independent trade union movement (the former for  years, according to information received from the ICFTU). The Committee notes that the ICFTU has attached a press clipping (Granma of  April ) that confirms these allegations. The Committee notes that the Government has made no reply to these allegations and urges it to send detailed observations in this respect without delay.ICFTU allegations for  and  (threats against trade union members, sentencing of a trade union member to two years in prison, violence against trade union members, detentions, searches of houses, and attempts by the police to prevent a trade union congress)
.The Committee notes with regret that the Government has not given specific replies to the following allegations:
.The Committee urges the Government to send detailed observations on these allegations without delay.
.The Committee urges the Government to accept a direct contacts mission.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee emphasizes that, in accordance with Convention No. , ratified by Cuba, workers should have the right to establish, in full freedom, the organizations that they consider necessary irrespective of whether or not they support the social and economic model of the Government, including the political model of the country, and that it is for these organizations to decide whether they shall receive funding for legitimate activities to promote and defend human rights and trade union rights.(b) Noting that the proposals for revision of the Labour Code are currently being considered, the Committee requests the Government to adopt, without delay, new provisions and measures to recognize fully",-1,2003,Cuba

The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.(f) The Committee is extremely concerned to note the allegations relating to the detention and the extremely harsh sentencing (between  and  years' imprisonment) of trade union officials of CUTC and CTDC.(g) The Committee must remind the Government that the detention and sentencing of trade union officials or members for carrying out activities to defend workers' interests is a serious violation of public freedoms in general and trade union freedoms in particular. The Committee requests the Government to take steps to release immediately the people mentioned in the complaints: Pedro Pablo Alvarez Ramos, Carmelo Daz Fernndez, Miguel Galvn, Hctor Ral Valle Hernndez, Oscar Espinosa Chepe, Nelson Molinet Espino and Ivn Hernndez Carrillo.

33,".At its June  meeting, the Committee made the following conclusions and recommendations on the issues that were still pending [see th Report, paras. -]:' the Committee is bound to note that the Government still refuses to recognize the CUTC, in spite of the fact that more than six years have elapsed since it requested official registration, and requests the Government to ensure that the CUTC can operate freely and that the authorities refrain from any interference such as restricting the organization s fundamental rights;' the Committee highlighted (after having noted that the Government had declared that none of the persons mentioned in the complaint were detained) that the Government had not referred specifically to the detention or arrest of Mr. Sixto Rolando Calero and his wife, Mr. Pedro Pablo Alvarez Ramos (several times), Ms. Gladys Linares Blanco and her husband, Mr. Humberto Mones Lafita, Mr. Carmelo Agustn Daz Fernndez and Mr. Pedro Pablo Hernndez Mijares, all of whom, according to the WCL, were trade union members or leaders, detained in the circumstances described by the complainant (the organization of a trade union congress), or to that of the journalist, Mr. Vctor Rolando Arroyo;' moreover, the Committee notes that the Government failed to reply explicitly to other specific acts allegedly committed by the authorities in order to prevent the national congress of the CUTC from taking place (harassment of CUTC members, threats of arrest, confiscation of documents, pressure to prevent the holding of a press conference, police intimidation through the deployment of state security agents around the site of the press conference);' given the insufficient information provided by the Government, the Committee requests it to provide full information on all the issues raised in this case.
.In its communication of  December , the Government reiterates its previous statements and indicates that, in relation to a request made by a so-called organization named the Single Council of Cuban Workers (CUTC) before the Ministry of Justice, the latter considered that the trial brief did not meet the requirements established by the Associations Act No.  of , and shelved the request, with the explanation that this Act does not provide for the creation of trade unions; furthermore, trade unions do not require prior authorization. As regards the alleged arrests of four citizens who claim to be trade union officials, it was proven that the only one of them remaining in detention in October  (and later released), at the disposal of the courts, was Mr. Pedro Pablo Alvarez, for criminal activities completely unrelated to trade union activities.
.The Government adds that the unity of the Cuban trade union movement is one of the greatest achievements of Cuban workers. Trade union activity is conducted on a daily basis in workplaces, and in all of its decision-making bodies, with the participation of representatives elected by the workers themselves, without interference, arrests, pressure, threats or intimidation, contrary to the WCL s allegations.
.Recent investigations have proven, yet again, that no workplace in the country has any trade union organization corresponding to the name CUTC. It was only possible to access information distributed under this name through foreign broadcasts and Internet services.
.One of the representatives and promoters of the so-called CUTC abroad is Mr. Ren Laureano Daz Gonzlez (who is not mentioned in the complaint), who has been proven responsible for terrorist activities against the Cuban people, amongst others, a dynamite attack against the Tallapiedra Thermoelectric Power Station in the City of Havana. Mr. Laureano devised plans to introduce counterfeit money into Cuba and has been behind acts of sabotage against the Cuban electricity sector which were carried out by members recruited within the country.
.The persons mentioned in the complaint are not known amongst Cuban workers, and neither could they be, simply because they are not involved in any form of employment. These people have not been elected by any body of workers, and they do not represent anyone.
.The Government then provides the following information on the persons mentioned in the complaint:' Mr. Pedro Pablo Alvarez Ramos. Unemployed since . Calls himself the  general secretary' of the non-existent CUTC. This individual enjoys freedom of movement and action, despite the fraudulent nature of his public opinions and statements. He has close and periodic links with agents in Havana defending the interests of a foreign State.' Ms. Gladys Mara Magdalena Linares Blanco. Sixty years of age (five years over the retirement age for women). Unemployed. Has close links with, and receives financing from, Mr. Enrique Blanco, who is a representative in Puerto Rico of the well-known terrorist organization, Independent and Democratic Cuba, for conducting counter-revolutionary activities. Ms. Gladys Linares Blanco, after blatantly and publicly stealing received money, had to be kept away from  trade union business'  following instructions given by agents in Havana defending the interests of a foreign State. The same occurred with Mr. Humberto Mones Lafita.' Mr. Carmelo Agustn Daz Fernndez. Sixty-five years of age (five years over the statutory retirement age for men). He voluntarily terminated his employment in  and calls himself a trade union press reporter. In reality, he carries out activities directed by agents in Havana defending the interests of a foreign State, which pays for the false information invented by this man.' Mr. Vctor Rolando Arroyo Carmona. Unemployed since , when he voluntarily left the Provincial Directorate of Physical Planning of Pinar del Ro, where he worked as a designer. He has close links with the terrorist organization, the Cuban American National Foundation. He is described as a  thief' by his fellow counter-revolutionaries because on repeated occasions he has stolen money sent from abroad for his own personal use. In September , he was accused of abusing minors after beating his wife s son on two occasions, causing after-effects, and threatening another child who was present at the time. On  February , the chief of agents in Havana defending the interests of a foreign State visited him at his home and rewarded his criminal activities with additional funding and  radio receivers with their respective chargers, four batteries, a ground antenna and earphones. Naturally, she also informed him of new activities for consolidating the  virtual trade unionism' that this foreign State is trying to create.' Mr. Sixto Rolando Calero Ramos. Unemployed for health reasons since , when he presented a medical certificate. He was paid his salary in full for the next two years. In , he began to receive  per cent of his usual salary and will continue to do so until November , when he will have to submit a new medical expertise in accordance with labour legislation. He had previously been dismissed from the Ministry of Education, where he worked as a teacher, following criminal acts of a sexual nature against students from the school where he worked. His wife, Ms. Faustina de la Caridad Feijoo Rodrguez, was dismissed from her workplace for stealing and illegally selling construction clothing and materials.' Mr. Pedro Pablo Hernndez Mijares. He is not in Cuba. He left the country in February  heading for the United States.
.The Government points out that trade unionist status should not be given to a list of names before checking whether they really represent a body of workers, or at least not before checking that the labour relationship required for the exercise of legitimate trade union activity exist.
.As part of the various activities being promoted by a foreign State against the Cuban revolution, organizations from this country are being used which are established to create fictitious organizations and imaginary leaders of the opposition, with a view to establishing links with organizations in Europe and North America.
.It has been discovered that the agents in Havana defending the interests of a foreign State have provided more than $, to promote internal tension within our country and generate an artificial climate of alleged violations of trade union rights.
.It is obvious that the phoney trade unionists mentioned in the communication have turned the development of phantom and virtual  trade unionism' into a lucrative business. These persons are not conducting any trade union work and do not have the support of any body of workers from this country.
.As regards the alleged refusal by the authorities to recognize the CUTC, the Committee notes the statements made by the Government and the fact that it completely puts into question the CUTC s representational nature and the election of so-called officials by any body of workers, at the same time as highlighting the counter-revolutionary characteristics of these persons. However, the Committee reminds the Government that during its previous examination of the case it observed that the CUTC was affiliated to CLAT and WCL, which are international trade union organizations, that the annexes to the membership application to the WCL (sent by the complainant) contained more than  signatures of Cuban workers, that the annexes also include a communication sent by the CUTC in  to the Register of Inscriptions of the Ministry of Justice, seeking  to be entered",-1,1998,Cuba
34,"in the corresponding register of inscriptions' and subsequently mentioning four workplaces [see th Report, para. ].
.The Committee observes that at its December  meeting, the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations made an observation on the application of Convention No. , in which it points out the following:
.With regard to trade union monopoly, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, these issues are being examined as part of the Labour Code revision process.Articles ,  and  of the Convention. Regarding the need to delete from the Labour Code of  the reference to the Confederation of Workers, the Committee again emphasizes that trade union pluralism must remain possible in all cases. Accordingly, the law must not institutionalize a de facto monopoly. Even where at some point all workers have preferred to unify the trade union movement, they should still remain free to set up unions outside the established structure, should they so wish (see General Survey of  on freedom of association and collective bargaining, paragraph ).Article  of the Convention. With regard to the need to amend Legislative Decree No.  of , which confers on the Confederation of Workers the monopoly to represent the country s workers on government bodies, the Committee urges the Government to amend this provision in order to ensure trade union pluralism, for instance by replacing the reference to the  Confederation of Workers' by the term  most representative organization' The Committee again expresses the firm hope that the draft revision of the Labour Code will be adopted in the very near future and will take account of the provisions of the Convention. The Committee requests the Government to send the Office a copy of the draft revision.
.Regarding the recommendations of the Committee on Freedom of Association in Case  (see th Report, June ), in which the Government was asked to ensure the recognition of the Single Council of Cuban Workers (CUTC) and to allow the latter full freedom to carry out its legitimate trade union activities without any threats, intimidation or pressure, the Committee notes that the Government reiterates its observations submitted in the framework of Case No.  to the effect that the above organization has not been shown to carry on any union activities and that, consequently, the persons concerned cannot be assigned any union representational duties being neither leaders nor representatives of any group of workers in any entity in the country. The Committee reiterates that the freedom, de facto and de jure, to establish organizations is the foremost among trade union rights and is the essential prerequisite without which the other guarantees enunciated in Conventions Nos.  and  would remain a dead letter (see General Survey, op. cit., paragraph ). The Committee hopes that the necessary measures will be taken to ensure that all workers enjoy this right both in law and in practice.
.The Committee shares the opinion of the Committee of Experts and requests the Government to take measures so that national legislation and practice are brought into line with Convention No. .
.As regards the alleged arrests of CUTC trade unionists (who were later released), the Committee notes that, according to the Government, Mr. Pedro Pablo Alvarez was detained and put at the disposal of the courts on the grounds of criminal activities and later released. The Committee observes that the Government has not explained the nature of the criminal activities carried out by this person. Neither has it indicated the charges for which the seven other unionists (who were later released) were arrested in relation to the allegations made in the complaint (in its reply, the Government refers to other circumstances and events).
.The Committee requests the Government in the future to respect the principle according to which  The detention of trade union leaders or members for reasons connected with their activities in defence of the interests of workers constitutes a serious interference with civil liberties in general and with trade union rights in particular' [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, , para. ].
.Lastly, as regards the allegations concerning the harassment of CUTC members, threats of arrest, the confiscation of documents, pressure to prevent a press conference from taking place, and police intimidation at the site of this press conference, the Committee observes that the Government has not specifically referred to these allegations. In this regard, the Committee is therefore bound to deplore these threats and acts of intimidation which, together with the other problems observed in the present case, demonstrate that the exercise of trade union rights of organizations independent of the official union structure, is extremely difficult, if not impossible. Therefore, the Committee highlights that  the right to express opinions through the press or otherwise is an essential aspect of trade union rights' and that  the right of an employers' or workers' organization to express its opinion uncensored through the independent press should in no way differ from the right to express opinions in exclusively occupational or trade union journals' [see Digest, op. cit., paras.  and ]. The Committee requests the Government to ensure that these principles are respected.
.As part of the follow-up to the recommendations in this case, which was presented by the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), in a communication dated  December  the WCL presented new specific allegations concerning detentions of journalists and members of the Single Council of Cuban Workers (CUTC), obstruction of the functioning and activities of the latter organization (holding of a congress), attacks on freedom of expression, intimidation and threats. The Government replied in general terms to these allegations in a communication dated  September . At its November  meeting, the Committee requested the Government to reply specifically to each of the allegations presented by the WCL [see th Report, paras. -].
.The WCL indicates in its communication of  December  that, in previous communications to the Committee on Freedom of Association, it has described the restrictions placed by the Government on freedom of association in Cuba, consisting of repeated acts of harassment, detention and blacklisting, and in particular the fact that there are no independent unions in Cuba and no freedom of association outside the official trade union established by the Government. Furthermore, it has repeatedly drawn attention to the systematic harassment and persecution of CUTC leaders, in their legitimate exercise of trade union activities.
.The WCL adds that the Single Council of Cuban Workers (CUTC) -- affiliated to the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) -- set the dates for a congress to be held on  and  October  and began to make the relevant preparations during the first week of August . The Department of State Security (DSE) renewed its harassment of CUTC members, with a view to preventing a second preparatory meeting, due to be held on  August, from taking place. Some leaders were detained, while some remained under house arrest and others were intercepted as they reached the meeting place and forced to go back to their homes under threat of arrest. Despite these acts of repression and interference in trade union activities, the CUTC confirmed that its congress would go ahead on  and  October. For example, in October, Mr. Sixto Rolando Calero (delegate for Camagey Province) and his wife were detained and their documents confiscated, in a police operation ordered by the chief state security official in Esmeralda District.
.According to the WCL, the CUTC planned to organize a press conference at  a.m. on Friday,  October , with a view to giving public notice of its intention to hold a congress. Before it took place, early in the morning of  October, state security agents arrested Mr. Pedro Pablo Alvarez Ramos, general secretary of the CUTC, as he was leaving home. He was later released in the evening of the same day. While he was under arrest, security agents attempted to coerce him into abandoning both the plans to hold a press conference on the following day, and the preparations for the congress. On the morning of  October, Mr. Pedro Pablo Alvarez Ramos and his colleagues travelled to the place where the press conference was due to be held at  a.m. ( calle San Francisco, between  and  October,  de Octubre District, Havana Province), but found it completely surrounded by state security agents. Once again, Mr. Pedro Pablo Alvarez Ramos was arrested, detained by security agents and taken to Detention Centre No.  in the same district. The security forces also confiscated the trade union documents he was carrying with him, as well as a Cuban flag. On the same morning of  October, Ms. Gladys Linares Blanco, another leading CUTC official, and her husband, Mr. Humberto Mones Lafita, the owners of the house in which the press conference was due to take place, were arrested. Another of the CUTC leaders detained during this wave of repression was Mr. Carmelo Agustn Das Fernndez,",-1,1998,Cuba
35,"who was also a representative of the independent press intending to cover the conference. Numerous journalists from the independent press on their way to attend the press conference were stopped by security agents and forced to turn back. For instance, in Gines, Mr. Pedro Pablo Hernndez Mijares and Mr. Vctor Rolando Arroyo (a well-known independent journalist from Pinar del Ro) were detained as they travelled to the capital. During their detention, they were beaten and subsequently taken to the western province of Pinar del Ro. Eventually, they were released and abandoned at the roadside between Guanajay and Artemisa.
.On Friday night, all of the CUTC leaders detained at Detention Centre No. , in Havana, were released, except for Mr. Pedro Pablo Alvarez Ramos. According to information received by the WCL, Mr. Pedro Pablo Alvarez Ramos was arrested under Order No. - for resisting arrest. However, Mr. Pedro Pablo Alvarez Ramos offered no resistance to the security forces on either of the occasions he was arrested, despite the fact that the arrests constituted clear violations of his most basic human rights. He was singled out simply because he was trying to organize, by peaceful means, a trade union congress, official notice of which had already been given to the authorities.
.In its communication of  September , the Government, with regard to the alleged detention of various persons carrying out trade union activities referred to in the complaint, states that inquiries have shown that none of the persons mentioned in the document are in prison, and that all of them are living comfortably at home, undisturbed by the ""security forces"", as the WCL alleges. The persons concerned are described by the WCL as ""leaders or unionists"". Yet the Government points out that this supposed trade union organization has never proven its involvement in any union activity, in any recognized workplace. In the absence of a labour relations framework, it is impossible to describe the persons concerned as union representatives, given that they neither represent nor lead any body of workers in any of the recognized workplaces throughout the country. In Cuba,  per cent of the workforce are affiliated to central trade union organizations which group together  national sectoral unions. In response to the doubts cast by the WCL on the freedom of workers to establish trade unions of their own choosing, there are  national sectoral trade unions in Cuba, all freely established by the workers, which were neither imposed by law, nor introduced by force, pressure, repression or violence from the public authorities.
.This mass, widespread trade union activity takes place without any interference, repression or coercion. Thus, public freedoms are recognized, protected and exercised in accordance with the law.
.Article  of the Labour Code establishes ""the right of workers to meet, discuss and freely express their views on all issues or matters affecting them"".
.Responding to the allegations concerning freedom of expression, the Government states that the aforementioned trade union activity presents a wide range of channels for the exercise of freedom of expression by workers and their legitimate leaders in all trade union, business and administrative structures -- channels that are recognized and protected by the Constitution and the Labour Code.
.The ILO monitoring bodies have repeatedly stated the importance of assessing the practical application of ratified Conventions, therefore it would be inappropriate for the Committee to ignore the reality and practical application of trade union rights in Cuba, by focusing solely on cases derived from the unreliable testimony of individuals who have flouted the law and have no connection with genuine trade union activity in the country.
.In its communication of  February , the Government further states that the persons named in the communication from the WCL have failed to prove their involvement in any trade union activity. In the absence of a labour relations framework, it is impossible to describe the persons concerned as union representatives, given that they neither represent nor lead any body of workers in any of the recognized workplaces throughout the country.
.The allegation presented by the WCL that trade unions in Cuba were founded by the Government is false; the WCL ignores the fact that, following a long process of unification dating back to the nineteenth century, the Central Organization of Cuban Workers was established in  by the workers themselves, rather than being imposed by law. It was subsequently endorsed by all trade union congresses. There is no climate of violence, pressure or intimidation in Cuba, as is demonstrated by the workers' participation in the aforementioned trade union activities, and by the rate of union membership, which stands at  per cent. The arrest of unionists or trade union leaders does not occur. In Cuba  per cent of the workforce are members of trade unions of their own choosing. The right to form or to join trade unions freely and without prior authorization is guaranteed by article  of the Labour Code. Allegations concerning acts of violence or the existence of blacklists such as those presented by the WCL are totally false; in fact, the persons referred to by the WCL are attempting to use the argument of their supposed union membership in order to flout the law. These individuals do not represent any body of workers, have not been elected in any workplace, and have failed to furnish proof, at any time during the examination of the case by the Committee on Freedom of Association, of their involvement in trade union activities.
.The Committee notes that, according to the Government, none of the persons referred to in the complaint are in prison. The Committee further notes that the Government contends that the persons concerned have failed to prove their involvement in any trade union activity, questions their status as ""leaders or trade unionists"", describes the CUTC as a ""supposed"" trade union organization and asserts that these persons neither represent nor lead any body of workers, and have failed to furnish proof of their involvement in trade union activities. In this regard, the Committee stresses that the CUTC is affiliated to CLAT and WCL, international trade union organizations, that over  signatures of Cuban workers are contained in the annexes to the membership application to the WCL (sent by the complainant), and that the annexes also include a communication sent by the CUTC in  to the Register of Inscriptions of the Ministry of Justice, seeking ""to be entered in the corresponding register of inscriptions"" and subsequently mentioning four workplaces; the Committee also points out that the allegations by the WCL relate to events surrounding the organization of a national congress. The Committee notes that, according to the Government, the arrest of unionists or trade union leaders does not occur, and the allegations concerning acts of violence or the existence of blacklists are totally false. The Committee is bound to note nonetheless that the Government has not referred specifically to the detention or arrest of Mr. Sixto Rolando Calero and his wife, Mr. Pedro Pablo Alvarez Ramos (several times), Ms. Gladys Linares Blanco and Mr. Humberto Mones Lafito (her husband), Mr. Carmelo Agustn Daz Fernndez and Mr. Pedro Pablo Hernndez Mijares, all of whom, according to the WCL, were trade union members or leaders, detained in the circumstances described by the complainant, or to that of the journalist, Mr. Vctor Rolando Arroyo. The Committee is therefore bound to regret deeply these detentions, as well as the ill-treatment suffered by the persons named by the WCL.
.Furthermore, the Committee is bound to note that the Government still refuses to recognize the CUTC, in spite of the fact that more than six years have elapsed since it requested official registration, and requests the Government to ensure that the CUTC can operate freely and that the authorities refrain from any interference such as restricting the organization s fundamental rights. The Committee draws the Government s attention to the fact that ""the right of workers to establish organizations of their own choosing implies, in particular, the effective possibility of forming, in a climate of full security, organizations independent both of those which exist already and of any political party"" and that ""the detention of trade union leaders or members for reasons connected with their activities in defence of the interests of workers constitutes a serious interference with civil liberties in general and with trade union rights in particular"" [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, , paras.  and ].
.Moreover, the Committee notes that the Government failed to reply explicitly to other specific acts allegedly committed by the authorities in order to prevent the national congress of the CUTC from taking place (harassment of CUTC members, threats of arrest, confiscation of documents, pressure to prevent the holding of a press conference, police intimidation through the deployment of state security agents around the site of the press conference). The Committee is therefore bound to deplore these threats and acts of intimidation which, together with the arrests and detentions referred to above, demonstrate that the exercise",-1,1998,Cuba
36,"of trade union rights of organizations independent of the official union structure is extremely difficult, if not impossible. With regard to the alleged restrictions on the freedom of expression, the Committee notes that the Government again makes only general comments. The Committee stresses that ""the right to express opinions without previous authorization through the press is one of the essential elements of the rights of occupational organizations"" and that ""the right of an employers' or workers' organization to express its opinion uncensored through the independent press should in no way differ from the right to express opinions in exclusively occupational or trade union journals"" [see Digest, op. cit., paras.  and ].
.Lastly, the Committee requests the Government to ensure that, in future, the CUTC can operate freely in a climate free from threats and intimidation, that the freedoms of opinion and expression of workers' organizations independent of the official union structure are guaranteed, and that the confiscated documents are returned to the persons mentioned in the allegations. Given the insufficient information provided by the Government, the Committee requests it to provide full information on all the issues raised in this case.

.The complaint in this case was submitted in a communication from the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) dated  March . The Government responded in a communication dated  July .
.In accordance with the Committee's procedure (paragraphs  and ), on  August  the Office sent the complainant organization a copy of the Government's observations, inviting it to submit -- given the contradictions between its allegations and the Government's reply -- its comments and any additional information to enable the Committee to examine the case in full knowledge of the facts.
.Cuba has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The World Confederation of Labour (WCL) alleges in its communication of  March  that on  November , Cuban state security officials burst into the homes of Mr. Pedro Pablo Alvarez Ramos, President of the Single Council of Cuban Workers (CUTC) and Mr. Vicente Esobal Ribeiro, Director of the Cuban Institute of Independent Trade Union Studies (ICESI). The state police conducted a thorough search and seized numerous documents relating to independent trade union activities in Cuba. These documents included in particular the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the programme of action and declaration of principles of the CUTC, the Via del Mar Declaration, several books from the Latin American Central of Workers, various documents and magazines from the Cuban workers' solidarity movement, one of the reports by the United Nations Special Rapporteur for Cuba, Dr. Carl Johan Groth, publications from the Catholic Church, personal letters belonging to the trade union officials, other documents and office material.
.The WCL states that the raids on the homes of the two CUTC leaders and the seizure of the material constitute serious disregard for the principles contained in ILO Convention No.  and also violate civil liberties. By not having access to this material which, in a regime lacking in freedom is the only source of access to information concerning the trade union movement and trade union and human rights, the Cuban trade union leaders lack the basic tools to train the country's workers and strengthen democratic trade unionism.
.The WCL explains that the Single Council of Cuban Workers (CUTC) is a trade union organization which was established in . On  October , the Cuban Institute of Independent Trade Union Studies submitted a formal application for recognition. The CUTC also applied for registration. There has been no response of any kind by the Cuban authorities to either request. While the country's legislation provides that workers are entitled to establish independent trade union organizations, this legal standard does not in fact apply in practice.
.The WCL explains that this is just one of many incidents whose purpose is to hinder the existence of a truly free trade union movement in Cuba. These violations of trade union rights are not isolated but instead are part of a systematic pattern of anti-union discrimination in Cuba, as the Committee on Freedom of Association has already seen in its examination of Case No.  concerning the Confederation of Democratic Workers of Cuba.
.In its communication dated  July , the Government refers to the complaint alleging raids on the homes of supposed trade union leaders of an organization called the Single Council of Cuban Workers (CUTC) and the seizure of material. Investigations made in this connection were unable to prove the veracity of the facts, given that the address of the residence allegedly raided is unknown.
.Furthermore, the Government continues, in investigating the matter of the trade union activity attributed to a supposed organization called the Single Council of Cuban Workers (CUTC) it has not been possible to find out in which workplace, enterprise, establishment, factory, body or labour institution there is a body of workers which serves as the social and labour base for this organization and which accepts its authority as trade union leader, chooses its leaders and follows its trade union programme in its everyday labour relations. Given the absence of any such a necessary and essential labour framework, it is impossible to speak of a trade union organization, trade union leaders, or, most importantly, a body of workers who in an entrepreneurial organization of any kind is an essential element in any trade union activity.
.The Government states that in Cuba there are  national sectoral trade unions which, on the basis of decisions freely taken by their members, periodically hold congresses, adopt the statutes, regulations and decisions which they consider appropriate for the defence of their members' interests, as well as those relating to their structure, functions, methods and styles of work, free of any interference from the public authorities. By reason of this trade union autonomy, these national sectoral trade unions have , grass-roots sections. None of these corresponds to a supposed organization called the Single Council of Cuban Workers.
.The Government states that at present approximately , collective labour agreements have been concluded, which involves the enterprise management, the trade union representatives and the actual body of workers meeting up to draft, discuss and approve the contents of these collective agreements, and monitoring observance in accordance with prevailing legislation. In none of the country's workplaces is there an organization called the CUTC.
.The Government considers that the Committee on Freedom of Association should not put into operation a mechanism that is so costly for all the member States on the basis of dubious testimony from groups who address appeals to it, underneath the mask of supposed trade unionism, groups who bear no relation to trade unionists, with objectives that do not correspond to the function exercised by the Committee on Freedom of Association. Mr. Pedro Pablo Alvarez Ramos and Mr. Vicente Escobal Ribeiro are not trade union leaders, they do not head any body of workers, they have not been elected at any workplace as representatives of any body of workers, nor do they exercise any form of trade union activity in any workplace in the country. There is no evidence that their homes were raided as a result of their trade union activities, nor for any other reason.
.The Committee observes that in this complaint the complainant organization has alleged: () raids and searches, including the seizure of documents and office material by state police, of the homes of Mr. Pedro Pablo Alvarez Ramos, President of the Single Council of Cuban Workers (CUTC) and of Mr. Vicente Escobal Ribeiro, Director of the Cuban Institute of Independent Trade Union Studies (ICESI); and () the lack of response of the authorities to the ICESI's formal application for recognition and the CUTC's application for registration.
.The Committee notes the Government's observations, and in particular that: () it has not been able to establish the veracity of the allegations as the address of the residence that was allegedly raided is not known, and for this reason the raid has not been proven; () in no workplace is there an organization called the CUTC or a body of workers which corresponds to that organization; () Mr. Alvarez Ramos and Mr. Escobal Ribeiro are not trade union leaders, they do not represent any body of workers, nor do they exercise any type of trade union activity in any workplace in the country.
.The Committee observes that, in accordance with the Committee's procedure (paragraphs  and ), on  August  the Office sent the complainant organization a copy of the Government's observations, inviting it to submit -- given the contradictions between its allegations and the Government's reply -- its comments and any additional information to enable the Committee to examine the case in full knowledge of the facts.
.The Committee regrets that the complainant organization has not yet sent any comments or additional information and therefore asks it to do so prior to its next meeting in March , given that otherwise it will have to examine",-1,1998,Cuba
37,"the case without all the elements before it. In particular, the Committee requests the complainant organization to send, in addition to any comments and supplementary information it wishes to submit:-- the addresses of the residences which were allegedly raided;-- the statutes of the CUTC and of the ICESI and a copy of the applications submitted to the authorities for their recognition and registration;-- a list of the organizations that make up the CUTC and the ICESI, with an indication of the sectors and workplaces where they are active, the number of workers they represent and any further information in support of the nature and trade union activities of both organizations.
.The Committee also requests the Government to indicate specifically whether the CUTC and the ICESI have presented a formal request for registration to the authorities and if so, what has been the reply.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the complainant organization to send, in addition to any comments and supplementary information it wishes to submit:-- the addresses of the residences which were allegedly raided;-- the statutes of the CUTC and of the ICESI and a copy of the applications submitted to the authorities for their recognition and registration;-- a list of the organizations that make up the CUTC and the ICESI, with an indication of the sectors and workplaces where they are active, the number of workers they represent and any further information in support of the nature and trade union activities of both organizations.(b) The Committee requests the Government to indicate specifically whether the CUTC and the ICESI, have presented a formal request for registration to the authorities and, if so, what has been the reply.",-1,1998,Cuba
38,".The Committee examined this case in its November  and November  meetings and on both occasions presented an interim report to the Governing Body (see th Report of the Committee, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ) and th Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November )).
.The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) forwarded new allegations in a communication dated  April . The Government sent new observations in a communication dated  September .
.Cuba has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee notes that the questions raised by the complainant relate to the failure to grant official recognition to the Confederation of Democratic Workers of Cuba (CTDC) and to the temporary detention of three officials of that organization.
.As regards the failure to grant official recognition to the Confederation of Democratic Workers of Cuba (CTDC), the Committee notes that, according to the Government, the application for recognition submitted by the CTDC to the Department of Associations of the Ministry of Justice does not comply with the Law on associations and, specifically, does not give any particulars of the persons forming the steering committee, gives no indication of the number of members, does not indicate the state body with which the organization would maintain relations, does not attach the organization's statutes and is not accompanied by the statutory stamp duty. However, the Committee also notes that the Government states that the law in question is not applicable to trade unions, that the right to form independent trade union organizations is recognized both in legislation and in practice and that under section  of the Labour Code all workers enjoy the right to associate freely and to establish trade union organizations without previous authorization.
.Under these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to guarantee the freedom of the CTDC to operate and to ensure that the authorities refrain from any interference aimed at limiting the exercise by that organization of fundamental rights recognized in the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the exercise of human rights related to the exercise of trade union rights, including the right of individuals not to be subjected to measures depriving them of their freedom on grounds related to their legitimate activities.
.In this case, the Committee refers to the second question left pending, namely, the detention on various days in February  of three CTDC officials (Jos Orlando Gonzlez Budon, Gustavo Toirac Gonzlez and Rafael Garca Surez) for calling on social organizations to form an independent workers' parliament. The Committee notes that the Government has not expressly denied either the fact that these detentions took place or the motives for the detentions, merely stating that the persons in question are at liberty and denying that they are trade union officials. Under these circumstances, given that the complainant has given details of the trade union responsibilities in the CTDC of the persons concerned, the Committee reminds the Government, as it has already done in its previous examination of the case (see th Report, para. ), of the principle according to which ""measures depriving trade unionists of their freedom on grounds related to their trade union activity, even where they are merely summoned or questioned for a short period, constitute an obstacle to the exercise of trade union rights"". (See Digest of decisions and principles of the Committee on Freedom of Association, th (revised) edition, , para. .) The Committee deplores the detentions in question and requests the Government to take measures to ensure that there will be no future recurrence of such measures depriving individuals of their freedom on grounds related to legitimate trade union activity.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to guarantee the freedom of the Confederation of Democratic Workers of Cuba (CTDC) to operate and to ensure that the authorities refrain from any interference aimed at restricting the exercise by that organization of the fundamental rights recognized in Convention No.  and the exercise of the human rights related to the exercise of trade union rights, including the right of individuals not to be subjected to measures depriving them of their freedom on grounds related to their legitimate activities.(b) Deploring the detention on various days in February  of three CTDC officials (Jos Orlando Gonzlez Budon, Gustavo Toirac Gonzlez and Rafael Garca Surez) for calling on social organizations to form an independent workers' parliament, the Committee reminds the Government of the principle according to which ""measures depriving trade unionists of their freedom on grounds related to their trade union activity, even where they are merely summoned or questioned for a short period, constitute an obstacle to the exercise of trade union rights"". The Committee requests the Government to take measures to ensure that there will be no future recurrence of such measures depriving individuals of their freedom on grounds related to legitimate trade union activity.
.The Committee examined this case at its November  meeting and presented an interim report to the Governing Body (see th Report of the Committee, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November )).
.The Government sent new observations in a communication dated  September .
.Cuba has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.A number of allegations remained pending in the previous examination of the case, in which the complainant organization highlighted various acts committed against trade union officials or members of independent trade union organizations: injuries, detentions, threats, acts of intimidation and harassment, refusal to grant legal personality to the Confederation of Democratic Workers of Cuba (CTDC) and anti-union dismissal.
.Specifically, the complainant organization had stated that:- according to the Confederation of Democratic Workers of Cuba (CTDC), Ms. Edith Lupe, Organization Secretary of the Trade Union Front of the CTDC, was summoned to appear on  May  at the Department of State Security, located in the Capri district, in the Havana municipality of Arroyo Naranjo, by the commander of this body. Inside the aforementioned premises, the officer threatened her with offensive and gross language. He told her he ""was going to make her disappear or imprison her for three years"" if she did not relinquish her organizational activities in the CTDC ranks. After this verbal aggression, a body search was carried out and Ms. Lupe was stripped and subjected to a thorough examination. She was then threatened once again and placed in a cell which the Cuban agents use to carry out further acts of intimidation. Before she left the cell, Officer Cortina delivered a stern warning to the effect that her home might be attacked by ""mobs"" throwing stones and that she might be attacked and beaten by ""neighbours from the district"";- on  August , on Avenida  of the Siboney district, in the municipality of Playa, Havana, Mr. Lzaro Corp Yeras, General Secretary of the Union of Cuban Workers (USTC) and his younger son, Ray Corp Morales, were severely beaten up with sticks by three men. Both suffered serious injuries. The ICFTU states that it has reason to believe that the aggressors had links with the Cuban security forces. This assault is the fifth in less than three months against Mr. Lzaro Corp.
.Furthermore, in its last communication, dated  July , the complainant organization had alleged that:- the Department of State Security is severely harassing members of the National Executive Committee and the Trade Union Fronts which make up the Confederation of Democratic Workers of Cuba (CTDC). This is the case of Juan Guarino Martnez Guilln (President), Jess Crdenas Lpez (Vice-President) and Ren Jos Montero Garay (Secretary responsible for International Relations). This organization has also submitted the necessary documentation in order to obtain legal personality but to date it does not seem to have the slightest chance of obtaining its registration;- on  September , at  p.m., Mr. Ren Jos Montero Garay was ordered to appear at the Unit of the National Revolutionary Police (PNR) in calle Dragones at the corner of Lealtad, in the centre of Havana. He was questioned by several officials of this repressive body, who threatened him and warned him that he himself and Martnez Guilln and Jess Crdenas would be sentenced to  and  years' imprisonment if they pursued their militant activities in the CTDC and if they continued defending the Cuban working class. Moreover, on  November , at . p.m., Mr. Juan Guarino Martnez Guilln, President of the CTDC, and Mr. Jess Crdenas Lpez, Vice-President of the same organization, were arrested by the Department of State Security. They were taken to the nearest police station, where they were subjected to brutal and",-1,1994,Cuba
39,"offensive interrogation;- according to the complainant organization's sources, Mr. Eduardo Lamas Campos, a member of the Trade Union Front of the ""Julio Antonio Mella"" sugar mill in Santiago de Cuba, Oriente, was expelled from his workplace simply because he had called for improvements in working conditions and food, since the food available was small in quantity and of very poor quality.
.In its reply, the Government cited the difficulties of locating information concerning the persons mentioned in the complaint, since none of these persons has trade union status, the events in question are not of a trade union nature, the persons concerned do not represent any group of workers, nor do they themselves have any employment relationship with any enterprise or labour body in Cuba, all of which places the Committee on Freedom of Association in a situation of having to deal with events which have no relationship with the laudable task which it carries out of defending trade union freedoms.
.Referring to various allegations, the Government made the following observations:- the ICFTU complaint mentions the name of Edith Lupe. This name, as well as the description of the events, are incorrect. On the basis of some of the elements contained in the communication, it was possible to determine the real identity of the person, and to ascertain what really happened. The matter concerns Enid Amelia Luque Rosales and not Edith Lupe, as stated by the ICFTU. On  May, she was summoned to the th station of the National Revolutionary Police, located in the Capri district, and was given a warning for having carried provocative activities against public order, in accordance with the applicable legislation. She was summoned and received in one of the offices of the above-mentioned police station, not in the Department of State Security, as erroneously stated by the ICFTU. She remained in this office for a short period of time, and was not placed in any cell or subjected to any body search. The Government adds that, according to statements made by Enid Amelia Luque Rosales, the intention of the provocative acts which were carried out in the company of four delinquents was to obtain favours and guarantees from the Section of United States Interests in Havana, with a view to obtaining a visa for permanent residence in the United States. Enid Amelia Luque Rosales left the country in August ;- as regards Lzaro Corp Yeras, the Government states that it is totally erroneous to say that he was assaulted by members of the Ministry of the Interior. If this person, as he says, was the victim of any act of violence by unknown persons, he could have made a denunciation to the police, which he did not do. Lzaro Corp Yeras left the country in September , when he went to live in the United States;- the Committee on Freedom of Association should be cautious about statements from persons of doubtful credibility such as those concerning the persons mentioned in the complaint, which do not give the true identity of the persons, or the address of their residence, the name and address of the workplace where they are supposedly leaders of workers' collectives, and who have not even established their status as workers at the time in question;- there are  national sectoral trade unions in Cuba, whose members include around  per cent of the workers in the country. Freedom of association is exercised in all workplaces by workers' collectives and their trade union representatives are nominated and elected by the workers themselves. Under the Cuban labour relations system, the different bodies of the trade union organizations participate systematically, through a wide variety of fora, in the decision-making process on matters of interest to workers. According to the Government, the ICFTU has been misinformed; the facts have been distorted by unscrupulous persons who claim to be trade unionists, and their only purpose is to obtain personal benefit through recourse to international procedures and propaganda.
.The Committee formulated the following recommendations (see th Report, para. ):- the Committee requests the Government to open a judicial inquiry into the serious injuries allegedly inflicted on the trade union official Lzaro Corp and his younger son, and to keep it informed in this respect;- as regards the allegations concerning the arrest of and threats and other acts of harassment against Enid Amelia Luque, Organization Secretary of the Trade Union Front of the Confederation of Democratic Workers of Cuba, the Committee requests the Government to provide the more detailed information to which reference is made in the conclusions, so that it can examine the allegations in full knowledge of the facts (in this respect, in its conclusions, the Committee had pointed out that the Government had not explained the substance of the ""acts of provocation against public order"" by Enid Amelia Luque and ""four delinquents"", and which resulted in a ""warning"" being delivered in the offices of the national police, or of the ""demonstration"" against her conduct by neighbours from the district, or the content of the ""warning"" by the national police (see th Report, para. ));- finally, noting that the Government had not replied to the allegations made by the complainant organization in its communication of  July , the Committee requests the Government to furnish its observations on:- - the refusal to grant legal personality to the Confederation of Democratic Workers of Cuba (CTDC);- - the arrest and harassment of and threats against several officials of the CTDC;- - the expulsion from his work centre of a trade unionist of the Trade Union Front of the ""Julio Antonio Mella"" central organization after he had called for better working conditions.
.In its communication of  September , the Government states that the inquiries carried out have ascertained that Mr. Lzaro Corp Yeras and his son were not attacked by ""persons linked with the Cuban security forces"", as stated by the complainant organization without providing any proof. No formal complaint to this effect has been lodged with any police unit. It was also ascertained that Mr. Lzaro Corp Yeras is not a trade union official, nor does he represent any workers' collective or have an employment relationship with any workplace. This person left the country in September .
.As regards the allegations concerning Ms. Enid Amelia Luque, the Government states that in addition to the information given in its previous reply of  July , which it confirms, according to the inquiries made, Ms. Enid Amelia Luque caused a public scandal and disorder near her place of residence, making offensive statements to which the neighbours reacted by expressing rejection of her conduct. There were no acts of violence, only a public scandal, disrupting neighbourly relations. The Government adds that the warning in question was issued in accordance with procedural law, at a meeting with police instructors at which the person is informed of the offence and warned not to repeat it. It is not true that Ms. Enid Amelia Luque was placed in a cell or subjected to a body search. She spent a short period of time in the police office, only in order to comply with the established procedures. Ms. Enid Amelia Luque is not a trade unionist, nor is she a union official, nor does she represent any workers' collective. She does not have an employment relationship with any workplace. She left the country in August .
.As regards the allegations presented by the ICFTU in its communication of  July , the Government states that the inquiries carried out have ascertained that there is no trade union called the Confederation of Democratic Workers of Cuba in any enterprise or labour body in the entire country. The persons referred to in the ICFTU's letter dated  July , Juan Guarino Martnez Guilln, Jess Crdenas Lpez and Ren Jos Montero Garay, are not trade union officials, nor have they been subjected to threats and harassment. These persons have been neither nominated nor elected in any workplace in the country as representatives of any workers' collective. Juan Guarino Martnez Guilln left the country in March .
.As regards the alleged expulsion of a trade unionist who, according to the allegations of the ICFTU, was a member of a Trade Union Front of the ""Julio Antonio Mella"" sugar mill, Mr. Eduardo Lamas Campos, the Government states that the inquiries carried out have ascertained that this person was transferred from his post as a disciplinary administrative measure on three occasions for unjustified absence from work and for being disrespectful to his superiors and fellow workers. These measures were imposed in accordance with the labour legislation in force, and the worker submitted to them without availing himself of the remedies laid down in the legislation. On  October , he requested leave from his workplace in order to evade another labour sanction for the same reasons. Mr. Eduardo Lamas Campos has never been nominated or elected by the workers of the ""Julio Antonio Mella"" sugar mill as a union official. Eduardo Lamas Campos has a criminal record.",-1,1994,Cuba
40,"In  he was sentenced to a year's imprisonment by the courts for robbery with use of force.
.The Government states further that there is no trade union front called the Confederation of Democratic Workers of Cuba in the ""Julio Antonio Mella"" sugar mill. The inquiries carried out ascertained that the sugar mill has  trade union sections affiliated to the National Union of Sugar Industry Workers. These  trade union sections have a total of , members, i.e.  per cent coverage. The union leaders at the Julio Antonio Mella sugar mill were nominated and elected by the workers themselves, who participated in trade union activities in accordance with their rules and by-laws in full freedom and have not had to request authorization from any state body for the exercise of their activities to defend workers' interests and rights, in accordance with the provisions laid down in section  of the Labour Code. Mr. Eduardo Lamas Campos has never been nominated or elected as a trade union official.
.The Government specifies that at Mr. Eduardo Lamas' new workplace where he began to work after requesting leave from the ""Julio Antonio Mella"" sugar mill, the agricultural machinery repair shop belonging to the Agricultural Machinery Enterprise, he was again sanctioned for having taken property belonging to the workplace ( tomato seedlings). As can be seen, the disciplinary measures imposed on Mr. Eduardo Lamas Campos were the result of indiscipline at work and bear no relation to trade union activities.
.The Government states in addition that the ICFTU is distorting the facts and relying on isolated persons who do not represent any workers' collectives and who in one way or another have acted in violation of the legislation in force, committing acts which bear no relation to trade union activities, and attempts to present them to the Committee as trade unionists when in fact none of the persons referred to has carried out any trade union activities, nor do they represent any workers' collective. The Government requests the Committee on Freedom of Association to reach definitive conclusions in this case, since these are not trade union activities such as those protected in the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee observes that the allegations pending refer to different acts committed against trade union officials or members of independent trade union organizations: injuries, detentions, serious threats, acts of intimidation and harassment, refusal to grant legal personality to the CTDC and an anti-union dismissal.
.As regards the allegations concerning the serious injuries allegedly inflicted on trade union official Mr. Lzaro Corp and his younger son, the Committee notes that the Government states that () the inquiries carried out have ascertained that they were not attacked by persons linked with the Cuban security forces, nor has any formal complaint to that effect been lodged; () Mr. Lzaro Corp Yeras is not a trade union official, nor does he represent any workers' collective, nor is he in an employment relationship in any workplace; () he left the country in September . In view of these statements and the fact that Mr. Corp left the country in September , the Committee concludes that in these circumstances it does not appear possible to open a judicial inquiry into the allegations as requested by the Committee at its previous meeting.
.As regards the allegations concerning the detention, threats and harassment against Ms. Enid Amelia Luque, Secretary of the Trade Union Front of the Confederation of Democratic Workers of Cuba, the Committee notes that the Government acknowledges that this person has spent some time in a police station, albeit for a brief period, and that she had been issued with a warning, as provided in procedural law, during which the person is informed of the offence and warned not to repeat it. On the other hand, the Government denies that Ms. Enid Amelia Luque is a trade union official or member, that she was held in a cell and that she was subjected to a body search, and emphasizes that the reason for the warning was offensive statements (the Government does not indicate the content of these statements) which provoked a scandal among her neighbours. In view of the discrepancy between the complainant's and the Government's versions, the Committee points out the principle that ""measures depriving trade unionists of their freedom on grounds related to their trade union activity, even where they are merely summoned or questioned for a short period, constitute an obstacle to the exercise of trade union rights"" (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th (revised) edition, , para. ). Lastly, the Committee notes that Ms. Enid Amelia Luque left the country in August . The Committee wishes to emphasize that those responsible for anti-union discrimination should be sanctioned.
.As regard the allegations concerning the detention and interrogation of and threats against Juan Guarino Martinez Guilln and Jess Crdenas Lpez (respectively, President and Vice-President of the CTDC) and the police summons of and threats against Mr. Ren Jos Montero Garay (Secretary responsible for International Relations of the CTDC), the Committee notes that the Government denies that they are trade union officials and have been subjected to threats or harassment, and states that Juan Guarino Martinez Guilln left the country in March . The Committee observes that the Government has not expressly denied the detention and interrogation of Mr. Juan Guarino Martinez Guilln and Mr. Jsus Crdenas Lpez, or the police summons of Mr. Ren Jos Montero Garay. The Committee therefore once again draws the Government's attention to the principle stated in the previous paragraph concerning the summoning and questioning of trade unionists.
.As regards the allegation that the Confederation of Democratic Workers of Cuba (CTDC) was not granted legal personality despite having submitted the appropriate documents, the Committee notes that the Government states that the inquiries carried out have ascertained that there is no trade union called the Confederation of Democratic Workers of Cuba in any enterprise or labour body in the entire country. In this respect, the Committee requests the Government to state expressly whether it has received the documents applying for the granting of legal personality to the CTDC mentioned by the complainant organization and, if so, to state what action has been taken. In this respect, and in view of the fact that several allegations in this case are related to trade unionists of the CTDC, the Committee would refer to one of its conclusions formulated at its previous examination of the case (see th Report, para. ), reproduced below:The Committee must therefore take into account the fact that there exists only one officially recognized central trade union organization mentioned in the legislation and that on previous occasions, complaints have been made concerning the refusal to grant official recognition to trade union organizations outside the existing officially recognized trade union structure. In this same way, in its last report (), the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations requested the Government ""to guarantee in law and in practice the right of all workers and employers, without distinction whatsoever, to establish independent trade union organizations of their own choosing, outside any trade union structure if they so desire (Article  of the Convention), and the right to elect their representatives in full freedom"" (see Report III (Part A), ILC, nd Session, , p. ).
.As regards the allegation concerning the expulsion of a trade unionist of the Trade Union Front of the ""Julio Antonio Mella"" sugar mill (Mr. Eduardo Lamas Campos) for having asked for improvements in working conditions, the Committee notes that the Government states that this person was not a trade union official and that he had been transferred from his post as a disciplinary measure, in particular for unjustified absence from work, had left his job, and had subsequently been again penalized at his new workplace for having appropriated enterprise property.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) As regards the allegations concerning the summoning and/or temporary detention of trade unionists, the Committee emphasizes the principle that measures depriving trade unionists of their freedom on grounds related to their trade union activity, even where they are merely summoned or questioned for a short period, constitute an obstacle to the exercise of trade union rights. The Committee wishes to emphasize that those responsible for acts of anti-union discrimination should be sanctioned.(b) As regards the allegation concerning the refusal to grant legal personality to the Confederation of Democratic Workers of Cuba (CTDC), the Committee requests the Government to state whether it has received the documents applying for the granting of legal personality to the CTDC mentioned by the complainant organization and, if so, to state what action has been taken. In this respect, the Committee would refer to the comments of the Committee of Experts requesting the Government ""to guarantee in law and in practice the right of all workers and employers, without distinction",-1,1994,Cuba
41,"whatsoever, to establish independent trade union organizations of their own choosing, outside any existing trade union structure if they so desire (Article  of the Convention), and the right to elect their representatives in full freedom (Article  of the Convention)"".
.The complaint is contained in a communication of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) dated  October . This organization sent additional information in a communication dated  July .
.At its meeting of June , noting that it had not received any reply to the allegations from the Government, the Committee made an urgent appeal and indicated that in accordance with procedure it would examine the case at its next meeting even if the Government's reply had not been received (see th Report of the Committee, para. ).
.The Government replied to the allegations contained in the first communication from the ICFTU in a communication dated  July .
.Cuba has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  October , the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) alleges that Mr. Rafael Gutierrez, one of the leaders of the Union of Workers of Cuba (USTC), was twice refused permission to leave Cuba to attend meetings of the ICFTU Committee on Human and Trade Union Rights, held in November  and June . The Government alleged that Mr. Gutierrez was still subject to a sentence resulting from his opposition to the Government; the real reason for the refusal was that for the last two years he had been trying to secure official recognition of the USTC, and had been imprisoned for that reason, but released following pressure brought to bear by the international trade union movement. The non-recognition of the USTC was examined by the Committee in its th Report (Case No. ), paras. -). In protest against the Government's refusal to let him leave Cuba, Mr. Gutierrez went on a hunger strike on  June, which he ended on  July, due to the solidarity expressed by the international trade union movement.
.The ICFTU adds that according to the Confederation of Democratic Workers of Cuba (CTDC), Mrs. Edith Lupe, organization secretary of the Trade Union Front of the CTDC, was summoned to appear on  May  at the Department of State Security, located in Reparto Capri, in the Havana municipality of Arroyo Naranjo, by the commander of this body. Inside the aforementioned premises, the official threatened her with offensive and gross language. He told her he ""was going to make her disappear or imprison her for three years"" if she did not relinquish her organizational activities in the CTDC ranks. After this verbal aggression, a body search was carried out and Mrs. Lupe was stripped and subjected to a thorough examination. She was then threatened once again and placed in a cell which the Cuban agents use to carry out further acts of intimidation. Before she left the cell, officer Cortina delivered a stern warning to the effect that her home might be attacked by ""mobs"" throwing stones and that she might be attacked and beaten by ""neighbours from the district"".
.The ICFTU also alleges during the week of - July  that CTDC officials were the victims of a violent demonstration by the so-called ""Rapid Response Brigades"" outside the residence of Mrs. Edith Lupe, organization secretary of the Trade Union Front of the CTDC. The dissidents Juan Jos Lpez Diaz and Welmen Lazaro Noa were also at her residence at the time. Officials of the Ministry of the Interior and members of the Communist Party of Cuba participated in this demonstration.
.Furthermore, on  August , in the Avenida  del Rpto. Siboney, in the municipality of Playa, Havana, Mr. Lazaro Corp Yeras, general secretary of the Union of Cuban Workers (USTC) and his younger son, Ray Corp Morales, were severely beaten up with sticks by three men. Both suffered serious injuries. The ICFTU states that it has reason to believe that the aggressors had links with the Cuban security forces. This assault, the fifth in less than three months against Mr. Lazaro Corp, once again shows the flagrant violation by the Government of Cuba of internationally recognized trade union rights and principles.
.After condemning the terrible harassment to which independent trade unionists in Cuba are subject, and which has often been denounced by the ICFTU, this organization emphasizes the total lack of freedom of association in Cuba.
.In its communication of  July , the ICFTU alleges that the Department of State Security is severely harassing members of the National Executive Committee and the Trade Union Fronts which make up the Confederation of Democratic Workers of Cuba (CTDC). This is especially the case of Juan Guarino Martinez Guillen (president), Jesus Crdenas Lpez (vice-president) and Rene Jos Montero Garay (secretary responsible for international relations). This organization has also submitted the necessary documentation in order to obtain its legal personality but to date it does not seem to have the slightest chance of obtaining its registration.
.The ICFTU states that on  September , at  p.m., Mr. Rene Jos Montero Garay was ordered to appear at the Unit of the National Revolutionary Police (PNR) in calle Dragones esquine Lealtad, in the centre of Havana. He was questioned by several officials of this repressive body, who threatened him and warned him that both he himself and Martinez Guillen and Jesus Crdenas would be sentenced to - years' imprisonment if they pursued their militant activities in the CTDC and if they continued their defence of the Cuban working class. Moreover, on  November , at . p.m., Messrs. Juan Guarino Martinez Guillen, President of the CTDC, and Jesus Crdenas Lpez, vice-president of the same organization, were arrested by the Department of State Security. They were taken to the nearest police station, where they were subjected to brutal and offensive interrogation.
.The ICFTU also states that, according to its sources, Mr. Eduardo Lamas Campos, a member of the Trade Union Front of the ""Julio Antonio Mella"" central organization, in Santiago de Cuba, Oriente, was expelled from his workplace simply because he had called for improvements in working conditions and food, since the food available was both small in quantity and of very poor quality.
.In its communication of  July , the Government explains that the delay in sending its reply was due mainly to the difficulties of locating information concerning the persons mentioned in the communication from the ICFTU, since none of these persons has trade union status, the events in question are not of a trade union nature, the persons concerned do not represent any group of workers, nor do they themselves have any employment relationship with any enterprise or labour body in Cuba, all of which places the Committee on Freedom of Association in a situation of having to deal with events which have no relationship with the laudable task which it carries out of defending trade union freedoms.
.That being said, the Government adds that the inquiries carried out on the basis of the scant information contained in the complaint have shown that Mr. Rafael Gutierrez could not complete his plans to travel to a foreign country since at that time he was on bail pending legal proceedings against him in the criminal courts. Mr. Rafael Gutierrez subsequently left the country on the dates given by the ICFTU in its communication.
.The Government adds that the ICFTU complaint mentions the name of Edith Lupe. This name, as well as the description of the events, are incorrect. On the basis of some of the elements contained in the communication, it was possible to determine the real identity of the person, and to ascertain what really happened. The matter concerns Enid Amelia Luque Rosales, and not Edith Lupe, as stated by the ICFTU. On  May, she was summoned to the ninth station of the National Revolutionary Police, located in Reparto Capri, and was given a warning for having carried out provocative activities against public order, in accordance with the applicable legislation. She was summoned and received in one of the offices of the above-mentioned police station, not in the Department of State Security, as erroneously stated by the ICFTU. She remained in this office for a short period of time, and was not placed in any cell or subjected to any body search. The Government adds that, according to statements made by Enid Amelia Luque Rosales, the intention of the provocative acts which were carried out in the company of four delinquents was to obtain favours and guarantees from the Section of United States Interests in Havana, with a view to obtaining a visa for permanent residence in the United States. The Government states that it is incorrect that Juan Jos Lpez Diaz and Wilmer Lazaro Mora Beltran were the victims of a violent demonstration or that they were at the residence of the said Enid Amelia Luque when a group of neighbours",-1,1994,Cuba
42,"from the district reacted against the provocations of the above-mentioned citizen. It was not members of the Ministry of the Interior, but neighbours from the district, who participated in this demonstration. Enid Amelia Luque Rosales left the country in August .
.As regards Lazaro Corp Yeras, the Government states that it is totally erroneous to say that he was assaulted by members of the Ministry of the Interior. If this person, as he says, was the victim of any act of violence by unknown persons, he could have made a denunciation to the police, which he did not do. Lazaro Corp Yeras left the country in September , when he went to live in the United States.
.The Government points out that the Committee on Freedom of Association should be cautious about statements from persons of doubtful credibility such as those concerning the persons mentioned in the complaint, which do not give the true identity of the persons, or the address of their residence, the name and address of the workplace where they are supposedly leaders of workers' collectives, and who have not even established their status as workers at the time in question.
.The Government states that there are  national sectorial trade unions in Cuba, whose members include around  per cent of the workers in the country. Freedom of association is exercised in all workplaces by workers' collectives and their trade union representatives are nominated and elected by the workers themselves. Under the Cuban labour relations system, the different bodies of the trade union organizations participate systematically, through a wide variety of fora, in the decision-making process on matters of interest to workers. According to the Government, the ICFTU has been misinformed; the facts have been distorted by unscrupulous persons who claim to be trade unionists, when in fact their activities have nothing to do with trade union matters, and their only purpose is to obtain personal benefit through recourse to international procedures and propaganda.
.In the light of all these matters, the Government requests the Committee on Freedom of Association to conclude that this case should be definitively closed.
.The Committee observes that in this case the complainant organization alleges the total lack of freedom of association in Cuba and refers to different acts committed against trade unionists or officials of independent trade union organizations: injuries, detentions, serious threats, acts of intimidation and harassment, refusals to grant permission to leave Cuba to attend trade union meetings and the refusal to grant legal personality to the CTDC and an anti-union dismissal.
.The Committee notes the statements by the Government and in particular, that  per cent of workers in the country are members of  national sectorial trade unions, whose representatives are appointed and elected by the workers themselves, and that through their different bodies, trade union organizations participate systematically in the decision-making process. Moreover, the Committee observes that the Government states as regards the allegations contained in the first communication from the complainant organization that the persons to whom it refers do not have the status of trade unionists, do not represent any workers' collective and do not have any employment relationship with any enterprise or any occupational activity in the country, and that their activities are not related to trade union matters - their objective is allegedly to obtain personal benefit - and that the events in question are not of a trade union nature.
.In accordance with its usual practice, the Committee will carry out an examination of the different allegations on the basis of specific observations made by the Government; however, it would like to emphasize that in the light of all the information at its disposal it must determine whether or not there have been infringements of freedom of association, with account being taken of the provisions of the ILO Conventions on freedom of association ratified by Cuba. The Committee must therefore take into account the fact that there exists only one officially recognized central trade union organization mentioned in the legislation and that on previous occasions, complaints have been made concerning the refusal to grant official recognition to trade union organizations outside the existing officially recognized trade union structure. In the same way, in its last report (), the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations requested the Government ""to guarantee in law and in practice the right of all workers and employers, without distinction whatsoever, to establish independent trade union organizations of their own choosing, outside any existing trade union structure if they so desire (Article  of the Convention), and the right to elect their representatives in full freedom"" (see Report III (Part A), ILC, nd Session, , p. ).
.As regards the alleged refusal to grant permission to leave Cuba (November  and June ) to Mr. Rafael Gutierrez, a trade unionist of the Union of Workers of Cuba, thus preventing him from attending meetings organized by the ICFTU, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, Mr. Gutierrez was on bail at the time, pending judicial proceedings against him in the criminal courts, so that he could not complete his plans for travelling to a foreign country, and that he subsequently left the country on the dates mentioned by the ICFTU. In this respect, observing that the Government has not indicated the specific allegations made against Mr. Gutierrez in the criminal proceedings and bearing in mind that the Government has not denied the statement by the complainant organization that this person was imprisoned for trying to obtain official recognition of the Union of Workers of Cuba, the Committee concludes that the authorities refused Mr. Gutierrez permission to leave the country to attend ICFTU meetings because of proceedings related to the carrying out of legitimate trade union activities. The Committee therefore deplores that Mr. Gutierrez was not permitted to attend two meetings organized by the ICFTU and requests the Government in future to guarantee respect of the principle whereby ""since participation by unionists in international trade union meetings is a fundamental trade union right, governments should abstain from any measure ... that would prevent representatives of workers' organizations from exercising their mandate in full freedom and independence"". (See th Report, Case No.  (Zambia), para. ; rd Report, Case No.  (Lesotho), para. .)
.As regards the alleged serious injuries caused by three men (concerning whom the complainant organization states that it has reason to believe had links with the Cuban security forces) against the persons of Mr. Lazaro Corp Yeras, general secretary of the Union of Workers of Cuba, and his younger son in August , the Committee notes that the Government states that it is totally false that Mr. Lazaro Corp was assaulted by members of the Ministry of the Interior, that he made no complaint and that he left the country in September . The Committee wishes to emphasize that the complainant organization did not say that the injuries to Mr. Corp and his young son were caused by ""members of the Ministry of the Interior"", but by persons who had links ""with the Cuban security forces""; moreover, the complainant organization pointed out that this was the fifth act of aggression against Mr. Corp in less than three months. In this respect, the Committee believes that the terms in which the Government's reply is worded do not exclude the possibility that Mr. Lazaro Corp and his younger son were assaulted and injured because of the trade union status or activities of the former. The Committee therefore requests the Government in future to ensure that no trade union official or trade unionist should be assaulted because of his or her trade union status or activities, and of course neither should his or her family members. The Committee requests the Government to set up a judicial inquiry into the serious injuries inflicted on the trade union official Mr. Lazaro Corp and his younger son despite the fact that they no longer live in Cuba, and to keep it informed in this respect.
.Furthermore, the Committee notes the allegations concerning Mrs. Edith Lupe, organization secretary of the Trade Union Front of the Confederation of Democratic Workers: threats to make her disappear or to imprison her made by a commander in May  when she was summoned to appear at the Department of State Security; body search and stripping; placing in an intimidation cell; new threats of attack and beating by ""mobs"" and ""neighbours""; a demonstration by the ""Rapid Response Brigades"" outside the home of Edith Lupe, where dissidents Juan Jos Lpez and Welmen Lazaro Noa were also present; and participation by officials of the Ministry of the Interior and members of the Communist Party of Cuba in the demonstration.
.In this respect the Committee notes that the Government states: () that the name of the person in question was not Edith Lupe but Enid Amelia Luque; () that she was summoned by the national police and given a warning because of her provocative activities which were contrary to public order, in accordance with the legislation; ()",-1,1994,Cuba
43,"that she remained for only a short time at the police station, that she was not put into any cell and that no body check was carried out; () that according to statements made by Enid Amelia Luque Rosales, the purpose of the provocative acts carried out in the company of four delinquents was to obtain favours and guarantees from the Section of United States Interests in Havana, with a view to obtaining a visa for permanent residence in that country; () that as a result of the acts of provocation of Enid Amelia Luque a group of neighbours from the district demonstrated against her conduct, without the participation of members of the Ministry of the Interior; () that citizens Juan Jos Lpez Diaz and Wilmer Lazaro Mora Beltran were not at the home of Enid Amelia Luque at the time nor were they the victims of any demonstration; () that Enid Amelia Luque left the country in August .
.The Committee notes that the allegations made and the statements of the Government are conflicting and contradictory on most points. However, the Committee would like to emphasize that the Government has not explained the substance of these ""acts of provocation against public order"" by Enid Amelia Luque and the ""four delinquents"", and which resulted in a ""warning"" being delivered in the offices of the national police, or of the ""demonstration"" against her conduct by neighbours from the district, or the content of the ""warning"" by the national police. In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to clarify all these matters so that it can examine the allegations in full knowledge of the facts.
.Finally, noting that the Government has not replied to the allegations made by the complainant organization in its communication of  July , the Committee requests the Government to send its observations on:- the refusal to grant legal personality to the Confederation of Democratic Workers of Cuba (CTDC);- the detention, harassment of and threats against several leaders of the CTDC;- the expulsion from his workplace of a trade unionist of the Trade Union Front of the ""Julio Antonio Mella"" central organization who had called for better working conditions.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) Deploring that the trade unionist Rafael Gutierrez was not permitted to participate in two meetings organized by the ICFTU, the Committee requests the Government in future to ensure respect of the principle whereby participation as a trade unionist in international trade union meetings is a basic trade union right, and that governments should abstain from any measure which would prevent representatives of a workers' organization from exercising their mandate in full freedom and independence.(b) The Committee requests the Government to open a judicial inquiry into the serious injuries allegedly inflicted on the trade union official Lazaro Corp and his younger son, and to keep it informed in this respect.(c) As regards the allegations concerning the arrest of and threats and other acts of harassment against Enid Amelia Luque, organization secretary of the Trade Union Front of the Confederation of Democratic Workers of Cuba, the Committee requests the Government to provide the more detailed information to which reference is made in the conclusions, so that it can examine the allegations in full knowledge of all the facts.(d) Finally, noting that the Government has not replied to the allegations made by the complainant organization in its communication of  July , the Committee requests the Government to furnish its observations on:- the refusal to grant legal personality to the Confederation of Democratic Workers of Cuba (CDTC);- the arrest and harassment of and threats against several officials of the CTDC;- the expulsion from his work centre of a trade unionist of the Trade Union Front of the ""Julio Antonio Mella"" central organization after he had called for better working conditions.",-1,1994,Cuba
44,".When the Committee examined this case at its meeting in May  (see th Report, paras. -) it requested the Government to make an immediate pronouncement on the registration of the General Union of Cuban Workers (UGTC) - which according to the Government is now called the Union of Cuban Workers (USTC) - and to keep it informed of any measures adopted in this respect. In a communication dated  December , the Government had criticized the recommendations made by the Committee and indicated, in particular, that the case lacked legal objectivity because the request initially made by Mr. Rafael Gutierrez Santos to the Minister of Justice (request for registration of a so-called trade union organization) was abandoned by a letter of  April , which had been transmitted to the Committee. At its meeting in March , the Committee took note of the Government's observations and decided to transmit them to the complainant organization so that it might provide any comments or information that it considered to be useful in this respect, and in particular, any documents proving effectively the request for registration of the organization concerned. (See nd Report, para. .)
.In its communication of  June , the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) pointed out that, during the events which shook Cuba in the summer of , thousands of Cuban citizens left the island, including Mr. Rafael Gutierrez Santos, president of the USTC. Recognition of the USTC as a trade union organization has still not been granted. Nevertheless, the activities of the organization have not been paralysed and its members elected a new executive committee on  September . Furthermore, the ICFTU states that Mr. Rafael Gutierrez Santos had not requested the withdrawal of his request for registration, but had simply informed the Government of the change in the organization's name. In its communication of  May , the ICFTU indicated that the USTC has still not been recognized, although it is prospering and has affiliates in many provinces of the country. The USTC claims to have , members. The ICFTU adds that Mr. Pedro Rubio Balbun, president of the USTC, has been the victim of a search by the Policy Police at his home, which is also the headquarters of the organization, and of a seizure of all documentation and of the basic resources indispensable to the proper functioning of the trade union organization.
.In its communication of  September , the Government states that, after analysing the contents of the two communications submitted by the complainant organization and after having undertaken relevant inquiries, it appears that the persons mentioned as leaders of the organization called ""Union of Cuban Workers"" do not qualify as unionists. This so-called trade union organization is not present in any work centre in the country and its officers have not been elected by any workers' collective. This situation leads one to believe that the Committee should limit itself to the contents of Convention No.  on freedom of association and the right to organize which protects workers in the exercise of their trade union rights and not persons who invoke the Convention, without fulfilling the minimum requirements for exercising a true trade union activity, by using a false image of unionists towards other ends. The Government recalls the provisions of the Labour Code which guarantee the right of workers to form unions without previous authorization, the right of assembly and the right to freely express one's opinions.
.Furthermore, it was not possible to verify the truth of the search of the domicile mentioned in the ICFTU communications. The police services have no trace of such a search and no complaint has been made in this regard. As the arguments of the ICFTU are not well founded, the Committee should not artificially pursue the treatment of this case since it does not concern a trade union activity covered by Convention No. .
.The Committee takes note of the information provided by the Government which does not contain any elements likely to modify the conclusions which it has made in its previous reports. The Committee deplores the fact that, since , the USTC has not been legally recognized by the authorities, a matter which has nothing to do with its degree of representativeness. It insists that this independent organization, outside of the existing recognized trade union structure, be registered and allowed to function fully without discrimination. The Committee observes with concern that another case concerning Cuba (No. ) examined in this report also concerns the denial of recognition of an independent trade union organization. The Committee refers to the conclusions formulated in this case and in particular to the comments of the Committee of Experts requesting the Government ""to guarantee in law and practice the right of all workers and employers, without distinction whatsoever, to establish independent organizations of their own choosing, outside any existing recognized trade union structure if they so desire (Article  of Convention No. ) and the right to elect their representatives in full freedom (Article  of Convention No. )."" (See Report III (Part A), ILC, nd Session, , page .)
.The Committee examined this case at its November  meeting and presented an interim report to the Governing Body (see th Report of the Committee, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November )). The Government sent fresh observations in a communication dated  January .
.Cuba has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.With regard to the allegations concerning the violent attack against Mr. Rafael Gutirrez, the founder and President of the UGTC, and his subsequent -hour detention, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, Mr. Gutirrez was not held incommunicado and that he was detained because of his instigation and leading role in a disturbance and breach of the peace, conduct which under section  of the Penal Code is considered to be a public order offence, and that Mr. Gutirrez was freed before the legal period of detention had elapsed.
.In this regard, the Committee observes that the versions put forward by the Government (which considers that Mr. Gutirrez both instigated and had a leading role in a breach of the peace) and by the complainant organization (which alleges that Mr. Gutirrez was attacked because of his trade union activities) are contradictory. In the circumstances, while noting that according to the Government Mr. Gutirrez has been released from detention, the Committee recalls that ""the arrest - even if only briefly - of trade union leaders and trade unionists for exercising legitimate trade union activities constitutes a violation of the principles of freedom of association"" (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Committee on Freedom of Association, rd edition, , para. ). The Committee also recalls that ""the right of workers to establish organizations of their own choosing implies, in particular, the effective possibility of forming, in a climate of full security, organizations independent of those which exist already"" (see th Report, Case No.  (USSR), para. ; th Report, Case No.  (China), para. ; and th Report, Case No.  (Cuba), para. ).
.As regards the allegation concerning the Ministry of Justice's failure to reply to the request for registration and recognition of legal personality submitted by the General Union of Cuban Workers (UGTC) (its rules and a list of some of the members' names had been enclosed by the complainant organization), the Committee notes the observations made by the Government according to which a request for registration had not been submitted, merely a request to the Ministry of Justice for a certificate of recognition that there was no association of workers with the same name in that department and that, subsequently, Mr. Gutirrez asked the Ministry to discount the aforementioned request for registration. In the Committee's opinion, it seems that the certificate of recognition was requested by Mr. Gutirrez with the express aim of being able subsequently to request legal registration for the new trade union, and he thus seemingly embarked on a procedure obviously with the aim of registering a new trade union body. The Committee observes, moreover, that from the documentation included by the Government it seems that, although Mr. Gutirrez in effect asked for the UGTC registration application to be discounted, this was merely due to the fact that he wished to change the name of the association to the Union of Cuban Workers (USTC).
.In the circumstances, the Committee concludes that the General Union of Cuban Workers was set up over a year and a half ago (according to the Government, it is now called the Union of Cuban Workers (USTC)), and has still not been registered. Furthermore, although it notes the Government's declarations concerning the UGTC's lack of representativity, the Committee must point out that the fact that an organization has only a small number of members is not a good enough reason for",-1,1992,Cuba
45,"refusing registration. In the circumstances, the Committee once again urges the Government to make an immediate pronouncement on the registration of the General Union of Cuban Workers (UGTC) (which according to the Government is now called the Union of Cuban Workers (USTC)), bearing in mind that, under Article  of Convention No. , workers and employers, without distinction whatsoever, shall have the right to establish and, subject only to the rules of the organization concerned, to join organizations of their choosing without previous authorization. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any measures adopted in this regard.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) observing the contradictory nature of the Government's and complainant's versions of the facts relating to the allegation concerning the violent attack and subsequent detention of Mr. Gutirrez, and noting that, according to the Government, Mr. Gutirrez was released rapidly, the Committee recalls, in general, that ""the arrest - even if only briefly - of trade union leaders and trade unionists for exercising legitimate trade union activities constitutes a violation of the principles of freedom of association"" and ""that the right of workers to establish organizations of their own choosing implies, in particular, the effective possibility of forming, in a climate of full security, organizations independent of those which exist already""; and(b) the Committee once again urges the Government to make an immediate pronouncement on registration of the General Union of Cuban Workers (UGTC) (which according to the Government is now called the Union of Cuban Workers (USTC)), taking full account of the fact that under Article  of Convention No.  workers and employers, without distinction whatsoever, shall have the right to establish and, subject only to the rules of the organization concerned, to join organizations of their choosing without previous authorization. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any measures adopted in this respect.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) dated  February . The Government replied in a communication dated  April .
.Cuba has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  February , the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) alleges that the Committee of Experts and the Conference Committee on the Application of Standards have, on numerous occasions, strongly criticised the status of trade union monopoly conferred upon the Cuban Central Organisation of Workers (CTC) by the Cuban legislation.
.The ICFTU adds that on  October , a group of workers set up the General Union of Cuban Workers (UGTC); exercising the right to establish organisations of their own choosing, guaranteed under Article  of Convention No. , section  of the Cuban Labour Code and article  of the Constitution of the Republic of Cuba. The ICFTU encloses a copy of the statutes of the UGTC. It is expressly confirmed in these statutes that the UGTC is an independent trade union (paragraph ), that it is open to all Cuban workers without distinction (paragraph ), that its sole objectives are to defend the interests and rights of Cuban workers and that it strongly rejects any form of outside interference from any individual, authority or organisation (paragraph ).
.The ICFTU states that, when the UGTC was established, it decided to request registration from the Ministry of Justice and thus recognition of its legal personality - vital for it to be able to exercise its trade union activities lawfully. This request was submitted to the Department of Associations of the Ministry of Justice in accordance with the standards in force, requiring that all organisations submit the corresponding request, which must receive a reply within  days. However, in spite of the time which elapsed, it did not receive any reply from the authorities. This failure not only violates Cuban legislation, but also the right of workers to establish organisations of their own choosing, without previous authorisation.
.The ICFTU is also concerned by the fact that the Cuban authorities have acted in such a way as to create a climate of intimidation to undermine and interfere with the setting up of the UGTC and its recruitment activities. More specifically, on  January , the President of the UGTC, Rafael Gutirrez, was violently attacked by a so-called ""rapid intervention brigade"" which was part of a ""protest campaign"" instigated by the Government. Mr. Gutirrez was held and attacked by the crowd, who tried to make him swallow copies of UGTC documents. He was then taken away in a vehicle without number plates to the tenth police station in the  October District in La Havana, where he was held in solitary confinement. His relatives were not allowed to see him and were told that he would be detained for a long time. However, Mr. Gutirrez was released  hours later without any charges being brought against him and any explanations being given as to the grounds for his arrest.
.The ICFTU concludes by pointing out that the situation described above proves that Cuban workers are still denied the basic right of trade union organisation and that the practice of free trade unionism is still subject to widespread repression on the part of the Government.
.In its communication dated  April , the Government states that as regards the ICFTU's allegations on the existence of the Cuban Central Organisation of Workers (CTC) and its position within the legislative framework, it has already supplied detailed replies in the Government's annual reports to the Committee of Experts on the application of Convention No.  and at the Conference Committee on the Application of Standards. The Government stresses that it adheres to the historical and judicial principles of the trade union movement and that national trade unions, grouping . per cent of the country's labour force, participate fully in this movement.
.In connection with the so-called independent trade union organisation promoted by the ICFTU, the Government states that this organisation is not known either by the workers, the general public or the social partners representing the various decision-making bodies within the labour relations system. The Government particularly stresses the fact that it does not have any representativity among the workers which might justify the widespread international propaganda campaign being conducted by the Government of the United States as part of its anti-Cuban activities.
.The Government indicates that it has information on funding by the Government of the United States which is designed to encourage the creation of parallel trade unions in Cuba through various channels, including the structures and procedures of the AFL-CIO and the ICFTU. Attempts by the AFL-CIO and the ICFTU to interfere in Cuban trade unionism include plans to set up satellite organisations representing United States' interests in Cuba, industrial sabotage and bribes for trade union officials. The Government encloses a photocopy of an article published in Nuevo Herald, dated  January  (Miami), confirming the above-mentioned statement.
.The Government states that if the present case submitted by the ICFTU were a legitimate act of trade union solidarity, it would have to be addressed and even supported in so far as the setting up of trade union organisations is the outcome and expression of the free will of workers; on the contrary, this case constitutes an act of trade union interference by the ICFTU and an international propaganda campaign. Far from being an act of solidarity, the steps taken by the ICFTU in this case constitute a violation of the trade union freedom enjoyed by Cuban workers, who have not encountered any difficulties or opposition whatsoever in setting up organisations of their own choosing, drafting their own statutes and resolutions and adopting the trade union structure they consider apt for the defence of their interests, as stipulated in section  of the Labour Code.
.The Government stresses that in Cuba there are more than . million workers, of whom . per cent belong to trade union organisations of their own choosing. The so-called trade union organisation mentioned by the ICFTU does not exist in the country, neither does it have any representativity amongst Cuban workers. To impose such a so-called trade union organisation - as part of an anti-Cuban campaign instigated by the United States to cause political destabilisation, as openly stated and published by the international press - not only constitutes a violation of the standards and principles of international law but also a violation of freedom of association by the AFL-CIO, the ICFTU and their supporters, because it does not reflect the true will of the workers in Cuba.
.As regards Rafael Gutirrez, alleged official according only to the ICFTU, the Government states that he is not being held and that no criminal charges have been brought against him.
.The Committee notes that in the present case the complainant has raised the following issues: () the failure of the Ministry of Justice to reply to",-1,1992,Cuba
46,"the General Union of Cuban Workers' (UGTC) request for recognition and acknowledgement of its legal personality, in spite of the legal time-lapse of  days; and () the violent attack against Rafael Gutirrez, president of the UGTC, by a ""rapid intervention brigade"" which was part of a ""protest campaign"" instigated by the Government, and the detention of the above-mentioned official for  hours without any charges being brought against him and no explanation being given as to the grounds for his arrest.
.The Committee notes the Government's observations to the effect that: () the UGTC is not known, either by the workers, the general public or the social partners representing the various decision-making bodies within the industrial relations system; () there are more than . million workers in Cuba, of whom . per cent belong to trade union organisations of their own choosing; the so-called trade union organisation mentioned by the ICFTU does not exist in the country, neither does it have any representativity whatsoever amongst Cuban workers; () Mr. Rafael Gutirrez is not being held, neither are there any criminal charges against him; and () the AFL-CIO and the ICFTU have plans to interfere in Cuban trade unionism by promoting industrial sabotage and trying to bribe the trade union officials; these are anti-Cuban activities designed to bring about political destabilisation.
.The Committee deplores the fact that the Government has not sent specific information on the failure of the Ministry of Justice to reply to the General Union of Cuban Workers' request for registration and recognition of its legal personality. Indeed, the Government merely stated that this organisation ""does not exist"", in spite of the fact that the statutes of this organisation were communicated by the complainant and that the names of six persons were mentioned in these statutes. The Committee also deplores the fact that the Government also failed to provide information on the allegations concerning the violent attack against Mr. Rafael Gutirrez, founder and president of the UGTC. In these circumstances, the Committee must point out that the right of workers to establish organisations of their own choosing implies, in particular, the effective possibility of forming, in a climate of full security, organisations independent both of those which exist already and of any political party (see th Report, Case No.  (USSR), para.  and th Report, Case No.  (China), para. ). The Committee urges the Government to send precise observations on these allegations to which it did not reply in a specific way and to decide, without delay, on the request for registration submitted by the UGTC, taking full account of the fact that under Article  of Convention No. , workers and employers, without distinction whatsoever, have the right to establish and join organisations of their own choosing without previous authorisation.
.As regards the detention of the president of the UGTC for  hours, the Committee deplores the fact that the Government did not send specific information on this detention and merely pointed out that Mr. Gutirrez was not ""being held"" and that no criminal charges have been brought against him. The Committee therefore urges the Government to send without delay its observations on this matter. It draws to its attention the principle that when the authorities arrest trade unionists without a warrant or it is subsequently found that no grounds exist for conviction, this constitutes a clear violation of trade union rights. Governments should take steps to ensure that the authorities concerned have instructions appropriate to eliminate the danger which arrest for trade union activities implies"" (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Committee on Freedom of Association, rd edition, , para. ).
.Finally, as regards the Government's statements concerning the complainant organisation's plans to interfere in the Cuban trade union movement, the Committee points out that any assistance or support that an international trade union organisation might provide in setting up, defending or developing national trade union organisations is a legitimate trade union activity, even when the trade union tendency does not correspond to the tendency or tendencies within the country. The Committee also points out that the recriminations and value judgements which the Government makes in a general way against the complainant are not admissible, neither may they be taken into account as part of the procedure of the Committee, which is only authorised to examine complaints against governments and not against workers' or employers' organisations.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to send it urgently specific observations on the allegation concerning the violent attack against Mr. Rafael Gutirrez, founder and president of the UGTC. The Committee points out that the right of workers to establish organisations of their own choosing implies, in particular, the effective possibility of forming, in a climate of full security, organisations independent both of those which exist already and of any political party.(b) The Committee urges the Government to send without delay its observations on the -hour detention of Mr. Rafael Gutirrez (president of the UGTC) and reminds the Government that when the authorities arrest trade unionists without a warrant or it is subsequently found that no grounds for conviction exist, this constitutes a clear violation of trade union rights.(c) The Committee requests the Government to send specific observations on the Ministry of Justice's failure to reply to the request for registration and recognition of legal personality submitted by the General Union of Cuban Workers (UGTC) and to make a ruling without delay on this matter, taking fully into account that under Article  of Convention No. , workers and employers, without distinction whatsoever, have the right to establish and join organisations of their own choosing without previous authorisation.(d) The Committee draws the Government's attention to the principle that any assistance or support provided by an international trade union organisation to help establish, defend or develop national trade union organisations is a legitimate trade union activity.",-1,1992,Cuba
47,".The Committee examined this case at its November  meeting, when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body. [See th Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ).]
.During the Governing Body debates (th Session, November ) on the Committee's report, the Government representative of the Republic of Cuba requested that his statement to the Committee on this case be put on record as the Government's initial reply. The Government sent further observations in a communications dated  November  and  February .
.Cuba has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations referred to the sentencing of workers for having attempted to organise an independent trade union, the arrest of four lawyers and a judge for having interceded on behalf of five of the workers and the arrest of other workers for trade union reasons.
.When the Committee examined the case at its November  meeting, it made the following recommendations: [See th Report, para. .](a) As regards the allegation that workers were sentenced to long terms of imprisonment for having attempted to organise an independent trade union, the Committee notes that the sentence rendered by the People's Supreme Court of the Republic of Cuba on  April  was based on acts other than their trade union activities.(b) The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the allegations according to which four lawyers and a judge of the People's Court of Havana were arrested merely for interceding on behalf of the five workers who were initially sentenced to death and who subsequently had their sentences commuted.(c) The Committee endorses the comments of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations concerning the application by Cuba of Convention No.  and wishes to stress that section  of Legislative Decree No.  of  aims at establishing and maintaining a single trade union system; it requests the Government to take the necessary measures to bring this provision into line with Convention No. .(d) The Committee requests the Government to send, as soon as possible, the precise and detailed observations which it has not supplied on the allegations concerning:(i) the arrest of two workers of the Pedro Marrero brewery for having suggested that an independent trade union should be set up;(ii) the arrest of between  and  workers in the Central Chaparra sugar refinery for having tried to organise an independent trade union;(iii) the arrest of some  peasants in the province of Sancti Spiritus for participating in collective protest actions.
.Referring to the conclusions and recommendations of the Committee in its th Report, the Government states, in its communication of  November , that it cannot understand the link between subparagraphs (a) and (b) of paragraph  of the Committee's report and that since there is no connection, the Government denies the accusation and its relation with any type of trade union activity. The Government wonders how, if it was fully proved that the initial complaint was false, is it possible to regard as valid the supposed link between the four lawyers and a judge of the People's Court and the trade unionists who were arrested, according to the complainant organisations for having intervened voluntarily. The Government points out that Cuban penal legislation grants all accused persons the full right of appeal against the decision of a competent court, and it would therefore be absurd and unnecessary for any third party to intervene voluntarily in order to secure a reversal of any sentence. Moreover, article  of the Constitution of the Republic of Cuba states: ""Each citizen has the right to lodge complaints and petitions with the authorities and to receive the necessary attention and replies in adequate time and in accordance with the law."" The accusation that these citizens were arrested for this reason is therefore invalid.
.As regards the existence of only one trade union organisation in each work centre, the Government refers to the replies which it supplied to the Conference Committee on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations in which it pointed out that the unity of the Cuban trade union movement was an historical achievement of the Cuban working class dating back to . This was a voluntary act on the part of the workers which dates from , that is,  years before the promulgation of Act No. ; the Act only reflects the historical reality. Section  of the Act recognises the voluntary character of trade union membership.
.The Government also states that the allegations relating to the supposedly arrested trade unionists of the Pedro Marerro brewery and of the Jess Menndez Central (previously known as Central Chaparra) for having tried to set up ""independent"" trade unions are totally baseless and are pure calumny. It states that no one in Cuba is under arrest for trade union or labour activities.
.According to the Government other calumnies relate to alleged protests by a group of small farmers against the requirement to supply part of their crop to state storage centres. It must not be forgotten that the first law promulgated by the revolutionary State was the agrarian reform law, which gave the land of the large estate owners (latifundistas) to the peasants who had been dispossessed by them. Thus, the small farmer has reason to be grateful to the Revolution and is aware of the manner in which the distribution of agricultural produce is carried out in a planned economy. For this reason he is happy to supply part of his crop to the state storage centres, at adequate prices. However, he also has the right to retain part of the fruits of his labour for his own sustenance or to sell it on the free market at a price that the farmer himself may fix. It is therefore meaningless to talk of a protest movement or of alleged imprisonment in this connection. Lastly, the Government points out that it is impossible to reply to false and absolutely groundless accusations.
.In its communication dated  February  the Government, in addition to its previous reply, states that it wishes to repeat that: in Cuba there are no persons detained from the ""Pedro Marrero"" brewery for having proposed the necessity of creating an independent trade union; in Cuba there are no persons detained from the ""Jesus Menndez"" sugar refinery (previously known as the Central Chaparra) for having attempted to set up an independent trade union; in Cuba there are no persons detained in the Sancti Spiritus Province for having participated in collective protest action. The Government concludes by pointing out that it has shown its willingness to, co-operate with the Committee in the elucidation of Case No. , but, for the reasons expressed above, it is clear that it cannot supply details on non-existent facts.
.During the discussion of this case at the th Session of the Governing Body (November ), the Government representative of the Republic of Cuba requested that his statement on the case be transmitted to the Committee as the Government's initial reply. The Government representative specifically denied the allegation relating to the detention of about  peasants in the Sancti Spiritus Province for having participated in protest action.
.As regards the allegation that four lawyers and a judge of the People's Court of Havana were arrested for having interceded on behalf of five workers who had tried to organise an independent trade union and who had initially been sentenced to death but whose sentences were subsequently commuted, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, Cuban penal legislation grants the right to appeal against court decisions, so that it would be absurd and unnecessary for any third party to intervene voluntarily in order to secure a reversal of a court decision; the Cuban Constitution, moreover, establishes the right to lodge complaints and petitions with the authorities and to receive the necessary attention and replies, so that the accusation made is, in the Government's opinion, invalid.Since the five workers on whose behalf, according to the complainant, four lawyers and a judge had interceded were sentenced, as the Committee concluded, [See th Report, para. .] for acts other than trade union activities, and in view of the explanation furnished by the Government, which denies the allegation, the Committee considers that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.
.As regards the allegation that workers were arrested for carrying out trade union activities, the Committee takes note of the Government's statements. It notes in particular that the Government describes as an unfounded calumny the allegations that supposed unionists of the Pedro Marerro brewery and the Jess Menndez Central (previously called Chaparra) were arrested for attempting to set up independent trade unions. The Government also denies the allegation that  peasants in the province of Sancti Spiritus were arrested for participating in collective protest actions. The Government also states that no one in Cuba is under",-1,1983,Cuba
48,"arrest for trade union or labour activities. Lastly, in its communication of  February  the Government specifically denies that workers and peasants of the places mentioned by the complainant are detained for trade union activities.
.Given that the Government denies that trade unionists are being detained for trade union activities, the Committee asks the complainant organisation to send more detailed information on these aspects of the case.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report and in particular the following conclusions:(a) As regards the allegation that four lawyers and a judge of the People's Court were arrested for having interceded on behalf of five workers, the Committee notes that these workers were sentenced for acts other than trade union activities. In view of this as well as the Government's explanations, it considers that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.(b) As regards the allegations that two workers of the Pedro Marerro brewery were arrested for suggesting that an independent trade union should be set up, that between  and  workers in the Jess Menndez Central (previously known as Chaparra) sugar refinery were arrested for trying to organise an independent trade union and that  peasants in the province of Sancti Spiritus were arrested for participating in collective protest actions, The Committee asks the complainant organisation to send more detailed information on these aspects of the case.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) dated  April . The ICFTU sent further information and new allegations in a communication dated  June . The Government replied in letters of  May and  September .
.Cuba has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The ICFTU, in a telegram dated  April  to the Director-General of the ILO, expressed its great concern at the information it had obtained concerning trade union repression in Cuba. The ICFTU reported that some  workers had been tried for having attempted to organise a strike in the sugar industry. According to some reports, five of these workers had already been executed, namely: Ezequiel Daz Rodrguez, Jos Luis Daz Romero, Carlos Garca Daz, Benito Garca Olivera and Donato Martnez Garca. According to other sources of information, however, the sentences on these persons had been commuted to  years' imprisonment. In view of the seriousness of this information, the ICFTU requested the Director-General of the ILO to approach the competent authorities of Cuba with a view to obtaining all relevant information on these allegations and ascertaining that trade union rights and freedoms were respected in Cuba.
.In response to the request of the ICFTU, the Director-General sent a communication dated  April  to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Cuba, in which it attached the telegram from the ICFTU and requested the Government to comment thereon.
.The Government sent the observations requested by the Director-General in a communication of  May  in which it describes the information furnished by the ICFTU as infamous and states that the laws and Constitution of the Republic of Cuba clearly and unequivocally include the right of manual and professional workers freely to establish and join trade union organisations. Likewise, the Constitution guarantees the right of workers, as of the entire Cuban people, to assemble, to hold discussions and to express their opinions freely on all matters affecting them. The Constitution of the Republic not only clearly establishes right of assembly and the right to organise but, furthermore, proclaims that the Cuban State must provide the material means of actually putting these rights into daily practice. As can be seen in the international statistics that are known to the ILO, practically all Cuban workers belong to trade unions which are grouped in the Confederation of Cuban Workers. Furthermore, Cuban penal legislation - which, like the rest of the country's legislation, is scrupulously respected by the Government of the Republic and the law courts of the State - contains no provision whereby citizens could be penalised for activities of a trade union nature. All this should be clear to anyone claiming to be concerned with events in Cuba.
.The Government adds that what does not and will not exist in Cuba, because the workers would not allow it, is a situation like the alleged one described by the instigators of this campaign. No one has been penalised for the alleged offence of having sought to organise a supposed strike. The persons mentioned in the telegram of the ICFTU were never sentenced to death. They were penalised by the courts of Cuba, in accordance with the law in force, for the offence of continuously sabotaging the national economy by activities which, furthermore, endangered the lives of other citizens. The group in question is an insignificant one, which includes the avowed agents of foreign services and they were discovered and arrested with the collaboration of the workers and citizens of the country. For these reasons, the Government states that it categorically and scornfully refutes the misrepresentation of the facts and the lies that have been spread.
.Subsequently, in a communication dated  April , the ICFTU lodged a formal complaint against the Government of the Republic of Cuba in which it made the following allegations.
.In its communication of  April , the ICFTU alleges that according to its information  workers were arrested in Havana in October  for having tried, with their comrades, to organise an independent trade union to defend their interests. The group of workers belongs to the State construction undertaking which has its headquarters in Havana and is engaged in work at the ""Lenin Park"" recreation centre in the city. The matter was brought before the Cuban courts as case No. / and the charges were of ""crimes against the security of the State"" and ""industrial sabotage"". The death sentence was passed by the Havana court on five of the workers: Ezequiel Daz Rodrguez, Jos Luis Daz Romero, Carlos Garca Daz, Benito Garca Olivera and Donato Martnez Garca. Their companions received prison sentences of up to  years.
.The ICFTU adds that an appeal was lodged with the People's Appeal Court but was rejected by the latter at the end of January . A further appeal was lodged with the State Council, presided over by Fidel Castro. The ICFTU also states that sources close to the workers concerned have reported that the death sentences have been commuted to sentences of  years' imprisonment. Nevertheless, according to the same sources, the case is still open for the Cuban authorities which means that the risk of the death sentences being applied cannot be totally ruled out.
.Moreover, the complainant states that the Cuban authorities are known to be exerting moral pressure on workers who were connected closely or even remotely with the attempt to set up an independent trade union, in order to prevent them from spreading information about this matter.
.In its communication of  June , the ICFTU alleges that according to information from reliable sources inside Cuba, four lawyers from a group practice (Mr. Aramias Taboada, aged , Mr. Francisco Moura, aged , Mr. Israel Tamayo, aged  and Mr. Ruben Quinteros, aged ) were arrested at the end of March simply for having interceded on behalf of the five workers who had been sentenced to death by a court of the first instance and subsequently to long terms of imprisonment. Furthermore, in the same situation and for the same reasons as the other four lawyers, Dr. Nicasio Hernandez de Arenas,' one of the judges of the Havana People's Court, was also arrested.
.According to the ICFTU, the same sources of information report that no date has yet been set for the hearing of case No. /.
.The ICFTU also states that it has learnt of further arrests that have taken place during the year, mainly of workers. The arrests concern the following matters:- in the province of Sancti Spiritus, formerly known as ""Las Villas"", some  smallholders were arrested for damaging their own crops as a form of protest against the obligation to deliver most of their produce to the food distribution centre known as ACOPIO (which deals with agricultural and other produce), which pays them according to the prices established by the regime;- two workers from the ""Pedro Marrero"" brewery, also known by its former name of ""Tropical"", in Havana, were arrested for suggesting that an independent trade union should be set up; and- an unspecified number of workers (between  and ) from the ""Central Chaparra"" sugar refinery in Oriente were arrested when they were found trying to organise an independent trade union comprising the firm's lorry drivers.
.It should be mentioned, the complainant continues, that trade union membership is compulsory in Cuba and that there is only one union per labour centre which, in turn, belongs to a single confederation; the payment",-1,1983,Cuba
49,"of trade union dues is also compulsory.
.Finally, the complainant alleges that in addition to trying to establish an independent trade union, the workers who have been under arrest since October  and those mentioned in the cases that have come to light more recently have made various protests, such as statements and short work stoppages, in order to draw the Government's attention to the ""voluntary"" work on Sundays. This ""voluntary"" work is actually considered to be compulsory since failure to work on any Sunday in the year without justification earns a black mark for the person concerned who then loses the possibility of obtaining from the Confederation of Cuban Workers the vouchers without which he cannot buy the products considered as luxuries, such as refrigerators, television sets and fans. The ""voluntary"" Sunday work is mainly agricultural; eight hours' work are involved and workers are obliged to cover considerable distances so that in fact they have to give up their entire Sunday to this activity.
.The Government sent its observations on the allegations in communications to the Director-General dated  May and  September . In the first of these communications the Government states that the complaint is calumnious since none of the supposed ""trade unionists"" ever had the intention of establishing any kind of trade union movement or of creating any type of organisation. The citizens referred to in the communication of the complainant organisation did not even have any labour links at the time of their arrest and trial. Only one of them was working on the family land as a small farmer, the other four being engaged in various illegal activities. The facts which led to their arrest and sentencing in case No. / before the Provincial Court, in a trial that was carried out in accordance with the legal provisions in force in the country, are connected with various acts of sabotage, including setting fire to sugar-cane plantations and grazing land, a tobacconist's shop, hayricks, etc. At the time of their arrest they were planning to set fire to big shops and stores in the capital, collecting arms and other equipment to carry out activities of this kind and were beginning to devise plots to attack government leaders. Moreover, the persons in question, who are the subject of the complaint and whose guilt was proved at the trial, admitted to these activities.
.The Government points out, moreover, that there are discrepancies between the two communications of the ICFTU. The first one states that it concerns ""some  workers who were trying to organise a strike in the sugar sector and the death of some of them"". The second communication speaks of  workers belonging to the State Ministry for Construction, who were working in the ""Lenin Park"" recreation centre and who were trying to establish an independent trade union to defend their interests. These discrepancies, the Government states, merely demonstrate that an attempt is being made, pointlessly, to undermine the prestige of Cuba by inventing a ""case"" of infringement of freedom of association for obvious purposes of propaganda.
.In its communication of  September , the Government sends a certified copy of ruling No.  of the People's Supreme Court of the Republic of Cuba, dated  April , dealing with the actions that were judged and the final sentence passed. According to the Government, this sentence constitutes unequivocally proof of the campaign of calumny and defamation organised against Cuba.
.Lastly, the Government describes the information provided in the last communication of the ICFTU as calumnious, stating that it is impossible to give a serious reply to such calumny which relates to supposed facts that have no connection whatsoever with case No.  but are merely figments of their inventors' imagination.
.Allegation relating to the sentencing of workers to prison
.The Committee notes that the complainant has alleged that  workers were arrested, tried and sentenced to long terms of imprisonment (in the case of five of these persons the death sentence having been commuted by a court of the second instance to sentences of  years' imprisonment) for having attempted to organise an independent trade union to defend their interests although the charges against them were of ""crimes against the security of the State"" and ""industrial sabotage"". Four lawyers and a judge of the People's Court of Havana are said moreover to have been arrested merely for having interceded on behalf of the five workers referred to. Furthermore, the complainant has alleged that in the Republic of Cuba trade union membership and the payment of membership dues are compulsory, there being only one union per labour centre which, in turn, belongs to a single confederation.
.As regards the allegation concerning the sentencing of  workers to long terms of imprisonment for having tried to organise an independent trade union, the Committee notes the Government's statements as well as judgement No. , dated  April , of the People's Supreme Court of the Republic of Cuba. The Committee notes that the judgement describes  of the accused persons, including Ezequiel Daz Rodrguez, Jos Luis Daz Romero, Carlos Garca Daz, Benito Garca Olivera and Donato Martnez Garca, as ""counter-revolutionary, anti-communist and anti-social elements, who had been organised for some time and devoted themselves to various counter-revolutionary activities inspired by their own ideology and influenced by North American imperialist propaganda and by broadcasts from the United States of America; in  they set up the organisation known as the 'Zapata Group', belonging to the ultra-reactionary terrorist organisation 'Alpha ' based in Miami in the state of Florida, whose fundamental task is to destroy the economy of the country and create panic among the population so as to create an atmosphere of insecurity with the aim of overthrowing our socialist State by violent means."" The judgement then describes the facts with which the accused persons are charged: ""scattering hooks on roads, setting fire to sugar plantations, starting fires in restaurants, setting fire to or damaging vehicles, setting fire to grazing land, attempting to poison cattle so as to cause large-scale deaths, setting fire to a coffee plant nursery and the food store of the undertaking, setting fire to a tobacconist's shop, sabotage of telephone lines, attempting to set fire to the wooden poles of electric cables and to a high-voltage tower, distribution in public places of a large quantity of counter-revolutionary documents containing libellous and offensive comments against the Commander-in-Chief of the Revolution and signed by the ""Company for Sabotage against Communism"", incitement against the socialist order and the socialist State. The judgement adds that ""these offences of a revolutionary and terrorist nature carried out by the accused persons during the period in question amount to more than  acts of sabotage of various kinds, all of which involve the direct or group participation of the accused, Ezequiel Daz Rodrguez, Benito Garca Olivera, Angel Donato Martnez Garcia, Jos Luis Daz Romero and Carlos Garca Daz, who played a direct part in almost all the different activities carried out.""
.Furthermore, as is stated in the judgement, two of the accused were recruited to belong to the counter-revolutionary group and although they accepted they did not take part in the activities referred to;  others did not belong to the group but knew of the counter-revolutionary activities and did not denounce them to the authorities and a further person co-operated in the criminal activities of the group. There would thus have been a total of  persons accused.
.The judgement of the People's Supreme Court of the Republic of Cuba revokes the death sentence passed on the five persons named above, sentences each of them to  years' imprisonment and upholds the rest of the sentences handed down by the Court of First Instance. As regards the allegation according to which four lawyers and a judge of the People's Court of Havana were arrested merely for interceding on behalf of the five workers who were initially sentenced to death, the Committee notes that the Government has furnished no precise information. Consequently, the Committee requests the Government to send its observations thereon.
.After carefully examining the judgement of the People's Supreme Court of the Republic of Cuba, dated  April , the Committee notes that the judgement does not mention activities of a trade union character on the part of the  accused. Consequently, the Committee considers that the sentence rendered by the Court was based on acts other than their trade union activities.
.Nevertheless, the Committee notes that the complainant has reported that the trial and judgement of the persons concerned stemmed from the attempt to organise an independent trade union. In this regard the Committee cannot fail to point out on this question that from the point of view of trade union legislation the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has for several years been objecting to section  of Legislative Decree No.  of , designed to set up and maintain a single trade union system, and which expressly mentions the Confederation of Cuban Workers. The Committee",-1,1983,Cuba
50,"of Experts has considered that this provision might constitute an obstacle to the creation of another confederation if the workers so wished and has expressed the hope that the Government will adopt the necessary measures to delete the reference in the legislation to a specific trade union organisation. In these circumstances the Committee endorses the comments made by the Committee of Experts.
.Allegations relating to the arrests of workers for trade union reasons
.The Committee notes that the rest of the allegations relate to the arrest of some  peasants in the province of Sancti Spiritus for having participated in collective protest actions, to the arrest of two workers of the ""Pedro Marrero"" brewery at Havana for suggesting that an independent trade union should be set up and to the arrest of between  and  workers from the ""Central Chaperra"" sugar refinery in Oriente for trying to organise an independent trade union comprising the firm's lorry drivers. In this regard the Committee notes the Government's statement of  September  which describes the allegations of the complainant organisation as calumny and states that it is impossible to reply seriously to supposed events that have no connection with Case No.  and exist only in the imagination of their inventors. On this point however the Committee notes that the allegations to which the Government has not replied in substance relate to concrete allegations of violations of trade union rights. Consequently, the Committee requests the Government to send, as soon as possible, precise and detailed observations on these allegations.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:(a) As regards the allegation that workers were sentenced to long terms of imprisonment for having attempted to organise an independent trade union, the Committee notes that the sentence rendered by the People's Supreme Court of the Republic of Cuba on  April  was based on acts other than their trade union activities.(b) The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the allegations according to which four lawyers and a judge of the People's Court of Havana were arrested merely for interceding on behalf of the five workers who were initially sentenced to death and who subsequently had their sentences commuted.(c) The Committee endorses the comments of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations concerning the application by Cuba of Convention No.  and wishes to stress that section  of Legislative Decree No.  of  aims at establishing and maintaining a single trade union system; it requests the Government to take the necessary measures to bring this provision into line with Convention No. .(d) The Committee requests the Government to send, as soon as possible, the precise and detailed observations which it has not supplied on the allegations concerning:(i) the arrest of two workers of the ""Pedero Marrero"" brewery for having suggested that an independent trade union should be set up;(ii) the arrest of between  and  workers in the ""Central Chaparra"" sugar refinery for having tried to organise an independent trade union;(iii) the arrest of some  peasants in the province of Sancti Spiritus for participating in collective protest actions.Geneva,  November .

In another communication dated  May , the complainant organisation submitted further information in support of its allegations. The texts of both these communications were passed on to the Government, which furnished its observations in a letter dated  May , from the Permanent Delegation of Cuba in Geneva.
.Cuba has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.With regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) for the reasons stated in paragraph , to decide that there would be no point in examining further the allegations concerning the requirement of a work book in connection with the exercise of trade union rights and, for the reasons stated in paragraph , to decide that the allegations concerning provisions on the dissolution and suspension of trade union organisations call for no further examination;(b) as regards the allegations concerning the right of workers to establish organisations of their own choosing:(i) to draw the Government's attention to the importance it has always attached to the principle contained in Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Cuba, whereby workers have the right "" to establish ... organisations of their own choosing without previous authorisation "";(ii) to reaffirm the conclusions of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, mentioned in paragraph  above, according to which certain provisions of Cuban legislation, establishing a single trade union branch in each workplace composed of all the workers in the same workplace (with which provisions all trade union organisations existing before the promulgation of the Act were obliged also to comply) are incompatible with Article  of Convention No. ;(iii) to request the Government to keep it informed of any measures the Government might have adopted or might envisage adopting in order to eliminate the discrepancy between its legislation in this respect and the above-mentioned principle;(c) in connection with the allegations concerning government control of workers' organisations:(i) to reaffirm the importance it has always attached to the principle embodied in Article  of Convention No. , ratified by Cuba, that workers' organisations have the right to organise their administration and activities without interference from the public authorities which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof;(ii) to take note of the Government's statement that the provisions relating to the powers of the Ministry of Labour to control occupational organisations have not been applied to workers' organisations and to note moreover that the provision specifically mentioned by the complainants has been repealed;(d) in connection with the allegations concerning the right to bargain collectively:(i) to take note of the Government's statement that the Ministry of Labour is empowered to regulate wages, working hours, leave and conditions of work, that these regulations must be observed in collective agreements and that they are always issued in consultation with the workers' organisations;(ii) however, in view of the fact that such important aspects of conditions of work thus virtually remain outside the scope of collective bargaining, the authorities having moreover the power to intervene in certain cases by means of decisions which may determine the content or suspend the execution of collective agreements, to draw the Government's attention to the importance it has always attached to the principle that the right of workers' organisations to bargain freely with employers on conditions of work constitutes an essential element in freedom of association, and that the public authorities should refrain from any interference that would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof;(iii) to repeat to the Government the importance of the principle of voluntary negotiation on conditions of employment contained in Article  of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Cuba, with which the legislation of the country is not in line;(e) to bring these conclusions to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.",-1,1968,Cuba
52,".The complaints, sent from Miami (United States), are contained in a letter dated  February , signed by Mr. Reinaldo Pico Ramn, General Secretary of the Cuban Transport Workers' Revolutionary Organisation (in exile) (O.R.T.), and in a letter dated  March  from the Economic Corporations of Cuba (in exile). In another letter, of March , the O.R.T supplied further information in support of its complaint. These three letters were transmitted to the Government by a communication dated  May .
.At its meetings in May and November  and February  the Committee, not having received the observations requested from the Government, decided to adjourn its examination of the case.
.By letters dated  June,  November and  December  the O.R.T made further allegations, of which the Government was also informed.
.The Government furnished its observations in a communication dated  April  transmitted by the Cuban Permanent Delegation in Geneva.
.At its meeting in May  the Committee decided to adjourn its examination of the case until its next meeting.
.Cuba has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  February  the O.R.T denounces the inhuman treatment to which thousands of imprisoned workers are subjected and the absence of freedom of association which, according to the complainants, prevents the Cuban workers from electing their representatives freely. With regard to itself, the O.R.T states that it is composed of exiled Cuban workers from the transport sector and is affiliated with the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unionists (C.L.A.S.C.). In its later communications the O.R.T cites specific acts and statements by the government authorities, which, it asserts, prove its allegations to be well founded.
.The complaint of the Economic Corporations of Cuba (in exile), dated  March , states that the Government only defends state interests and openly attacks the right to organise, abolishing the normal type of employer or management system and substituting the State as sole employer. The complainants also state that in Cuba a system of compulsory labour has been established, contravening, inter alia, the right to free collective bargaining. In Cuba, they add, the workers used to have a say in the negotiations for wage fixing, either directly or in collective agreements or through their representatives on the tripartite minimum wage boards. In , however, the complainants allege, these committees were abolished by the Government, which in  "" prohibited wage fixing by collective agreement, this power remaining from thereon in the hands of the State "". In  and  the Government is said to have established the Communist system of "" wage categories "". The complainants also state that the above-mentioned measures contravene International Labour Conventions on forced labour, minimum wages, etc.
.In its reply of  April  the Government questions the right of the two complainant organisations to submit complaints to the I.L.O regarding alleged violations of freedom of association, but has nevertheless supplied detailed observations on some of the points raised.
.Rejecting the receivability of the complaint made by the Economic Corporations of Cuba (in exile), the Government repeats the arguments by which, in Case No. , it opposed the Committee's examination of another complaint by the same organisation. The Government considers it necessary also to draw attention to "" the highly suspect representation made after so long by the complainant organisation or members thereof in favour of the development and protection of trade union rights and social gains achieved by the workers..."". It considers that the complainants are pursuing mere propagandist objectives and aim at bringing about a return to the situation which prevailed before the establishment of the present social and economic system.
.With regard to the complaints presented by the O.R.T, the Government again refers to its previous arguments, when it defined its position "" on allegations of this kind which have no connection with the defence of the trade union movement in our country but, on the contrary, constitute an endeavour to raise to the international plane matters of internal and ideological policy and even mere cases of common criminal law"". The Government considers it necessary to establish, firstly, "" the true character of the complainant organisation, the circumstances surrounding its championing of the matter and the motives of its promoters "". The Government states that the O.R.T is not a national, still less an international, industrial association enjoying consultative status. Nor, the Government states, is this a matter of activities carried on outside Cuban territory by an organisation which might once have existed in Cuba. According to the Government, the allegations emanate from a new entity whose members are neither de facto nor de jure Cuban transport workers which, in the Government's opinion, precludes them from referring to themselves as an industrial association "" for the purposes set forth in I.L.O. Conventions Nos.  and  "". The Government goes on to declare that the O.R.T is totally unconnected with the interests of the transport workers and their legitimate organisations, which have a membership in Cuba of more than , workers.
.The Government considers it proper that the Governing Body and the Committee on Freedom of Association should not regard themselves as bound by any national definition of an industrial association but maintains that such an approach does not entitle them to attribute at will the character of industrial association to any association whatsoever, regardless of its object, nature and the manner of its establishment, since this would open the way to action of universal scope incompatible with the Constitutional provisions which define the competence of the International Labour Organisation.
.With regard to the substance of the questions raised by the Economic Corporations of Cuba (in exile), the Government rejects as "" completely and utterly false "" the version given by the complainants of certain facts and of certain labour or social legislation. The Government states that since it came to power on  January  no Constitutional or legal provision has been adopted to prohibit strikes, nor is bargaining with regard to contracts, either individually or collectively, proscribed or obstructed, nor has the wage system been organised to the detriment of the workers' interests.
.With regard to the substance of the questions raised by the O.R.T, the Government also rejects the version of the facts given in the complaint.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to draw the Government's attention to the importance which the Governing Body has always attached to Article  of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), which Cuba has ratified, according to which measures shall be taken for the full development and utilisation of machinery for voluntary negotiation, and, subject thereto, to decide that the allegations presented in this case do not call for further examination.",-1,1966,Cuba
53,".This case was already examined by the Committee at its sessions in May , February  and May . On these occasions the Committee submitted to the Governing Body interim reports on the case which appear in paragraphs  to  of its rd Report, paragraphs  to  of its th Report and paragraphs  to  of its th Report respectively. These three reports were approved by the Governing Body.
.In the previous stages of its examination of the case the Committee formed certain conclusions regarding the sentencing of  of the  trade unionists whose imprisonment was specifically referred to in the complaint of  December  from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.
.The Committee now has the observations and information, dated  December , submitted by the Government in respect of the seven remaining persons, as requested in paragraph  (c) of the th Report of the Committee.
.Cuba has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.According to the facts given in the complaint, the seven trade unionists in question were: Luis Miguel Linsuain, General Secretary of the Gastronomic Federation of Oriente Province; Alberto Garcia, General Secretary of the National Medical Federation; Antonio Dagas, Deputy General Secretary of the Cuban section of the Spanish trade union organisation, National Confederation of Labour (C.N.T.); Leandro Barreras, member of the Executive Board of the National Federation of Sugar Workers; Norberto Abreu, Secretary of the Federation of Printing and Allied Trades; Carmen Mndez Linares, employee of the Confederation of Cuban Workers; and Juan Manuel Reines, leader of the trade union section of the clandestine movement.
.From the Government's communication dated  December  and from the texts of the judgments attached thereto it emerges that all these persons-except Mr. Leandro Barreras-were judged by revolutionary courts or councils of war by virtue of penal provisions quoted in the respective judgments, and sentenced to various terms  imprisonment.
.According to the information submitted by the Government, Mr. Luis Linsuain was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment on  May  for an offence against the state authorities. He is accused of taking part in the activities of a counter-revolutionary group known as M.D.C, which is alleged to have planned to overthrow the Government by means of an armed rising, acts of sabotage, stocking and transporting arms, and attacks on government officials. Mr. Alberto Garcia was sentenced to  years' imprisonment "" for his direct participation in acts constituting an offence against the state authorities "", which are alleged to have consisted of counter-revolutionary activities in which he took part as an active member of a clandestine organisation known as the "" National Liberation Army "", in which, according to the judgment, he held the rank of captain. The sentence was passed on  October . Mr. Antonio Dagas was sentenced to three years and seven months' imprisonment "" for his direct participation in acts constituting an offence against the state authorities ""; together with other persons, he is said to have committed acts of terrorism, such as planting a bomb under a car parked in front of the offices of the C.T.C.R. (Confederation of Workers of Revolutionary Cuba). Mr. Norberto Abreu was sentenced on  June  to  years' imprisonment "" for his direct participation in acts constituting offences against the unity and stability of the nation "" as a member of the counter-revolutionary Organisation known as the ""Movement of  November"", in which he is said to have been responsible for propaganda throughout the country. Juan Manuel Reines and Maria del Carmen Mndez Linares were sentenced on  October  to nine and three years' imprisonment respectively "" for their direct participation in carrying out acts constituting offences against the unity and stability of the nation, and against the state authorities, arson, violence and possession of explosives "". Both are alleged to have belonged to an organisation known as the "" People's Revolutionary Movement "", which is said to have carried out acts of sabotage directed against industrial and commercial centres as well as against public services.
.With regard to Mr. Leandro Barreras, the Government states that the investigations which have been carried out have revealed no evidence whatsoever of any legal proceedings nor of a previous criminal record to show that this person has undergone or is undergoing a prison sentence or temporary deprivation of freedom.
.From the judgments sent by the Government it emerges that the additional penalties inflicted on the accused included the confiscation of all their goods. Names of defence counsel are also given. In some cases these appear to have been chosen by the accused and in others to have been appointed by the courts.
.The Government repeats what it stated in another case examined by the Committee, in respect of the standards applied by the revolutionary courts. It declares that in these cases too the accused participated directly in the commission of serious and sufficiently distinct acts, defined as offences under legislation promulgated before they were committed, "" and that they have nothing to do with genuine trade union militancy and activities "".
.The Committee notes that the Government has been unable to find any evidence that Mr. Leandro Barreras, one of the  trade unionists named in the complaint, has been imprisoned or tried. It points out, on the basis of the observations of the Government and of the texts of the judgments submitted by the latter at various stages in the examination of the case, that the acts imputed to each of the  remaining trade unionists, which provided grounds for the sentences, do not appear to bear any relation to trade union activities. The Committee has already pointed out that the procedure applied by the revolutionary courts dealing with these cases is the extraordinary procedure laid down in the  Act respecting Trials in Cuba Under Arms.
.This case was considered by the Committee at its meetings held in May  and February , together with Cases Nos.  and , when it submitted the interim conclusions in respect of it contained in paragraphs  to  of the rd Report and in paragraphs  to  of the th Report respectively, both of which were approved by the Governing Body.
.By a letter dated  April  transmitted by the Cuban Permanent Delegation in Geneva, the Government submitted some of the additional information requested in paragraph  of the th Report of the Committee.
.Cuba has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its complaint of  December  the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (I.C.F.T.U.) stated that a number of trade union officials had been imprisoned for alleged "" counter-revolutionary activities "" and requested the Governing Body to set up a fact-finding commission with a view to ascertaining the equity of the judicial procedure applied to the officials in question and the way in which they were treated in prison.
.At its meeting in February  the Committee had before it a communication from the Government dated  November , supplying information with respect to  of the  persons whose names and trade union activities were listed in the complaint, with the texts of the judgments given against them in public hearings by various Councils of War (revolutionary courts). On that occasion, in paragraph  of its th Report, the Committee recommended the Governing Body, among other things, with regard to the  trade union officials on whose situation the Government had supplied information, to emphasise to the Government, as it had already done previously, the importance which it attached to the principle that trade unionists, like all other persons, should be entitled to the safeguards of normal judicial procedure, and to invite the Government to co-operate by furnishing, as soon as possible, detailed information concerning the present situation of the trade union officials mentioned in the complaint.
.This recommendation having been approved by the Governing Body, the request for additional information referred to was brought to the notice of the Government by a letter dated  March .
.The annexes to the communication of  April  from the Cuban Permanent Delegation in Geneva contain the additional information submitted by the Cuban Government respecting five others of the  trade union officials named in the complaint, as well as the text of various relevant judgments pronounced by various Councils of War in public hearings.
.It emerges from this information and the judgments that Mr. Angel Custodio Linares (called Angel Custodio in the complaint) was sentenced to  years' deprivation of freedom for having been an accessory to the offence of theft with breaking and entering, by virtue of sections  and  (paragraph ) of the Code of Social Defence as amended by the provisions of Act No.  of  March . According to the text of the",-1,1964,Cuba
54,"judgment, this offence was committed when the accused, at a date not specified in the judgment, entered the dwelling of a third party, breaking the padlock, and stealing a shirt and some bedclothes. Mrs. Ada Gonzlez Gallo was sentenced to  years' imprisonment, for complicity, with eight other persons, in acts which, according to the Council of War, constituted offences against the state authorities and against the stability and unity of the nation, and arson, defined and made punishable by section  (paragraph ), taken in conjunction with section , sections  (paragraph A) and  of the Code of Social Defence as amended by Acts No.  of  July  and No.  of  January . In the judgment it is stated to have been proved that Ada Gonzlez Gallo was among persons selected by the "" forces of regression "" for the destruction of workplaces, industrial plant, etc., belonging to the nation, and especially a particular department store in Havana, which was set fire to by a co-accused. Mr. Jorge Blanco Ferrando was sentenced, with others, to nine years' rigorous imprisonment, having been accused of belonging to an organisation, not identified in the judgment, dedicated to various counter-revolutionary activities such as the distribution of propaganda, the sale of bonds, carrying arms and explosives and hiding fugitives. The judgment states that some days before  April , the date of an armed invasion of the Cuban territory, the accused were engaged in great activity to facilitate the invasion. The Council of War considered that these acts constituted an offence against the state authorities, defined by section  (paragraph ) of the Code of Social Defence as amended by Act No. .
.According to another of the judgments, Mrs. Sara Carranza Astiastegui (called Sara Carranza Arriastegui by the complainants) was sentenced to  years' rigorous imprisonment for having committed an offence against the unity and stability of the nation, defined by section  of the Code of Social Defence as amended by Act No. . The Council of War declared it to have been proved that this person and the other accused belonged to an organisation styled "" Movement of  November "", to which it attributes the execution of the plans of various foreign organisations and governments. The judgment declares it to have been proved that Sara Carranza Astiastegui was the national finance co-ordinator of this organisation and that as such she "" received considerable sums from abroad which were distributed to the unit chiefs for their expenses "".
.The judgments referred to in the two preceding paragraphs stated that the additional penalties inflicted on the accused include confiscation of all of their goods. The judgments also indicated that the accused were defended by a number of counsel, whose names are listed.
.With respect to Mr. Arnaldo Muller Sotolongo, the Government stated that this person was sentenced to nine years' rigorous imprisonment by the revolutionary court of the district of Havana, by a judgment dated  April , on the charge of offences against the unity and stability of the nation, arson and wilful damage. The case in question was the same as that relating to the sentencing of Mr. Reinaldo Gonzlez, considered by the Committee under Case No. .
.The Government repeated what it had said earlier regarding the national provisions on jurisdiction and competence, the penal provisions and procedural safeguards applied. It added that in all cases the accused participated directly in the commission of serious and sufficiently distinct acts, defined and made punishable under legislation promulgated prior to the offence, and that the activities in question had nothing in common with trade union militancy and activities.
.With respect to the seven other persons on whom additional information was requested, the Government stated that in spite of its wishes and the zeal displayed by the competent officials, it was not able to submit any information on these cases and repeated its earlier observation on the need for further information or concrete antecedents in order that the cases might be identified.
.With regard to the five persons in respect of whom the Government has now sent information, the Committee observes that their situation is similar to that of those other persons on whose sentences the Government provided the information examined by the Committee at its meeting in February . These five persons were in fact judged in a public hearing before revolutionary courts or Councils of War by virtue of penal provisions quoted in the respective judgments, and sentenced to various terms of imprisonment. In all these cases the alleged facts on which the sentences were passed, as emerges from the information and the texts of the judgments submitted by the Government, do not appear to bear any relation to trade union activities. From the Government's observations it seems that these cases too were conducted in accordance with the exceptional procedure laid down in the  Act governing trials in the Republic of Cuba under arms, owing to the fact that the offences of which these persons had been accused were regarded as "" counter-revolutionary "".
.As in Case No.  already mentioned, and earlier in this same case, the Committee again recalled in this respect that in cases where it has established that an exceptional procedure is being followed, it had always reiterated the importance it attached to the observance in such circumstances of all the guarantees afforded by due legal process. In the cases in point, it emerges from the information submitted by the Government that the persons concerned were able to employ the services of defence counsel, but it did not appear that they enjoyed safeguards such as appeals for re-evaluation and appeals against the sentences imposed.
.With regard to the seven persons whom the Government states it cannot identify, the Committee notes that, according to the text of the complaint as communicated to the Government, the trade union leaders in question are Luis Miguel Linsuain, General Secretary of the Gastronomic Federation of Oriente Province, who was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment; Alberto Garcia, General Secretary of the National Medical Federation, sentenced to  years' imprisonment; Antonio Dagas, Deputy General Secretary of the Cuban section of the Spanish trade union organisation National Confederation of Labour (C.N.T.), imprisoned in La Cubana fort; Leandro Barreras, member of the Executive Board of the National Federation of Sugar Workers; Norberto Abreu, Secretary of the Federation of Printing and Allied Trades; Carmen Mndez Linares, employee of the Confederation of Cuban Workers (C.T.C.), sentenced to  years' imprisonment; and Juan Manuel Reines, sentenced to ten years' imprisonment for being an officer of the trade union section of the clandestine movement.
.The Committee duly appreciates the grounds on which the Government declares itself unable to supply any information regarding the situation of the persons listed in paragraph  above. Nevertheless, in order to be able to formulate its conclusions with respect to the allegations concerning them and the request of the complainants for the setting up of a fact-finding committee, the Committee would be grateful to the Government if it would communicate any information which it might be possible to obtain by additional investigation in this matter and, in any case, be good enough to specify as quickly as possible whether the persons in question are or are not in fact being detained or serving prison sentences in Cuba, and, if so, to communicate the grounds for their detention or sentence and the texts of the judgments passed in respect of them.
.Under these circumstances, as regards the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to take note of the information submitted by the Government in respect of five of the  trade union officers whose situation has been examined in this case since the approval of the th Report of the Committee, from which information it appears that the said persons have been sentenced to various terms of imprisonment by virtue of facts and penal provisions which have no connection with trade union activities;(b) to draw the attention of the Government once again, however, having regard to the exceptional procedure followed in the present cases, to the importance it attaches to the principle that trade unionists, like all other persons, should be entitled to the safeguards of normal judicial procedure;(c) to request the Government to be good enough to supply information concerning the seven remaining trade unionists of the  listed in the complaint, which it might obtain by additional investigation in the matter, and, in any case, to state as quickly as possible whether these seven persons are or are not in fact being detained or serving prison sentences in Cuba, and, if so, to communicate the grounds for their detention or sentence and the text of the judgments passed with respect to them;(d) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a new report once it has received the additional information requested of the Government in subparagraph (c) above.
.The Committee considered these three cases together at",-1,1964,Cuba
55,"its meeting held in May , when it submitted the interim conclusions contained in paragraphs  to  of its rd Report, which was approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session (May-June ). In that report the Committee submitted its definitive conclusions and recommendations concerning two series of allegations: (a) those relating to the imprisonment of the trade union leader Reinaldo Gonzlez and (b) those relating to the dissolution of employers' organisations. Thus the only allegations consideration of which has remained in suspense are those put forward by I.C.F.T.U concerning the detention of trade union officials; in this connection the Government was asked to supply detailed information (see paragraph  of the aforesaid report).
.In a communication dated  November , transmitted by the Permanent Delegation of Cuba in Geneva on  December , the Government answered that request for information.
.Cuba has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the  trade union officials on whose situation the Government has supplied information, to emphasise to the Government, as it has already done previously, the importance which it attaches to the principle that accused trade unionists, like all other persons, should be entitled to the safeguards of normal judicial procedure;(b) to invite the Government to co-operate by furnishing, as soon as possible, detailed information concerning the present situation of the trade union officials in question and of those referred to in paragraphs  and  above, as well as the texts of the judgments handed down in each instance and their grounds; and meanwhile to postpone consideration of the case;(c) to take note of the present interim report of the Committee, it being understood that the Committee will report further to the Governing Body when the information referred to in subparagraph (b) above has been received.
.In accordance with the practice which it has followed in certain earlier cases, the Committee has found it convenient to consolidate and consider together the three cases relating to Cuba, which concern the complaints presented by the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions (I.F.C.T.U.), the Economic Corporations of Cuba (in exile) and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (I.C.F.T.U.).

.In the circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the  trade union officials on whose situation the Government has supplied information, to emphasise to the Government, as it has already done previously, the importance which it attaches to the principle that accused trade unionists, like all other persons, should be entitled to the safeguards of normal judicial procedure;(b) to invite the Government to co-operate by furnishing, as soon as possible, detailed information concerning the present situation of the trade union officials in question and of those referred to in paragraphs  and  above, as well as the texts of the judgments handed down in each instance and their grounds; and meanwhile to postpone consideration of the case;(c) to take note of the present interim report of the Committee, it being understood that the Committee will report further to the Governing Body when the information referred to in subparagraph (b) above has been received.
.In accordance with the practice which it has followed in certain earlier cases, the Committee has found it convenient to consolidate and consider together the three cases relating to Cuba, which concern the complaints presented by the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions (I.F.C.T.U.), the Economic Corporations of Cuba (in exile) and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (I.C.F.T.U.).
.Cuba has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.With regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:
.The complaint is contained in a communication dated  February . It was brought to the attention of the Government, which replied to it on  April .
.Cuba has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants have submitted to the Committee a lengthy document in which it is alleged that the Cuban Government has violated the principles and standards laid down in Conventions Nos.  and  in regard to both employers and workers. As regards the actual matter of the right of association of employers, the complainants allege that as from  January , when the present rgime came to power, it began by progressive stages to restrict and interfere with the free operation of the employers' organisations, arbitrarily decreeing that there should be intervention therein, persecuting their members and leaders, thus forcing them into exile, and finally ordering the dissolution of the employers' associations, the majority of which were wound up during  and . The complainants add that in making these interventions the Ministry of Labour invoked Act No.  of  December , which empowered the Minister to order the taking of such measures where in his opinion circumstances rendered it necessary for the maintenance in operation of the centres of production. This Act, which was in force for  months before being repealed by Act No.  of  May , was the pretext used to interfere with and finally dissolve all the employers' organisations. The greater part of the document is concerned with various nationalisation and expropriation measures taken by the Government.
.In its reply the Government merely states that in regard to this case, in view of the political and ideological implications which naturally arise from it, it wishes to draw the attention of the Governing Body to the importance of the right of peoples to self-determination, and their freedom to choose the economic systems and political structures best suited to their desires for progress and culture, in peaceful co-existence with other peoples and different systems.
.The Committee considers that the Government's reply does not contain any information specific enough to enable it to form an opinion as to the merits of the complaint. The complainants allege in fact that the Minister interfered with employers' organisations, invoking Act No.  of , "" where in his opinion circumstances rendered it necessary for the maintenance in operation of the centres of production "". The complainants also declare that this interference with the associations culminated in their dissolution. The Government makes no reference to these specific allegations, nor to the reasons which motivated the Government's actions.
.The Committee observes that Cuba has ratified Convention No. , Article  of which provides that employers as well as workers, without distinction whatsoever, shall have the right to establish organisations of their own choosing without previous authorisation; Article  stipulates that public authorities shall refrain from any interference which would restrict the right of organisations to draw up their Constitutions and rules, to elect their representatives in full freedom, to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes; while Article  lays down that organisations shall not be liable to be dissolved or suspended by administrative authority. Moreover, the Committee also observes that, according to a statement made by a Government representative to the Committee on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations at the International Labour Conference in , employers may form associations in conformity with the Royal Decree of 
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to express its regret that, more than a year after the complaint was brought to its attention, the Government still has not furnished concrete observations concerning the specific allegations made in the complaint ;(b) to request the Government to be good enough to furnish its observations as soon as possible, particularly in regard to the measures taken in respect of employers' associations, the legal enactments invoked in this connection and the procedure followed ;(c) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will report further as soon as it has received the information requested from the Government.",-1,1963,Cuba
57,".The Committee considered these three cases together at its meeting held in May , when it submitted the interim conclusions contained in paragraphs  to  of its rd Report, which was approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session (May-June ). In that report the Committee submitted its definitive conclusions and recommendations concerning two series of allegations: (a) those relating to the imprisonment of the trade union leader Reinaldo Gonzlez and (b) those relating to the dissolution of employers' organisations. Thus the only allegations consideration of which has remained in suspense are those put forward by I.C.F.T.U concerning the detention of trade union officials; in this connection the Government was asked to supply detailed information (see paragraph  of the aforesaid report).
.In a communication dated  November , transmitted by the Permanent Delegation of Cuba in Geneva on  December , the Government answered that request for information.
.Cuba has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).

.Cuba has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.With regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:
.The International Federation of Christian Trade Unions (I.F.C.T.U.) addressed to the Director-General on  February  a telegram containing a request for urgent intervention by the I.L.O on the ground that the Cuban trade union leader Mr. Reinaldo Gonzlez was in imminent danger of execution. The Director-General brought the contents of this telegram to the notice of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Cuba by two telegrams dated  February .
.By a letter of  February  the Director-General transmitted the complaint to the Government of Cuba in accordance with the normal procedure for the examination of complaints of alleged infringements of trade union rights. In his letter he explained to the Government that, as matters involving human life were raised in the complaint, the case fell within the category of cases regarded by the Governing Body as urgent, in accordance with the decision taken by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ), and, for this reason, requested the Government to furnish as speedy a reply as possible.
.The Government replied on  April .
.Cuba has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.Repeatedly in the past, where allegations that trade union leaders or workers had been arrested or detained for trade union activities had been met by governments with statements that the arrests or detentions were made for subversive activities, for reasons of internal security or for common law crimes, the Committee has followed the rule that the governments concerned should be requested to submit further and as precise information as possible concerning the arrests or detentions and the precise reasons which led to them. If, in certain cases, the Committee has concluded that allegations relating to the arrest or detention of trade union militants did not call for further examination, this has been after it has received information from the governments concerned showing sufficiently precisely and with sufficient detail that the arrests or detentions were in no way occasioned by trade union activities but solely by activities outside the trade union sphere, which were either prejudicial to public order or of a political nature. Moreover, the Committee has repeatedly asked governments to send information on judicial proceedings and their results, in view of the importance which such information might have in aiding the Committee to appreciate whether or not allegations were well founded.
.In the present case the Committee observes that Mr. Reinaldo Gonzlez is now serving a prison sentence after trial by the courts of his country. In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to request the Government to furnish detailed information as to the offences of which the person concerned was accused, together with information with respect to the judicial proceedings and the text of the judgment handed down, and decides to wait before formulating its conclusions, until it has fuller information with regard to the circumstances which led to the detention and conviction of Mr. Reinaldo Gonzlez.
.The I.F.C.T.U addressed to the Director-General on  February  a telegram containing a request for urgent intervention by the I.L.O on the ground that a Cuban trade union leader, Mr. Reynol Gonzlez, was in imminent danger of execution. The Director-General brought the contents of this telegram to the notice of the Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Cuba by two telegrams dated  February .
.By a letter of  February  the Director-General transmitted the complaint to the Government of Cuba in accordance with the normal procedure for the examination of complaints of alleged infringements of trade union rights. In his letter he explained to the Government that, as matters involving human life were raised in the complaint, the case fell within the category of cases regarded by the Governing Body as urgent, in accordance with the decision taken by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ), and, for this reason, requested the Government to furnish as speedy a reply as possible.
.Cuba has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.At its th Session (February ) the Committee examined the case for the first time and, noting that no reply had been received from the Government, recommended the Governing Body to request the Government of Cuba to furnish its observations on the complaint as a matter of urgency.
.The Government of Cuba was informed of this decision by a letter dated  March . On the same day the Director-General received a note from the Government, dated  March , stating that his letter of  February , mentioned in paragraph , had been referred to the competent organ of the Revolutionary Government for appropriate action. In a further note, dated  April , the Government repeated its statement to the effect that the complaint had been referred to the competent organ of the Revolutionary Government and added that this had been done so that, after study of the complaint, the appropriate observations could be made within the prescribed time.
.At its st Session (May ), not having received the Government's observations, the Committee recommended the Governing Body to request the Government of Cuba once again to furnish its observations on the complaint as a matter of urgency. This request was communicated to the Government by a letter dated  June , and the Government replied by a note dated  June  indicating once again that the said request had been referred to the competent organ of the Revolutionary Government for appropriate action. The request was repeated by letter of  August .
.At its nd Session (October ), not having yet received the Government's observations, the Committee had to adjourn examination of the case and made a special request to the Government of Cuba to furnish the information in question in time for it to be taken into account by the Committee when it examined the merits of the case at its following session. This decision was communicated to the Government by a letter dated  November  and brought once more to its attention by a letter of  January .
.At its rd Session (February ), still not having received the Government's observations, the Committee had once again to adjourn examination of",-1,1962,Cuba
58,"the case and made a special request to the Government of Cuba to furnish the information in question as a matter of urgency prior to the following session in May . This decision was communicated to the Government by a letter dated  March  and brought once more to its attention by a letter dated  April . Still no reply has been received from the Government.
.While it deeply regrets not having received a reply which would already have enabled it to examine this case in full knowledge of the facts, the Committee still hopes that the Government of Cuba, which, in three communications dated  March,  April and  June , stated that it had submitted the complaint to the competent organs for the formulation of the appropriate observations, promising in that dated  April  to furnish a reply, will not fail to comply as a matter of urgency with its promise by sending the information requested repeatedly from  February  onwards.
.In all the circumstances the Committee, having regard to the fact that a question of life or death is at stake in this case, recommends the Governing Body:(a) to deplore the fact that the Government of Cuba, despite the promise contained in its communication dated  April  and the requests addressed to it on eight occasions, has not furnished the reply necessary to permit of the examination of this case in full knowledge of the facts;(b) to express to the Government its earnest hope that it will not fail to fulfil, as a matter of urgency, the promise to furnish a reply made in its communication dated  April .

.In particular, as no reply had been received from the Government, the Governing Body decided, on the request of the Committee, to request the Government of Cuba to furnish its observations on the complaint as a matter of urgency.
.The Government of Cuba was informed of this decision by a letter dated  March . On the same day the Office received a letter from the Government, dated  March , stating that the Director-General's letter of  February  mentioned in paragraph  above had been referred to the competent organ of the Revolutionary Government. In a further letter, dated  April , the Government repeats the statement that the matter had been referred to the competent organ in question and adds that this has been done in order to enable the latter to study the matter and to prepare observations. No further communication has been received from the Government.

59,".The Committee has already examined this case at its th Session (November ), when it submitted to the Governing Body a provisional report which appears in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ).
.Cuba has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants' allegations, analysed in paragraph  of the Committee's th Report, relate in particular to the shooting of three Cuban workers, William Lesant Naser, Julio Casielles Amig and Orilio Luis Mndez Prez, who had been accused of acts of sabotage.
.After examining the complainants' allegations, and the Government's reply, the Committee formulated, in paragraph  of this same report, certain recommendations and a request for additional information, in the following terms:
.In all the circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to reaffirm the duty of the Committee to examine all complaints which are receivable under the rules in force, irrespective of the government to which they relate, with equal impartiality;(b) to decide that the complaint is receivable, having regard to the principle on which the Committee has acted consistently since its First Report that a government cannot deny the right of complainants to submit a complaint by reason of measures taken against them which are alleged in the complaint to have violated freedom of association;(c) to reaffirm that political matters not involving the exercise of freedom of association are outside the competence of the Committee and to decide that, in these circumstances, the Committee has no jurisdiction of the complaint in so far as the facts out of which it arose may have been acts of sabotage and is likewise incompetent to deal with the political matters referred to in the Government's reply;(d) to reaffirm that the fact that a complaint may have a political aspect does not relieve the Committee of its duty of examining whether or not an allegation of violation of freedom of association is well founded;(e) to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that it is bound by the obligations imposed by the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Cuba;(f) to reaffirm that the question whether a matter relates to a criminal offence or to the exercise of trade union rights is not one which can be determined unilaterally by the government concerned;(g) to request the Government, in accordance with the practice always followed in cases in which allegations as to sentences passed on trade unionists have been met with statements that such sentences were passed because of subversive activities or common law crimes, to indicate, in order to enable the Committee to reach a conclusion as to how far any question of freedom of association was involved, whether the appropriate and responsible court by which the sentences of death in the case of Messrs. Lesant Naser, Casielles Amig and Mndez Prez were pronounced was an ordinary court of law, and, if not, to give particulars as to its nature and procedure and to request the Government to furnish the text of the judgment given;(h) to decide that an emotional popular demand for the execution of a capital sentence cannot be invoked before the Freedom of Association Committee as evidence upon the question whether or not there has been a violation of freedom of association;(i) to draw the attention of the Government to the importance which the Governing Body has always attached to the fact that freedom from government interference in the holding and proceedings of trade union meetings constitutes an essential element of trade union rights and to the principle that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof;(j) to draw the attention of the Government to the importance which the Governing Body has always attached to the principle embodied in Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Cuba, that workers' organisations should have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom;(k) to draw the attention of the Government to the importance which the Governing Body attaches to the principle, embodied in Article  of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Cuba, that workers should enjoy adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment, including acts calculated to cause the dismissal of or otherwise prejudice a worker by reason of union membership or because of participation in union activities.
.These recommendations, and the request for further information contained in subparagraph (g) of paragraph  of the th Report, were communicated to the Government by letter dated  November  and were again brought to its attention by letter dated  January .
.Having received no reply from the Government, at its th Session (February ) the Committee adjourned its examination of the case until its following session.,
.The Government was informed of this decision by letter dated  March  in which it was asked to furnish the information in question as early as possible and in any case before  April . A letter of reminder was sent to the Government on  April .
.As the information requested from the Government had still not been received, the Committee, at its st Session (May ), recommended the Governing Body to request "" the Government of Cuba to furnish as a matter of urgency the information requested in paragraph  (g) of the th Report of the Committee "".
.This request for information was communicated by letter of  June  to the Government of Cuba and an acknowledgment of receipt dated  June  was received indicating that the request had been transmitted to the "" competent body of the revolutionary Government for appropriate action "". On  August  the Government was sent another letter of reminder about the said request for information.
.Having received no reply from the Government, the Committee, at its nd Session (October ), adjourned its examination of the case until its following session.
.This decision was communicated to the Government by letter dated  November  also containing a request that it be good enough to send the said information at the earliest possible moment, and in any case not later than  January . A further letter of reminder was sent to the Government on  January .
.Not having received the information requested, the Committee, at its rd Session (February ), once more adjourned consideration of the case and requested the Government to furnish the information requested as speedily as possible, in time for it to be taken into account by the Committee when it examined the merits of the case at its following session.,
.This decision was communicated to the Government by letter dated  March  in which it was asked to furnish the said information at the earliest possible moment and before  April  at the latest. A letter of reminder was sent to the Government dated  April .
.The Committee notes that since its decision at its th Session (November ) to request certain further information in order to proceed with the examination of the case, and despite the despatch to the Government of  letters on the subject, it has been obliged to adjourn its examination of the case at its th, st, nd and rd Sessions, not having received the information requested.
.In regard to the merits of the case, and in the absence of a material reply from the Government of Cuba concerning the nature of the court which condemned Messrs. William Lesant Naser, Julio Casielles Amig and Orilio Luis Mndez Prez to death, on the procedure followed by that court and the text of the judgment given, the Committee cannot do otherwise than place on record that, in several earlier cases, it has stressed the importance it has always attached to the principle that when trade unionists are accused of political or criminal offences which the government considers to be outside the scope of their trade union activities, they should be given prompt and fair trial by an impartial and independent judicial authority, which principle takes on unusual importance in this case as the three trade unionists accused were sentenced to death and shot. If in certain cases the Committee has concluded that allegations relating to arrests or detentions of trade union militants did not call for further examination, this has been after it has received further information from the government showing sufficiently precisely and with sufficient detail that the arrests or detentions were in no way occasioned by trade union activities, but solely by activities outside the trade union sphere which were either prejudicial to public order or of a political nature.
.Consequently, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to draw the attention",-1,1961,Cuba
60,"of the Government to the importance it has always attached to the principle that when trade unionists are accused of political or criminal offences which the government concerned considers to be outside the scope of their trade union activities, they should be given prompt and fair trial by an impartial and independent judicial authority, which principle takes on unusual importance in this case as the three trade unionists accused were sentenced to death and shot.
.The Committee also considers that the refusal of the Government of Cuba to co-operate with the Committee on Freedom of Association and the Governing Body calls for the formulation of certain observations which it wishes to bring to the attention of the Governing Body. Indeed, the Committee cannot but deplore the Government's repeated failure to co-operate in not having replied adequately to the reiterated requests of the Committee on Freedom of Association and the Governing Body for information on questions closely related to the fundamental rights of man to fair trial and personal freedom.
.Consequently, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to point out to the Government that it deplores the Government's repeated failure to co-operate in not replying adequately to the reiterated requests of the Committee on Freedom of Association and the Governing Body for information on questions closely related to the fundamental rights of man to a fair trial and personal freedom.
.In these circumstances the Committee, having regard to the fact that the Government has stated that the three trade unionists in question were sentenced to death and shot, recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the attention of the Government to the importance which the Governing Body has always attached-and which it attaches with particular emphasis in a case of such gravity as the present case-to the principle that when trade unionists are accused of political or criminal offences which the government concerned considers to be outside the scope of their trade union activities, they should be given prompt and fair trial by an independent judicial authority;(b) to deplore the inexplicable attitude of the government which has failed to reply adequately to  successive requests on behalf of the Committee on Freedom of Association and the Governing Body for information on questions closely related to the fundamental rights of man to fair trial and personal freedom.
.This case was examined by the Committee at its th Session (November ), when the Committee submitted to the Governing Body the conclusions contained in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ).
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to request the Government of Cuba to furnish as a matter of urgency the information requested in paragraph  (g) of the th Report of the Committee cited in paragraph  above.
.In a letter dated  February  addressed directly to the I.L.O, the Federation of Cuban Electricity, Gas and Water Workers (in Exile) submitted a complaint relating to alleged breaches of freedom of association in Cuba.
.The Government forwarded its observations in a letter dated  October .
.Cuba has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants allege that three fellow workers, viz. William Lesant Naser, Julio Casielles Amig and Orilio Luis Mndez Prez, were accused of having been materially responsible for acts of sabotage in Havana and were shot in January  after having been tried and sentenced to death "" despite the fact that it was not found possible to prove them guilty "". The complainants add that the court in this case applied a law which had not been promulgated until  days after the acts with which the accused were charged. The complainants also allege that the members of the executive committee of the Federation of Cuban Electricity, Gas and Water Workers, including the four signatories of the complaint, were, threatened by the Government to make sure that the workers publicly demanded that the revolutionary tribunals should order the shooting of the aforesaid union members and that when they flatly refused to do so the Confederation of Trade Unions "" in collusion with the Government "" called meetings which were "" packed with individuals who had no connection at all with our industry "" and dismissed all the senior officials of the Federation from the Havana district branch.
.In its reply dated  October  the Government begins by referring to the complaint as having been lodged "" by a group of four persons in exile who have conferred upon, themselves the intensely exaggerated title of the Federation of Cuban Electricity, Gas and Water Workers' "". The Government goes on to declare that "" it is deplorable that the I.L.O should have felt bound to give currency to this complaint by a group of privileged agents of the Electric Bond and Share Company against the Cuban Revolutionary People's Government, which has the support of the workers, the poor peasants, the intellectuals and the students and has organised armed militias-a Government which was bitterly fought by the United States monopolies and millionaire imperialists, by the former landowners and parasitical capitalists, by the thieving and tyrannical hack politicians dislodged from power and by the former corrupt, moneymaking, strike-breaking union leaders imposed on the workers by the tyranny of Batista "". The main contention of the Government appears to be that, while the I.L.O is prepared to examine allegations against the present Government, it did not examine complaints concerning the repression of the trade union movement under the previous rgime. The reply concludes as follows: "" There is not a trace of oppression of the workers in Cuba because the arms are in the workers' own hands and it is the workers who administer industry and the country itself. Action is only taken (in accordance with the law and with due respect for human dignity) against counter-revolutionaries, murderers, arsonists, terrorists, saboteurs and mercenaries who invade our country at the order of the United States Government. Never have the workers enjoyed so much freedom to meet, to settle their own problems, to discuss them with members of the Government, to hold demonstrations and to take part in the management and organisation of production. Only a government with the widest support among the workers and the entire people would turn the barracks into schools, form a militia, give arms to the workers and peasants and call: the people together to discuss questions of all kinds in public. Only a government with the unqualified backing of the people could defeat in less than  hours a well-planned and powerful attack launched by the United States Central Intelligence Agency with , well-armed mercenaries who made a surprise landing in the Zapata Marshes. This support is due to the fact that ours is a just and revolutionary government, a government of the workers, the poor peasants and the whole people, a government with a patriotic, democratic and socialist purpose.""
.The Government appears to question the right of four persons who, before they went into exile, were officials of the Federation of Cuban Electricity, Gas and Water Workers; to present the complaint, because, in its view, they were "" mercenaries "" who were thrown: out of office by their organisation as enemies of the new rgime.
.In paragraph  of its First Report, the Committee laid down the principle that it would be altogether inconsistent with the purpose for which the procedure for the examination of allegations concerning the infringements of trade union rights has been established for it to admit that the dissolution or purported dissolution of an organisation by governmental action extinguishes the right of the organisation to invoke the procedure. The Committee followed this principle, for example, in Case No.  relating to the Dominican Republic"" and in Case No.  relating to Cuba-, when the previous Government was in power. Pursuing the same line of reasoning, the Committee, in Case No.  relating to Venezuela examined in May , did not consider a complaint to be irreceivable because it relates to persons who no longer perform trade union duties as the result of a governmental measure dissolving the organisation to which they belonged and, in Case No.  relating to Spain  examined in October , did not consider a complaint irreceivable because former trade union leaders had set up a new organisation in a foreign country. The fact that their original organisation or a succeeding organisation has continued to exist in their own country, but under government control, has not been accepted by the Committee as a reason for refusing to entertain the complaint, although the question as to whether or not they were ousted from their old organisation by legitimate procedures is a factor which the Committee has had to consider when examining the complaint in substance.
.In the present case it is not disputed that the four signatories of the complaint were officials of the Cuban Federation of Workers",-1,1961,Cuba
61,"in Electricity, Gas and Water Undertakings, an organisation which apparently still exists in Cuba, but from which the complainants contend they were ousted as a result of threats by the Government. While the arguments of the Government on this contention are a matter for consideration when examining the merits of the case, the Committee considers that, in the circumstances, and following its earlier jurisprudence, the complaint should be regarded as receivable.
.The second contention of the Government is that no comparable complaints against the repression of the trade union movement by the previous rgime were entertained by the Committee. In fact, the Committee, in Cases No.  and , examined numerous allegations against the previous Cuban rgime, including allegations relating to arrests and acts of violence against trade unionists, and made recommendations to the Governing Body which were drawn to the notice of the Cuban Government.
.As regards the substance of the allegations, the Government declares that Messrs. Lesant Naser, Casielles Amig and Mndez Prez were arrested and sentenced in accordance with laws passed before the acts of terrorism which they committed and were convicted by an appropriate, responsible court. The Government contends that they conspired to destroy the electricity service and to commit terrorist acts and that, as the result of the activities of these persons and their associates, five of the main electrical substations in Havana were dynamited. The Government adds that no claim by the workers was involved and that no dispute with the workers was in progress and asks since when has the placing of bombs to blow up publicly owned undertakings been a trade union activity and since when has the storing of dynamite and conspiring to assassinate leaders of the Revolutionary Government and sabotaging the nationalised industries been one of the duties of trade unionists.
.If, in fact, the grounds on which the persons concerned were sentenced had no relation to the exercise of trade union rights, the matter would fall outside the competence of the Committee. In the past, however, the Governing Body has emphasised that the question as to whether such a matter is one relating to a criminal offence or to the exercise of trade union rights is not one which can be determined unilaterally by the government concerned. Where allegations as to arrests and sentences of trade unionists have been met by governments with statements that the arrests or sentences were on the ground of subversive activities or for common law crimes, the Committee has followed the rule that the governments concerned should be requested to submit further and as precise information as possible concerning the legal or judicial proceedings instituted and the result of such proceedings.
.In these circumstances, while it is not clear from the complaint how far questions relating to trade union rights may have been involved, the Committee considers that, having regard to the allegations that there was no evidence of sabotage by the persons concerned and that they were convicted by virtue of retroactive legislation and to the gravity of allegations concerning the loss of human life, it needs to have before it the text of the court decisions on which the Government relies before it can judge how far the contention of the Government that the cases involving the persons concerned were purely cases of sabotage, and not cases involving the exercise of trade union rights, is justified.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to request the Government to furnish the texts of the judgments in accordance with which the three persons concerned were sentenced to death.
.As stated in paragraph  above, the complainants also allege that the members of the executive committee of the Federation of Cuban Electricity, Gas and Water Workers, including the four signatories of the complaint, were threatened by the Government to make sure that the workers publicly demanded that the revolutionary tribunals should order the shooting of the aforesaid union members and that when they flatly refused to do so the Confederation of Trade Unions "" in collusion with the Government "" called meetings which were "" packed with individuals who had no connection at all with our industry "" and dismissed all the senior officials of the Federation from the Havana district branch.
.On this point the Government declares in its reply that it is untrue that it threatened the members of the executive committee of the Federation of Cuban Electricity, Gas and Water Workers that they must demand the shooting of the accused and it adds that ""All the workers spontaneously called for this sentence to be given "". It goes on to say that the meetings which dismissed the union officials from office were called and held in accordance with the union rules and were attended by more than , members of the Federation and the Havana district branch of the electricity, gas and water workers.
.While appreciating that the Government contends that the workers who were shot had been found guilty of sabotage, the Committee has serious difficulty in accepting without reservation the account of these events given by the Government. It is difficult to reconcile the statement that all the workers spontaneously called for the shooting of union members with the Government's further statement that  workers were suspended, some of whom will be given work only in places where they cannot commit sabotage. Nor can the existence of an emotional popular demand for the execution of a capital sentence properly be invoked before the Freedom of Association Committee as evidence upon the question whether or not there has been a violation of freedom of association.
.While noting that the Government denies the allegations to the effect that the members of the executive committee of the Federation of Cuban Electricity, Gas and Water Workers were threatened, the Committee is far from clear concerning the relationship between these allegations and the dismissals admitted by the Government.
.In this connection the Committee wishes to emphasise, as it did in Case No.  relating to conditions in Cuba under the previous Government, the importance which it has always attached to the fact that freedom from government interference in the holding and proceedings of trade union meetings constitutes an essential element of trade union rights, and to the principle that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof. It wishes to emphasise further, as it did in Case No.  relating to conditions in Cuba under the previous Government, the importance it has always attached to the principle that workers' organisations should have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom. The Committee recommends the Governing Body to draw the attention of the Government to the foregoing principles.
.The complainants also allege that as a result of the events described in paragraph  they were persecuted to such an extent that they were forced to take refuge in various embassies, where they lived for more than  days before finally going into exile.
.Lastly, the complainants allege that, after the executions took place, the Government dismissed more than  workers in the electricity industry without notice; that more than  workers in the same industry are in prison; and that as many again have had to give up their jobs as a result of the authorities' threats of imprisonment and that there are a number of union officials among them.
.On this point the Government declares in its reply that only  workers were suspended; that the proper procedure was observed in each case; that many workers have been reinstated in their jobs after due investigation; that others will be given work in places where they cannot commit sabotage; that it is false to say that hundreds upon hundreds of workers have been tortured and that "" There is not a trace of oppression of the workers in Cuba because the arms are in the workers' own hands and it is the workers who administer industry and the country itself "".
.In this connection the Committee recommends the Governing Body to draw the attention of the Government to the importance which it has always attached to the principle, embodied in Article  of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Cuba, that workers should enjoy adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment, including acts calculated to cause the dismissal of or otherwise prejudice a worker by reason of union membership or because of participation in union activities.
.In all the circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to reaffirm the duty of the Committee to examine all complaints which are receivable under the rules in force, irrespective of the government to which they relate, with equal impartiality;(b) to decide that the complaint is receivable, having regard to the principle on which the Committee has acted consistently since its First Report that a government cannot deny the right of complainants to submit a complaint by reason of measures taken against them which are alleged in the complaint",-1,1961,Cuba
62,"to have violated freedom of association;(c) to reaffirm that political matters not involving the exercise of freedom of association are outside the competence of the Committee and to decide that, in these circumstances, the Committee has no jurisdiction of the complaint in so far as the facts out of which it arose may have been acts of sabotage and is likewise incompetent to deal with the political matters referred to in the Government's reply;(d) to reaffirm that the fact that a complaint may have a political aspect does not relieve the Committee of its duty of examining whether or not an allegation of violation of freedom of association is well founded;(e) to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that it is bound by the obligations imposed by the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Cuba;(f) to reaffirm that the question whether a matter relates to a criminal offence or to the exercise of trade union rights is not one which can be determined unilaterally by the government concerned;(g) to request the Government, in accordance with the practice always followed in cases in which allegations as to sentences passed on trade unionists have been met with statements that such sentences were passed because of subversive activities or common law crimes, to indicate, in order to enable the Committee to reach a conclusion as to how far any question of freedom of association was involved, whether the appropriate and responsible court by which the sentences of death in the case of Messrs. Lesant Naser, Casielles Amig and Mndez Prez were pronounced was an ordinary court of law, and, if not, to give particulars as to its nature and procedure and to request the Government to furnish the text of the judgment given;(h) to decide that an emotional popular demand for the execution of a capital sentence cannot be invoked before the Freedom of Association Committee as evidence upon the question whether or not there has been a violation of freedom of association;(i) to draw the attention of the Government to the importance which the Governing Body has always attached to the fact that freedom from government interference in the holding and proceedings of trade union meetings constitutes an essential element of trade union rights and to the principle that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof;(j) to draw the attention of the Government to the importance which the Governing Body has always attached to the principle embodied in Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Cuba, that workers' organisations should have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom;(k) to draw the attention of the Government to the importance which the Governing Body attaches to the principle, embodied in Article  of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Cuba, that workers should enjoy adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment, including acts calculated to cause the dismissal of or otherwise prejudice a worker by reason of union membership or because of participation in union activities.",-1,1961,Cuba
63,".In February  the Committee resumed its examination of the various complaints, submitted by the Confederation of Workers for Latin America and the W.F.T.U, dated  December  and  March , alleging violations of trade union rights in Cuba.
.At that time the Committee submitted its final conclusions regarding some of the allegations; these were adopted by the Governing Body at its th Session (February-March ). As regards the allegations contained in the communication from the W.F.T.U dated  March , and on which the Government made certain comments in its communications of  May and  August of the same year, the Committee recommended the Governing Body to request the Government "" to furnish information as to the circumstances surrounding the deaths of the persons mentioned by name in the complaint of the W.F.T.U and, particularly, on the conclusions reached in the judicial investigations into these events"".
.In a statement submitted by the Legal Department of the General Staff, dated  November , the Government supplied some information on the circumstances in which Alejo Toms Lpez, Hector Infante Prez, Isaac Hernndez Oliver, Loynaz Hechavarria y Cordovez and Luis Sera Moreno lost their lives. According to that statement, the legal proceedings, which were initially instituted in the ordinary courts, were subsequently transferred to the military courts, and the proceedings against the persons apparently implicated in those crimes were dropped for lack of evidence.
.As the reply mentioned in the previous paragraph did not cover all the persons on whom the Committee had asked the Government for information with regard to the circumstances of their deaths and the legal proceedings taken against the persons responsible or presumed to be responsible, the Committee, at its th Session (November ), instructed the Director-General to ask the Government to communicate the conclusions reached in the judicial investigations into the deaths of the other persons mentioned in the complaint of the W.F.T.U, namely Armando Guzmn and Enrique Morgan, of the Preston Plant; Antonio Valencio Consuegro, of the Manati Plant; Silverio Hernndez, sugar worker; Antonio Concepcin Paradio, workers' leader at Puerto Padre; Jess Feli Meyva, tobacco worker; and Tilmo Esperanza, painter.
.In the absence of any reply to the earlier request for information the Committee deferred examination of the case at its st (February ), nd (May ), rd (November ), th (February ), th (May ), th (November ) and th (February ) Sessions. The Government sent its reply in a communication dated  April .
.As there has been a change of political rgime in Cuba since the occurrence of the incidents alleged the reply of the Government is of particular interest. The Government recognises the allegations to be well-founded but requests the I.L.O to take into account the date on which they occurred, as, in its view, the complaint has no longer any relevance as far as the Cuban workers are concerned and, moreover, all confusion with regard to the true identity of the persons responsible must be avoided. The communication states that the Revolutionary Government was in no way responsible for such atrocities; they were the work of the tyranny which, by dint of tremendous struggles and sacrifices, the revolutionary movement finally succeeded in ousting and replacing by a system of government which fully respects all the rights of the people and has established trade union rights in the truest and most positive sense of the term. In conclusion the communication states that the basis and principal objective of the efforts of the new rgime is the defence of the working classes and that the principal aim of its policy is the promotion and safeguarding of the exercise of trade union rights to the fullest possible extent.
.The only allegation put forward in this case on which a decision by the Committee is still required is that concerning the violent deaths of the persons mentioned in the W.F.T.U complaint. The information on the circumstances of their deaths and the legal proceedings taken against the persons responsible or presumed to be responsible, for which the Government had been asked, had been received, in an extremely fragmentary form, when the change of rgime took place in the country. The new Government has also failed to supply the information for which the Committee has repeatedly asked. In its reply it merely states that the allegations are well founded but that the new Government does not consider itself responsible for the atrocities perpetrated by the previous one.
.In certain earlier cases I the Committee took the view that, where a change of rgime had taken place in a country, the new government should take all necessary steps to remedy any continuing effects which events complained of as having taken place under its predecessor might have had since its accession to power; for instance in Case No.  (Bolivia) z, the Committee, after examining allegations concerning infringements of trade union rights by a government which had subsequently been overthrown, expressed the view that, although the government in power "" can obviously not be held responsible for events which took place under its predecessor, it clearly is responsible for any continuing consequences which they may have had since its accession to power "".
.The Committee has, however, also accepted the principle - where circumstances of the kind mentioned in the previous paragraph do not obtain-of discontinuing examination of complaints relating to political situations which no longer exist. In the present case there has obviously been a change in the political situation. Consequently, in view of the change of political rgime which has taken place in Cuba and the statement made by the new Government in its communication of  April  (see paragraph  above), the Committee considers that the events referred to in the complaint are no longer of current interest and that, in addition, they do not seem to have given rise to any consequences which might continue to make themselves felt under the new rgime.
.In all the circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that, for the reasons indicated in paragraphs  to  above, the case does not call for further examination.
.By two communications dated respectively  December  and  March , the former being addressed to the Secretary-General of the United Nations and transmitted by him to the I.L.O, the Confederation of Workers of Latin America and the World Federation of Trade Unions formulated a number of allegations relating to infringements of the exercise of trade union rights in Cuba. These allegations may be summarised as follows. The regulations concerning trade union elections embodied in Decrees No.  of  January  and No.  of  June  constituted an intervention by the State in a field in which the right of organisations to draw up necessary regulatory provisions is generally recognised ; these decrees, it was alleged, were contrary to the rights guaranteed to trade union organisations by Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), namely the right to organise their activities and to elect their representatives in full freedom. Acts of violence were alleged to have been committed against trade unionists ; in particular, the complainants gave the names of several persons alleged to have been killed. It was alleged that the right of meeting was not respected and that a congress of the Cuban Workers' Confederation took place under police supervision. Finally, allegations were formulated with respect to a wage freeze, the dismissal of workers and infringements of human rights.
.The Government forwarded its observations in two communications dated  and  May ; also, following the request made by the Committee at its th Session (Geneva, May ), the Government furnished further information on several points in a letter dated  August .
.At its th Session (Geneva, October ) the Committee examined the case as a whole and formulated certain conclusions and recommendations which were embodied in its th Report. This report was adopted by the Governing Body at its th Session (Geneva, October-November ). The Committee recommended the Governing Body to decide that the allegations relating to the wage freeze, dismissals and violation of human rights did not call for further examination. With respect to the allegations relating to the right of meeting, the Committee recommended the Governing Body to draw the attention of the Government to its view that police intervention on the occasion of a trade union congress is contrary to freedom of association and incompatible with Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), which has been ratified by Cuba. With respect to the allegations relating to intervention by the State in trade union elections, the Committee recommended the Governing Body to draw the attention of the Government of Cuba to its view that the electoral system introduced by Decrees No.  of  and No.  of  is incompatible with the safeguards afforded to trade unions by the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right",-1,1956,Cuba
64,"to Organise Convention,  (No. ), which has been ratified by Cuba, and, in particular, with the provisions that "" workers' organisations shall have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom and to organise their administration and activities "" and that "" the public authorities shall refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof "", and to request the Government to take the necessary action to bring its legislation into harmony with these provisions of the Convention. With respect to the allegations relating to wrongful acts committed against trade unionists, the Committee recommended the Governing Body to request the Government of Cuba, as a matter of urgency, to provide precise information on the circumstances surrounding the deaths of the persons mentioned by name by the complainants, and, particularly, on the conclusions reached in the judicial investigations into these events, it being understood that the Committee would submit a further report on these allegations as soon as the information requested had been received.ANALYSIS OF THE GOVERNMENT'S OBSERVATIONS
.By five communications dated  November,  December (two communications),  and  December , the Government of Cuba forwarded to the Office a number of observations on the conclusions adopted by the Committee and by the Governing Body, together with further information which the Committee had requested it to furnish on certain points.
.In the first place, the Government declares formally that, contrary to what would appear to be the case judging by the conclusions of the Committee and the Governing Body, it has never recognised that any police or military intervention took place on the occasion of a trade union congress. In the view of the Government nothing in the observations which it had presented on the allegations made by the complainants justified the conclusion that there had been any such admission on its part. Consequently, states the Government, this interpretation was erroneous and even malicious in the sense that it was calculated to distort the truth. The Government declares that in fact neither the police nor the security forces-even less so the army-entered the premises in which the trade union congress mentioned in the complaint of the Confederation of Workers of Latin America was being held, and surveillance was exercised only in the street for the exclusive purpose of preventing any possible disturbance.
.Further, the Government contests the validity of the reasoning which led the Committee to formulate the recommendation contained in paragraph  (a) of its th Report with respect to the regulations concerning trade union elections embodied in the decrees of  and . According to the Government, the decrees criticised in no way constitute instruments by which the trade unions are rendered subordinate. In support of this statement the Government declares that, moreover, the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has never regarded these texts as constituting an infringement of freedom of association. Finally, the Government states that these two decrees, which were promulgated in order to deal with a transitory situation, have since been repealed.
.Finally, in response to the request for further information made by the Committee in paragraph  (f) of its th Report, the Government gives the following information. After inquiries had been opened by several examining magistrates on the ground of murder in the cases of Messrs. Alejo Toms, Hctor Infante Prez, Isaac Hernndez Oliver, Loynaz Hecheverria and Luis Sera Moreno, the courts before which these cases had been brought declared themselves to be incompetent and surrendered their jurisdiction to the military judicial authorities. With regard to the case of Mr. Armando Guzmn Guidi, the murder inquiry instituted by the competent examining tribunal was provisionally suspended pursuant to the second paragraph of section  of the Penal Code on the ground that it had not been possible to establish who were the authors of the crime, their accomplices or the persons who sheltered them. For the same reasons, proceedings were suspended in the cases of Messrs. Antonio Valencio Consuegro and Antonio Concepcin. Paradio. With regard to the case of Mr. Miguel Torres Surez, whose death was verified through the files of the competent judicial authorities, an inquiry was opened by the said authorities and has not yet terminated. With regard, finally, to the cases of Messrs. Germnico Mendoza, Ramn Concepcin Cue, Amaranto Fransua, Luis Frits, Miguel Mordago and Enrique Morgan, the Government declares that their names are not mentioned in the records of inquiries filed in December .
.The Government categorically denies that it ever admitted any police or military intervention on the occasion of a trade union congress. This objection relates to paragraph  (b) of the th Report of the Committee, which stated:[The Committee recommends the Governing Body] to draw the attention of the Government of Cuba to its view that police and military intervention (such as that recognised by the Government) on the occasion of a trade union congress is contrary to freedom of association and incompatible with Article  of Convention No. , which has been ratified by Cuba.
.The reasons which caused the Committee to formulate its conclusions in these terms were as follows. In reply to a specific allegation that such intervention had taken place the Government, without specifically admitting the intervention for which it was criticised in this particular instance, nevertheless did not deny this allegation but, on the contrary, admitted the principle of intervention by declaring that it regarded it as justifiable. The Government's observations in this connection were as follows : "" trade union activities, particularly in times of political disturbance, insurrection and terrorism, require the exercise of supervision by the police and the security forces."" In these circumstances the Committee took the view that the fact that the Government refrained from refuting the intervention for which it was criticised, added to the attitude which the Government adopted in favour of the principle of police supervision, was equivalent to an admission by the Government that such intervention had actually occurred.
.Since the conclusions of the Committee were approved by the Governing Body the Government has furnished further information containing new elements, from which it would appear that the intervention for which the Government was criticised did not actually take place.
.In these circumstances, while affirming that any police or military intervention in legitimate trade union activities would be contrary to Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Committee has noted the more detailed observations furnished by the Government since the adoption of the th Report of the Committee by the Governing Body, according to which, in the specific instance mentioned by the complainants, the intervention for which the Government was criticised did not actually take place.
.The Government declares that the two decrees relating to the regulating of trade union elections, which the Committee and the Governing Body considered incompatible with the provisions of Convention No.  ratified by Cuba, cannot in any way be regarded as instruments resulting in the subordination of the trade unions. In support of this point of view, the Government declares that the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has never regarded these texts as infringing freedom of association. It is true that the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, which has addressed to the Government of Cuba observations on certain points (trade union rights of officials and State, provincial and municipal employees, general prohibition of all political activities on the part of trade unions, presence of an official at trade union meetings), has not commented on the decrees in question. It is necessary, however, to point out that, if the Committee of Experts has not been able to make observations on the two decrees in question, this is to be explained by the fact that the decrees have never been mentioned by the Government in the reports which it has furnished, in accordance with article  of the Constitution of the I.L.O, on the application of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and on the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ). Moreover, when the Committee of Experts, in , specifically asked in one of its observations addressed to the Government of Cuba, whether there were "" provisions in the national legislation respecting the election of trade union leaders"", the Government, in its reply, made no reference to either of the texts criticised in the present case. Finally, when the draft monograph with respect to Cuba prepared in the course of the inquiry of the Committee on Freedom of Employers' and Workers' Organisations-a draft which also contained no reference to the two decrees in question-was communicated to the Government of Cuba for its observations and a request was made to the Government to indicate any texts which might be missing from the list of legislative texts annexed to the draft, the Government refrained from making any reference to the decrees in question.",-1,1956,Cuba
65,"It is not possible, therefore, to interpret the absence of any observations on these texts by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations as having constituted even tacit approval of their contents.
.On the other hand, with respect to this aspect of the case, the latest observations received from the Government of Cuba contain new elements which entirely change the situation. In fact, the Government states that the two decrees which were criticised have, since the th Report of the Committee was adopted, been repealed. In the concluding part of paragraph  (a) of the Committee's th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (October-November ), the Government was requested to take the necessary action to bring its legislation into harmony with the provisions of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ). In the repealing decree (Decree No. ), the text of which is annexed to the Government's communication dated  December , and which, as the Government points out in its letter of  December , was published in the Official Gazette of  December , it is stated in one of the clauses of the preamble that one of the reasons justifying the repeal of the two decrees in question is to be found in the fact that they might be regarded as being at variance with the requirements of Convention No. . In these circumstances, the Committee notes with satisfaction the effect thus given by the Government of Cuba to one of its recommendations approved by the Governing Body.
.Finally, in its latest communications, the Government replies to the request for further information made by the Governing Body with respect to allegations of wrongful acts committed against trade unionists. From the information furnished by the Government it would appear that the cases relating to the persons mentioned by name by the complainants have been the subject of references to the military judicial authorities by the civil courts before which they came, or of a provisional suspension of proceedings because of the impossibility, so far, of establishing the facts, or of investigations which have not yet been terminated or, finally, have not yet been the subject of any inquiry. In other words, all the cases in question are still pending and the information received from the Government is in the nature of a report as to the stages which have been reached in the proceedings which have been instituted.
.In these circumstances, while thanking the Government for the information which it has been good enough to furnish with respect to the stages reached in the proceedings instituted in the cases of the persons mentioned by name in the complaints, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to request the Government of Cuba to furnish precise information as to the circumstances surrounding the deaths of the persons mentioned by name in the complaint of the World Federation of Trade Unions and, particularly, on the conclusions reached in the judicial investigations into these events, it being understood that the Committee will report further on these allegations when it has received the information requested.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to take note of the more detailed observations furnished by the Government since the adoption of the th Report of the Committee on Freedom of Association by the Governing Body, according to which, in the specific case mentioned by the complainants, the police intervention on the occasion of a trade union congress for which the Government was criticised did not actually take place ;(b) to take note with satisfaction of the statement by the Government that Decrees No.  of  and No.  of , regarded by the Governing Body as being incompatible with the guarantees afforded to trade unions by the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), have been repealed, this measure giving effect to the recommendation made by the Governing Body that the Government of Cuba should take the necessary action to bring its legislation into harmony with the provisions of the Convention ;(c) to decide, while thanking the Government for the preliminary information which it has been good enough to furnish with respect to this question, to request the Government to furnish information as to the circumstances surrounding the deaths of the persons mentioned by name in the complaint of the World Federation of Trade Unions and, particularly, on the conclusions reached in the judicial investigations into these events, it being understood that the Committee will report further on these allegations when the information requested has been received from the Government.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to express to the Government of Cuba its view that the electoral system introduced by Decrees No.  of  and No.  of  is incompatible with the safeguards afforded to trade unions by the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), which has been ratified by Cuba, and, in particular, with the provisions that ""workers' organisations shall have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom and to organise their administration and activities"" and that ""the public authorities shall refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof "", and to request the Government to take the necessary action to bring its legislation into harmony with these provisions of the Convention ;(b) to draw the attention of the Government of Cuba to its view that police and military intervention (such as that recognised by the Government) on the occasion of  trade union congress is contrary to freedom of association and incompatible with Article  of Convention No. , which has been ratified by Cuba ;(c) to communicate the above conclusions to the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, calling its attention to a situation which is incompatible with a Convention which has been ratified ;(d) to note, with respect to the allegations relating to an attack on the Secretary-General of the Construction Workers' Union of Havana, that the competent courts of law opened an investigation and that the official in question is continuing to perform his trade union functions, and to decide that these allegations do not call for further examination ;(e) to decide that the allegations relating to the wage freeze, dismissals, etc., and those relating to the violation of human rights, do not, for the reasons indicated in paragraphs  and  above, call for further examination ;(f) to request the Government of Cuba, as a matter of extreme urgency, to provide precise information on the circumstances surrounding the deaths of the persons mentioned by name in the complaint of the W.F.T.U, and particularly on the conclusions reached in the judicial investigations into these events, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report on these allegations as soon as the information requested has been received.",-1,1956,Cuba
66,".In accordance with paragraph  of a resolution adopted by the Economic and Social Council on  April , the Secretary-General of the United Nations transmitted to the I.L.O by letter dated  January  the text of two communications regarding sundry infringements of human rights in Cuba, one from the "" Confederacin de trabajadores de Amrica Latina "" (C.T.A.L) dated  August , and the other dated  November  from the "" Comit de Ejidatarios de Tapachula "" (Committee of Peasant Farmers of Tapachula) (Chiapas, Mexico), the ""Sindicato Unico de la Construccin"" (United Building Workers' Union) (Fresnillo, Mexico), and the "" Sindicato National de Trabajadores de la Educacin "" (National Teachers' Union).
.For all these reasons the Committee considers that the complaint as a whole calls for no action on its part, either because the allegations do not relate to specific infringements of trade union rights or because they have already been examined in connection with Case No. .",-1,1953,Cuba
67,".The complainant alleges, in a first communication dated  July , that Mr. Lzaro Pea, Vice-President of the World Federation of Trade Unions and a Cuban union leader, and Mr. Jos Morera, Secretary of the Confederation of Latin American Workers, were arrested on  July  at Havana Airport on their return from a meeting of the W.F.T.U Executive Committee, and considers that their arrest constitutes a clear violation of trade union rights.
.In a second communication dated  September  the complainant states that the Government unleashed at the end of July  a wave of persecution against the trade union and democratic movement in Cuba. Several trade union and democratic leaders, among whom were Mr. Lzaro Pea and the workers' leaders in the tobacco and transport industries, namely, Joaquin Ordoqui, Jorge Garcia Gallo, Gonzalo Collado, Carlos Fernndez and Jos Maria Prez, were thrown into prison. The premises of several trade unions and the residence of Lzaro Pea were ransacked by the police. The workers' daily newspaper Noticias de Hoy was banned. All Constitutional guarantees were suppressed on pretext of a plot which had no connection with the trade union or democratic movement. The real reason for these persecutions and repression is to be found in the intention of the Government to strike a blow against the unified struggle of the workers for their economic and social demands and for the maintenance of trade union and democratic freedom.
.In these circumstances the Committee, having regard, first, to the highly political character of these events, and, secondly, to the fact that the complaint is now purposeless since the Constitutional guarantees have been restored, recommends the Governing Body, subject to the observations made in paragraphs , ,  and  above, to decide that the case as a whole does not call for further examination.",-1,1952,Cuba
