.At its June  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendations [see th Report, para. ]:The Committee deeply deplores the murder of the trade union official, Mr Melndez, and urges the Government to take all necessary steps to ensure that the competent authorities: (i) prioritize the ongoing investigations and devote all necessary efforts to identify and punish without delay both the instigators and perpetrators of the murder; and (ii) take full account in the investigations of all relevant elements arising from Mr Melndez s trade union activities. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed, without delay, of the progress made in this respect.The Committee requests the Government to ensure that the workers from the institution in which Mr Melndez carried out his trade union activities enjoy adequate protection against any act that may cause prejudice to them by reason of their participation in union activities.The Committee requests the Government to provide up-to-date information on the actions taken in relation to the initiative  Proposal for reform of the Criminal Code'  which was drafted by the MTPS with the aim of improving the protection of the freedom of association of trade union leaders and trade unionists.The Committee draws the Governing Body s attention to the serious and urgent nature of this case.
.By means of a communication dated  October , the Government transmitted, firstly, information on the actions taken in connection with the investigations to identify the perpetrators of Mr Melndez s murder (recommendation (a) of the Committee), stating that: (i) the Attorney General and the Director of the National Civil Police were once again requested, in a letter of  September , to provide information on the progress of the corresponding investigations, and to follow up on the actions undertaken concerning this case; and (ii) it was awaiting the relevant responses.
.With respect to recommendation (b) of the Committee on the need to provide members of the trade union to which Mr Melndez belonged with adequate protection against any act that may cause prejudice to them by reason of their participation in union activities, the Government transmitted the observations of the Mayor of San Salvador city, who indicates that: (i) the regulations governing labour relations between workers' associations and the administration of the municipality of San Salvador, whose purpose is to regulate and organize relations between the administration and the associations of municipal workers, are applied; and (ii) the San Salvador municipal administration ensures the safety of workers through its corps of municipal police officers, and as a municipality they do not carry out acts intended to undermine the workers of the institution who belong or might belong to trade union associations. The Government adds that steps are being taken to obtain more information on the execution of the measures to protect workers against any act that may cause prejudice to them by reason of their participation in union activities in the said workplace.
.Concerning recommendation (c) of the Committee on the actions taken in relation to the  Proposal for reform of the Criminal Code' initiative, which was drafted by the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare with the aim of improving the protection of the freedom of association of trade union officials, the Government states that: (i) in response to the murder of the trade union leader and official Weder Melndez, it was proposed to conduct an analysis of legislative changes that would protect against, penalize and eradicate similar acts and those that may affect workers by reason of their membership in trade unions; (ii) in this context, it became apparent that it was necessary to include such acts that go against workers' freedom of association as aggravating circumstances in the Penal Code and to increase the penalties for them; and (iii) the proposal for reform is under examination within the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare for subsequent submission to the Legislative Assembly.
.The Committee recalls that the purpose of the present case is to denounce the murder for anti-union reasons of Mr Weder Arturo Melndez Ramrez, a trade union official and worker of the Municipality of San Salvador, which occurred on  August  in San Salvador. The Committee takes note of the information provided by the Government in a communication of  October . While noting that the Government indicates that it once again requested the Attorney General s Office and the National Civil Police to follow up on the actions undertaken to identify and punish the perpetrators of Mr Melndez s murder, the Committee deeply deplores the fact that it has no new information concerning the progress made in the relevant investigations.
.The Committee recalls once again that the killing, disappearance or serious injury of trade union leaders and trade unionists requires the institution of independent judicial inquiries in order to shed full light, at the earliest date, on the facts and the circumstances in which such actions occurred and in this way, to the extent possible, determine where responsibilities lie, punish the guilty parties and prevent the repetition of similar events [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , para. ]. It is important that investigations into the murders of trade unionists yield concrete results in order to reliably determine the facts, the motives and the persons responsible, in order to apply the appropriate punishments and to prevent such incidents recurring in the future [see Compilation, para. ]. The Committee also recalls that it is important that all instances of violence against trade union members, whether these be murders, disappearances or threats, are properly investigated. Furthermore, the mere fact of initiating an investigation does not mark the end of the Government s work; rather, the Government must do all within its power to ensure that such investigations lead to the identification and punishment of the perpetrators. [see Compilation, para. ].
.The Committee therefore once again urges the Government to take the necessary steps to ensure that the competent authorities: (i) prioritize the ongoing investigations and devote all necessary efforts to identify and punish without delay both the instigators and perpetrators of the murder; and (ii) take full account in the investigations of all relevant elements arising from Mr Melndez s trade union activities. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed, without delay, of the progress made in this respect.
.In connection with recommendation (b) on the need to provide the members of the trade union to which Mr Melndez belonged with adequate protection against any act that may cause prejudice to them by reason of their participation in union activities, the Committee takes note of the information provided by the municipal administration of San Salvador submitted by the Government, according to which: (i) the regulations governing labour relations between workers' associations and the administration of the municipality of San Salvador, whose purpose is to regulate and organize relations between the administration and the associations of municipal workers, are applied; and (ii) the San Salvador municipal administration ensures the safety of workers through its corps of municipal police officers, and as a municipality they do not carry out acts intended to undermine the workers of the said institution who belong or might belong to trade union associations. The Committee also notes that the Government adds that steps are being taken to obtain more information on the execution of the measures to protect workers against any act that may cause prejudice to them by reason of their participation in union activities in the workplace. While duly noting the information related to the actions taken by the municipal administration of San Salvador, the Committee, recalling that the complainants allege that Mr Melndez s murder is a consequence of his trade union activities, urges the Government to ensure that all of the competent state authorities take the necessary actions to provide the members of the union to which Mr Melndez belonged with adequate protection against any act that may cause prejudice to them by reason of their participation in union activities. The Committee requests the Government to provide specific information in this respect.
.In connection with recommendation (c) on the actions taken in relation to the  Proposal for reform of the Criminal Code' initiative, which was drafted by the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare with the aim of improving the protection of the freedom of association of trade union leaders, the Committee notes that the Government indicates that: (i)",1,2020,El Salvador
1,"in the context of the murder of Mr Melndez, it became apparent that it was necessary to characterize the anti-union nature of the offences committed against union leaders and trade unionists by reason of their trade union activity as an aggravating circumstance in the Penal Code and to increase the corresponding penalties; and (ii) the proposal for reform is under examination within the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare for subsequent submission to the Legislative Assembly. Observing that it has not received any new information on the progress in handling of this initiative since October , the Committee urges the Government to keep it informed of any developments. The Committee reminds the Government that it can seek technical assistance from the Office in this respect.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee deeply deplores the lack of information on progress in the investigations into the murder of the trade union official, Mr Melndez, and once again urges the Government to take all necessary steps to ensure that the competent authorities: (i) prioritize the ongoing investigations and devote all necessary efforts to identify and punish without delay both the instigators and perpetrators of the murder; and (ii) take full account in the investigations of all relevant elements arising from Mr Melndez s trade union activities. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed, without delay, of the progress made in this respect.(b) The Committee urges the Government to ensure that all of the competent state authorities take the necessary actions to provide the members of the union to which Mr Melndez belonged with adequate protection against any act that may cause prejudice to them by reason of their participation in union activities. The Committee requests the Government to provide specific information in this respect.(c) The Committee urges the Government to keep it informed of any progress in the handling of the  Proposal for reform of the Criminal Code' initiative, which was drafted by the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare with the aim of improving the protection of the freedom of association of trade union leaders. The Committee reminds the Government that it can seek technical assistance from the Office in this respect.(d) The Committee draws the Governing Body s attention to the serious and urgent nature of this case.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the Salvadoran Association of Municipal Workers (ASTRAM) and the Union of Workers of the Municipality of San Salvador (STAMSS) dated  August  (received on  December ).
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  May .
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Workers' Representatives Convention,  (No. ), and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainant organizations denounce the murder for anti-union reasons of Mr Weder Arturo Melndez Ramrez (Mr Melndez), trade union official and worker at the Directorate for Solid Waste Management at the Municipality of San Salvador, which occurred on  August  in Colonia Guatemala  of San Salvador at approximately . p.m.
.The complainant organizations indicate that, according to the information they have received, Mr Melndez was present in the above-mentioned location when two individuals on a motorbike approached him; one of them got off the motorbike, went towards Mr Melndez and shot him ten times; the two individuals then fled on the motorbike to an unknown location. The complainants indicate that Mr Melndez died on the way to the hospital of the Salvadoran Social Security Institute and that according to the medical assessment the preliminary cause of death was found to be death by gunshot wounds.
.The complainant organizations state that Mr Melndez was one of their most important trade union officials and that he was deeply committed to the welfare work carried out by his organization. The complainants also state that Mr Melndez was murdered in the exercise of his trade union activities, that is to say while he was collecting, in the above-mentioned location, a donation of bread for the communities that are supported on an ongoing basis by the trade union movement.
.According to the complainant organizations, Mr Melndez was one of the trade union leaders who publicly denounced through different types of media, including social networks, the irregularities committed in the Municipality of San Salvador under the authority of its then mayor. According to the complainants, these irregularities include withholding deductions from workers' wages but not making the corresponding payments of the contributions to the Pension Fund Administrators, the Salvadoran Social Security Institute and the Social Housing Fund, and not paying the instalments due for loans obtained by workers at various banking or financial institutions. The lack of effective payment of the deductions withheld from wages is damaging to the workers concerned and has been reported to the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare (MTPS), resulting in a notification being submitted to the Attorney-General s Office.
.The complainant organizations allege that they have sufficient evidence to conclude that the murder of the trade union official was not due to common crime, but was intended to put an end to the denunciations he had been making in his position of trade union leader.
.The complainants state that Mr Melndez was not in conflict with anyone, that he never mentioned having any enemies and that the then mayor was the only person who had reported problems with the trade union official as he had alleged that the then mayor had committed offences of misappropriation or withholding of deductions that were prejudicial to the workers of the Municipality of San Salvador. The complainant organizations indicate that as Mr Melndez was one of the people who, as a workers' representative, had focused on denouncing all the irregularities committed by the then mayor, this situation cannot be ruled out as the motive for the murder. Furthermore, the complainants state that it is common knowledge that the then mayor is closely associated with members of gangs or mobs and that he is being prosecuted for this crime before the courts of San Salvador.
.The complainant organizations add that some days before the murder of the trade union official, the then mayor had wanted to dismiss him because of the denunciations that he was making against him and that this situation was made known at the extraordinary session of the board of the Municipal Directorate for Sustainable Solid Waste Management, number , held on  July  on the premises of the Diego de Holgun Municipal Complex. At that session, according to the complainants, the then mayor specifically stated, among other comments, that he would assume all legal consequences that may arise regarding the dismissal of Mr Melndez, and then, after this item was put on the agenda, a vote was taken on his dismissal. The complainants go on to say that all those present at the session, apart from one person, voted in favour of the dismissal and that the person who voted against it was later dismissed by the Municipal Council. The notification of the dismissal of Mr Melndez did not come into effect and was pending implementation at the time of his death.
.According to the complainant organizations, the fact that the then mayor had tried to dismiss the trade union official and that he spoke disrespectfully about him is a demonstration of trade union persecution against him and this in turn shows that the then mayor could be linked to the murder.
.Lastly, the complainant organizations ask the Committee to intervene in order to request the Government to carry out an immediate and effective investigation into the murder of Mr Melndez and to demand that the authorities, in particular the Municipality of San Salvador, fully respect the exercise of freedom of association, in order to prevent further repression or attacks against trade union officials and leaders both inside and outside the municipality in question.
.In a communication of  May , the Government provides information on the actions taken by the MTPS, the Attorney-General s Office and the National Civil Police concerning the murder of Mr Melndez. In the same communication, the Government refers to the statement issued by the Human Rights Ombudsman on  August  condemning the murder of Mr. Melndez and requesting the Attorney General s Office and the National Civil Police to carry out effective investigations that consider all possible alternatives, including that the cause of the murder may be linked to a reprisal for the trade union activities performed by Mr. Melendez.
.The MTPS indicates that it has taken steps to seize the competent judicial bodies to investigate the murder of Mr Melndez. The MTPS indicates that, to that effect, it has made public statements condemning the murder in various media and has approached the Minister of Labour of Guatemala in his capacity as chair pro tempore of the Council of Ministers of Central America and the Dominican Republic",-1,2020,El Salvador
2,"to inform him of the facts of the case and seek his support.
.Furthermore, the MTPS states that, in October  and March , exercising its constitutional powers and on its own initiative, it: (i) submitted criminal notifications to the Attorney-General s Office seeking relevant investigations; and (ii) provided the Attorney-General s Office with information on the suspects in the murder of Mr Melndez, after receiving a statement from a citizen who sought witness protection. Lastly, the MTPS states that organized crime impacts on trade union leaders who, like Mr Melndez, denounce the widespread corruption.
.The Government also submits the information provided by the Attorney-General s Office on the steps it has taken as part of the investigations into the murder of Mr Melndez. Those steps include, among others, interviews of witnesses and other people under protection, police visual inspections of the crime scene, the union leader s vehicle and the vehicle that drove him to the hospital, the forensic examination and post mortem of the corpse, and the seizure of some assets. The Attorney-General s Office also indicates that it has obtained a certified copy of Mr Melndez s employment record and the criminal notifications submitted by the MTPS and, in , by ASTRAM in relation to his murder.
.Finally, the Government submits, as one of the appendixes to its communication of  May , a document entitled  Proposal for reform of the Criminal Code'  which was drafted by the MTPS with the aim of improving the protection of freedom of association. It proposes the amendment of various provisions of the Criminal Code relating to aggravated homicide, aggravated bodily harm, aggravated threats and coercion in order to include among the hypothesis of these crimes assaults that specifically affect trade union leaders and trade unionists.
.The Committee observes that in this case the complainant organizations are denouncing the murder for anti-union reasons of Mr Weder Arturo Melndez Ramrez (Mr Melndez), trade union official and worker at the Municipality of San Salvador, on  August  in San Salvador, while Mr Melndez, as alleged by the complainants, was carrying out trade union welfare activities.
.The Committee deeply deplores the murder of the trade union official Mr Melndez. The Committee notes with concern that the complainants link the murder to the trade union leader s union activities and, in particular, his alleged public denunciation of the irregularities committed by the then mayor of the Municipality of San Salvador. The Committee observes that the complainants consider that, as a result, the leader was subject to trade union persecution by the then mayor, who had allegedly spoken disrespectfully about him and had sought to dismiss him days before his death; the complainants thus allege that it could not be ruled out that this conflict may have been the motive for his murder.
.The Committee also notes the information provided by the Government. Firstly, the Committee notes that the Government refers to the statement issued by the Human Rights Ombudsman on  August  condemning the murder of Mr Melndez and requesting the Attorney General s Office and the National Civil Police to carry out effective investigations that consider all possible alternatives, including that the cause of the murder may be linked to a reprisal for the trade union activities performed by Mr Melendez.
.The Committee also takes note of the Government s indications on the actions taken by the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare (MTPS) concerning the murder of Mr Melndez, namely: (i) its public condemnation of the murder in various national forums and at the international level; (ii) the criminal notifications submitted to the Attorney-General seeking relevant investigations; and (iii) the provision of information to the Attorney-General s Office on the suspects in the murder of Mr Melndez, as a result of a statement from a citizen who requested witness protection. Furthermore, the Committee observes that the MTPS states that organized crime impacts on trade union leaders who, like Mr Melndez, denounce the widespread corruption.
.The Committee further notes that the Government provides information on the steps taken by the Attorney-General s Office and the National Civil Police, which include interviews of witnesses and other people under protection, police visual inspections of the crime scene, the union leader s vehicle and the vehicle that drove him to the hospital, the forensic examination and post mortem of the corpse, the seizure of some assets and the obtaining of a certified copy of Mr Melndez s employment record.
.Finally, the Committee notes that the Government submits, as one of the appendixes to its communication, a document entitled  Proposal for reform of the Criminal Code'  which was drafted by the MTPS with the aim of improving the protection of freedom of association. It proposes the amendment of various provisions of the Criminal Code relating to aggravated homicide, aggravated bodily harm, aggravated threats and coercion in order to include among the hypothesis of these crimes assaults that specifically affect trade union leaders and trade unionists.
.The Committee duly notes these various elements. The Committee deeply deplores the murder of Mr Melndez and recalls that the right to life is a fundamental prerequisite for the exercise of the rights contained in Convention No.  (ratified by El Salvador) and that the rights of workers' and employers' organizations can only be exercised in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind against the leaders and members of these organizations, and it is for governments to ensure that this principle is respected [see Compilation of Decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , paras  and ].
.Noting the actions taken to date by the MTPS, the Attorney-General s Office and the National Civil Police to investigate and shed light on the facts of the murder of Mr Melndez, the Committee also recalls that the killing, disappearance or serious injury of trade union leaders and trade unionists requires the institution of independent judicial inquiries in order to shed full light, at the earliest date, on the facts and the circumstances in which such actions occurred and in this way, to the extent possible, determine where responsibilities lie, punish the guilty parties and prevent the repetition of similar events [see Compilation, para. ].
.While observing that the complainants allege that Mr Melndez was murdered because of his trade union activities, the Committee urges the Government to take the necessary steps to ensure that the competent authorities: (i) prioritize the ongoing investigations and devote all necessary efforts to identify and punish without delay both the instigators and perpetrators of the murder; and (ii) take full account in the investigations of all relevant elements arising from Mr Melndez s trade union activities. The Committee recalls that it is important that all instances of violence against trade union members, whether these be murders, disappearances or threats, are properly investigated. Furthermore, the mere fact of initiating an investigation does not mark the end of the Government s work; rather, the Government must do all within its power to ensure that such investigations lead to the identification and punishment of the perpetrators [see Compilation, para. ].The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed, without delay, of the progress made in this respect.
.In addition, in the light of the facts reported, the Committee requests the Government to ensure that the workers from the institution in which Mr Melndez carried out his trade union activities enjoy adequate protection against any act that may cause prejudice to them by reason of their participation in union activities.
.With regard to the  Proposal for reform of the Criminal Code'  which was drafted by the MTPS with the aim of improving the protection of the freedom of association of trade union leaders and trade unionists, the Committee requests the Government to provide up-to-date information on actions taken in relation to this initiative.
.Lastly, the Committee draws the Governing Body s attention to the serious and urgent nature of this case.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee deeply deplores the murder of the trade union official, Mr Melndez, and urges the Government to take all necessary steps to ensure that the competent authorities: (i) prioritize the ongoing investigations and devote all necessary efforts to identify and punish without delay both the instigators and perpetrators of the murder; and (ii) take full account in the investigations of all relevant elements arising from Mr Melndez s trade union activities.

4,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the National Association of Private Enterprise (ANEP) dated  June .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  June .
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainant denounces acts of harassment and interference against ANEP and its leaders, in particular its president, by high-ranking representatives of the Government of El Salvador, including the President of the Republic. The complainant notes that ANEP is the most representative employers' organization in El Salvador, comprising  entities in more than  subsectors of the economy and more than , enterprises, representing  per cent of the gross domestic product.
.In particular, ANEP indicates that: (i) on  April , at its general assembly, its member organizations unanimously elected Mr Javier Ernesto Simn Dada as president along with its new board of directors for a two-year period; (ii) on  May, the President of the Republic posted on the Twitter social network that  It is evident that the new leadership of ANEP El Salvador is only seeking to sabotage the work of the Government. Worse still, in the middle of a pandemic. ' From now on, the Government does not recognize Javier Simn as the representative of private enterprise'  (iii) on his Facebook page, the President of the Republic wrote that  It is clear that ANEP is free to elect and have as members whoever it wants ' But what is the point of having someone lead an organization if he is no longer of any use? In any case, the vast majority of business owners in our country want to move forward and do not feel represented by ANEP. The majority of employers' associations (many of which are never taken into consideration) want to work for El Salvador and do not place their political interests before the well-being of everyone. We will be working hand in hand with those associations. Gone are the days in our Government when ANEP told the President of the Republic what to do'  (iv) on the same day, the Presidential Commissioner of Operations and Cabinet, Ms Carolina Recinos, publicly reaffirmed the President s decision not to recognize Mr Simn Dada as president of ANEP and representative of the private sector, stating that  In difficult circumstances, personalities and agendas are identified. We cannot use the crisis of the pandemic as a platform to attack'  (v) messages were sent via various government officials and/or representatives of the governing party harassing Mr Simn Dada or saying that they did not recognize him, and higher orders were given to arbitrarily close one of the enterprises of the business group to which Mr Simn Dada belongs, which had permits from the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Labour to produce face masks and medical gowns, both for export and for the Government of El Salvador; and (vi) on  May , the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare made statements on Salvadorean television channels ,  and  indicating that a few days before, representatives of associations came to see him at the Ministry of Labour and he received them because at no point did they say that they were representing ANEP; he also indicated in the same interview that the doors of the Ministry of Labour were immediately completely closed to Mr Simn Dada, saying that the position of the Government and the Ministry of Labour is to work and meet with all sectors except ANEP.
.In a communication dated  June , the Government indicates that it is respectful of social dialogue and of the legitimacy that characterizes the representation of both workers and employers. The Government states that at no point was there any interference on its part in the electoral process and activity of the board of directors or president of ANEP because the Government (at the time of its communication in response to the complaint) was not aware of whether there had been an election for the board of directors. The Government affirms that it is therefore unaware of whether Mr Javier Ernesto Simn Dada was elected president of the Association at its general assembly as stated in the complaint.
.To confirm the above, the Government indicates that it requested the Registry of Non-Profit Associations and Foundations of the Ministry of the Interior (which is responsible for maintaining the registries and documentation related to associations and foundations, as well as information on their legal representatives) to provide details on the last appointment or election of ANEP s legal administration entered in the registry. The Director General of the Registry of Non-Profit Associations and Foundations replied on  May  stating that the latest certification on record for ANEP concerned the board of directors that was elected in April  for a two-year term and that  no official application to register a new board of directors appears to have been submitted by the National Association of Private Enterprise'  The registry was consulted again on  June , and the Government was informed again by a memo of  June that no request to register a new board of directors or to restructure the board had been submitted thus far. The Government provides a copy of these communications.
.Concerning the alleged closure of enterprises of the business group linked to Mr Simn Dada, the Government indicates that no isolated action was taken against him or the business group to which he belongs. It states that the action was part of general measures taken in relation to the lockdown and mandatory quarantine that was decreed by law to contain the pandemic, as the priority of the Government in combating the virus was the life and health of all persons.
.The Committee notes that the complaint denounces acts of interference and harassment against ANEP and its leaders by high-ranking government representatives, in particular through the non-recognition of its new president, Mr Simn Dada, who was elected by the complainant s general assembly on  April . The Committee observes that the Government argues that it could not have interfered in the electoral process as it was not aware of it taking place. The Government indicates that it has no knowledge as to whether elections have been held for the board of directors and presidency of ANEP and that there is no record of the election of a new board of directors and president in the relevant registry. In this regard, and noting that there is no question as to the conduct of the electoral process, the Committee invites the complainant organization, if it has not already done so, to complete the formalities to register its new board of directors.
.The Committee observes, however, that the Government does not question the authenticity of the public statements denounced in the complaint, which were made at the highest level of State. Not only do those statements imply an expression of knowledge of the ANEP elections, but they also state clearly and unequivocally that the authorities do not recognize the election result and, in particular, the new president of ANEP. Nor does the Government question the statements made by other public authorities, in particular the Minister of Labour, in which they explicitly do not recognize the president of ANEP, and consequently reject ANEP as a social partner.
.In this regard, and while it recognizes that the registration of new boards of directors of employers' and workers' organizations is a formality that national legislation may establish to make public and give full effect to the results of elections of those organizations, the Committee considers that the actions denounced in the complaint of non-recognition of the president and board of directors of ANEP and the rejection by the highest public authorities of the representative organization of employers after its April  elections constitute a serious violation of freedom of association in general and, in particular, of the autonomy of employers' and workers' organizations and their right to freely elect their representatives. The Committee considers that, in view of the well-known fact of the election of the president of the most representative employers' organization in the country, which was widely publicized in the media, the requirement of a procedural formality in order to be recognized and to be able to act as a legitimate spokesperson before the authorities is an act that is not compatible with the principle of freedom of association.
.The Committee recalls in this regard that when the authorities intervene during the election proceedings of workers' or employers' organizations, expressing their opinion of the candidates and the consequences of the election, this seriously challenges the principle that those organizations have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom, and that it is for such organizations to appoint their own representatives on consultative bodies.
.Furthermore, the Committee notes the June  discussion before the Committee on the Application of Standards of the",1,2020,El Salvador
5,"International Labour Conference on the application in El Salvador of the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention,  (No. ), and the fact that the Committee urged the Government to refrain from interfering in the establishment and activities of independent organizations of workers and employers, in particular ANEP.
.In the light of the foregoing, and deploring the situation denounced, the Committee requests the Government to immediately take the necessary measures to ensure full respect of ANEP s autonomy, recognize the results of its April  elections, in particular of its president, Mr Simn Dada, and recognize the employers' organization as a social partner so as to enable ANEP to participate fully in social dialogue through the representatives of its choice.
.As to the alleged incidents of harassment against the business group of the president of ANEP, the Committee observes significant discrepancies between the claims contained in the complaint ' stating that the Government arbitrarily ordered the closure of an enterprise of that business group ' and the Government s reply ' stating that the action was a general measure taken as part of the lockdown and mandatory quarantine decreed by law to contain the pandemic. In view of these discrepancies, the Committee invites the complainant organization to provide further details on the alleged harassment of the business group of the president of ANEP or of any other company affiliated to this organization that is the target of hostile actions, so that the matter can be examined with all relevant elements, and requests the Government to provide further information in support of its assertion that the action challenged in the complaint was a general measure.The Committee s recommendations
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to immediately take the necessary measures to ensure full respect for the autonomy of the National Association of Private Enterprise (ANEP), recognize the results of its April  elections, in particular of its president, Mr Javier Ernesto Simn Dada, and recognize the employers' organization as a social partner, so as to enable ANEP to participate fully in social dialogue through the representatives of its choice.(b) The Committee invites the complainant organization to provide further details on the alleged harassment of the business group of the president of ANEP or of any other company affiliated to this organization that is the target of hostile actions, and requests the Government to provide further information in support of its assertion that the action challenged in the complaint was a general measure.",1,2020,El Salvador
6,".The complaint is included in a joint communication from the Union of Municipal Workers of Santa Ana (SITRAMSA) and the National Confederation of Salvadoran Workers (CNTS) of  September .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  February .
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ) and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  September , the complainant organizations allege that in October  the administration of the ARENA political party, to which the mayor of the municipality of Santa Ana, Mr Moreira Cruz, belonged and its plural municipal council (comprising councillors from his party and other parties, apart from the Farabundo Mart National Liberation Front (FMLN) and the Grand Alliance for National Unity (GANA) political parties), requested SITRAMSA to support them. Since the trade union did not accede to this request, this led to a discrimination campaign against SITRAMSA, threats of dismissals of its members, and non-compliance with the arbitration ruling. The complainant organizations indicate that the arbitration ruling, issued on  May  by the Court of Arbitration during the direct reconciliation proceedings, has the status of a collective labour agreement, was registered with the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare and entered into force on  January . The complainant organizations allege that the municipal administration failed to comply with several of the  clauses of the arbitration ruling, despite the fact that compliance with all of them was compulsory for both parties.
.The complainant organizations allege that, at the beginning of , the municipal administration began to delay the payment of instalments for loans that members had with financial institutions, banks and cooperatives, even though those instalments had been deducted from the salaries of workers, who had fallen into arrears and were exposed to the payment of additional interest, and threats of seizure. The complainant organizations allege that the funds had been used by the administration to cover the municipality s debts, thereby infringing paragraph  of the arbitration ruling relating to the retention of union dues, payment of external funds held in custody and workers' contributions.
.They also allege that between January and February , the workers who were members of SITRAMSA, Mr Cuellar, Mr Leiva and Mr Meja, were subject to discrimination as they were trade union members and as the result of personal circumstances, following which they were dismissed. They allege also that  employees were suspended and their salaries reduced without justification, in specific violation of paragraphs ,  and  of the arbitration ruling, relating to employment stability, and non-discrimination and special rights for trade union members.
.The complainant organizations state that, in February , in the face of constant violations of freedom of association and the arbitration ruling, and since the authorities and the mayor did not respond, trade union activities were conducted to request observance of employment rights and compliance with the arbitration ruling. Similarly, on  February  SITRAMSA lodged a relevant complaint with the Office of the Prosecutor for the Defence of Human Rights, and requested this Office to mediate between the parties. The Mayor s Office of the Municipality of Santa Ana did not, however, wish to engage in dialogue, as a result of which the Office of the Prosecutor issued a ruling on  June , recording the fact that the municipal administration had abused its authority.
.The complainant organizations state that on  February  the management council of SITRAMISA (ten members) was notified of its indefinite suspension with dismissal proceedings. It was also informed that similar proceedings would be instituted against the  employees of the trade union committees in the following days, in addition to  trade union members, together with a reduction in the salaries of more than  workers who had participated in the trade union activities. The council members were also informed that the premises assigned to the trade union was being used by the municipal administration and that henceforth they would be denied entry to the premises. All the officials were forbidden to enter the municipal mayor s offices, an example of trade union persecution. The complainant organizations state that on  February  the municipal authorities arbitrarily closed and seized the trade union premises. The union members were escorted by the police out of the municipal mayor s offices. The complainants attached a copy of a letter, dated  May , which was sent by SITRAMISA to the then lady mayor of Santa Ana. It requested that the trade union officials be reinstated and indicated that the officials were the subject of a court ruling ordering their reinstatement. In the letter, the trade union also requested that the  workers who had been suspended and were trade union members be reinstated.
.The complainant organizations allege that as of  February  the members of SITRAMSA were the subject of discrimination as a result of their trade union membership ( members); similarly, trade unions attached to the municipal government and with a smaller number of members (SITRAMUSA,  members, and SEMSA,  members) forced the workers to give up their membership of SITRAMSA and the same municipal government conducted anti-union activities by taking photographs of any worker who supported the union. The complainant organizations also report that there were  suspensions with dismissal proceedings and  dismissals owing to the expiry of contracts, thereby constituting unfair dismissals in different areas. Further, there is a persistent threat that more workers will be dismissed when their employment contracts expire, affecting all the above-mentioned union members.
.Finally, the complainants allege that in  and  there were delays in the delivery of the basic basket of goods, and the supermarket vouchers, awarded in the arbitration ruling, were not given. Similarly, benefits such as home help in the case of death of family members and life insurance were infringed and abolished, as was paid vacation for administrative employees. The complainant organizations allege that the above measures are designed to undermine the claims that were successful in the arbitration ruling. They also allege that, as of  May , the new lady mayor. Ms Caldern de Escaln, adopted the same policy of deleting clauses from the SITRAMSA arbitration ruling. The mayor had stated in newspaper stories that the collective agreement had already expired and, for that reason, the benefits resulting from the agreement were not granted.
.In its communication of  February , the Government submits its observations, together with those of the Mayor s Office of the Municipality of Santa Ana. As regards the alleged non-compliance with the arbitration ruling, the Mayor s Office indicates that the ruling was issued on  May , and was in force for three years, from  January  to  December . The Mayor s Office indicates that, although the ruling could be extended automatically, provided that none of the parties requested it to be revised, in this case, both parties (the municipality of Santa Ana and SITRAMSA) did request the arbitration ruling to be revised before the Public Service Tribunal. Therefore, since such a revision was requested, the ruling was not extended for one more year and remained in force until  December . The Mayor s Office also states that to date no other valid collective labour agreement exists, that has been concluded by the municipality of Santa Ana and SITRAMSA. The municipal Mayor s Office emphasizes that when the Mayor took power, in May , the ruling in question was no longer valid and that, in any case, she was not aware which benefits from the ruling were not complied with.
.In relation to the alleged threats of dismissal of trade union members and the alleged prohibition on entry to the municipal mayor s offices, those offices indicate that since the current administration came to powers, i.e. on  May , it has always observed and guaranteed the social and individual rights of any person who is a trade union member. The mayor s offices state that it was the municipal authorities which were in power from  May  to  April , that put forward requests for authorization of dismissal of various municipal employees to the judge of the Santa Ana Labour Court. These employees include the SITRAMSA officials, who were deemed to have undertaken actions that were construed as reasons for dismissal under the Municipal Administrative Career Act, as they had endangered the health of the population of Santa Ana, unlawfully obstructed the collection of solid waste by the municipality, and used violent means to close municipal facilities and obstructed lorries collecting solid waste from leaving. In view of the above, the Municipal Council of Santa Ana requested authorization for dismissal of the union officials from the judge of the Santa Ana Labour Court, prior to taking the decision to dismiss them. Since the municipal employees involved, including the union officials, were made aware of the requests",1,2018,El Salvador
7,"that had been filed against them, they abandoned their posts in February  and did not report for work.
.The Government indicates that it requested information on this case from the judge of the Santa Ana Labour Court and that the judge had responded that his records contained the details of two cases which were already finalized and had been filed: (i) as regards Ms Cuellar, a final ruling was issued on  April  declaring that the request to nullify the dismissal was not receivable, as confirmed by the Chamber of Second Instance; and (ii) as for Ms Leiva, on  February , a final ruling was issued declaring the dismissal to be null and void, as confirmed by the respective Chamber of Second Instance. The case was currently with the First Labour Chamber, since an appeal had been lodged against an initial ruling made on  July . The Government attached a note from the Santa Ana Labour Court in which the labour judge states that he could not provide the Government with information on the dismissal authorization proceedings concerning the SITRAMSA officials, because their names or case numbers had not been communicated.
.Finally, the Government indicates that it will continue to follow up on this case and provide information on any progress made.
.The Committee observes that in this case, the complainant organizations allege that, at the beginning of  and after not supporting the party to which he belonged, the then mayor of Santa Ana and the municipal council of the mayor s office (excluding the FMLN and GANA political parties) undertook a campaign of discrimination against SITRAMSA, threatening its officials with dismissal and failing to comply with various clauses of the arbitration ruling issued in  (a ruling which has the status of a collective labour agreement). They also allege that suspensions and dismissals of trade union members (including the ten members of the management council) took place and that the union premises were closed. The Committee notes that, according to the complainant organizations, on  February  SITRAMSA reported these matters to the Office of the Prosecutor for the Defence of Human Rights.
.As regards the alleged failure to comply with the arbitration ruling (clauses relating to employment stability; non-discrimination: retention of trade-union dues and payment of external custodial funds; economic assistance, etc.), the Committee notes that the mayor s office of the municipality of Santa Ana indicates that: (i) both the municipality of Santa Ana and SITRAMSA made a request to the Public Service Tribunal for the ruling to be revised, for which reason it was not automatically extended and was in force until  December , (ii) it was unaware which benefits from the ruling were not complied with and, in any case, when it took power in May , the ruling was no longer valid, and (iii) no valid collective agreement with SITRAMSA currently exists.
.The Committee observes that the complainant organizations attached to their complaint a copy of the arbitration ruling and that, according to the provisions of paragraph , the ruling was valid for three years as of  January , after which date it would be automatically extended for one-year periods, provided that no party requested it to be revised. The Committee notes that although it is not clear from the complaint that any of the parties requested the ruling to be revised, the municipal mayor s office indicates that both parties appear to have requested such a revision and that the ruling seemingly ceased to be valid at the end of . The Committee notes, in any case, that the complainant organizations allege that the failure to comply with the ruling appears to have begun at the start of , and regrets to observe that, in its response, the municipal mayor s office simply indicates that it was unaware which benefits from the ruling were not complied with. In any case, the current administration took up office in May , when the ruling was no longer in force. Recalling that agreements should be binding on the parties and that mutual respect for the commitment undertaken in collective agreements is an important element of the right to bargain collectively and should be upheld in order to establish labour relations on stable and firm ground [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , paras  and ], the Committee requests the Government and the complainant organizations to provide information and specific documentation relating to the revision of the arbitration ruling. Similarly, it requests the Government, if the ruling is valid, to take all necessary measures to ensure full compliance therewith.
.As regards the alleged suspensions and dismissals of union members (including the ten members of the SITRAMSA management council), the Committee notes that the municipal mayor s office indicates that: (i) since it came to power on  May , it has always observed and guaranteed the rights of trade union members, (ii) the previous municipal administration had made requests for authorization of dismissal of various municipal employees, including the SITRAMSA officials, for having endangered the health of the population of Santa Ana, unlawfully obstructing the collection of solid waste by the municipality, using violent means to close municipal facilities, and obstructing lorries collecting solid waste from leaving, and (iii) in February , the municipal employees, including the union officials, were made aware of the requests that had been made against them, abandoned their posts and did not report for work. The Committee also notes that the Government has attached a note from the judge of the Santa Ana labour court, which states that: (i) Ms Cuellar, a member of SITRAMSA, is the subject of a final ruling declaring that the request to nullify the dismissal is not receivable, and (ii) Ms Leiva, a member of SITRAMSA, is the subject of a final ruling declaring her dismissal to be null and void, as confirmed by the chamber of second instance, and which is currently with the first labour chamber as the result of an appeal lodged against an initial ruling made on  July  (copies of the rulings are not attached).
.The Committee observes that the complainant organizations attached to their complaint a copy of the ruling handed down by the Office of the Prosecutor for the Defence of Human Rights on  June , noting that the ruling confirms the violation of labour rights, trade union freedoms, and those deriving from the right of association, owing to unlawful acts or those infringing the employment stability of union officials and trade union persecution. The Office of the Prosecutor indicated that the municipal mayor bears responsibility for these violations and recommended to that authority that the necessary administrative proceedings be undertaken to reinstate the union officials, and also other workers, immediately. It also indicated that it would inform the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare of the ruling so that the Minister exercised appropriate supervision.
.The Committee also notes that the complainant organizations attached a copy of a letter which SITRAMSA sent on  May  to the then lady mayor of Santa Ana. The Committee observes that in the letter the trade union requests that the SITRAMSA officials be reinstated and indicates that the officials were the subject of a judicial ruling ordering that they be reinstated. In the letter, the union also requested that the  suspended workers who were members of the trade union be reinstated. The Committee notes that although the information provided by the complainant organizations would appear to show that the union officials were the subject of a ruling ordering their reinstatement and that those officials had seemingly not been reinstated, at least as of the date of submission of the complaint, according to the municipal mayor s office the union officials had abandoned their posts in February , when they were made aware of the requests for dismissal that had been made against them. Furthermore, the Committee points out that in a note attached by the Government and signed by the judge of the Santa Ana Labour Court, the judge indicated that he could not provide information relating to the dismissal authorization proceedings concerning the SITRAMSA officials, because their names or case numbers had not been communicated.
.Recalling in general that no person should be dismissed or prejudiced in employment by reason of trade union membership or legitimate trade union activities, and that it is important to forbid or penalize in practice all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of employment [see Compilation, para. ], the Committee requests the Government and the complainant organizations to supply a copy of any court ruling issued in relation to the dismissals of the union members and officials. The Committee urges the Government to take all the necessary initiatives, including by means of dialogue with SITRAMSA, to ensure that the union officials are immediately reinstated, provided that these officials are the subject of relevant court orders, and also that workers for whom the anti-union nature of their suspensions or",0,2018,El Salvador
8,"dismissals has been confirmed are reinstated.
.As regards the allegation that the discrimination campaign against SITRAMSA and its members appears to have originated because the trade union had not allegedly supported the political party to which the then municipal mayor of Santa Ana belonged, the Committee reaffirms the principle expressed by the International Labour Conference in the resolution concerning the independence of the trade union movement that governments should not attempt to transform the trade union movement into an instrument for the pursuance of political aims, nor should they attempt to interfere with the normal functions of a trade union movement because of its freely established relationship with a political party [see Compilation, para. ].
.As regards the allegation that the municipal authorities arbitrarily closed and seized the trade union s premises, thereby denying access to those premises for officials and members, who were escorted by the police out of the municipal mayor s offices, while regretting that the Government has not submitted any detailed observations in this regard, the Committee recalls that the access of trade union members to their union premises should not be restricted by the state authorities [see Compilation, para. ] and urges the Government to guarantee strict observance of such access.
.In the light of the foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government and the complainant organizations to provide information and specific documentation relating to the revision of the arbitration ruling. It also requests the Government, provided that the ruling is in force, to take the necessary measures to ensure that the ruling is applied in full.(b) The Committee requests the Government and the complainant organizations to provide a copy of any court ruling issued in relation to the dismissals of the union members and officials. The Committee urges the Government to take all the necessary initiatives, including by means of dialogue with SITRAMSA, to ensure that the union officials are immediately reinstated, provided that these officials are the subject of relevant court orders, and also that workers for whom the anti-union nature of their suspensions or dismissals has been confirmed are reinstated,(c) The Committee urges the Government to guarantee access for SITRAMSA members to their union premises.",-1,2018,El Salvador
9,".The complaint is contained in communications from the Union of Health Solidarity Fund Workers (SITRAFOS) and the Autonomous Federation of Salvadoran Workers (CATS) dated  May and  October .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  June .
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainant organizations report delays and other obstacles to collective bargaining suffered by the majority trade union at the Health Solidarity Fund (FOSALUD) (the employing institution).
.In their communication of  May , the complainant organizations condemn the fact that the various state bodies in which they participated in order to engage in collective bargaining in strict accordance with the law, instead of creating conditions to facilitate or promote negotiation, have shown deliberate intent to obstruct it. They allege that this has allowed the employer to avoid negotiating with SITRAFOS. The complainants state that:SITRAFOS is the majority trade union at the employing institution with , members and, in accordance with the requirements of section  of the Labour Code (to have at least  per cent of the workers as members), it drew up a set of demands in the form of a draft collective agreement, which was approved by its general assembly on  June , and, following the procedure established in the Labour Code, it made a request on  October  to the Directorate-General of Labour to launch the direct contact phase in the negotiation process;on  November , SITRAFOS was notified of the decision of  October  of the Director-General of Labour instructing the representatives of FOSALUD (the employer) to certify the type of employment relationship that existed between the institution and its workers (individual employment contracts or appointments under the Wages Act);on  November , the Minister of Health, as the legal representative of FOSALUD, issued a reply indicating that  employees had individual contracts and the other , were employed under the Wages Act;on the basis of this information, arguing that if the process was conducted on the basis of the Labour Code the resulting collective agreement would only apply to the minority of workers holding individual contracts, the Labour Director-General, by a decision of  November , declared that the matter lay outside her competence and that the Civil Service Act was applicable. In this regard, the complainants questioned the validity of the above-mentioned argument and pointed out that, under the existing legal provisions, the resulting collective agreement ' irrespective of the legislative basis ' would apply to all workers. They emphasized that the Labour Director-General was aware of this, since there had been previous examples of autonomous institutions which, like FOSALUD, employ workers on individual contracts as well as workers appointed under the Wages Act, and in these institutions collective agreements exist which have been negotiated on the basis of the provisions of the Labour Code and apply to all workers;SITRAFOS had no choice but to use the procedure established in the Civil Service Act and on  December  it submitted to the Civil Service Tribunal (TSC) the request and documentation for initiating the direct contact phase;by a decision of  January , the TSC issued four specific reservations, which SITRAFOS resolved satisfactorily within the stated deadline;however, the TSC was dilatory in not informing the FOSALUD representatives until  March , when it issued a decision requesting the latter to submit the payroll of public servants working at the institution. The complainants object that this requirement was not only unnecessary ' since the union s request already contained the relevant documentation, which the employer had forwarded to the Ministry of Labour and which SITRAFOS had already sent to the TSC ' but was also imposed without fixing a time limit, thereby paving the way for further delays; and;the Minister of Health, representing the employer, had not completed this formality at the time of presentation of the complaint ( May ), thereby unduly delaying the procedure, despite possessing the information and having previously sent it to the Ministry of Labour.
.By a communication of  October , the complainants provided additional documentation condemning the continuation of the delaying tactics, since the bargaining process had still not started at that date. By a decision of  June , the TSC finally confirmed that the requirements of the Civil Service Act (having a membership of at least  per cent of the workers) had been met, and so it would be possible to proceed to the initial phase of direct contact. However, the employer s representatives continued with their delaying tactics. Instead of calling a meeting with the union representatives in accordance with its legal obligation (section  of the Civil Service Act gave the employer  hours, from the time of the TSC decision, to hold a meeting with the requesting party), the employer addressed a note directly to the TSC, dated  June , delaying even further the start of negotiations.
.The complainants indicate that, as a result of these manoeuvres, the TSC summoned the parties to a hearing to be held on  July  to determine the date and time of negotiations (which, under the terms of the Civil Service Act, should have been determined within the  hours following the decision of  June ). Moreover, the complainants object that in this summons the institution s proposal was not sent to SITRAFOS, which would have enabled progress to be made. Lastly, the complainants indicate that this proposal was not sincere either, since on the day of the hearing the employer s representatives, far from maintaining this proposal, refused to enter into negotiations and presented three additional delaying motions that lacked any legal basis, and these were addressed by the TSC.
.In its communication of  June , the Government has provided the responses of the authorities concerned to the allegations made in the complaint. The Government states that:on  October , the Director-General of Labour issued a decision requesting FOSALUD to certify the type of its employment relationship with its workers. FOSALUD replied on  November , stating that it employed  workers on individual contracts and , on appointment agreements under the terms of the Wages Act;by a decision of  January , the TSC acknowledged receipt of the set of demands containing the revised version of the FOSALUD collective labour agreement and it issued reservations which were resolved by SITRAFOS on  February ;on  April , the TSC notified the employer of the decision, requesting it to send the payroll of employees working at the institution;on  May , FOSALUD replied, certifying that SITRAFOS met the requirement of having a membership of more than  per cent of the workers;on  June , notification was received of the TSC official letter of  June , informing the FOSALUD representatives of the set of demands and requiring them to reach agreement with the requesting trade union within  hours (under the terms of section  of the Civil Service Act) regarding the place, date and time for opening negotiations;on  June , FOSALUD sent a communication to the TSC proposing that the negotiations be held on Thursdays at  a.m.;on  July , a meeting was held at the TSC to enable the parties to reach an agreement on the scheduling of meetings. The Government points out that no agreement was reached at the above-mentioned meeting because the TSC representative started the meeting on the mistaken premise that the negotiation process had been exhausted;on  July , two motions were brought before the TSC: (a) one by SITRAFOS, alleging a violation of the right of defence and failure to meet the -hour deadline established by law; and (b) the other by the employing institution, to clarify whether the bargaining committee appointed by the union in  still had the same legitimacy and representativeness to negotiate the collective agreement (or whether a new bargaining committee had been given legitimacy at the previous general assembly);in view of the concerns expressed by SITRAFOS regarding the delays, FOSALUD sent the TSC a communication on  October  denying any lack of willingness and declaring its readiness to the TSC to continue with the phases of the process, and requested a meeting with SITRAFOS to establish a mechanism to streamline notifications;on  November , the TSC declared certain previous notifications and decisions null and void and summoned the representatives of FOSALUD and SITRAFOS to appear before it;by a ruling of  December , the TSC placed on record that no agreement had been reached by the parties at the meeting of  November regarding the scheduling of meetings;by a decision of  January , the TSC acknowledged receipt of the certification of the record of the general assembly authorizing the elected executive committee to engage in the negotiation process;on  February , FOSALUD received an instruction",1,2018,El Salvador
10,"for the parties concerned to agree on a timetable for holding meetings in the direct contact phase;on  February , the representatives of the parties went to the TSC, where a FOSALUD representative stated that, in accordance with the updated information at the institution s disposal, SITRAFOS no longer had a membership of  per cent of the workers. Consequently, it stated that, being liable for its actions and acting on the basis of the principle of legality, the institution was not obliged to negotiate. The Government has forwarded a communication from that representative, stating that in the public sector voluntary negotiation is not possible if the  per cent requirement is not fulfilled (something which is possible under the Labour Code). The grounds put forward are that public officials do not have decision-making power to commit public funds for the future, or any other powers apart from those explicitly laid down by law, and that voluntary collective bargaining in the public sector, although not expressly prohibited, would be open to challenge on account of a lack of regulation. In this regard, the SITRAFOS bargaining committee replied that the TSC had already resolved the above-mentioned motion at the time (corroborating the necessary representativeness) and that it had been filed out of time. This being the case, no agreement had been reached to determine the place, date and time for engaging in the direct contact phase; andon  March , the TSC acknowledged receipt of the motion refusing negotiations on the grounds that SITRAFOS did not have the necessary representativeness.
.Lastly, the Government states that at no time did FOSALUD launch internal campaigns to undermine any of the trade unions at the institution, let alone to cause them any loss of membership. It concludes by stating that FOSALUD hopes that the TSC will resolve the outstanding motion so that negotiations regarding a collective agreement can go ahead.
.The Committee observes that in the present case the complainant organizations report delays and other obstacles to collective bargaining from the authorities concerned. The Committee notes that the negotiation process was proposed in a public health sector institution (FOSALUD), where some workers had been contracted under the Labour Code and others under the Wages Act, and that, since most workers had been appointed under the Wages Act, the Directorate-General of Labour decided that the procedure established under the Civil Service Act should be applied; SITRAFOS complied with this, following the procedures provided for in the aforementioned Act.
.The Committee observes that, although the authorities indicate that they are willing to engage in negotiations, after a process initiated by SITRAFOS in October  and with no success in fixing a place and date for sessions in the direct contact phase of negotiations, in February  FOSALUD stated that it was unable to proceed with negotiations since SITRAFOS no longer had the  per cent representativeness required by the Civil Service Act for compulsory collective bargaining.
.In general terms, with regard to the alleged refusal of FOSALUD to negotiate with SITRAFOS on the grounds that the latter no longer represented  per cent of the workers, the Committee has considered that if there is no union covering more than  per cent of the workers in a unit, collective bargaining rights should nevertheless be granted to the unions in this unit, at least on behalf of their own members [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , para. ].
.Furthermore, with regard to this specific case, the Committee observes that the objection made by FOSALUD that the membership had decreased in  is a matter which, as indicated by SITRAFOS, was reportedly dealt with at the start of the procedure (compliance was verified by the TSC by a decision of  June , admitting the list of demands and affirming that SITRAFOS had the stated percentage). In addition, the Committee observes that the alleged decrease in SITRAFOS membership below  per cent in  is not an obstacle to negotiation via the procedures established by the Labour Code (these procedures, as asserted by the complainants and not denied by the Government, do allow voluntary negotiation when the  per cent level of representativeness is not achieved and apply to other institutions with similar mixed situations ' in other words, involving workers appointed under the Wages Act as well as workers hired on the basis of the Labour Code).
.The Committee recalls the importance which it attaches to the obligation to negotiate in good faith for the maintenance of the harmonious development of labour relations, and also recalls that the principle that both employers and trade unions should negotiate in good faith and make efforts to reach an agreement means that any unjustified delay in the holding of negotiations should be avoided The Committee also recalls that both employers and trade unions should bargain in good faith and make every effort to come to an agreement, and satisfactory labour relations depend primarily on the attitudes of the parties towards each other and on their mutual confidence [see Compilation, paras ,  and ].
.In this regard, the Committee observes that the Government, apart from denying the allegation of a lack of willingness to negotiate and stating its readiness to streamline and complete the negotiation process, does not deny or attempt to justify the specific instances of procrastination reported in the complaint (for example, one and a half months for FOSALUD to communicate information which it possessed and which it had already sent to the Ministry of Labour) or the resulting delay (over  months since the start of the procedure without any progress). The negotiation process having started at the end of , there had still been no compliance in May  with the initial requirement (agreeing on the schedule for direct contact meetings), for which the law prescribes no more than  hours. In conclusion, the Committee notes with regret that, in the negotiation process launched by SITRAFOS, a series of actions and delays occurred which could be ascribed to the authorities concerned and which had the effect of obstructing the negotiations. The Committee considers that situations of this kind can undermine confidence in the system of labour relations in the sector. Lastly, the Committee observes that although the Government refers to the decrease in union membership as an obstacle to negotiation, it concludes its observations by stating that FOSALUD is waiting for that issue to be resolved in order to conduct negotiations for the collective agreement.
.In these circumstances, the Committee firmly expects that the authorities concerned will take the appropriate measures to promote the negotiation of a collective agreement between FOSALUD and SITRAFOS without further delay. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of all progress in this respect.
.In the light of the foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:",1,2018,El Salvador
11,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the National Union of Prison Workers (SITRAPEN) of  February .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication of  February .
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  February , the complainant union, which is in the prison sector, alleges that the authorities are taking efforts aimed at breaking up the union and calls for full recognition of the right of prison workers to organize.
.SITRAPEN alleges that the Government pursued a separatist strategy to break up the union. The complainant union states that: (i) the lawyers of the Directorate-General for Prisons are relentlessly hounding workers throughout the working day, asking them to fill in forms to withdraw their membership; and (ii) they then send these forms to the Ministry of Labour and Social Security so that it can authorize the withdrawals, in violation of the Constitution and the ILO Conventions.
.The complainant union alleges that, both in its actions and in its decisions, the Government uses the argument that custodial officers of the prison system do not benefit from the right to organize, as they are excluded from the administrative career system under the Civil Service Act. This is notwithstanding the  constitutional reform that was introduced in order to ensure conformity with ILO standards, which lifted this restriction on freedom of association.
.The complainant union considers that: the Government should respect the right of prison workers to organize; the Ministry of Labour and Social Security should declare itself incompetent to continue taking over the role relating to the union membership of workers that the Civil Service Act confers on trade union executive boards; and all of the withdrawals authorized by the Ministry should be declared null and void and the outstanding membership dues should be paid to the union (a copy of the decisions on withdrawal taken by the Directorate-General for Labour is attached to the complaint).
.In its communication of  February , the Government provides the replies of the authorities concerned in respect of the allegations raised in the complaint. The Government states that:(i)	large numbers of SITRAPEN members have approached the National Department of Trade Unions claiming that the members of the union s executive board refuse to accept their withdrawal from the union. The Government adds that there has been an increase in the number of withdrawals by SITRAPEN members since the end of ;(ii)	with regard to the procedure for withdrawing from a trade union before the National Department of Trade Unions, the Government points out that this procedure is followed in accordance with the provisions of section  of the Civil Service Act, which provides that, in the event that the members of the executive board refuse to accept the withdrawal, the withdrawing worker may apply to the Ministry of Labour and Social Security. Under this provision, the legal representatives of the trade union are summoned so that they can be notified of the worker s decision and, once the procedure has been completed, the order confirming the withdrawal is sent out and the relevant party is instructed to stop deducting the trade union dues from its payments;(iii)	as a safety precaution in such cases, which also applies in respect of other unions, the Government requires any workers who wish to withdraw their union membership to submit an affidavit, to be authenticated by a notary, stating that the executive board of the union to which they belong refuses to accept their withdrawal;(iv)	under the Constitution, the authorities are required to accept such applications and the Civil Service Act provides for the possibility that the worker concerned might not be physically present. Accordingly, it is not possible to accede to the request made by the complainant union to reject applications for withdrawal from a trade union that are not submitted in person by the withdrawing worker;(v)	the authorities are merely complying with due process, which is demonstrated in the decisions on withdrawal made by the Directorate-General for Labour that are annexed to the text of the complaint. These records show that, although both parties had been summoned, neither the workers who submitted the application for withdrawal nor the union representatives attended the hearing, and therefore the withdrawal was carried out on the basis of the documentation submitted, with both the workers and SITRAPEN being duly notified; and(vi)	the Directorate-General for Prisons states that it has acted in accordance with the law and that it has not intervened or interfered in respect of the freedom of association of SITRAPEN members, and the Government considers, as is clear from the above, that there is no separatist strategy to break up SITRAPEN or to promote the withdrawal of its members, as is falsely alleged in the complaint.
.The Committee notes that the complaint alleges that the authorities are interfering in a prison-sector union by encouraging the withdrawal of its members; and it alleges a failure to give full recognition to the right of prison workers to organize.
.The Committee notes that, while the complainant organization alleges that the prison authorities are encouraging the withdrawal of its members, the Government denies these allegations and states that it has followed the legally established procedure for cases in which the union s executive board refuses to accept the withdrawal of its members. The Government states that, in accordance with this procedure, the union was notified of the withdrawal request and it did not appear at the hearing to which it was summoned. The Government highlights that compliance with this procedure is demonstrated in the decisions on withdrawal that have been sent by the complainant together with the complaint, which support the explanations given by the authorities. The Government adds that, as a precautionary measure, the authorities require the submission of an affidavit by the worker alleging that the executive board has not accepted their withdrawal. The complainant organization considers that, through these actions, the authorities are interfering in the internal affairs of the union.
.The Committee considers that it is not contrary to freedom of association to have a rule allowing workers to notify the competent authorities of their withdrawal if the union s executive board refuses to accept it. With regard to the allegation that the employer s lawyers are hounding the workers to leave SITRAPEN, the Committee notes that the prison authorities deny any act of interference and that the complainant does not provide any details or evidence that would allow the allegation to be examined. In these circumstances, the Committee will not pursue its examination of these allegations.
.The Committee also notes the complainant organization s allegation, which is not challenged by the Government, that the authorities continue to refer to legal provisions that are not in conformity with freedom of association principles and that restrict the full recognition of the right of prison workers to organize. In this regard, the Committee notes that the ILO supervisory bodies have been calling for the necessary measures to be taken to amend the legislative provisions that exclude certain categories of public servants from the right to organize (including the provisions of the Civil Service Act cited by the complainant organization, in particular section ). In this regard, the Committee has urged the Government as a matter of urgency to ensure that the national legislation of El Salvador is amended in such a way that it recognizes the right of association of workers employed in the service of the State, with the sole possible exception of the armed forces and the police [see Case No. , rd Report, para. , th Report, para. , and th Report, para. ]. The Committee must recall, in respect of the specific case that is the subject of the complaint, that prison staff should enjoy the right to organize [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , para. ]. The Committee expects that the Government will take the necessary measures to ensure full respect of the right of prison staff to organize and refers the legislative aspects of the case to the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, and requests that, if deemed necessary, the Government avail itself of ILO technical assistance in this regard.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee expects the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure full respect of the right of prison staff to organize.(b)	The Committee refers the legislative aspects of the case to the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.(c)	The Committee requests that, if deemed necessary, the Government avail itself of ILO technical assistance in this regard.",1,2018,El Salvador
12,".The complaint is contained in communications dated  August  and  June  from the Trade Union of Employees of the Office of the Ombudsperson for Human Rights of El Salvador (SEPRODEHES).
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  February and  September  and  January .
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communications, the complainant alleges violations of freedom of association by the titular head of the Office of the Ombudsperson for Human Rights (the Ombudsperson), in particular: violations of freedom of expression and freedom of association; failure to respond to requests and communications, cancellation of planned meetings and hearings and other refusals to participate, in contravention of the arbitration award that serves as the collective labour agreement (the LACCT); and workplace harassment of the Secretary-General of the board of directors, as well as other arbitrary acts carried out on the instructions of the Ombudsperson.
.The complainant states that on  July  industrial action was taken outside one of the institution s premises to call on the Ombudsperson to resume dialogue, which she had broken off in March , and to comply with the LACCT. In response, that same day, the Ombudsperson issued a memorandum (No. /) in which she made false accusations in an effort to stigmatize the industrial action as a criminal offence and  acts of vandalism and gender violence' ' accusations that constituted an effort to limit freedom of expression and association. In that same memorandum, the Ombudsperson did not recognize the board of directors of SEPRODEHES, refusing to hold dialogue with the trade union, even though it is the legitimate representative of the majority of workers, and called on employees to organize themselves independently of SEPRODEHES. In that regard, the complainant submits the text of several internal communications from the Ombudsperson to the workers, in which she attacks the board of directors and attempts to influence the electoral process, stating, for example:  I believe that the current board of directors is not sufficiently representative and I urge staff members, whether they are union members or not, to seek objective and professional representatives ' in order to be able to embark upon mechanisms of dialogue with the administration'  or  I vow to ensure that true representatives will be elected'  or, in a communiqu issued the day before the elections, accusations that members of the board of had committed criminal offences, abandoned their work duties and were only acting in their own interests. The complainant also submits press releases containing statements from the Ombudsperson making serious and unfounded accusations against the members of the trade union s board of directors (calling its two main leaders  criminals' or stating that  they are not staff members of the institution and they are getting money for nothing'  adding that  these two people and ten other people do not do anything at all' and that  I do not take any notice of criminals' . In addition, the complainant reports that the Ombudsperson denied the request made by the trade union for its members to attend an extraordinary general assembly, arguing that the activity was not  explicitly provided for in the work plan, which they have not even submitted to me correctly' ' which was not true, because the board of directors of SEPRODEHES had indeed submitted that work plan.
.The complainant adds that, during the '  term of the board of directors, the Ombudsperson systematically and repeatedly failed to respond to documents submitted by the trade union and refused requested hearings: (i) even though the Ombudsperson had signed a memorandum (/ of  January ) containing the schedule of the year s twelve meetings, only one meeting was held, on  March , and the following meetings were cancelled without notifying the trade union; (ii) by means of memorandum No. / of  June , the Ombudsperson violated clause  of the LACCT, which established that she should have a presence at the meetings, by appointing a committee to represent her; (iii) in memorandum / of  July  the Ombudsperson annulled the previous memorandum by cancelling the scheduled meetings with the aforementioned committee; and (iv) as of April , the unilateral breakdown of dialogue was confirmed, when the board of directors of the trade union was prevented from participating in budget management, as established in clause  of the LACCT. SEPRODEHES affirms that, in spite of these denials, it remains open to dialogue, and on  August  it sent a mediation proposal to the Ombudsperson with a view to re-establishing dialogue.
.Lastly, the complainant alleges workplace harassment of its Secretary-General and other arbitrary anti-union activities. SEPRODEHES alleges that on  July , its Secretary-General, Mr Carlos Solrzano Padilla, was relieved of his duties in the institution by means of memorandum No. /, which required him to stop the work that had been assigned to him and move out of his office. Several days later, in a continuation of the illegal and arbitrary actions, people who work alongside the Ombudsperson took away the Secretary-General s computer and attempted to extract information from its hard drive ' as a result of his personal objections and those of other executives, the Secretary-General was eventually able to access his personal files. The Secretary-General was also required to present an inventory of the movable property that he used in his work for the institution. In addition, the trade union also makes reference to the dismissal of one of its members on  May  but does not provide details indicating that this is an anti-union measure.
.In its communications, the Government provides the responses of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare and the Office of the Ombudsperson to the allegations made in the complaint.
.The Government states that, although it is true that SEPRODEHES sent a document to the National Department of Social Organizations (DNOS) on  August  to request that they instruct the titular head of the Office of the Ombudsperson to stop interfering in the exercise of freedom of association, DNOS replied stating that it was not in a position to intervene and issue such instructions to the Office of the Ombudsperson. The Government specifies that it is not that it did not want to support the trade union, but that it was not able to intervene because there is an express prohibition on doing so. Nonetheless, the judicial route was available to the trade union for it to assert any rights that they considered to have been violated.
.As for the Ombudsperson, she affirms that: (i) it was in fact the board of directors of the trade union that carried out a repeated and systematic campaign to discredit the titular head of the Office of the Ombudsperson and those who work alongside her, and she believes that  their actions were borderline criminal, characterized by violence towards a woman and disrespect for her authority'  as well as harassment of workers who did not go along with their efforts to harangue and blockade management; (ii) their disrespectful conduct towards the titular head of the Office of the Ombudsperson and those who work alongside her made holding dialogue impossible, regardless of their willingness; (iii) the alleged violations have been presented out of context and are not true ' at no time did she obstruct the right of staff members to organize; (iv) her goodwill towards the working class was made clear when she took responsibility for the implementation of the LACCT, even though it lacked funding, so that all the workers could benefit from it, and she has faithfully complied with all the rights and benefits that the LACCT confers on the staff; (v) with regard to the schedule of meetings, the Secretary-General of SEPRODEHES was asked to submit the work plan with the activities listed, in accordance with clause  of the LACCT, but he did not do so; (vi) the members of the trade union and its board of directors had had absolute freedom to demonstrate, they hurled all sorts of insults at the Ombudsperson and carried out multiple protest actions, including road closures and generally limiting staff members' access to their work; and (vii) as a show of goodwill towards the complainant organization, on  October and  November  and  January , fifteen notices were submitted withdrawing actions that the previous titular head of the Office of the Ombudsperson had brought against the board of directors of SEPRODEHES.
.With regard to the alleged harassment of the Secretary-General of the complainant organization by removing him from his work duties, the Government states that his removal was linked to the fact that, in accordance with the LACCT, the Secretary-General had a  per cent exemption from the working day in order to carry out",1,2017,El Salvador
13,"his trade union activities. In this regard, the Government understands that by being part of the board of directors and having this full trade union leave, the Secretary-General had implicitly given up his work duties, which still needed to be done. In that regard, the Government reports that, in response to his dismissal, the Secretary-General brought a case alleging  clear injustice'  which was dismissed by the Civil Service Tribunal on  June  in a ruling declaring that the allegation of clear injustice was without basis.
.Lastly, in its communication dated  January , the Government states that: (i) on  October  the Legislative Assembly elected a new titular head of the Office of the Ombudsperson, who, in a television interview two days later, expressed his intention not to conflict with SEPRODEHES and to work harmoniously with the whole institution; and (ii) at a press conference on  October , SEPRODEHES gave the new Ombudsperson their vote of confidence, after holding a meeting at which they discussed issues of interest to the trade union and the new Ombudsperson committed to respecting the rights and benefits that had been obtained through the collective agreement.
.The Committee observes that in this case various allegations have been made that indicate the existence of a conflict situation and a lack of dialogue between the leadership of the Office of the Ombudsperson (the employer institution) and the complainant organization. On the one hand, the trade union reports acts of anti-union reprisal and stigmatization by the Ombudsperson in response to the exercise of legitimate trade union activities; failure to respond to requests and communications, cancellation of planned meetings and hearings and other refusals to participate, in contravention of the arbitration award that serves as the collective labour agreement (the LACCT); as well as anti-union discrimination, in particular the workplace harassment of the Secretary-General of the board of directors. On the other hand, the Government states that the Ministry of Labour authorities did not have the jurisdiction to intervene in the conflict and, with regard to the allegation of workplace harassment of the Secretary-General of the complainant organization, specifies that his removal was linked to his trade union leave, as established in the LACCT, and that the Civil Service Tribunal had made a ruling declaring that the case brought by the Secretary-General alleging clear injustice in this regard was without basis. The Government has also sent the response of the Ombudsperson, in which she states that: (i) it was in fact the board of directors of the trade union that, while having complete freedom to exercise their functions, behaved disrespectfully towards her and those who worked alongside her and that this had made holding dialogue impossible, regardless of their willingness; (ii) the goodwill of the Ombudsperson towards the working class was made clear when she took responsibility for the implementation of the LACCT, even though it lacked funding, so that all the workers could benefit from it, and she has faithfully complied with all the rights and benefits that the LACCT confers on the staff; and (iii) that goodwill was also demonstrated by the notices submitted withdrawing actions that the previous titular head of the Office of the Ombudsperson had brought against SEPRODEHES.
.Noting the differences between the allegations made by the complainant and the response of the Ombudsperson, the Committee observes the animosity in the public declarations of the Ombudsperson towards the trade union leadership, which the union provides extensive documentation to support and the Ombudsperson does not deny. The Committee observes, for example, that while the Ombudsperson indicates in her written statement to the Committee that she respects freedom of association and that members of the board have complete trade union leave to carry out their duties, in statements to the press she accuses them of being  criminals' or states that  they are not staff members of the institution and they are getting money for nothing'  adding that  these two people and ten other people do not do anything at all'  On the other hand, the Committee observes that the Ombudsperson states that it was in fact the trade union that carried out a repeated and systematic campaign to discredit the titular head of the Office of the Ombudsperson, and she believes that  their actions were borderline criminal, characterized by violence towards a woman and disrespect for her authority'  although she does not provide any supporting evidence to back up these assertions. The Committee also takes note of the internal communications in which the Ombudsperson used her position in the institution to attack the board of directors and interfere in the trade union elections, sending internal communications to workers urging them to elect different leaders to the board of the trade union. The Committee recalls in this regard that when the authorities intervene during the election proceedings of a union, expressing their opinion of the candidates and the consequences of the election, this seriously challenges the principle that trade union organizations have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , para. ]. The Committee considers that statements such as these interfere in the right to freely elect leaders and do not contribute to the development of harmonious labour relations.
.In that respect, the Committee has highlighted the importance for harmonious labour relations of full and frank consultations on matters affecting the workers' occupational interests, and stressed the importance that immediate action be taken to create a climate of trust based on respect for business and labour organizations, so as to promote stable and solid industrial relations [see Compilation, , paras  and ]. In these circumstances, the Committee invites the authorities concerned to continue facilitating constructive dialogue between the leadership of the Office of the Ombudsperson and the complainant organization, including to address any matters raised in the complaint that remain unresolved, with a view to ensuring complete respect for freedom of association in the institution in question and promoting harmonious labour relations.
.In light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee invites the authorities concerned to continue facilitating constructive dialogue between the leadership of the Office of the Ombudsperson and the complainant organization, including to address any matters raised in the complaint that remain unresolved, with a view to ensuring complete respect for freedom of association in the institution in question and promoting harmonious labour relations.",0,2017,El Salvador
14,".The complaint is contained in a communication dated  May  from the Union of Municipal Workers of Nueva Concepcin (SITMUNC), supported by the Trade Union Federation of Municipal Workers of El Salvador (FESISTRAM).
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  June .
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  May , the complainants allege that, despite the agreements concluded between the SITMUNC and the municipal authority of Nueva Concepcin following the end of a strike movement, the union and its members were subjected to anti union acts by the municipal council, and refer in particular to the transfer of four union officials.
.The complainants state that, on  April , against the backdrop of a strike, representatives of the municipal authority and SITMUNC took part in a mediation session chaired by members of the clergy of the church of the Immaculate Conception of Mary with a view to ending the labour dispute dividing the above-mentioned parties and to lifting the strike. According to the complainants, during the session it was agreed that the municipal authority s work would resume, in exchange for the establishment of ongoing round-table talks, and that this round table would include representatives of the workers and the mayor s office. During the mediation session, SITMUNC also proposed the inclusion of certain items on the agenda, including the reinstatement of unfairly dismissed workers, the functioning of the committee overseeing the law on public employment, and guarantees that the striking workers would not face retaliatory financial penalties or other reprimands by the employer.
.The complainants allege that, despite the above-mentioned agreement, the mayor and his municipal council systematically harassed and intimidated the members of the union s executive committee and allege in that regard that: (i) on  April , the members of the municipal council and municipal authority agreed on the transfer of Ms Celita Armida Rodrguez Hrcules, secretary-general of the executive committee, Ms Katya Lissette Tejada, deputy disputes secretary, Ms Rosa Elena Tobar de Gonzlez, social security and welfare secretary, and Mr Jess Alberto Gonzlez Garca, press and public relations secretary; (ii) on  August , the union filed applications for amparo (protection of constitutional rights) against the decisions to transfer the union officials; (iii) on  September , the municipal council voted in favour of levying a sanction of  days without pay against the union officials targeted by the transfer measures; (iv) on  January , the suspension was approved by the committee overseeing the law on public employment; and (v) the union officials were suspended from  to  February . In the complainants' view, both the transfers and the sanction of  days without pay imposed on the four union officials are incompatible with section () of the Constitution of El Salvador relating to trade union immunity, which provides that members of union executive committees cannot be dismissed, suspended for disciplinary reasons, transferred or given less favourable employment conditions other than for a just cause as previously determined by the competent authority.
.Lastly, the complainants refer to the unfair dismissal of  town hall workers, against which applications for amparo were filed with the constitutional chamber of the Supreme Court. A final decision on these proceedings is still pending.
.In its communication dated  June , the Government indicates that, as municipal workers are excluded from the Labour Code, the regulation that applies to this category of workers is the law on public employment. Under section () of this law the municipal commissions have the power to deal with complaints from municipal officials and employees concerning violations of their rights by their hierarchical superiors. With regard to national jurisprudence, the Government indicates that there is a ruling (administrative proceedings case No. -) establishing that the Ministry of Labour should refrain from carrying out inspections into violations of labour rights in the municipal authorities as they do not have the competence in this regard. However, the Government indicates that the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare s General Directorate of Labour Inspection does have the power to carry out occupational safety and health inspections. Therefore, at the request of the complainant union, on  December  the inspectorate carried out an assessment of psychosocial risks relating to the alleged harassment to which the members were subjected by their employer. The Government indicates that, after the inspection, which included workplace visits and interviews with both the employer and the workers, which reported  the existence of a tense atmosphere between management and union members'  the local authority was sanctioned for non-compliance with the obligation to develop and implement an occupational risk prevention management programme as required under section () of the general law on the prevention of workplace risks. The Government emphasizes that, as part of this investigation, eight recommendations were made on addressing and preventing psychosocial risks in the workplace. It further notes that, in order to minimize the negative effects of work and put adequate measures in place to ensure that labour relations are beneficial and respectful, initiatives were proposed to establish round-table talks and provide facilities to enable worker representatives to carry out their duties. The Government indicates that, according to the reinspection report, the employer subsequently complied with the obligation to develop and implement the respective occupational risk prevention management programme.
.Lastly, concerning the amparo proceedings mentioned by the complainants, the Government indicates that: (i) regarding the application for amparo filed for the unfair dismissal of the  municipal workers, the constitutional chamber of the Supreme Court ordered the case to be dismissed on the grounds that the applicant withdrew the appeal; and (ii) regarding the applications for amparo filed by the union officials against the transfer decisions, the Supreme Court declared them inadmissible.
.The Committee observes that this case relates to allegations of harassment and anti-union acts against SITMUNC members, in particular the transfer and suspension of four union officials and the dismissal of  municipal workers.
.The Committee notes the allegations of the complainants claiming that: (i) against the backdrop of a strike within the municipal authority of Nueva Concepcin, a mediation session took place on  April  between the municipal authority and the complainant union with a view to ending the labour dispute between the parties and lifting the strike; (ii) during the mediation session it was agreed that work would resume, in exchange for the establishment of ongoing round-table talks that would include representatives of the employer, workers and alternate members; (iii) the mayor s office and the municipal council continued to harass members of the complainant union s executive committee, and the complainants referred in particular to the municipal authority s decision to transfer four union officials (Ms Celita Armida Rodrguez Hrcules, secretary-general of the executive committee, Ms Katya Lissette Tejada, deputy disputes secretary, Ms Rosa Elena Tobar de Gonzlez, social security and welfare secretary, and Mr Jess Alberto Gonzlez Garca, press and public relations secretary), and the union officials in question filed applications for amparo against this decision; (iv) on  January , the committee overseeing the law on public employment approved a sanction of  days without pay against the four union officials, who were suspended from  to  February ; and (v)  municipal workers were unfairly dismissed and, in response, applications for amparo were filed with the constitutional chamber of the Supreme Court.
.The Committee notes that, for its part, the Government states that: (i) municipal workers are governed by the law on public employment and that under section () of this law the municipal commissions, and not the labour inspectorate, have the power to deal with complaints from municipal officials and employees concerning violations of their rights by their hierarchical superiors; (ii) however, the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare s General Directorate of Labour Inspection does have the power to rule on occupational safety and health issues; (iii) following the request of the complainant union for an assessment of psychosocial risks relating to the alleged harassment against union members to be conducted, the aforementioned body carried out an inspection; and (iv) as a result of the inspection, in addition to the issuance of an infraction report, recommendations were made on addressing and preventing psychosocial risks in the workplace and, with a view to fostering beneficial and respectful labour relations, initiatives were proposed to establish round-table talks with the union and provide facilities to enable worker representatives to carry out their duties.
.The Committee further notes the information provided by the Government on the status of the legal proceedings initiated relating to the facts alleged in this case, according to which: (i) on  May , the constitutional chamber of the Supreme Court declared inadmissible the applications for amparo filed by the union officials concerning their respective transfers, finding that the applicants had not proven the existence",1,2017,El Salvador
15,"of a constitutional violation against them; and (ii) regarding the unfair dismissal of  municipal workers, on  August , the constitutional chamber of the Supreme Court ordered the case to be dismissed on the grounds that the applicant had withdrawn the appeal.
.Concerning the transfer of the four SITMUNC union officials, the Committee observes that the information and documents provided by the complainants and the Government indicate that: (i) twenty-four days after the end of the strike movement within the municipal authority, Mr Jess Alberto Gonzles Garca was transferred from the mayor s office to the warehouse, Ms Celita Armida from the mayor s office to the municipal treasury, Ms Katya Lissette Tejada to elsewhere within the town hall and Ms Rosa Elena Tobar de Gonzlez from the mayor s office to the facilities of the house attached to the town hall; (ii) the labour inspectorate, given that it does not have the competence to examine compliance with legislation on trade unions in the public administration in general and in the municipal authorities in particular, did not examine the alleged anti-union nature of the transfers; and (iii) the constitutional chamber of the Supreme Court considered itself unable to verify the constitutionality of the transfers and declared inadmissible the applications for amparo filed by the union officials affected. The Committee observes in this regard that, in its ruling, the Court found that the applicants had not been subject to a violation of their constitutional rights, given that the transfers had not affected their hierarchical status, that their salaries had remained unchanged and that they had not been able to prove how the transfers had affected their ability to carry out their union activities. On those grounds, the Court decided not to examine the merits of the appeals.
.The Committee observes that it is clear from the foregoing that the grounds for the municipal authority s decision to transfer the four union officials, and the alleged anti-union nature of the reprisal, were not examined by either the labour inspectorate or as part of the aforementioned applications for amparo. The Committee also notes that they were the subject of an administrative sanction. The Committee recalls that, in a previous case involving El Salvador [see nd Report, November , Case No. , para. ], after noting that the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare does not have the competence to deal with the claims of anti-union acts that are the subject of the complaint as they relate to situations that occurred in the public sector, it had considered that an independent authority should be in a position to investigate the allegations of anti-union discrimination in order to gather sufficient evidence to support the case when it is brought before the jurisdictional authorities.
.In the light of the above and recalling that basic regulations that exist in the national legislation prohibiting acts of anti-union discrimination are inadequate when they are not accompanied by procedures to ensure that effective protection against such acts is guaranteed [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , para. ], the Committee requests the Government, in consultation with the social partners from the sector, to take the necessary steps, including legislative measures if necessary, to ensure that the workers in the municipal authorities have access to adequate protection mechanisms against acts of anti-union discrimination. The Committee refers the legislative aspects of this case to the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.
.With regard to the allegations of the unfair dismissal of  local authority workers, the Committee notes that the Government indicates that the constitutional chamber of the Supreme Court decided to dismiss the case on the grounds that the applicant withdrew the appeal. In the light of the foregoing and noting furthermore that the complainants merely indicated that the dismissals in question were unfair, without specifying whether the workers concerned were union members or providing any other details regarding the circumstances of the breaches of contract, the Committee will not pursue its examination of this allegation.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee requests the Government, in consultation with the social partners from the sector, to take the necessary steps, including legislative measures if necessary, to ensure that the workers in the municipal authorities have access to adequate protection mechanisms against acts of anti-union discrimination. The Committee refers the legislative aspects of this case to the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.",0,2017,El Salvador
16,".The Committee examined this case (presented in ) at its meeting in June , when it presented an interim report to the Governing Body [see th Report, paras ' , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session].
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  February .
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ) and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.In its previous examination of the case in June , the Committee made the following recommendations [see th Report, para. ]:(a)	The Committee refers to its conclusions in Case No.  regarding the requirement to be Salvadoran by birth and again expresses the hope that the Government will take all steps, including legislative measures, to ensure that section  of the Labour Code and its application are consistent with the right of workers to elect their representatives in full freedom;(b)	The Committee requests the Government to take appropriate steps to ensure that, irrespective of the worker s type of contract, trade unions may freely appoint members of their executive committees. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect;(c)	The Committee requests the Government, in consultation with the most representative trade union organizations, to take the necessary steps to review the rules applicable to the registration of executive committees in order to guarantee the right of organizations to elect their representatives in full freedom and to ensure a swift process. Reminding the Government that it can avail itself of ILO technical assistance, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard;(d)	The Committee requests the Government, in consultation with the organizations concerned, to expedite the pending registrations of the executive committees of the trade unions mentioned in this case. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard;(e)	With regard to the suspension of the Higher Labour Council, the Committee refers to its recommendations in Case No.  and urges the Government to reactivate the Higher Labour Council as soon as possible; and(f)	As for the alleged irregularities in the appointment of worker representatives to the National Minimum Wage Council and the Housing Social Fund, the Committee urges the Government to respond without delay to the allegations made by the complainant organization and expresses the hope that the Government will ensure that the appointment of worker representatives to tripartite bodies will be based on objective, precise and pre-established criteria on representativeness, and that any dispute as to the appointment of those representatives will be resolved by an independent body. Regretting that this situation has persisted for years, and reminding the Government that it can continue to benefit from the Office s technical assistance, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.In its communication dated  February , the Government indicates that, in accordance with article  of the Labour Code, the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare is responsible for supervising trade union organizations, in order to verify whether they comply with the rule of law in carrying out their activities, and refrains from any form of intervention designed to limit the rights and guarantees enshrined by the laws for the benefit of trade unions. The Government indicates that, on that basis, the principles have been established for the supervision of rights of the persons who are members of trade union management committees, beginning with the phase of registration and verification of the person who forms part of the workers' representatives on the management committee. For this purpose, the appropriate means is the Single Identity Document, as well as any instrument with which the employment relationship can be verified. The Government indicates that since  the management committees of the National Confederation of Salvadoran Workers (CNTS) have been registered without delay and within the legal deadline. The Government has attached certified copies of the records of registration of those committees.
.The Committee recalls that this case refers, firstly, to the alleged imposition of excessive and arbitrary conditions for registering and recognizing the credentials of trade union executive committees (such as the submission of copies of individual identity documents and payslips in order to verify whether members of executive committees are Salvadorans by birth or to verify the worker s type of contract), and the subsequent refusal of the labour administration to register the executive committees of a number of trade union organizations, thus preventing their members from being elected to various tripartite bodies. This includes the executive committees of  trade unions affiliated with the Trade Union Council of El Salvador (CONSISAL), namely the Independent Union of Agricultural Workers in the San Jos de la Montaa Canton (SITRAM), the General Trade Union of Workers in the Fishing and Allied Industries (SGTIPAC), the Independent Union of Commercial Workers in Colonia Las Flores (SITRACOF), the Independent Union of Retail Workers in Jerusaln (SICOJ), the Independent Union of Agricultural Workers in the El Espino Canton (SITRACE), the Union of Independent Craftspersons in Santa Mara Ostuma (SINAISMO), the Trade Union Federation of Registered Workers of El Salvador (FESTRAIS), the Trade Union Federation of Agricultural and Commercial Workers (FESTRAC), the Western Trade Union Association of Small Retailers (ASPECO), the Association of Merchant Seafarers of El Salvador (AMMS), the Independent Union of Agricultural Workers in the Tepeagua Canton (SITRACT), the Union of Agricultural Producers in the San Felipe Canton (SIPROACASF), the Union of Independent Commercial Workers in Nueva San Salvador (SITICONSS), the Union of Agricultural Workers in the Achichilco Canton (SINTRACA), the Union of Commercial Workers in La Unin (SITRACUN), the Union of Agricultural Workers in the La Labor Canton (SITRACL), the Independent Union of Artisanal Fishers in Zacatecoluca (SINPEZ), the Independent Union of Professionals and Technicians of El Salvador (SIPROTES), the Union of Agricultural Producers in Santo Domingo (SIPROASD) and the Union of Small Agricultural Producers in the Galeano Canton (SIPEACG), the Union of Independent Commercial Workers in Puerto de la Libertad (SITRAINCOP), the Union of Agricultural Producers in the La Esperanza Canton, San Sebastin District (SIPROACESS), the Union of Commercial Workers in Colonia Agua Caliente (SITRACCAC) and the Independent Union of Agricultural Workers in the Chaperno Canton (SITRACH). The case also refers to alleged irregularities in the appointment of worker representatives in tripartite bodies such as the National Minimum Wage Council and the Housing Social Fund, as well as the Higher Labour Council.
.The Committee notes that in its communication the Government refers to the documents that must be submitted for the purposes of requesting the registration of management committees and states that, since , the management committees of the CNTS have been registered without delay and within the legal deadline. In this regard, the Committee recalls that the last time it examined the case it made specific recommendations in relation to the excessive requirements for the registration of trade union management committees. It also recalls that the last time it examined the case, it had noted that the CNTS management committees had been registered, once the precautionary measures taken by the National Department of Social Organizations of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare had been remedied. The Committee notes that the Government has attached certified copies in which it costs the registration of the CNTS management committees between  and . Observing, however, that the Government has not sent any information regarding the registration of the management committees of the  trade unions that belong to CONSISAL, mentioned in the previous paragraph, or any information relating to the remaining recommendations it made when it last examined the case at its meeting in June  [see th Report, paras ' ], the Committee finds itself obliged to reiterate those recommendations, as follows.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee refers to its conclusions in Case No.  regarding the requirement to be Salvadoran by birth and again expresses the hope that the Government will take all steps, including legislative measures, to ensure that section  of the Labour Code and its application are consistent with the right of workers to elect their representatives in full freedom.(b) The Committee requests the Government to take appropriate steps to ensure that, irrespective of the worker s type of contract, trade unions may freely appoint members of their executive committees. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.(c) The Committee requests the Government, in consultation with the most representative trade union organizations, to take the necessary steps to review the rules applicable to the registration of executive committees in order to guarantee the right of organizations to elect their representatives in full freedom and to ensure a swift process. Reminding the Government that it can avail itself of ILO technical assistance, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.(d) The Committee requests the Government, in consultation with the organizations concerned, to expedite the",1,2016,El Salvador
17,"pending registrations of the executive committees of the trade unions mentioned in this case. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard;(e) With regard to the suspension of the Higher Labour Council, the Committee refers to its recommendations in Case No.  and urges the Government to reactivate the Higher Labour Council as soon as possible.(f) As for the alleged irregularities in the appointment of worker representatives to the National Minimum Wage Council and the Housing Social Fund, the Committee urges the Government to respond without delay to the allegations made by the complainant and expresses the hope that the Government will ensure that the appointment of worker representatives to tripartite bodies will be based on objective, precise and pre-established criteria on representativeness, and that any dispute as to the appointment of those representatives will be resolved by an independent body. Regretting that this situation has persisted for years, and reminding the Government that it can continue to benefit from the Office s technical assistance, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.The complaint is contained in a communication dated  October  from the National Confederation of Workers of El Salvador (CNTS), and in two communications dated  June and  October  from the Trade Union Council of El Salvador (CONSISAL).
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  April .
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  October , the National Confederation of Workers of El Salvador (CNTS) alleges that the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare (MTPS) is imposing arbitrary conditions, which are not specified either in the Constitution or in legislation, for registering trade union executive committees and the issuing of accreditation to their members, including the requirement to provide the payslips and individual identity documents of executive committee members. According to the complainant, the Government s intention in not granting full accreditation to executive committee members was to leave both its trade union confederation and affiliated organizations without leadership in order to obstruct their participation in tripartite and bipartite bodies and prevent the organizations concerned from demanding that the labour rights of their members be upheld in accordance with applicable collective agreements.
.The CNTS notes that, on  July , it submitted a request for the registration of its new executive committee to the National Department of Social Organizations (DNOS) of the MTPS. On  July , the complainant was notified in a decision issued by the DNOS that, in order to proceed with the registration of the new executive committee, the confederation had to submit a new record showing the exact number of persons present at the time voting took place, as well as an uncertified copy of the payslips or certificate of salary payment of the persons elected to the executive committee. This requirement had to be met within five working days from the day after the notification.
.On  August , the DNOS notified the CNTS that it was apparent from an analysis of the documents submitted that the conditions had only been partially met and that, as a result, the following vacancies remained open: (i) secretary for agricultural and environmental matters because, given that no payslip was submitted, it was not possible to verify the employment relationship between the worker and the enterprise; and (ii) organization secretary because, given that the union member elected, Mr Cesar Emilio Zetino Consuegra, works for the Los Lagartos agricultural production cooperative association, a limited liability enterprise, and as a casual worker in the sugar cane and coffee industry, he would be excluded from being a member of the executive committee under the terms of section (a) of the Labour Code.
.In addition, the complainant alleges that, on  August , the DNOS requested the Union of Workers in the Cotton, Synthetics, Similar or Related Industries (STIASSYC) to provide an updated list of all members of the trade union, likewise giving a deadline of five working days to provide the document.
.With respect to the above-mentioned conditions, in the complainant s view: (i) no provisions of section  of the Labour Code stipulate that payslips and individual identity documents must be requested; (ii) the decision to exclude Mr Zetino Consuegra from becoming organization secretary because he was a casual worker in the sugar cane and coffee industry is erroneous pursuant to section (a) of the Labour Code, given that this provision has nothing to do with prohibiting casual workers from being members of union executive committees and, if that were the case, the provision would be discriminatory and contrary to articles  and  of the Constitution; and (iii) the conditions imposed on its confederation and other affiliated organizations are not found in ILO Conventions, in the Constitution of El Salvador or in legislation and, therefore, imposing such conditions would constitute an arbitrary act.
.In a communication dated  June , the Trade Union Council of El Salvador (CONSISAL) alleges that the MTPS refused to register and grant accreditation to the executive committees of  unions affiliated to its confederation (the Independent Union of Agricultural Workers in the San Jos de la Montaa Canton (SITRAM), the General Trade Union of Workers in the Fishing and Allied Industries (SGTIPAC), the Independent Union of Commercial Workers in Colonia Las Flores (SITRACOF), the Independent Union of Retail Workers in Jerusaln (SICOJ), the Independent Union of Agricultural Workers in the El Espino Canton (SITRACE), the Union of Independent Craftspersons in Santa Mara Ostuma (SINAISMO), the Trade Union Federation of Registered Workers of El Salvador (FESTRAIS), the Trade Union Federation of Agricultural and Commercial Workers (FESTRAC), the Western Trade Union Association of Small Retailers (ASPECO), the Association of Merchant Seafarers of El Salvador (AMMS), the Independent Union of Agricultural Workers in the Tepeagua Canton (SITRACT), the Union of Agricultural Producers in the San Felipe Canton (SIPROACASF), the Union of Independent Commercial Workers in Nueva San Salvador (SITICONSS), the Union of Agricultural Workers in the Achichilco Canton (SINTRACA), the Union of Commercial Workers in La Unin (SITRACUN), the Union of Agricultural Workers in the La Labor Canton (SITRACL), the Independent Union of Artisanal Fishers in Zacatecoluca (SINPEZ), the Independent Union of Professionals and Technicians of El Salvador (SIPROTES), the Union of Agricultural Producers in Santo Domingo (SIPROASD) and the Union of Small Agricultural Producers in the Galeano Canton (SIPEACG)), leaving them without leadership.
.The complainant considers that the line of action taken by the DNOS is aimed at eliminating all trade unions that are not sympathetic to the Government s political aspirations, by obstructing the processes and procedures for their formation and for the election of executive committees. The complainant considers that the imposition of conditions not provided for in labour regulations, and the subsequent ineligibility of the requests attached to the conditions, was aimed at leaving the trade unions without leadership, and further considers that the Government intends to base its measures on the provisions of sections ,  and  of the Labour Code, sections (b) and (b) of the Act on the Organization and Functions of the Labour and Social Welfare Sector and the Special Act on Regulating the Issuance of the Individual Identity Document, and considers, with respect to the latter law, that this is not a labour regulation and therefore does not apply to the registration of executive committees and the issuing of accreditation to their members.
.The complainant points out that the documentation required, namely photocopies of individual identity documents (or, failing this, the birth certificates or passports of each elected member), payslips (or any other document verifying the names or posts held by the workers in the places where they work, such as certificates of salary payment stamped and signed by the human resources manager of the enterprises where the elected workers carry out their duties as members of the executive committee) and the submission of a list of members (in original or photocopy, stamped and signed by all members present at the session of the general assembly at which the members of the executive committee were elected), is excessive and contains private data and classified information on each individual.
.The complainant also states that the imposition of conditions not provided for in labour regulations is a strategy devised by the Farabundo Mart National Liberation Front (FMLN), the party in power at the time the complaint was submitted, as a way to prevent participation in the tripartite bodies by majority organizations that do not support the Government and that are part of the Salvadorian Labour Movement.
.The complainant also alleges irregularities in the elections of worker members in various tripartite councils, referring in particular to: (i) the election of members to the National Minimum Wage Council on  December , when the Government, far from adhering to the procedure laid down in current regulations adopted by tripartite consensus,",1,2016,El Salvador
18,"made use of a government decree to elect four persons from pro-Government union organizations; (ii) during the May and July  elections of new worker members to the governors' assembly of the Housing Social Fund, the MTPS had reportedly altered the number of members of the Union of Construction and Related Workers of El Salvador (STRACOCS), affiliated to the complainant organization, to ensure that none of its representatives would be in the Housing Social Fund; (iii) at the same time, it reportedly increased the number of members of the Union of Construction Workers (SUTC), a pro-Government organization, resulting in the election of a representative from that union who, according to the rules of procedure, was ineligible because the person had been accused of an offence; and (iv) during the elections of worker representatives to the Higher Labour Council in , after the majority of representatives appointed were from unions that were not sympathetic to the Farabundo Mart National Liberation Front, the tripartite body was left without leadership and nothing has been done to date to reactivate the Higher Labour Council.
.In its communication dated  October , the CONSISAL also alleges that, on  July,  and  August and  September , the Union of Independent Commercial Workers in Puerto de la Libertad (SITRAINCOP), the Union of Agricultural Producers in the La Esperanza Canton, San Sebastin District (SIPROACESS), the Union of Commercial Workers in Colonia Agua Caliente (SITRACCAC) and the Independent Union of Agricultural Workers in the Chaperno Canton (SITRACH) requested the registration of their executive committees and the issuance of accreditation to their respective members. The requests were refused, leaving the organizations without leadership. The confederation requests the Committee to overturn these decisions because they are inconsistent with legislation, the Constitution and the aforementioned Conventions.
.In its communication dated  April , the Government refers, on the one hand, to the complainants' allegations concerning the imposition of conditions not provided for in the Constitution or legislation for registering the executive committees of first-, second- and third-level trade unions. In this connection, the Government considers that the allegations are unwarranted and baseless, given that the conditions imposed by the DNOS of the MTPS for registering executive committees can be found in domestic legal regulations. The Government indicates that the requirement to provide photocopies of the individual identity documents of the persons elected to executive committees is provided for in section  of the Special Act on Regulating the Issuance of the Individual Identity Document, which provides that:  the individual identity document is the official document, which is sufficient and necessary to identify unequivocally all natural persons who are nationals of El Salvador in any public or private act, both at home and abroad'  this being the only valid document through which persons who are members of executive committees can be identified. Similarly, this condition would be consistent with the requirements for membership of executive committees set out in section () and () of the Labour Code that members should be nationals of El Salvador by birth and over the age of . With regard to the requirement to attach to the request the payslip or employment certificate, they are required pursuant to section () of the Labour Code, which provides that membership of an executive committee also requires members  not to be employed in positions of trust or representatives of the employer'  This requirement therefore serves to corroborate the strict employment relationship between the persons elected and the institution or enterprise for which they provide their services, and emphasizes that this requirement does not apply in the case of independent unions. With regard to the requirement to provide a list of all persons present when the executive committee was elected, the Government states that this requirement is intended to verify that the members of the executive committee were actually present at the assembly in question, given that cases have been reported of elected persons not being present at the assembly during which they were elected, as well as to ensure that the number of votes matches the number of persons present at the meeting.
.The Government also indicates, with regard to the registration of the CNTS executive committee, that this confederation submitted documentation on  July  and that documentation verifying the members of its executive committee was submitted on  August . With regard to the registration of the executive committee of the STIASSYC, the Government notes that, on  December , this union submitted documentation for the registration of its executive committee, that on  January  it was notified that it had to submit a list of all its members, including their full names and copies of their individual identity documents. These documents were provided and the executive committee was registered on  January .
.With regard to the confidentiality of documents forwarded by trade unions, the Government indicates that, in order to safeguard the extreme confidentiality of the documents requested, as well as the legal security of executive committees, the accreditations of members of executive committees should not be sent by post, and that the DNOS recently adopted a directive to notify each executive committee by telephone when their accreditation and cards are ready for collection.
.Lastly, the Government states that the trade union organizations SITRACH, SITRACCAC, SIPORACESS, SITRAINCOP, SIPROTES and SITRACL have been left without leadership because, even though they were given time to address any shortcomings in their applications, namely to submit the individual identity documents of their executive committee members, the above unions failed to submit any of the documents requested and their applications were therefore declared inadmissible.
.The Committee observes that this case refers, firstly, to the alleged imposition of arbitrary conditions for registering trade union executive committees and the issuing of accreditation to their members and to the subsequent refusal of the labour administration to register the executive committees of a number of trade union organizations and, second, to alleged irregularities in the elections of worker representatives in tripartite bodies.
.With regard to the alleged imposition of arbitrary conditions for registering trade union executive committees, the Committee notes that the complainants allege in general terms that: (i) the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare (MTPS) makes the registration of executive committees dependent on the submission of the individual identity documents and payslips of members of those committees, as well as the signed list of the members of the union who were present at its general assembly; (ii) the conditions imposed are both unduly demanding and arbitrary, given that they are not provided for in legislation; and (iii) the imposition of the conditions in question were intended to obstruct the processes and procedures for the election of executive committees that did not support the Government at the time the complaint was presented and to prevent their members from being elected to various tripartite bodies. The Committee further notes, more specifically, that: (i) the National Confederation of Workers of El Salvador (CNTS) alleges that the MTPS refused to register two members of its executive committee because, firstly, it had failed to submit the payslip of a union official and, second, that another union official, elected to the post of organization secretary, only worked on a casual basis; (ii) the CNTS alleges that, on  August , the National Department of Social Organizations (DNOS) had requested the Union of Workers in the Cotton, Synthetics, Similar or Related Industries (STIASSYC) to provide an updated list of all members of the trade union; and (iii) the Trade Union Council of El Salvador (CONSISAL) alleges that the DNOS arbitrarily refused to register and issue accreditation for the executive committees of  trade unions affiliated to its confederation.
.The Committee observes that the Government states with regard to the alleged imposition of arbitrary conditions that: (i) section  of the Special Act on Regulating the Issuance of the Individual Identity Document provides that the document in question is the only valid document through which persons who are elected as members of executive committees can be identified; (ii) one of the requirements for membership of executive committees under section () and () of the Labour Code is for members to be Salvadoran by birth and have attained the age of majority; (iii) section () of the Labour Code provides that one of the requirements for membership of executive committees is for members not to be employed in positions of trust or representatives of the employer, hence the requirement to attach to the request the payslip and employment certificate; and (iv) the requirement for the list of those present at the assembly where the members of the executive committee were elected arises from the need to check that the persons who are members of the executive committee were present at the assembly and to verify whether the number of votes matches the number of persons present. With regard to the specific allegations concerning the refusal to register  executive committees, the Committee observes that the Government indicates that: (i) the executive committees of",1,2016,El Salvador
19,"the CNTS and the STIASSYC were registered once any shortcomings in meeting the conditions imposed by the DNOS had been addressed; and (ii) the trade union organizations SITRACH, SITRACCAC, SIPORACESS, SITRAINCOP, SIPROTES and SITRACL failed to submit the documentation requested and that is why they have been left without leadership.
.The Committee recalls that it has already had occasion in the past to examine allegations of the imposition of excessive conditions for the registration of executive committees in El Salvador. In Case No.  [see th Report, para. ], the Committee had noted the Government s indication that, in order to register members of executive committees, trade unions should, in accordance with section  of the Labour Code, submit a copy of their individual identity documents and payslips to verify whether executive committee members were Salvadorans by birth and had attained the age of majority, and that they were not employed in positions of trust or representatives of the employer. On that occasion, the Committee had recalled concerning the requirement to be Salvadoran by birth that legislation should be made flexible so as to permit the organizations to elect their leaders freely and without hindrance, and to permit foreign workers access to trade union posts, at least after a reasonable period of residence in the host country [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , para. ].
.The Committee therefore refers to its conclusions in Case No.  concerning the requirement to be Salvadoran by birth and again expresses the hope that the Government will take all steps, including legislative measures, to ensure that section  of the Labour Code and its application are consistent with the right of workers to elect their representatives in full freedom. Regarding the allegation of the CNTS concerning the refusal of the labour administration to register one of its executive committee members because of the casual nature of his work, the Committee recalls that it is the prerogative of workers' and employers' organizations to determine the conditions for electing their leaders and the authorities should refrain from any undue interference in the exercise of the right of workers' and employers' organizations freely to elect their representatives, which is guaranteed by Convention No.  [see Compilation, op. cit., , para. ]. Recalling that all workers must be able to enjoy the right to freedom of association regardless of the type of contract by which the employment relationship has been formalized [see Compilation, op. cit., , para. ] , the Committee requests the Government to take appropriate steps to ensure that, irrespective of the worker s type of contract, trade unions may freely appoint members of their executive committees. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.As for the complainants' specific allegations regarding the refusal to register  executive committees, the Committee observes that: (i) the Government provides its observations on eight of the  trade unions concerned, indicating that two executive committees were registered once any shortcomings in meeting the conditions imposed by the labour administration had been addressed, while the applications of the other six organizations were declared inadmissible due to the failure to submit the documentation required; and (ii) it is clear from the above, as well as from the complainants' allegations, that most of the trade unions mentioned in the complaint have been left without leadership. Considering that the accreditation procedures for workers' organizations and their executive committees should include formal verifications carried out expeditiously and in a consistent manner, the Committee requests the Government, in consultation with the most representative trade union organizations, to take the necessary steps to review the rules applicable to the registration of executive committees in order to guarantee the right of organizations to elect their representatives in full freedom and to ensure a swift process. In the light of the foregoing, the Committee requests the Government, in consultation with the organizations concerned, to expedite the pending registrations of the executive committees of the trade unions mentioned in this case. Reminding the Government that it can avail itself of ILO assistance, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.Concerning the steps taken by the Government to exclude trade unions that do not support the Government from various tripartite bodies, and the irregularities in the appointment of worker representatives in those bodies, alleged by the CONSISAL, the Committee notes that, according to this complainant: (i) during the elections of the National Minimum Wage Council, on  December , the Government, ignoring the institution s regulations adopted by tripartite consensus, elected four persons from pro-Government trade unions; (ii) during the elections of governor members of the Housing Social Fund, the Government had altered the number of members of the Union of Construction and Related Workers to prevent any of its representatives from participating in that body and had increased the number of members from a pro-Government trade union with the aim of increasing its representation in the governors' assembly; and (iii) during the elections of worker representatives to the Higher Labour Council, after the appointment of a majority of representatives from trade unions that were not pro-Government, the tripartite body was left without leadership, and nothing has been done to date to remedy the situation.
.While noting that the Government did not transmit its observations on this matter, the Committee observes that the allegations made by the complainant relating to the suspension of the Higher Labour Council are still being examined by the Committee in Case No. . In this case, the Committee underlined the urgent need for in-depth consultations with the confederations and federations in order to establish clear and stable rules for the appointment of worker representatives to the CST (particularly when there is no single list of worker representatives) which respect the criterion of representativeness and requested the Government to keep it informed in this regard. Taking into account the urgency of this situation the Committee also invited the Government to accept an ILO technical assistance mission to help in finding a solution to the issues raised [see th Report, para. ]..Observing that the ILO has been providing technical assistance to the Government in respect of the determination of criteria to establish trade union representation, the Committee refers to its recommendations in Case No.  and urges the Government to reactivate the Higher Labour Council as soon as possible.
.With regard to the alleged irregularities in the appointment of worker representatives to the National Minimum Wage Council and the Housing Social Fund, the Committee recalls that it has already had occasion to examine similar allegations in Case No.  a case brought by an employers' organization. In that case, the Committee requested the Government to ensure that the representatives of workers' and employers' organizations on tripartite bodies are appointed by them freely, and that in-depth consultations are urgently held with those organizations within the Higher Labour Council, so that mutual agreement can be reached on ensuring the balanced tripartite composition of the management boards of the autonomous institutions referred to in the complaint (notably the ISSS, the FSV and the NIVT), and that the shared decision so reached is submitted without delay to the Legislative Assembly in the course of its examination of the legislative reform previously proposed by the Government. [see th Report, para. ]. Regretting that no progress has been made in that respect, the Committee insists, once again, that pre-established, precise and objective criteria for the determination of the representativity of workers' and employers' organizations should exist in the legislation and such a determination should not be left to the discretion of governments [see Compilation, op. cit., para. ]. In view of the above, the Committee urges the Government to respond without delay to the allegations made by the complainant regarding the appointment of worker representatives in the National Minimum Wage Council and the Housing Social Fund. The Committee also expresses the hope that the Government will ensure that the appointment of worker representatives to tripartite bodies will be based on objective, precise and pre-established criteria on representativity, and that any dispute as to the appointment of those representatives will be resolved by an independent body. Regretting that this situation has persisted for years, and reminding the Government that it can continue to benefit from the Office s technical assistance, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee refers to its conclusions in Case No.  regarding the requirement to be Salvadoran by birth and again expresses the hope that the Government will take all steps, including legislative measures, to ensure that section  of the Labour Code and its application are consistent with the right of workers to elect their representatives in full freedom.(b)	The Committee requests the Government to take appropriate steps to ensure that, irrespective of the worker s type of contract, trade unions may freely appoint members",1,2016,El Salvador
20,"of their executive committees. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.(c)	The Committee requests the Government, in consultation with the most representative trade union organizations, to take the necessary steps to review the rules applicable to the registration of executive committees in order to guarantee the right of organizations to elect their representatives in full freedom and to ensure a swift process. Reminding the Government that it can avail itself of ILO technical assistance, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.(d)	The Committee requests the Government, in consultation with the organizations concerned, to expedite the pending registrations of the executive committees of the trade unions mentioned in this case.

Regretting that this situation has persisted for years, and reminding the Government that it can continue to benefit from the ILO technical assistance, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.",0,2016,El Salvador
21,".The Committee last examined this case at its June  meeting, when it made the following recommendations [see th Report, para. ]:(a) As regards the dismissals of members of the executive committee of the complainant organization, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of further developments, particularly to provide further details regarding its recommendation to reinstate the dismissed trade union officials and its implementation.(b) The Committee requests the Government to ensure that the members of the executive committee of the complainant organization are able to take trade union leave, in accordance with the decisions applying the principles of freedom of association mentioned in its conclusions, and invites the Government, with a view to determining arrangements for such leave, to promote dialogue and collective bargaining between the parties concerned. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.(c) The Committee encourages the Government to continue promoting social dialogue between the parties to address any pending issues and invites the complainant organization to supply any additional information that it may have on this matter. It also requests the Government to keep it informed of developments.
.In a communication dated  May , the Government provided the following information in response to the Committee s recommendations:
.The Government indicates that the dismissals of the members of the executive board of the Trade Union for the Defence of Workers of the Social Security Institute of El Salvador (SIDETISSS) were undertaken pursuant to the final rulings of the competent courts, which authorized the dismissals. The six individuals concerned were notified of these rulings. The Government states that the requests for reinstatement were not admissible because the various judicial rulings had found that the individuals had committed offences that merited dismissal.
.With regard to trade union leave, the Government reports that, in accordance with the law, it is fully aware of the obligation to grant leave for trade union activities, although it recalls that requests for leave must comply with the standards set out in the regulations. In this respect, the Government refers to the opinion of the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice contained in ruling for the protection of constitutional rights No. - of  June : (i) stating that  trade union leave is thus the instrument whereby the employer authorizes union leaders to be absent from the workplace during working hours in order to accomplish specific activities essential to the proper functioning and development of the labour organization, provided that such leave is reasonable, proportionate and necessary'  and (ii) recalling the content of Article () of the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ), under which,  the granting of such facilities shall not impair the efficient operation of the administration or service concerned' 
.Lastly, regarding the promotion of social dialogue between the parties to address matters that may remain pending, the Government indicates that the Administration of the Salvadoran Social Security Institute (ISSS) maintains dialogue with all the trade unions legally established within the ISSS, including SIDETISSS.
.The Committee further notes that the complainant organization, SIDETISSS, has not provided additional information, despite having been invited to do so.
.In these circumstances, and taking due note of the information provided by the Government, the Committee considers this case closed and will not pursue its examination.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the Trade Union for the Defence of Workers of the Social Security Institute of El Salvador (SIDETISSS) dated  November .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  February .
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Workers' Representatives Convention,  (No. ), and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  November , the complainant organization reports: (i) dismissals of members of its executive committee; (ii) the refusal by the Social Security Institute of El Salvador (ISSS) (the employer) to grant trade union leave to the union s officers and also the refusal by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security (Ministry of Labour) to grant trade union accreditation to three members of the union s executive committee; and (iii) anti-union threats and failure by the authorities to take action against such threats.
.As regards the anti-union dismissals of members of the executive committee of the complainant organization, namely Ms Elsa del Socorro Carranza de Murcia, Mr David Ernesto Lpez Urquilla, Mr Francisco Eduardo Cotto Murcia, Mr Rafael Ernesto Martnez Arvalo, Mr Jos Luis Santos Orellana and Mr Modesto Daz Jovel, the complainant indicates that the employer took legal action to have their dismissals authorized and their employment relationship terminated. It also indicates that, as at  November , four of these six dismissals had been authorized by the courts and the other two were still pending.
.As regards the employer s refusal to grant union leave to the union s officers, the complainant organization indicates that it requested such leave ' whether partial or permanent ' on three occasions ( May ,  August  and  July ), that the employer rejected these three requests, and that it did not provide any opportunity to negotiate a timetable or reduce working hours so that the executive committee could carry out its union activities. Moreover, the complainant refers to a letter from the employer dated  May , indicating that  it is inappropriate to grant union leave with wages and benefits ' since there is no way for these to be permanent or ongoing, considering the essential service provided by the institution for which we all work' 
.As regards the refusal by the Ministry of Labour to grant trade union accreditation to three members of the executive committee, namely Ms Elsa del Socorro Carranza de Murcia, Mr David Ernesto Lpez Urquilla and Mr Francisco Eduardo Cotto Murcia, the complainant organization indicates that the Ministry decided to reject its requests because no payslips or wage certificates had been submitted proving that the three individuals were employed by the ISSS. It also objects to the fact that other trade union officers at autonomous institutions having the same status as its three executive committee members, such as officers of the Union of Judiciary Workers (SITTOJ) and the Union of Food Processing Industry Workers (SITIPA), had been granted union accreditation.
.Lastly, as regards the anti-union threats on the part of the authorities, the complainant organization denounces the statement made by the Minister of Health that, in the wake of the work stoppage and marches by health sector workers in October , the authorities were going to make deductions from wages, dismiss workers and even dissolve trade unions. The complainant also denounces the silence on the part of the Ministry of Labour and the central Government in response to the various complaints made against anti-union acts committed by the employer, particularly those dated  August ,  November ,  January ,  July ,  September  and  September .
.In its communication of  February , the Government indicates, with regard to the dismissals of Ms Elsa del Socorro Carranza de Murcia, Mr David Ernesto Lpez Urquilla, Mr Francisco Eduardo Cotto Murcia, Mr Rafael Ernesto Martnez Arvalo and Mr Modesto Daz Jovel, that all committed misconduct regarded as grounds for dismissal under the law and that their dismissals were authorized by the competent authorities. It also indicates that to date no legal actions have been admitted and no protective measure of reinstatement has been issued.
.The Government indicates that in the case of Ms Elsa del Socorro Carranza de Murcia, civil proceedings for the authorization of dismissal were brought in the Second Civil and Commercial Court (Judge No. ) and on  July  the dismissal for unjustified absence from work was authorized. It adds that this decision was upheld on  September  by a decision issued by the Civil Chamber (First Division, Central Region) in San Salvador.
.The Government indicates that, in the case of Mr David Ernesto Lpez Urquilla, on  May  the First Civil and Commercial Court authorized his dismissal for unjustified absence from work. It also indicates that, in the case of Mr Francisco Eduardo Cotto Murcia, on  February  the Civil Court of Mejicanos authorized his dismissal for unjustified absence from work. It adds that this decision was upheld on  March  by a definitive judgment issued by the Third Civil Chamber (First Division, Central Region) in San Salvador.
.The Government also indicates that, in the case of Mr Rafael Ernesto Martnez Arvalo, on  June  the Fifth Civil and Commercial Court authorized his dismissal for unjustified absence from work. It adds that this decision was upheld on  August  by a definitive judgment issued by the Third Civil Chamber (First Division, Central Region) in San Salvador. It further indicates that, in the case of Mr Modesto Daz Jovel, on  January  the Fourth Civil and Commercial Court authorized his dismissal",0,2016,El Salvador
22,"for unjustified absence from work for over  days and that this decision was upheld on  March  by a judgment issued by the Second Civil Chamber (First Division, Central Region).
.Lastly, the Government indicates that, in the case of Mr Jos Luis Santos Orellana, civil proceedings for the authorization of dismissal were brought in the Fourth Civil and Commercial Court for unjustified absence from work, and that this court decided to allow the application of  June . The authorization of dismissal is currently being processed.
.As regards the employer s refusal to grant trade union leave, whether partial or permanent, to officers of the complainant organization, the Government indicates that one of the obligations for employers established by section  of the Labour Code is to grant leave to workers so that  for the time required, they can perform their essential duties as officers of occupational organizations, provided that this is requested by the organization concerned. The employer will not be obliged to grant any benefits in this respect'  The Government also indicates that the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice, in ruling No. - of  June , states in paragraph IV(c) that  trade union leave is thus the instrument whereby the employer authorizes union leaders to be absent from the workplace during working hours in order to accomplish specific activities essential to the proper functioning and development of the labour organization, provided that such leave is reasonable, proportionate and necessary' and states in paragraph V(c)(a) that  the status of trade union officer shall not prevail over that of public servant'  The Government also points out that the aforementioned ruling states that it is inappropriate to grant permanent leave to union officers.
.Furthermore, the Government indicates that a request was made to review the refusal to grant trade union leave to Mr Rafael Ernesto Martnez Arvalo, third disputes secretary of the executive committee of the complainant organization, and that as a result of the relevant investigation the labour inspector was unable to confirm the alleged refusal of union leave, since the leave claimed by the worker had not been requested for union activities. However, it adds that the employer was recommended to comply with the terms of Article  of Convention No. .
.As regards the refusal by the Ministry of Labour to grant trade union accreditation to three members of the executive committee of the complainant organization, namely Ms Elsa del Socorro Carranza de Murcia, Mr David Ernesto Lpez Urquilla and Mr Francisco Eduardo Cotto Murcia, the Government indicates that it should be made clear that one of the requirements to be checked before granting accreditation is set out in section () of the Labour Code, which excludes employees occupying positions of trust and employer representatives. The Government indicates that, at the time of checking the documentation required under the aforementioned section to register the executive committee of the complainant organization, no payslips or certificates from the human resources department had been attached showing the employment relationship and the duties performed for the employer, which is necessary in relation to the exclusion established in section () of the Labour Code. However, the Government indicates that on  December  the complainant presented a new request for accreditation for Ms Elsa del Socorro Carranza de Murcia, Mr David Ernesto Lpez Urquilla and Mr Francisco Eduardo Cotto Murcia. It also indicates that, because of the unavailability of payslips or certificates from the human resources department demonstrating the employment relationship between the three workers and the employer, the complainant attached to its request copies of the amparo appeals filed with the Constitutional Chamber to have the termination of their employment relationship declared null and void, thereby replacing the documentation normally required by section () of the Labour Code. The Government indicates that the accreditation requested for the three executive committee members was granted through a decision issued on  December , with validity from  December  to  June .
.The Government indicates that, on  May , the complainant organization elected a new executive committee due to hold office from  June  to  June  and that full accreditation was granted on  August  to Mr Oscar Ernesto Murcia Carranza, general secretary of the complainant organization. As regards the accreditation granted to other trade union officers who were allegedly in the same situation as the officers of the complainant organization (such as the officers of SITTOJ and SITIPA), the Government emphasizes that the same criterion was applied to these unions and that they attached the required documentation in due time.
.Lastly, as regards the anti-union threats by the authorities and the silence on the part of the Ministry of Labour and the central Government with respect to the various complaints concerning alleged anti-union acts committed by the employer, the Government indicates that no discriminatory, anti-union policy exists or has ever existed with respect to the complainant organization and that various labour inspections have been carried out by the Labour Inspection Department, as described below:(a)	A request was made to investigate allegations of obstruction of freedom of association and anti-union discrimination against Mr Rafael Ernesto Martnez Arvalo, third disputes secretary of the executive committee of the complainant organization, and further to the interviews held with representatives of the employers and colleagues of the worker, the alleged discrimination was not proven.(b)	Mr Francisco Eduardo Cotto Murcia and Mr Jos Luis Santos Orellana requested an investigation into allegations of discrimination with regard to their status as union officers and, further to the corresponding investigation at the workplace liable to inspection, the labour inspector noted in a report dated  April  that since this involved a collective dispute of a legal nature, he had no competence in the matter, and consequently the file was closed.(c)	Mr Carlos Armando Snchez requested an investigation into allegations of illegal deductions and discriminatory acts and an infringement of section () of the Labour Code was established, which forbids employers to discriminate, directly or indirectly, against workers on account of their trade union membership. The Government indicates that the inspector recorded in a re-inspection document that this infringement had been rectified and consequently the file was closed.(d)	Mr Modesto Daz Jovel requested an investigation into his employment situation, alleging fraud with respect to recruitment since the employer had modified his form of contract, which he saw as being intended to undermine the trade union movement and union freedoms. The Government indicates that after completing the corresponding inspection procedures the labour inspector recorded in a report dated  January  that the change in the form of contract was in line with clause  of the collective agreement, whereby workers having over  years' service are no longer covered by the recruitment regime and Mr Modesto Daz Jovel had  years' service to date; hence no infringement of the labour regulations was established, and consequently the file was closed.(e)	Ms Elsa del Socorro Carranza requested an investigation into her employment situation and, further to the relevant investigation by the labour inspector assigned to the case, the report dated  March  concluded that since this involved a labour dispute in which the recruitment regime, under section  of the Labour Code, does not come within the competence of the Ministry of Labour, it was necessary to return the file for closure.(f)	Mr David Ernesto Lpez Urquilla requested an investigation into discriminatory acts committed by representatives of the employer, including abuse of power, gender violence and harassment at work, and also with respect to the right to a hearing and defence and the adversarial principle established in clause  of the collective agreement. The Government indicates that the labour inspector concluded with regard to this last point that the Labour Inspection Department does not have competence for a collective dispute of a legal nature deriving from the application or interpretation of legal standards but the inspection report established an infringement of section () of the Occupational Risk Prevention Act, which penalizes non-fulfilment of the obligation to formulate and implement the enterprise s occupational risk management and prevention programme, an infringement which was shown to have been rectified in the re-inspection report, and consequently the file was closed.(g)	Ms Mirna Elizabeth Meja requested an investigation into her transfer as a union representative, noting that the assigned inspector established that there had been a violation of the collective agreement.
.The Government also highlights the use of dialogue round tables as a means of settling disputes, through the Labour Department and the Labour Minister s advisory team, and the publication by the Ministry of Labour of a recommendation to the employer in October  to consider the reinstatement of the dismissed union officers.
.Lastly, the Government indicates that as regards the notes dated  January ,  July  and  September , no record was found at the Labour Inspection Department of any files drawn up or procedures conducted on those dates, according to internal databases.
.The Committee observes that in the present case",0,2016,El Salvador
23,"the complainant organization reports: (i) dismissals of members of its executive committee; (ii) the refusal by the employer to grant union leave to its officers and also the refusal by the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare (Ministry of Labour) to grant union accreditation to three members of its executive committee; and (iii) anti-union threats and failure of the authorities to take action against them.
.As regards the dismissals of members of the executive committee of the complainant organization, namely Ms Elsa del Socorro Carranza de Murcia, Mr David Ernesto Lpez Urquilla, Mr Francisco Eduardo Cotto Murcia, Mr Rafael Ernesto Martnez Arvalo and Mr Modesto Daz Jovel, the Committee notes the judicial decisions authorizing their dismissals for unauthorized absence from work. It notes that the competent courts concluded, in the light of the evidence presented by the parties, that it had not been proven that the absences were for participating in activities required by their status as trade union officers. The Committee also observes that in the case of Mr Jos Luis Santos Orellana, the Fourth Civil and Commercial Court decided to allow the application for dismissal on  June , and the authorization of dismissal is currently being processed. The Committee also observes that the Ministry of Labour issued a recommendation to the employer in October  to consider the reinstatement of the dismissed union officers. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments, particularly to provide further details regarding the recommendation to reinstate the dismissed trade union officers and its implementation.
.As regards the refusal by the employer to grant trade union leave to officers of the complainant organization, the Committee notes the information provided by the Government concerning the relevant legislation and the ruling of the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice dated  June . It also notes the complainant s statement that it requested the aforementioned union leave on three occasions and that the employer rejected these three requests and was unwilling to negotiate a timetable or a reduction in working hours so that the executive committee could carry out its union activities. The Committee recalls in this respect that Article () of Convention No.  provides that  such facilities shall be afforded to the representatives of recognised public employees' organisations as may be appropriate in order to enable them to carry out their functions promptly and efficiently, both during and outside their hours of work'  Article () provides that  the granting of such facilities shall not impair the efficient operation of the administration or service concerned'  The Committee recalled that, while account should be taken of the characteristics of the industrial relations system of the country, and while the granting of such facilities should not impair the efficient operation of the undertaking concerned, Paragraph () of Recommendation No.  provides that workers' representatives in the undertaking should be afforded the necessary time off from work, without loss of pay or social and fringe benefits, for carrying out their representation functions. Paragraph () also specifies that, while workers' representatives may be required to obtain permission from the management before taking time off, such permission should not be unreasonably withheld. The Committee also recalls that Paragraph () of Recommendation No.  indicates that reasonable limits may be set on the amount of time off which is granted to workers' representatives [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , paragraphs  and ]. The Committee requests the Government to ensure that the members of the executive committee of the complainant organization are able to take trade union leave, in accordance with the above, and invites the Government, with a view to determining arrangements for such leave, to promote dialogue and collective bargaining between the parties concerned. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.As regards the refusal by the Ministry of Labour to grant trade union accreditation to three members of the executive committee of the complainant organization, namely Ms Elsa del Socorro Carranza de Murcia, Mr David Ernesto Lpez Urquilla and Mr Francisco Eduardo Cotto Murcia, the Committee observes that the complainant and the Government indicate that the employer rejected the three requests because no payslips or wage certificates had been submitted proving that they were ordinary workers and not representatives of the employer or persons occupying positions of trust. In this respect, the Committee notes that the Government highlights the fact that the same criterion was applied to all trade unions and the same documentation was requested from them. Furthermore, it notes the Government s statement that once the complainant submitted copies of the amparo appeals lodged with the Constitutional Chamber to provide the documentation that had been originally requested (payslips or certificates from the human resources department), the requested accreditation was granted. The Committee notes the Government s indication that on  May  the complainant elected a new executive committee and that full accreditation was issued on  August  to Mr Oscar Ernesto Murcia Carranza, the general secretary of the complainant organization. Under these circumstances, the Committee will not pursue its examination of this allegation.
.As regards the allegations of anti-union threats by the authorities and of silence on the part of the Ministry of Labour and the central Government in relation to various complaints of alleged anti-union acts committed by the employer, the Committee notes that the Government provides detailed information on the various inspections carried out by the Labour Inspection Department. It also notes the Government s indication that it made use of dialogue round tables to address the disputes that had arisen. The Committee encourages the Government to continue promoting social dialogue between the parties to address any pending issues and invites the complainant organization to forward any additional information that it may have on this matter. It also requests the Government to keep it informed of developments.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	As regards the dismissals of members of the executive committee of the complainant organization, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of further developments, particularly to provide further details regarding its recommendation to reinstate the dismissed trade union officials and its implementation.(b)	The Committee requests the Government to ensure that the members of the executive committee of the complainant organization are able to take trade union leave, in accordance with the decisions applying the principles of freedom of association mentioned in its conclusions, and invites the Government, with a view to determining arrangements for such leave, to promote dialogue and collective bargaining between the parties concerned. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.(c)	The Committee encourages the Government to continue promoting social dialogue between the parties to address any pending issues and invites the complainant organization to supply any additional information that it may have on this matter. It also requests the Government to keep it informed of developments.",0,2016,El Salvador
24,".The complaint is contained in a communication of  November  from the Administrative Employees' Union of the National Civil Police of El Salvador (SEAD PNC) and the Federation of Public Sector Workers' Unions (FESITRASEP).
.The Government sent its observations in a communication of  April .
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainant organizations report that on three occasions (in ,  and ) the SEAD PNC carried out the procedures vis--vis the Ministry of Labour to apply for legal personality, receiving a negative response on all three occasions. In the decisions rejecting the application to acquire legal personality, which were forwarded by the complainants, the Ministry indicates that: (i) article  of the National Constitution provides that members of the National Civil Police do not have the right of association (the Government emphasizes that this restriction also appears in the Civil Service Act); (ii) this is in accordance with Article  of Convention No. ; and (iii) the exclusion in the Constitution is applicable to both judicial and administrative personnel: the Constitution does not make distinctions among police staff on the basis of competencies or positions held; the police function ' the object of which is to ensure public safety ' comprises duties assigned to the whole institution of the National Civil Police, without distinguishing between posts or competencies of staff in its service.
.The complainants disagree with the Government s position. They consider that the reform made to article  of the Constitution in  was intended to place restrictions on the handling of confidential police information, and emphasize that the legislation distinguishes between police personnel and administrative personnel. In particular, section  of the Police Careers Act provides that this Act only applies to the police personnel of the National Civil Police and that the administrative, technical and service personnel of the National Civil Police will be regulated by other legislation ' which at present does not exist. The complainants also indicate that attempts have been made for years to apply the Civil Service Act to administrative personnel, even though section  of this Act provides that the members of the armed forces and of the National Civil Police are not part of the administrative career service. The complainants report that the Government nevertheless makes use of these distinctions to exclude administrative personnel from all the benefits and allowances granted to police personnel ' but when they wish to form a union to defend their interests they are not allowed to do so, being recognized under those circumstances solely as members of the National Civil Police. This gives rise to a situation of legal uncertainty, vulnerability and inequality in terms of rights and benefits.
.In its communication of  April , the Government makes observations in response to the complainants' allegations. With reference to the arguments put forward in the Ministry of Labour s decisions to reject the application by SEAD PNC to acquire legal personality and to the information provided by the Director-General of the National Civil Police, the Government indicates that: (i) the National Civil Police is a public-law institution, under the authority of the Ministry of Justice and Security, the purpose of which is to  protect and guarantee the free exercise of the rights and freedoms of individuals, to prevent and combat all kinds of crimes and to cooperate in the investigation of crimes; maintain internal peace, tranquillity, order and security in both urban and rural areas, with strict respect for human rights'  (ii) the prohibition contained in article () of the Constitution ' which establishes that members of the National Civil Police shall not have the right of association ' does not distinguish between staff on the basis of their competencies or posts held, in other words it does not distinguish between administrative and police staff; (iii) in the same manner, section () of the Basic Act of the National Civil Police prohibits all members of the police force from  organizing in trade unions or other groups that pursue the same ends, or participating in strikes, suspensions or stoppages of work'  (iv) the nature of policing is that the role is performed not by some staff but by the institution as a whole, being a joint and continuous task and a service that cannot be suspended for any reason; the tasks performed by police and administrative staff are not directly or indirectly separated, since the actions of police staff are directly linked to the work performed by administrative staff; and (v) in view of the foregoing, the exclusion in question, which affects all National Civil Police staff, is fully in accordance with Convention No. .
.The Committee observes that the complaint is concerned with allegations that the application by a new trade union of administrative staff in the National Civil Police to acquire legal personality was rejected and that the complainants emphasize that the legislation distinguishes between police personnel and administrative personnel within the police entity.
.In this regard, the Committee recalls that Article () of Convention No.  provides as follows:  The extent to which the guarantees provided for in this Convention shall apply to the armed forces and the police shall be determined by national laws or regulations.' ,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:
.The Committee observes that, despite the fact that the legislation distinguishes between administrative and police personnel, in particular with respect to their professional careers, the administrative decisions rejecting the application from SEAD PNC to acquire legal personality, as well as the Government s observations in relation to the complaint, highlight that: (i) the exclusion of the right to organize in the Constitution and in national legislation makes no distinction between categories of staff in the National Civil Police; and (ii) that the police function comprises duties assigned to the whole institution of the National Civil Police, without distinguishing between posts and competencies of staff in its service.
.While recalling that Article  of the Convention provides only for exceptions to the general principle, that the interpretation of these possible categories of exclusion (police and armed forces) should be restrictive and that in case of doubt, workers should be classified as civilians, the Committee takes due note of the information provided by the Government and observes that the complainants do not deny that administrative personnel are an integral part of the National Civil Police and they do not allege that the duties and tasks of such personnel are different in nature from those of police personnel; furthermore, they do not present any supporting evidence in this regard. In these circumstances, the Committee will not pursue its examination of the case.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.",1,2016,El Salvador
25,".The complaint is contained in communications from the CONAMYPE Workers' Union (SITCO) and the Trade Union Coordinating Body of El Salvador (CSS) dated  April  and  November , as well as in a communication received on  September  signed by SITCO.
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  March ,  January,  March and  June , and  January .
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communications, the complainants report that the authorities have refused to register a collective agreement that has already been approved and that the employer organization has refused to continue negotiating with SITCO. They indicate that:on  October  SITCO, as the union with the majority membership of workers, initiated the negotiation of a collective agreement with the National Commission for Micro and Small Enterprises (CONAMYPE) by presenting a request to the Ministry of Labour;on  December , the Directorate General for Labour (DGT), faced with the reasonable question of whether CONAMYPE was an independent body or a unit of the Ministry of the Economy, requested an opinion on the matter from the Minister of the Economy and the Minister of the Treasury; the Minister of the Economy responded that CONAMYPE was an independent body and was not part of the centralized structure of the Ministry;in light of this response, on  December , the DGT, treating CONAMYPE as an independent body, decided to go ahead with the negotiation and called on the parties to set a timetable for the direct negotiation stage, as well as calling on the Minister of the Economy in his capacity as president and legal representative of CONAMYPE (a position that the Minister did not dispute at that time, but which he denied after the collective agreement had been made);the negotiations took place in a normal fashion:  per cent of the collective agreement was agreed during the direct negotiation stage, the rest was resolved in the conciliation stage, whereby SITCO and CONAMYPE concluded the negotiation of the collective agreement satisfactorily, in accordance with the rules for independent bodies. The collective agreement was signed by both parties on  June : on one side, the Minister of the Economy and president of CONAMYPE, and, on the other side, the Secretary-General of SITCO;on  October  the Minister of the Economy and president of CONAMYPE submitted the collective agreement to the Ministry of the Treasury for its opinion (one of the legal requirements established in the Labour Code) ' surprisingly, the Minister of the Economy changed his opinion in that communication and declared that CONAMYPE was not independent and that he was not its legal representative;on  November  the Minister of the Treasury issued a resolution declaring that, since CONAMYPE was not established as an independent body, its legal status did not meet the requirements laid down in article  of the Labour Code and article  of the Civil Service Act, which meant that the requested statement could not be issued, and that the Ministry lacked the jurisdiction to give a legal, technical, financial or budgetary opinion;SITCO continued the process of registering the collective agreement that had already been made and duly signed and approved by the Ministry of the Economy, presenting the necessary information to the Ministry of Labour; however, the Ministry of Labour responded on  November  with additional prerequisites, notably the  favourable' opinion of the Ministry of the Treasury and the approval of the Minister of the Economy (approval that was already on record, since he had signed the collective agreement himself);in the interest of complying with the additional prerequisites, SITCO again requested: (a) confirmation of the Minister of the Economy s approval ' however, the Minister responded on  January , once again contradicting his initial statement on the basis of which the agreement had been made and stating that CONAMYPE was not an independent body and that he was not its legal representative; and (b) the opinion of the Minister of the Treasury ' who withdrew his previous response regarding lack of jurisdiction. SITCO submitted these opinions to the Ministry of Labour with a view to moving past the request to register the collective agreement ' however, the Ministry of Labour denied the request, stating that it did not comply with  one of the necessary prerequisites for registration, that is to say the favourable opinion of the Ministry of the Treasury, in order for the collective labour agreement to be valid in accordance with article  of the Labour Code' the denial was unfounded because: (a) article  refers to  the opinion of the Ministry of the Treasury' without specifying whether it needs to be favourable; (b) in addition, the objective of this prerequisite is to establish whether funds are available, which was not relevant in this case because it did not affect the balance of the budget (the agreement had been made on the basis that it would be implemented with salary economies generated each tax year ' and for that reason the Ministry of the Treasury has not expressed any impediment to the signing of the agreement in its communications); and (c) both the Ministry of the Treasury and the Ministry of the Economy had been asked the central question (about the legal nature of CONAMYPE) at the outset of the proceedings and did not raise any reservations about the negotiation process at that time ' the Minister of the Economy had confirmed that it was an independent body and signed the agreement that was negotiated himself. As a result, SITCO appealed the denial, but on  March  the DGT upheld its initial resolution and again refused to register the collective agreement; andsubsequently, the complainants reported that workers' representatives had been excluded from the process of drawing up the CONAMYPE travel allowance regulations ( July ) and its protocol for dealing with cases of workplace and sexual harassment ( September ).
.In its communications the Government provides the responses from the authorities concerned to the allegations made in the complaint. The Government indicates that:(i)	in response to the request from SITCO to register the collective agreement, the information submitted was checked and it was found that a favourable opinion from the Ministry of the Treasury had not been included, which is an indispensable prerequisite for registration, in accordance with article  of the Labour Code (which requires  the approval of the relevant Ministry' as well as obtaining  the opinion of the Ministry of the Treasury in advance'  and article  of the Civil Service Act (which makes registration subject  to the favourable opinion of the Ministry of the Treasury' ;(ii)	on  November  the trade union was notified that it would need to present a favourable opinion from the Ministry of the Treasury, as well as approval from the Ministry of the Economy (because CONAMYPE is affiliated to it); and
.The Government also indicates that:on  July  the Minister of the Economy sent a memo to the President of the Republic s Secretary for Legislative and Legal Affairs, stating that the legal nature of CONAMYPE needed to be established with regard to its legal representation ' however, no response was received at that time. Prior to that, on  June , the Minister had gone ahead and signed the collective agreement in his capacity as Minister of the Economy, but he did not hold the position of legal representative of CONAMYPE. Subsequently, in a memo dated  October , the Minister of the Economy wrote to the Minister of the Treasury to explain the follow-up that had been given to the collective agreement in question and to clarify that CONAMYPE was not an independent body and that, as a result, there had been a delay in processing the documentation, since it did not comply with article  of the Labour Code;it could be said that there was a legal lacuna in the decree that set up CONAMYPE, since it did not establish its legal representation, and this situation prevented the registration of the collective agreement;the leadership of CONAMYPE stated that they were prepared to negotiate a collective agreement with SITCO and indicated that, during the impasse, they had provided additional employment benefits, some of which were among those that had been duly agreed with the union;subsequently, legislative measures were taken to define the legal nature of CONAMYPE and on  November  legislative decree No.  was adopted, establishing CONAMYPE as an independent body ' which led to a transition process that did not affect SITCO;on  February  negotiations were established between CONAMYPE and SITCO in order to reach a common agreement and five meetings were held in this framework, addressing various issues of mutual interest, including the collective labour agreement, labour liabilities, wage adjustment",1,2016,El Salvador
26,"and specific cases, andwith regard to the collective labour agreement, SITCO requested that the agreement that had already been negotiated be taken up again, but CONAMYPE proposed negotiating a new collective agreement. SITCO showed willingness to renegotiate, as long as this was voluntary, since it did not have the percentage established in law for compulsory negotiation ( per cent), and as long as the resulting agreement could be registered without further delay. Consequently, various public authorities were consulted to assess the legitimacy of that request, which did not meet the legally established prerequisites for compulsory negotiation.
.In its communications of  March  and  January , the Government adds that:on  July  a round table was held between CONAMYPE and SITCO at the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare, during which it was stated that CONAMYPE was carrying out additional consultations so that its board of directors could assess the possibility of ratifying the contents of the existing draft collective agreement;on  November  another meeting was called with the DGT as mediator, but that one was unsuccessful as the parties disagreed and the representatives of CONAMYPE decided to leave the round table, declaring that the negotiations could not proceed in the absence of respectful conditions  neither party has communicated with the DGT since then;according to the consultations that the Government held with CONAMYPE at that time, CONAMYPE has declared that SITCO has lost members and its membership only amounted to . per cent of public servants in the institution, so it would not be possible to continue the negotiations; nonetheless, CONAMYPE was prepared to start negotiations when the prerequisites established in law were met ( per cent membership for compulsory negotiation);starting on  June , changes were made in executive authority institutions, including CONAMYPE, and on  June  SITCO met with the new president of CONAMYPE, expressing that they were  prepared to make progress' with the institution; the following day, the president of CONAMYPE made it known that  we will make our relationship with SITCO win-win, both for the institution and for the workers'  andin that context, the SITCO Delegates Assembly approved a list of requests for the negotiation of the collective agreement, which was presented to the administrative authorities on  July , who stated that they will draw up mechanisms for the development of a proposal.
.With regard to the two internal instruments referred to by SITCO, the Government states that, according to information received from CONAMYPE: (i) the CONAMYPE travel allowance regulations ( July ) at no time established conditions that were any different to those that had already been included in the general travel allowance regulations, they simply set up the internal administrative procedures, so there had been no need to negotiate with the union; and (ii) the workers were indeed consulted about the contents of the institution s protocol for dealing with cases of workplace and sexual harassment ( September ) and they had taken account of the observations that SITCO had made as part of the internal employment regulations (the Government submits various documents to support this), since the protocol was initially contained within those regulations ' however, due to its importance, it was later presented as a separate instrument.
.The Committee observes that, in this case, relating to collective bargaining in a public institution (CONAMYPE), the complainants report that the competent authorities have refused to register a collective agreement that has already been approved and to continue negotiating with the majority union (SITCO).
.The Committee observes that confusion about the legal status of CONAMYPE as an employing organization ' whether or not it was an independent body ' led, firstly, to a collective agreement being made through direct negotiation and conciliation, and, secondly, to the refusal to register the agreement that had been negotiated and signed in good faith by the parties. After SITCO had followed the appropriate collective bargaining procedures and after the Ministry of Labour had carried out the relevant consultations, the Minister of the Economy had initially believed that CONAMYPE was an independent body whose relations with the Executive went through his Ministry. Having received that opinion, the Ministry of Labour began the negotiating process. However, once the agreement had been negotiated, signed by the Minister of the Economy himself in his role as president of CONAMYPE, he then issued another opinion (finding that it was not an independent body affiliated to his Ministry) which meant that the agreement could not be registered. The Committee also observes that, subsequently, when the legal nature of CONAMYPE was clarified, enabling negotiations again, the authorities concerned concluded that they could not negotiate with SITCO because it had lost some members and its membership only amounted to . per cent of the workers ' which did not meet the  per cent membership established in the Labour Code and the Civil Service Act that would oblige the public institution to negotiate and sign a collective agreement.
.In this regard, the Committee recalls the importance which it attaches to the obligation to negotiate in good faith for the maintenance of the harmonious development of labour relations [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , para. ]. The Committee considers that the question about the legal nature and representation of the employer organization should have been addressed beforehand ' this question was later raised by the same party who participated in the negotiation in order to deny the registration of the collective agreement. This should have been clarified in advance or at least before the collective agreement was signed ' for example, when the question was raised by the Ministry of Labour following the union s request for negotiations. The Committee considers that this type of situation can erode confidence in the sector s industrial relations system and hopes that it does not happen again in the future.
.With regard to CONAMYPE s refusal to negotiate with SITCO because it no longer represents  per cent of the workers, the Committee has considered that, if there is no union covering more than  per cent of the workers in a unit, collective bargaining rights should nevertheless be granted to the unions in this unit, at least on behalf of their own members [see Compilation, para. ].
.In light of the foregoing, since the question about the legal nature of CONAMYPE and its capacity for collective bargaining has been clarified, and observing that the latest information provided by the Government suggested that the union was very close to having the percentage required for the negotiations to become compulsory (its membership amounting to . per cent of public servants in the public institution) and that the Government has indicated in several of its communications that it is carrying out consultations regarding the possibility of reaching a collective agreement voluntarily ' and reported in its latest communication that the administrative authorities had expressed that they would draw up mechanisms for the development of a proposal in response to the list of requests presented by SITCO on  July  ' the Committee trusts that the authorities concerned will continue to take the necessary measures to promote the negotiation of a collective agreement in full respect of the principles of freedom of association and collective bargaining.
.In light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee trusts that the authorities concerned will continue to take the necessary measures to promote the negotiation of a collective agreement in full respect of the principles of freedom of association and collective bargaining.",1,2016,El Salvador

.In its communications of  January and  May , the STEES reports the anti-union dismissal of the members of the executive committee of the enterprise trade union branch in the Central American Technological Institute (ITCA) ' Corporate Foundation for Educational Development (FEPADE) Specialized School of Engineering (hereinafter  the School' . The complainant alleges specifically that: (i) the first executive committee of the trade union branch was elected on  March  and the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare issued credentials to its members on  April ; (ii) as a consequence of the establishment of the trade union branch, the institution s authorities dismissed the following members of the executive committee: Ms Ana Margarita Ortiz de Alvarado, finance secretary; Ms Jeannette Guadalupe Martnez Pineda, communications secretary; Ms Yanira Elizabeth Mena Vsquez, trade union relations secretary, on  November ; and Mr Roberto Rosales Alemn, organization and statistics secretary, on  December ; and (iii) from that point on, the institution s security service refused to allow the members of the executive committee of the trade union branch to enter its premises, maintaining that their contracts had ended.
.The STEES adds that the Ministry of Labour, through the Special Unit for the Prevention of Discriminatory and Labour-related Actions, confirmed the dismissal of Mr Roberto Rosales Alemn through a special inspection conducted on  January . The complainant provides a copy of the inspection report, which states that the School had violated section  of the Labour Code, having acted improperly in dismissing Mr Rosales Alemn because he held the post of organization and statistics secretary of the executive committee. The inspection report ordered the School to remedy this violation within three days. The STEES reports that the School did not follow the labour inspectorate s reinstatement recommendation.
.In its communication of  May , the complainant also provides the text of the court judgments concerning the dismissal of Ms Ana Margarita Ortiz de Alvarado, Ms Jeannette Guadalupe Martnez Pineda and Ms Yanira Elizabeth Mena Vsquez. In these judgments, issued on  and  April , the labour court states that: (i) while the workers held service contracts, they had been performing ongoing labour-related functions in the institution for many years; (ii) the three workers had been appointed to membership of the executive committee of the trade union branch in April  and therefore enjoyed the trade union immunity established in domestic law; and (iii) the three workers were dismissed in November  without adequate justification by the employer. The complainant states that, based on these facts, the labour court ordered the School to pay the wages owed to each of the three workers from the date of her dismissal to the date on which her trade union immunity expired.
.Lastly, the complainant states that, despite the aforementioned labour inspectorate decisions and court judgments, the institution is refusing to reinstate the members of the executive committee who were dismissed.
.In its communication of  March , the Government transmits its observations on the complainant s allegations. It indicates, first, that the labour inspectorate carried out a total of  inspections of the School in connection with the events reported in the complaint. On this point, the Government mentions specifically that: (i) the inspection conducted on  November  established that although the functions performed by the members of the executive committee of the trade union branch were ongoing, the School s employees held service contracts, a fact that was inconsistent with the Labour Code; and (ii) the inspection conducted on  January  established that the wrongful dismissal of Mr Roberto Antonio Rosales, member of the STEES executive committee, on  December  had violated section  of the Code. With regard to the latter violation, the Government states that a penalty was imposed and the School was fined pursuant to a judgment of  August . However, the Government indicates that the enterprise appealed this judgment on  November  and that the appeal is still ongoing.
.In its communication of  March , the Government provides additional information on the outcome of the labour inspection activities related to the allegations set out in the complaint. The Government notes in particular that an administrative procedure relating to the wrongful dismissal of seven leaders of the trade union branch (including Ms Ana Margarita Ortiz de Alvarado, Ms Jeannette Guadalupe Martnez Pineda and Ms Yanira Elizabeth Mena Vsquez) and to several anti-union discrimination actions, is in the sanctioning phase of the proceedings ' the final resolution of the matter currently pending. As to the pending judicial procedures, the Government indicates that: (i) the Second Court of Santa Tecla ruled in favour of three leaders of the trade union branch, ordering the payment of salaries not received due to the employer s actions and noting that it did not address the reinstatement of the workers in so far as it considered that their employment relationship had not been terminated; (ii) the Second Chamber of Labour Matters revoked certain first instance rulings favourable to the workers; and (iii) such second instance decisions of the Second Chamber have been appealed before the Administrative Chamber of the Supreme Court.
.The Government also indicates that on  July , the STEES again wrote to the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare, requesting it to intervene in the dismissal of the trade union officers. In light of this request, the Department of Labour summoned the parties to three hearings (on  June,  September and  November , respectively) in order to resolve the dispute concerning the dismissals and the Minister of Labour held an additional meeting in her own office on  March  for the same purpose. However, the Government indicates that none of these meetings led to an agreement because the School maintained its position that the dispute could not be resolved administratively because the institution had already referred the cases to the courts and would wait for the labour judge to settle them.
.The Government indicates, on the other hand, that in a communication of  March , the Ministry of Education states that: (i) although the School is an institution of higher education operating under the aegis of the Ministry of Education, it is privately administered and is governed by its own statutes; and (ii) the trade union officers mentioned in the complaint are not public servants, but rather former teachers; thus, the wages that they received for their professional services did not derive from public resources managed by the School.
.In its  March  communication, the Government adds that the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare undertook the following additional measures: (i) the Ministry of Labour convened for  April  a new conciliation meeting to seek the reinstatement of the trade union leaders but the school did not attend; (ii) on  April , the Ministry of Labour convoked a press conference to make public the violations to freedom of association which had occurred in the school; (iii) on  August , the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare addressed a communication to the President of the Republic, informing that its Ministry had followed up on the case of unfair dismissal of several trade union leaders in the school, and that, in so far as the school receives funds from the State, it should lead by example in guaranteeing freedom of association; and (iv) the Ministry of Labour continues supporting the trade union branch in the actions seeking the restitution of its labour rights.
.The Committee observes that in the present case, the complainant reports the anti-union dismissal of several trade union officers a few months after the establishment of a trade union branch in a school of engineering. The Committee notes that the complainant mentions, in particular, the dismissal of the trade union officers, Mr Roberto Rosales Alemn, Ms Ana Margarita Ortiz de Alvarado, Ms Jeannette Guadalupe Martnez Pineda and Ms Yanira Elizabeth Mena Vsquez, which took place on  November and  December . The Committee also notes that, according to the complainant, the School failed to comply with the rulings of the labour inspectorate and the labour courts with regard to these dismissals.
.The Committee observes that both the complainant and the Government indicate that the events that prompted this complaint led to several interventions by the labour inspectorate and to several court judgments. The Committee notes that it is clear from the documents provided by the Government and the complainant that: (i) on  November , the labour inspectorate found that the",1,2016,El Salvador
28,"fact that the members of the executive committee held service contracts even though they were performing ongoing functions was inconsistent with the Labour Code; (ii) on  January , the labour inspectorate found that the School had violated section  of the Labour Code by wrongfully dismissing the trade union leader, Mr Roberto Antonio Rosales Alemn, and ordered it to remedy the violation within three days; (iii) on  November , the School appealed the ruling in which the labour inspectorate had fined it for violating section  of the Labour Code by wrongfully dismissing Mr Alemn, and that appeal is still under way; (iv) an administrative procedure relating to the wrongful dismissal of seven leaders of the trade union branch (among them three trade union leaders mentioned in the complaint) and to several anti-union discrimination actions, is in the sanctioning phase of the proceedings ' the final resolution of the matter currently pending (v) the trade union officers, Ms Ana Margarita Ortiz, Ms Jeannette Guadalupe Martnez and Ms Yanira Elizabeth Mena, have brought judicial proceedings demanding reinstatement. On  and  April , the labour court issued judgments in which it found that the employer had not adequately justified the dismissals and ordered the School to pay the claimants the wages owed to them from the date of their dismissal to the date on which their trade union immunity expired (the School appealed these judgments); and (vi) other first instance judicial rulings favourable to the workers revoked in second instance are pending resolution by the Supreme Court. The Committee also takes note of the following additional measures undertaken by the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare: (i) on  July , in light of the continued dismissal of the various members of the executive committee of the trade union branch, the STEES requested that the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare intervene in order to resolve the situation; (ii) the Ministry summoned the parties to four conciliation hearings, the last of them in the presence of the Minister of Labour, in the hope of reaching an agreement on the status of the trade union officers; (iii) at these meetings, the School maintained its position that it could not agree to the officers' reinstatement and would await the final rulings of the courts in the cases; and (iv) the Ministry of Labour has drawn the attention of the President of the Republic to the need for the school to respect the principles of freedom of association.
.The Committee observes that it is clear from the foregoing that: (i) the trade union officers' dismissals that are the subject of the present complaint gave rise to interventions and rulings by the labour inspectorate that found violations of the provisions of the Labour Code concerning the protection of trade union officers. These interventions and rulings are not, however, final, whether because the fines have been appealed or because some of the administrative procedures are still under way; (ii) similarly, the lower labour courts have ruled that the dismissal of three of the trade union officers was not consistent with the provisions of the Labour Code concerning the protection of trade union officers, and these labour court judgments are the subject of an appeal that is pending; and (iii) the conciliation hearings and other initiatives undertaken by the Ministry of Labour were unable to resolve the situation.
.The Committee recalls that the dismissal of trade union officers on account of their trade union office or activities, even if they are subsequently reinstated, is contrary to Article  of Convention No. , and could, in cases where dismissal has been proven, amount to intimidation preventing the exercise of their trade union functions [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , para. ]. While taking due note of the Government s efforts to reach an agreement on reinstatement of the trade union officers who were dismissed, the Committee notes with concern that, two and a half years after the aforementioned dismissals, the final rulings of both the labour inspectorate and the labour courts are still pending. Therefore, while recalling that no one should be subjected to anti-union discrimination because of legitimate trade union activities and the remedy of reinstatement should be available to those who are victims of anti-union discrimination [see Compilation, op. cit., para. ], the Committee urges that the necessary measures be taken to ensure that the pending judicial proceedings in relation to the present case are concluded without further delay. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard without delay.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee urges that the necessary measures be taken to ensure that the pending judicial proceedings in relation to the present case are concluded without further delay. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard without delay.",0,2016,El Salvador
29,".The complaint is contained in a communication of  August  from the Union of Electrical Sector Workers (STSEL).
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  November .
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Workers' Representatives Convention,  (No. ), and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  August , the complainant alleges that STSEL was the victim of acts of interference by the President of the Ro Lempa Hydroelectric Executive Commission ( the Commission' , a public group acting in that sector and covering various firms. The complainant explains that the official in question took up his post in June  and that STSEL openly expressed its opposition to his appointment. The complainant states that the said person had tried to be elected as Secretary-General of STSEL, but that he had been refused the position, as he did not fulfil the legal requirements and acted as an employer s representative and trusted employee in one of the Commission s firms (La Geo,  firm A' , as project coordinator. According to the complainant, the fact that he did not manage to obtain the union position, as a result of the majority of members rejecting him at a general assembly, led to him making threats towards the union and guaranteeing that he would not rest until the organization was destroyed.
.The complainant alleges that the President of the Commission sponsored a group of STSEL members and all the members of an STSEL section governing board to join forces with him in attacking the union. It states that STSEL reacted to this attack by expelling the members that had joined forces with the President and that, faced with their expulsion, they obtained further support from the President of the Commission, to the effect that he used them to establish a parallel union based in firm A, known as the Union of Electrical Industry and Related Activities Workers of El Salvador (STESEC). The complainant states that membership of STESEC was obtained by coercing the STSEL members to withdraw from that union and become members of the new union, by offering the managers wage increases, if they joined up, as well as jobs for the children of those who became members. According to the complainant, the President of the Commission made a personal appeal for all middle and high-ranking members, and managers of firm A and of the Commission, to join the STESEC, a step which those staff members actually took. Referring to membership of the union, the President of the Commission stated publicly that  members were either with him or against him'  for that reason, the employees and managers became members of STESEC out of fear. As regards the above, the complainant indicates that it filed an application for protection with the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice, dated  October , but that ten months after the application was filed nothing had been forthcoming. The complainant also informs that on  November , it submitted a request to the Second San Salvador Labour Court, for STESEC to be legally dissolved owing to the acts of coercion against the STSEL members in firm A, committed together with the managers, although no final decision had as yet been taken on the application. It indicates that it has filed a further application with the Fourth Labour Court, owing to acts of coercion committed in the Commission by STESEC, although that judicial authority has not yet taken a final decision either.
.Furthermore, the complainant states that while firm A of the Commission refuses to grant union leave to union leaders of various branches of STSEL to perform their union duties, it grants unrestricted leave to STESEC union leaders to carry out their activities, and provides them with appropriate food and transport. The complainant indicates that such conduct is also carried out by Commission officials who favour STESEC s union activities and restrict union leave for STSEL.
.The complainant also states that on  May , firm A dismissed Mr Julio Cesar Avils Oliva, Secretary-General of STSEL s branch in firm A, for taking union leave, despite the fact that the Director-General of Labour of the Ministry of Labour had issued a ruling of  October  to the effect that STSEL union leaders could benefit from union leave on the basis of the collective labour agreement. In addition, STSEL considers that, in accordance with the labour laws, a union leader cannot be dismissed or be subject to disciplinary sanctions without the competent authority having previously proved that a specific reason exists; in the case of Mr Avils, that prior requirement had not been satisfied but he had been dismissed arbitrarily by the employer.
.The complainant also denounces the fact that the President of the Commission authorized lawyers from its legal body to provide advice on the disputed ownership of the collective agreements concluded by STSEL with various Commission bodies, to the effect that the Head of the National Department of Social Organizations informed STSEL that it had transferred ownership, to STESEC, of the collective labour agreement with firm A (by a decision of  October ), and of the collective agreement with another firm (firm B) and with the Commission itself (in both cases by a decision of  May ). The complainant informs that it was not guaranteed the right to a hearing and due process, and that although it had informed the head of department in question that STESEC had gained union members from the said firms with the sponsorship of the President of the Commission, and that it had also taken legal action in that regard, the case was decided in favour of the employers' union, STESEC.
.The complainant states that it reported these facts to the Minister of Labour and that, despite the Minister holding one meeting with the President of the Commission, the President continued with the attacks mentioned, to the extent that STSEL was deprived of the collective labour agreements of which it was the owner. The complainant states that the Minister also failed to intervene with the Head of the National Department of Social Organizations for the purposes of carrying out an investigation of how STESEC gained the largest number of members. According to the complainant, the Minister s failure to act led to further attacks against STSEL s right to freedom of association.
.Finally, the complainant alleges that it requested the Labour Inspectorate-General to conduct inspections in relation to the abovementioned anti-union practices and that the inspectorate noted the instances of coercion reported.
.In its communication of  November , the Government provides a response to the allegations made by the complainant, partly based on the information received from firm A (attached to the response). As regards the allegation of interference by the President of the Commission and his role in creating a parallel union (STESEC), the Government indicates that the President was appointed to his position in June , for a four-year period. Referring to the registers held by the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare, the Government indicates that only two unions are in operation in the Commission, i.e. STSEL and STESEC. The first was established on  August  and the second on  May , i.e. sufficiently in advance of the President s appointment. At the same time, it states that STSEL was already unhappy with the appointment of the official in question.
.The Government states that the Commission is an official state autonomous public service institution, and that firm A is a public firm which belongs to the Commission, and that, in accordance with the individual labour agreement of the Secretary-General, it may be noted that she is an employee of firm A. From the above, the Government states that the facts alleged in the complaint by STSEL took place in firm A, whose legal representative, from  June  to date, was not the President of the Commission but another person. In other words, the majority of the facts alleged by STSEL occurred in firm A, although the Commission managed the relevant information so as to examine in depth the facts relating to the representative.
.As regards the procedure for changing ownership of the collective labour agreement concluded between STSEL and the Commission in favour of STESEC, the Government indicates that, pursuant to article  of the Labour Code, when comparing the updated payroll of STESEC members with the list of payments presented by the Commission, the National Department of Social Organizations of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare determined that STESEC had exceeded the required minimum percentage set by article  of the Labour Code. As regards firm A, the Government states that on  October , the National Department of Social Organizations declared that STESEC was the owner of the collective labour agreement.
.The Government further presents statistics concerning membership of the",1,2015,El Salvador
30,"two sectoral unions (STSEL and STESEC), by means of which it provides proof of and justification for STSEL s loss of union ownership, owing to its smaller number of members, and highlights the obligation of the employer, firm A, to conclude the collective agreement with the union that represents the majority of workers. Based on the above, on  November , that firm and STESEC finalized a new collective labour agreement which repealed the previous agreement, thereby demonstrating, according to the Government, a willingness to engage in dialogue by both parties in the conclusion of the new collective agreement.
.With respect to the allegations that union leave was refused for trade union leaders of various branches of STSEL, the Government states that paragraph  of the new collective agreement recognizes the right of the union for its leaders to have union leave, but such leave is partial and not permanent:One member of the Section Governing Board for firm [A] of the Union and one member of the General Governing Board shall have ten () days of leave each per calendar month with full pay for the period during which he/she performs the duties for which he/she was elected, in order to carry out those necessary and essential duties in the exercise of his/her functions, with no obligation other than to report on a daily basis to the firm s premises, so as to provide assistance and verify that the work is carried out in an efficient and smooth manner, ensuring respect and consideration between coordinators and subordinates. The remaining members of the Section Governing Board for firm [A] and General Governing Board shall have six () days' leave per calendar month with full pay; they shall report to their place of work in the same manner; and time shall not be accumulated in subsequent months.
.The Government further considers that the minority union also has the right to union leave, but on a partial basis and not full time. For the Government, the fact that the STSEL Secretary-General considers that she has the right to  per cent working time as a right granted by trade union freedoms is solely the result of a personal decision to grant herself the exclusive privilege not to work, contrary to the provisions of the new collective agreement in force. In that regard, it provides a list of  notes sent by the firm s human resources administrative authority, in which it requests STSEL s Secretary-General to report for work, something she has not as yet done.
.As to the dismissal of Mr Julio Csar Avils Oliva, Secretary-General of the STSEL s branch in firm A, for allegedly taking union leave, the Government states that the corresponding court proceedings have been temporarily suspended.
.Concerning the filing of the application with the Second Labour Court of San Salvador, on  November , requesting that STESEC be dissolved for alleged acts of coercion against STSEL members in firm A committed together with the managers, the Government indicates that the application for dissolution was declared  non-admissible' by the court, on  July  (proceedings No. NUE --LBJC-LB-(), as administered by the Second Labour Court; the decision is attached to the Government s response). Pointing out that the proceedings in question contain  sworn witness statements, the Government states that the claims made in the complaint are therefore refuted and that it is clearly established that the President of the Commission did not, at any time, commit any acts of coercion against any worker or union activist.
.As regards the application filed with the Fourth Labour Court for alleged acts of coercion committed by STESEC, the Government indicates that the Court, in a decision issued on  July , upheld the lis pendens exception alleged by the defendant.
.With respect to the hearing, mentioned by the complainant, with the Minister and the President of the Commission, the Government reports that a hearing was arranged on  April  to launch a dialogue between the two parties involved, but that the hearing ended without a settlement being reached owing to the inflexible position of the Secretary General of STSEL, who refused to report to her place of work.
.In relation to the allegation concerning the request for inspections to be made by the Labour Inspectorate-General, the Government states that an inspection was requested by STSEL for the purposes of verifying whether anti-union discrimination existed in firm A; in those proceedings a breach of section () of the Labour Code was highlighted, that breach was not remedied and the case was transferred to the appropriate sanctions procedure. The Government indicates that the proceedings are with the Appeals Section of the Labour Inspectorate-General, owing to the fact that a fine of US$. was imposed, for a breach of section  of the Labour Code, as it pertains to article () of the same Code.
.Finally, in relation to STSEL s Secretary-General, the Government states that, as indicated in the document of  May , firm A requested that a special or unplanned inspection be conducted so as to establish the union leader s obligation to perform the work agreed in the individual employment contract.
.The Committee notes that in this case the complainant (STSEL) claims that: (i) acts of interference have been committed by the President of the Hydroelectric Executive Commission (the Commission), in particular its role in creating a parallel union (STESEC); (ii) the complainant s ownership of the collective agreement has been transferred to that parallel union; (iii) union leave has been refused by firm A of the Commission for trade union leaders of various branches of STSEL; and (iv) Mr Julio Cesar Avils Oliva, Secretary-General of STSEL s branch in firm A, has been dismissed, allegedly for taking union leave.
.As to the allegations of interference by the President of the Commission and his role in setting up a parallel union (STESEC), the Committee notes the rivalries, mentioned by the complainant and the Government, between the STSEL management and the President. According to the STSEL representative, these rivalries are alleged to date back to the period during which the current President had tried to be elected as STSEL Secretary-General, and his candidacy had been rejected by the majority of members since he was acting as the employer s representative and a trusted employee in one of the Commission s firms (firm A). The Committee notes that, according to the complainant, this had given rise to some personal resentment on the part of the President towards the complainant and the willingness to create a parallel union (STESEC). The Committee also notes the information provided by the Government, according to which STESEC had been established long before the President s appointment (two years) and the STSEL union was unhappy with the appointment of the official in question as President of the Commission.
.In relation to the application filed with the Second Labour Court of San Salvador, dated  November , in which the complainant requested STESEC to be dissolved, for alleged acts of coercion against the STSEL members in firm A, committed together with the managers, the Committee notes the information provided by the Government, according to which, in a ruling issued on  July , the application for dissolution was declared  non admissible' (court proceedings No. NUE --LBJC-LB-()). The Committee notes that the decision highlights the imprecise nature of the causal factors of the proof provided. In particular, the decision reads:  no evidence has been provided of the persons who have been coerced, nor has evidence been forthcoming as to who from the union that is the subject of the application has allegedly been the cause of such circumstances, nor of the means as to how the alleged coercion has been verified; by contrast, documents have been filed showing that members have moved from one union to another, without there being any violence, force or coercion in this regard ' and, moreover, in the case brought, as a legal person the union has not infringed any provision of the law or of its constitution, while actions are attributed to its members as natural persons and individuals; it can therefore be inferred that cancelling the registration of a trade union or dissolving it for alleged illegal activities of some of its members, would result in broad and serious consequences for the representation of the interests of hundreds of workers'  Considering that at the time the complaint was submitted, the complainant had no knowledge of the decision, the Committee requests it to indicate whether it lodged an appeal against the decision of the Second Labour Court dated  July .
.As regards the relinquishing of ownership of the collective agreement to STESEC, the Committee notes the procedure reported by the Government, in relation to the work of the National Department of Social Organizations of the Ministry of Labour, as well as the statistics relating to the members of the two trade unions concerned, through which evidence is provided of STSEL s loss of union ownership, owing to its smaller",0,2015,El Salvador
31,"number of members in both the Commission and in firm A. It also notes that on  November  a new collective agreement was subsequently formalized between firm A and the new majority union, STESEC.
.As regards the issue of union leave, the Committee notes that the new conditions applicable are the result of the new collective agreement mentioned and that they restrict the leave granted, although such leave is given to both unions, according to the information provided by the Government. The Committee notes that for the Government such conditions are the logical consequence of the collective agreement, as it has been negotiated by the new majority union, STESEC, while the STSEL representative appears to apply the old system which was more favourable to STSEL.
.In more general terms, despite the allegations of interference and coercion of the firm in promoting a parallel union in order to damage the complainant not having been proved, and despite the consequences resulting from the loss of ownership of a collective agreement, the Committee cannot fail to note that the decision in question of the Second Labour Court, of  July , recognizes that the members of the union which is the subject of the application (STESEC), including in its executive board, consist of persons who are managers and who, as a result, are trusted employees and represent the employers of firm A:  since there is no proof to deny that the workers in question with the relevant positions acted or act as union leaders on the general executive board and the section of the union subject to the application, it is established that as they are in fact employers' representatives and form part of the management of the relevant union, the provisions of article () of the Labour Code have been breached ' and thus the work-related interests of the other workers are affected, irrespective of whether they are members of the relevant union, in so far as those employees are part of the management of that trade union and, at the same time, have been employers' representatives; this constitutes interference by the employers in the union s activities and infringes the rights of a workers' group  ? In those circumstances and in the light of the information available to it, the Committee cannot exclude the possibility that the employer has grounds to isolate STSEL and promote another union (STESEC) presumably more closely suited to its interests, even to the extent of giving it ownership of the collective agreement. In this regard, the Committee considers that the fact that managers of the firm are also members of the union and of its governing board is clear evidence of unfair practice, giving rise to acts of interference in violation of Convention No. , Article , and of national legislation, with possible repercussions for collective bargaining. In this respect, the Committee reiterates that, recalling the importance of the independence of the parties in collective bargaining, negotiations should not be conducted on behalf of employees or their organizations by bargaining representatives appointed by or under the domination of employers or their organizations [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ].
.The Committee also notes that investigations have been conducted by the Labour Inspectorate-General at the request of STSEL. In this regard, the Committee notes that, according to the complainant, the inspectorate noted the instances of coercion reported ' although the organization did not provide further details ' and that the Government indicates that the inspectorate highlighted a breach of article () of the Labour Code in firm A (referring to anti-union practices, and direct or indirect discrimination), which was not remedied, and the case was transferred to the appropriate sanctions procedure. The Committee further notes that the case is currently with the Appeals Section of the Labour Inspectorate-General, owing to the fact that a fine of US$. was imposed for a breach of article  of the Labour Code, relating to the protection of trade union immunity, as it pertains to article () of the same Code.
.The Committee requests the Government to provide detailed information on the anti-union practices observed by the Labour Inspectorate-General in firm A. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the corresponding sanctions procedure, so as to ensure that the sanctions applied are sufficiently dissuasive as to guarantee the freedom of association of all workers in the firm.
.As to the dismissal of Mr Julio Csar Avils Oliva, Secretary-General of STSEL s branch in firm A, the Committee notes that, according to the complainant, firm A dismissed Mr Avils Oliva on  May  for taking union leave, despite the fact that the Director-General of Labour of the Ministry of Labour had issued a ruling, dated  October , that STSEL union leaders could take union leave as per the collective labour agreement. The Committee also notes that the Government indicates that the corresponding court proceedings have been temporarily suspended. Drawing attention to the Workers' Representatives Convention, No.  and Recommendation No.  (), in which it is expressly established that workers' representatives in the undertaking shall enjoy effective protection against any act prejudicial to them, including dismissal, based on their status or activities as workers' representatives or on union membership, or participation in union activities, in so far as they act in conformity with existing laws or collective agreements or other jointly agreed arrangements [see Digest, op. cit., para. ], the Committee urges the Government to inform it of the outcome of the court case in progress.
.In light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee invites the complainant to indicate whether it lodged an appeal against the decision of the Second Labour Court, dated  July .(b) The Committee requests the Government to provide detailed information on the anti-union practices observed by the Labour Inspectorate-General in firm A and to keep it informed of the outcome of the corresponding sanctions procedure, so as to ensure that the sanctions applied are sufficiently dissuasive as to guarantee the freedom of association of all the workers in the firm in question.(c) As to the dismissal of Mr Julio Csar Avils Oliva, Secretary-General of STSEL s branch in firm A, the Committee urges the Government to inform it of the outcome of the court case in progress.",0,2015,El Salvador
32,".The complaint was presented by the Trade Union Coordinating Body of El Salvador in communications dated  September and  November .
.The Government of El Salvador sent its observations on the allegations in two communications, dated  October  and  September .
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Workers' Representatives Convention,  (No. ), the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ), and the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  September , the Trade Union Coordinating Body of El Salvador states that it is presenting a complaint concerning the violation of the ILO Conventions on freedom of association and collective bargaining ratified by El Salvador on the grounds of numerous anti-union acts carried out against the Trade Union of Doctors of Rosales Hospital (SIMEHR), a hospital that is under the remit of the Ministry of Health (MINSAL).
.The complainant organization states that the SIMEHR, an organization that was established in , submitted on multiple occasions requests for compliance with Article  of Convention No.  in order to participate in the determination of the terms and conditions of employment of doctors at Rosales Hospital, which the SIMEHR considers to be abysmal, inhuman and inadequate.
.The SIMEHR states that, after it filed a series of complaints with a view to achieving a safe working environment with the necessary resources to provide adequate care for the hospital s patients, the director took retaliatory measures. According to the complainant, the aim of the measures was to harass and violate the rights of the trade union and its members, all under the complacent eye of the senior authorities of MINSAL and the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare.
.In this respect, the complainant organization alleges that the director of Rosales Hospital took a series of anti-union measures in  and , namely: (i) the arbitrary transfer of three doctors, who were in charge of the teaching units and who were also union officials; (ii) the workplace harassment and transfer of the former head of pathology, a union member, through the dissemination of falsified audit reports; (iii) labour rights violations and psychological harassment against a specialist in the pathology department, Dr Genoveva Ochoa, a union member, who, as a result, asked to be transferred to another hospital; and (iv) labour rights violations against the head of the research unit at Rosales Hospital, a union member, by forcing her immediate superior to adjust her performance appraisal downwards in retaliation for her participation in a protest against him.
.The complainant organization further alleges that the director of Rosales Hospital committed a series of violations of the trade union rights of officials and members of the union in  and , namely: (i) the unfair and arbitrary dismissal of union members, including the head of the intensive care unit and the head of otorhinolaryngology; (ii) the violation of the rights of Dr Alcides Gmez Hernndez, the general secretary of the union, by issuing him with a warning in  for reasons that he was never able to establish and by denying him the right to defence in the disciplinary proceedings; (iii) unwarranted searches of union members' belongings following a complaint in  that supplies had gone missing; (iv) the suspension of union member Dr Guillermo Reyes in  for refusing a police search, without him being given the opportunity to defend himself; and (vi) the refusal to grant union leave to union officials.
.The organization also alleges that, in June , a system for clocking in and out of the workplace exclusively through the use of biometric markers was unilaterally imposed, without the trade union being consulted, which was perceived to be an act of repression. The complainant organization further alleges that this practice goes against the grain of specialized medical care and trade union rights, as it contributes to the mechanization of medical care work. The complainant also states that all these measures are part of an ongoing pattern of mistreatment, workplace harassment, and supply and equipment shortages. The complainant organization states that, since the appointment of Dr Mauricio Ventura as director of Rosales Hospital, the SIMEHR has tried unsuccessfully to resolve these labour issues with the hospital director and with the MINSAL authorities. To this end, according to the complainant organization, it held meetings with several senior officials from MINSAL and from Rosales Hospital, without managing to find a solution to the labour issues being faced.
.The complainant organization alleges that the very tense situation created by these labour issues led to a decision by the Assembly of Doctors on  September  to reduce outpatient work, with the exception of certain critical specialities. The complainant organization states that it was only after the adoption of this measure that the authorities of MINSAL and the Office of the Human Rights Ombudsman (PDDH) decided to take action in this regard. Furthermore, the complainant organization states that, although the PDDH set up a table for dialogue and negotiation between the authorities of MINSAL and the medical specialists of Rosales Hospital, represented by the SIMEHR, no progress has been made, and it attributes this lack of progress to the political alignment of the PDDH and the personal ambitions of the Human Rights Ombudsman.
.The complainant organization states that, on  September , it was notified of a decision handed down by the First Labour Court of San Salvador declaring the strike staged by the SIMEHR since  September  to be unlawful and ordering the strikers to return to their respective posts. The complainant organization also states that, after an appeal brought before the same court was rejected, the SIMEHR filed, on  October , an application for amparo (protection of constitutional rights) before the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice, which, at the time of the presentation of the complaint in September , had not been settled. The complainant organization goes on to state that it was obliged to file an application for amparo with the Supreme Court because, under section  of the Labour Code, decisions concerning the determination of a strike or work stoppage are not open to appeal. The complainant alleges that this provision is contrary to international labour standards.
.The complainant organization further alleges that the dispute continued to escalate as a result of the retaliatory measures taken by the authorities of Rosales Hospital, namely: (i) wage deductions of  per cent were applied in July , even before the reduction of work began; (ii) wage deductions of  per cent were applied in August  and of over  per cent were applied in September and October  and from January to May ; (iii) criminal complaints were filed on  September , in other words the day after the reduction of work began, by the hospital director with the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic against the union s executive committee and  specialist doctors who were also union members, for the alleged offences of denial of health care (section  of the Criminal Code) and breach of duty (section  of the Criminal Code); (iv) complaints were filed with the First Labour Court by the hospital director against  specialist doctors, calling for the strike consisting of a reduction of work to be declared unlawful, with the First Labour Court declaring it unlawful on  September ; (v) acts of harassment were carried out by members of the political police on ,  and  September , who went to the homes of certain union members without showing identification to inform them that they were under investigation, with the aim of intimidating them; (vi) a one-day suspension from work was imposed on  chief medical specialists, the majority of whom are members of the union and its executive committee; and (vii) disciplinary proceedings with threats of dismissal were initiated against union officials and anyone who did not obey the orders of the hospital director. Furthermore, the complainant organization alleges that, from June  until at least the date on which this complaint was presented ( September ), the union members who participated in the strike have not been paid their wages and have not received social benefits or social security.
.The complainant also alleges that, in June , the director of Rosales Hospital filed an action with the First Civil and Commercial Court to dismiss union officials and union members, in violation of the ILO Conventions ratified by El Salvador.
.In its communication dated  November , the complainant organization alleges that the instruction document concerning the establishment and functioning of the labour relations roundtables of MINSAL (hereinafter  the instruction document' , which was adopted in August  and which provides for the establishment of a series of labour relations roundtables at the national, regional and local levels within El Salvador s public health system, as well as in every public hospital, constitutes a clear violation",1,2015,El Salvador
33,"of freedom of association, rather than fulfilling its stated purpose of improving the work climate and environment. The complainant organization states in particular that: (i) according to the recitals of the instruction document, labour relations roundtables are appropriate forums and mechanisms for dialogue, conciliation and agreement so that the issues that exist in every institution in respect of labour relations and the improvement of services can be addressed in a timely way; (ii) section  of the instruction document provides that the document will  also govern the procedure for the adoption of agreements and recommendations and the formal conditions for ensuring their validity and effective application'  (iii) according to section  of the instruction document, the national labour relations roundtable shall be composed of: one delegate from the Ministerial Office; one delegate from the Office of the Deputy Minister for Health Policies; one delegate from the Office of the Deputy Minister for Health Services; one delegate from the Office of General Operations Management; one Ministerial Legal Adviser; one delegate from every national trade union duly accredited by the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare; one delegate from every national association of employees or workers duly accredited by the Ministry of the Interior; and one or more delegates for employees that do not belong to a trade union organization, so that there is one such delegate for every delegate from a trade union or workers' association; and (iv) according to section  of the instruction document, the roundtable agendas are set unilaterally, as a number of requirements are imposed regarding the items that may be put forward by the representatives of the roundtables, such as the requirement that the items must benefit administrative management in the interests of the users of the network of public health establishments or the employees of these establishments, and must be viable from a technical and financial point of view.
.The complainant organization, after claiming that the instruction document was adopted without prior consultation with the trade unions, alleges that this instrument: (i) encourages the participation of representatives of workers who are not union members, to the detriment of trade unions; and (ii) violates the bipartite bargaining process by allowing the participation of elected representatives under employer control with a view to obtaining the majority of votes, thereby undermining the trade union s participation in the determination of terms and conditions of employment and in the settlement of disputes. The complainant organization concludes by stating that labour relations roundtables are a mechanism that will facilitate favouritism or hostility towards certain trade union organizations and undue interference by the public authorities in trade union activities.
.In its communication dated  October , the Government provides its observations on the complainant organization s allegations concerning the anti-union nature of the instruction document, stating that: (i) the aim is simply to establish forums and mechanisms that encourage dialogue, conciliation and agreement, and there is therefore no violation of trade union rights; (ii) the instruction document is not a law or a formal legislative act, but an instrument providing administrative support; and (iii) it neither replaces nor hinders dialogue with trade unions ' rather, it encourages trade union activity and strengthens protection against acts of interference. The Government adds that: (i) labour relations roundtables provide an opportunity to discuss problems and find solutions and in no way do they restrict trade union activity or prevent bipartite bargaining; (ii) the Government is not engaged in any collective bargaining and it refutes the complainant s allegations in that regard; and (iii) the Government encourages the inclusion of non-unionized workers in labour relations roundtables in accordance with the legislation in force.
.In its communication of  September , the Government presents its observations on the allegations that the director of Rosales Hospital carried out violation of rights and acts of repression against the SIMEHR trade union and its members, depriving them of their wages, social security, pension funds, social and economic benefits and union dues. In this respect, the Government states that such allegations are false and lack any factual and legal basis. Likewise, with regard to the complainant s allegations of deplorable and unsafe conditions in Rosales Hospital, including equipment and medicine shortages, while the Government acknowledges that resources are insufficient, it emphasizes that significant improvements have been made under the leadership of Dr Mauricio Ventura, the hospital director, such as, for example, a reduction in waiting times and a lower rate of medical supply shortages.
.The Government states that the complainant organization s allegations stem from the fact that the administrative authorities had launched administrative proceedings against staff members of Rosales Hospital for having refused to comply with the institutional regulations imposed on them concerning the clocking in and out of staff by biometric means. The Government states that the financial impact on their wages, their social security and their pension funds is due to the deductions that had to be made when they refused to comply with the requirement to register their attendance at work using a biometric clocking system. The Government states that this refusal led to findings of administrative misconduct that were handled in accordance with due process. The Government specifies that the findings of administrative misconduct also applied to union members, as the trade union guarantees they enjoy are not a shield that exempts them from their responsibilities or from following due process.
.With regard to the complainant organization's allegations that no headway has been made in the talks with the authorities of MINSAL and the PDDH aimed at establishing a dialogue and negotiation table, and that this has led to increased retaliation against the union's members and its executive committee through various anti-union acts, the Government states that, since the suspension of the meetings with the PDDH, no decision at all has been handed down against the director of Rosales Hospital for arbitrary acts, abuse of authority or unfair deductions. It follows, in the Government's view, that the institution responsible for the protection of labour rights investigated the allegations made by the complainant and found insufficient evidence and the PDDH has not requested further information on these cases either.
.The Government states that ensuring respect for the rights of users is a priority in El Salvador s public administration and that, with a view to improving the health services offered to its users, Rosales Hospital has set up its own institutional regulatory framework. The Government also states that the supervisory body that is competent to determine compliance with this regulatory framework is the Court of Auditors of the Republic, which assesses all activities, and if an unlawful wage deduction is detected, the Court will be responsible for ensuring the reimbursement of the money that has been deducted arbitrarily.
.The Government reiterates once again that the issues at Rosales Hospital arose as a result of the decision by the hospital authorities that, as of July , medical staff would have to register their attendance at work using a biometric system, in accordance with the provisions of section  of the regulations setting out the hospital s specific technical standards for internal oversight.
.The Government states that it was because of the refusal by several doctors to register their attendance using the biometric system when it was introduced in June  that a decision was taken to apply the relevant deductions to certain unionized doctors. The Government further states that the relevant evidence was submitted to the labour courts and arguments were put forward demonstrating that the doctors' claims were false, since, according to the documentary evidence submitted to the courts, all the procedures under the institutional regulations had been followed in making the deductions. The Government also provides the numbers of the cases brought before the Civil Service Courts, which contain details of the procedures followed in making the deductions.
.The Government states that the fact that some staff members at Rosales Hospital failed to apply the provisions of the regulatory framework is demonstrated by the final decision handed down by the Government Ethics Court on  October , a copy of which is annexed to its communication. In this decision,  doctors were found to be responsible for failing to comply with section (d) of the Government Ethics Act, which prohibits the holding of two or more incompatible posts in the public sector.
.With regard to the allegations concerning the written warnings given to union members, the Government explains that the issuance of such warnings is provided for in section  of the Civil Service Act. The Government adds that the power and the competence to issue this type of warning lies with the immediate superiors, as is provided for in the Act, and that such warnings are a tool to prevent anarchy from a work and administrative point of view. The Government also states that only the immediate superior can issue a written warning and that the steps leading to the issuance of the warnings were approved by the Civil Service Court in the corresponding proceedings. Specifically with regard to the disciplinary proceedings",-1,2015,El Salvador
34,"initiated by the hospital director against Dr Alcides Gmez Hernndez, the general secretary of the SIMEHR union, and the acts of discrimination against him, the Government states that, in this case, a court decision has already been handed down in favour of Rosales Hospital, establishing that the proceedings were lawful and that the relevant institutional regulations were duly applied.
.With regard to the complainant s allegations concerning the arbitrary deductions of wages, social security, pension funds and economic and social benefits that were applied to union officials and union members, the Government states that, in the various court cases that have been brought against the director of Rosales Hospital, decisions have been handed down that are favourable to the interests of the institution.
.With regard to the complainant s allegations that union leave has not been granted to union members, the Government states that requests for such leave are processed by MINSAL and that the trade unions that have requested such leave have been granted it without any problem. However, the Government states that the SIMEHR has not taken any steps to request such leave and it cannot provide any evidence of a decision rejecting a request for time off for union purposes as it has never made such a request. Furthermore, the Government states that the members of the complainant organization hold their general assemblies on days and at the time of their own choosing and do not request permission from their immediate supervisors to be absent from their workplaces.
.With regard to the establishment of labour relations roundtables in the context of Rosales Hospital, the Government states that the majority of the hospital s employees are not members of the SIMEHR, which has a membership of  doctors, whereas the hospital has a total of , public servants. The Government adds that the workers who are not union members have their own mechanism for election to and participation in the establishment of labour relations roundtables. The Government also states that Rosales Hospital is merely a user of the instruction document in question and was not involved in drafting it.
.With regard to the dismissal action brought by the director of Rosales Hospital against union members and union officials, the Government alleges that all public servants possess the constitutional power to bring legal action when they detect a possible violation and that failure to do so constitutes a breach of that constitutional duty. Therefore, according to the Government, bringing legal proceedings against union members and union officials does not in itself constitute a violation of the labour rights of union members, as, in the Government s view, trade union membership does not mean that union members are free not to meet their work obligations.
.With regard to the complainant s allegation concerning the complaints of manifest injustice filed with the Civil Service Court, the Government states that the Court reported that, in ,  and , it received  complaints of manifest injustice from doctors working at Rosales Hospital and that the proceedings had been completed, according to a report submitted by the Civil Service Court at the time the Government submitted the present communication.
.With regard to union members not being paid their wages as from July  because of their participation in the strike, the Government states that the court hearing the case ruled that the deductions were applied to the employees in accordance with the legal provisions and that the administrative process allowing for the non-payment of these wages was carried out in compliance with the guarantees of due process. Accordingly, the court found that the manifest injustice action brought by the union members was without merit.
.With regard to the dismissal action brought in June  against union officials and union members, the Government states that this action has now been closed and filed, as the First Civil and Commercial Court before which the action was brought found that it had no jurisdiction and the action was dismissed. The Government also states that the fact that the hospital director initiated the dismissal action does not in itself mean that any trade union rights were violated, but rather that the hospital director applied the principle of legality enshrined in article  of the Constitution of El Salvador.
.The Committee notes that, in the present case, the complainant organization alleges that a series of anti-union acts were committed between  and  by a public hospital against the officials and members of a trade union of doctors, the SIMEHR, before and after a strike was staged in September  demanding the modification of the system for monitoring the attendance of medical staff by means of biometric markers that was introduced in the hospital in June . The Committee notes that the complainant organization also alleges that the instruction document adopted in August , which provides for equal representation between trade union representatives and representatives of non-unionized workers, facilitates interference by the public authorities in the representation of workers and undermines the rights of trade union organizations, including in respect of collective bargaining.
.The Committee notes that, for its part, the Government states that: (i) the acts against the officials and members of the SIMEHR alleged by the complainant organization are not anti-union in nature but are the result of the failure by some doctors to apply the hospital s regulations, notably the system for monitoring attendance using biometric markers; (ii) the strike staged in September  was declared unlawful by the courts, which, in accordance with the regulations in force, carried a number of implications for the doctors who took part in it; and (iii) the Ministry of Health s instruction document of August  creating labour relations roundtables encourages consultation with both the trade unions in the health sector and the representatives of non-unionized workers and therefore does not undermine dialogue with the trade unions.
.The Committee notes that the complainant organization alleges first of all that, between  and , a series of anti-union acts were carried out against the officials and members of the SIMEHR, including, inter alia: (i) the arbitrary transfer of three doctors who were union officials and of two others who were members of the union; (ii) the issuance of unfounded warnings to Dr Alcides Gmez Hernndez, the general secretary of the union, without giving him the opportunity to defend himself; (iii) the dismissal of the head of the intensive care unit and the head of otorhinolaryngology; (iv) the suspension of Dr Guillermo Reyes, a union member, in , for having refused a police search; and (v) the denial of requests for union leave made under the instruction document and to the director of Rosales Hospital in order to enable officials of the SIMEHR to carry out their union activities. With regard to this first set of allegations, the Committee notes that the Government states that: (i) having the status of a trade union official does not constitute a shield that exempts that person from responsibility for any misconduct that they might commit; (ii) the disciplinary proceedings against the general secretary of the trade union were the subject of legal action and concluded with a decision in favour of Rosales Hospital, which found that the disciplinary proceedings were in accordance with the law and that the institutional regulations were duly applied; and (iii) although trade union leave can be requested without any problem under the instruction document, the SIMEHR has not requested such leave, which has not prevented union members from holding assemblies without the permission of their superiors.
.With regard to the granting of trade union leave to the SIMEHR, the Committee, while noting the differing versions of events given by the parties, takes note of the document provided by the Government containing a notification addressed to the complainant organization, dated  February , in which its representatives are invited to a second meeting for the granting of trade union leave. On the basis of the foregoing, the Committee trusts that the SIMEHR is able to enjoy the trade union leave to which it is entitled and it will therefore not pursue the examination of this allegation.
.With regard to the allegations concerning a series of specific acts that were carried out between  and  against certain officials and members of the SIMEHR, the Committee, while taking due note of the Government s reply concerning the confirmation by the courts of the lawfulness of the warning issued to the general secretary of the trade union, observes that: (i) neither the reference number nor the text of the above-mentioned court decision has been provided; and (ii) the Government has not provided a response concerning the other specific acts alleged by the complainant organization. Recalling that the Government is responsible for preventing all acts of anti-union discrimination and it must ensure that complaints of anti-union discrimination are examined in the framework of national procedures which should be prompt, impartial and considered as such by the parties concerned [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, para. ], the",0,2015,El Salvador
35,"Committee requests the Government to ensure that, from now on, any allegations of anti-union acts in the hospital in question are promptly followed up by effective investigations by the competent authorities so as to guarantee full respect for freedom of association within the hospital.
.The Committee also notes that the complainant organization also alleges that, due to the opposition of the SIMEHR to the unilateral implementation in June  of a biometric attendance monitoring system and the impossibility of engaging in a constructive dialogue with the hospital management and the Office of the Human Rights Ombudsman, the trade union was forced to carry out a partial work stoppage as from  September . The Committee notes that the complainant organization states that the dispute over biometric attendance monitoring led to an escalation of anti-union acts against the SIMEHR, alleging in particular that: (i) union members were subject to a wage deduction of  per cent in July ; (ii) wage deductions of  per cent were imposed in August  and of more than  per cent in September and October  and from January to May ; (iii) in retaliation for the reduction of work, the hospital director filed criminal complaints against the union s executive committee and  specialist doctors, who are themselves members of the union, as well as complaints before the First Labour Court against  specialist doctors; (iv) a total of  chief medical specialists, the majority of whom are also members of the union and its executive committee, were suspended from work for one day; (v) the doctors who participated in the work stoppage were harassed by members of the political police on ,  and  September , with the aim of intimidating them; and (vi) in June , disciplinary proceedings with threats of dismissal were initiated against union officials and all those who did not obey the orders of the hospital director.
.The Committee notes that the complainant organization adds that the work stoppage was declared unlawful by a decision of the First Labour Court of  September , that the Labour Code provides that the Court s decision is not open to appeal and that the amparo action brought in this respect before the Supreme Court was pending at the time of submission of the present complaint.
.The Committee notes that, for its part, the Government states that: (i) the financial impact on wages, social security and pension funds mentioned in the complaint is due to the deductions that had to be applied to staff members who refused to comply with the requirement to register their attendance at work using the biometric clocking system; (ii) this refusal led to findings of administrative misconduct against staff, whether union members or not, which were handled in accordance with due process; (iii) in the different court cases that have been brought against the director of Rosales Hospital with respect to the aforementioned deductions, decisions have been handed down that are favourable to the interests of the institution; (iv) in its final decision of  October , the Government Ethics Court found that  doctors at the hospital were responsible for failing to comply with the Government Ethics Act, which prohibits the holding of two or more incompatible posts in the public sector; (v) a court heard the case concerning the non-payment of the wages of union members for having participated in the strike and ruled that the deductions were applied to the employees in accordance with the legal provisions and that the administrative process allowing for the non-payment of these wages was carried out in compliance with the guarantees of due process; and (vi) the dismissal action brought in June  against union officials and union members has now been closed and filed, as the First Civil and Commercial Court before which the action was brought declared itself incompetent and the action was dismissed. The Committee takes due note of the information provided by the parties in relation to the dispute arising from the introduction in June  of the biometric monitoring of staff attendance. The Committee wishes to recall first of all that its mandate consists in determining whether any given legislation or practice complies with the principles of freedom of association and collective bargaining laid down in the relevant Conventions [see Compilation, para. ]. It is therefore not within its competence to examine the merits and suitability of the biometric attendance monitoring system introduced by the hospital, as it is not alleged that such a system had the purpose or effect of infringing freedom of association. Noting, however, that the Government does not object to the allegation that the new attendance monitoring system was introduced unilaterally, the Committee emphasizes that it has recalled the importance of consulting all trade union organizations concerned on matters affecting their interests or those of their members [see Compilation, para. ]. The Committee therefore invites the Government to take the necessary steps to establish a framework for constructive dialogue between the trade unions present in the hospital and the hospital management and the Office of the Human Rights Ombudsman on matters affecting their interests or those of their members.
.With regard to the deductions of wages after the entry into force of the attendance monitoring system and prior to the strike action, while regretting that it has not received the text of the rulings referred to by the Government, the Committee trusts that these rulings have ensured that the deductions have been applied objectively, irrespective of the trade union membership or union activity of the hospital workers.
.With regard to the partial strike staged from  July , the Committee recalls that the right to strike is one of the essential means through which workers and their organizations may promote and defend their economic and social interests [see Compilation, para. ]. Nevertheless, the Committee recalls that it has considered that the right to strike may be restricted or prohibited: () in the public service only for public servants exercising authority in the name of the State; or () in essential services in the strict sense of the term (that is, services the interruption of which would endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population) [see Compilation, para. ] and that, in this regard, it has considered that the hospital sector may be considered to be an essential service [see Compilation, para. ]. Lastly, the Committee recalls that salary deductions for days of strike give rise to no objection from the point of view of freedom of association principles [see Compilation, para. ]. With regard to the allegation that court decisions on the lawfulness of a strike cannot be challenged, the Committee notes that the SIMEHR did file an application for amparo before the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice and trusts that this matter has been resolved promptly and in conformity with the principles of freedom of association.
.With regard to the complainant organization s allegations concerning a series of reprisals following the strike action, the Committee notes that the Government states that it stopped pursuing the dismissal actions after the court hearing the case found it had no jurisdiction, and that these cases have been closed and filed. The Committee regrets to note, however, that the Government has not provided its observations on the allegations of criminal proceedings against  officials and members of the SIMEHR and the other legal actions mentioned by the complainant organization. While emphasizing the importance of conducting legitimate trade union activities in a peaceful manner, the Committee considers that the criminalization of industrial relations is in no way conducive to harmonious and peaceful industrial relations [see Compilation, para. ]. On the basis of the foregoing, the Committee trusts that the various criminal and legal actions arising from the strike action mentioned by the complainant organization have been brought to a close. The Committee also invites the Government to take the necessary steps to establish a framework for constructive dialogue between the hospital and the various trade union organizations present in the hospital.
.Furthermore, the Committee notes that the complainant organization claims that the instruction document violates the principles of freedom of association in that: (i) it encourages acts of interference by supporting the representation of workers who are not members of a trade union and who answer to MINSAL, to the detriment of trade unions; and (ii) it violates the bipartite bargaining process by allowing a majority to be obtained as a result of the participation of elected representatives under employer control, thereby undermining the trade union s participation in the determination of terms and conditions of employment and in the settlement of disputes through labour relations roundtables. The Committee also notes that the Government, for its part, stated that the instruction document: (i) aims to establish labour relations roundtables, which are forums and mechanisms that encourage dialogue, conciliation and agreement; (ii) is not a formal legislative act, but merely an instrument that provides administrative support; (iii) allows for",0,2015,El Salvador
36,"the participation of all workers in labour relations roundtables, including those who are not members of a trade union organization, in accordance with the legislation in force, without restricting trade union activity; and (iv) does not affect collective bargaining with trade union organizations.
.The Committee takes due note of these various points. The Committee notes that the above-mentioned instruction document, which was adopted in August , establishes a number of labour relations roundtables at the national, regional and local levels within the public health system of El Salvador, as well as in every public hospital. The Committee notes in particular that: (i) section  of the instruction document provides for equal representation in the labour relations roundtables between trade union representatives and (elected) representatives of non-unionized workers; and (ii) section  of the instruction document ""also governs the procedure for the adoption of agreements and recommendations and the formal conditions for ensuring their validity and effective application"", and that section  stipulates that ""[t]he members of the labour relations roundtables shall try to reach consensus on recommendations and agreements concerning the determination of measures, actions or terms and conditions relating to the performance of work of MINSAL staff"". While noting that the parties have not provided comprehensive data on the rate of trade union membership in the public health sector, the Committee further notes that: (i) the instruction document does not provide for or make reference to representativeness mechanisms that would ensure that the number of seats given to the different workers' representatives at labour relations roundtables is proportionate to the support they have from staff; (ii) the instruction document establishes that the delegates representing non-unionized employees shall be elected by the assembly of non-unionized employees, and therefore it does not provide for a mechanism allowing trade union organizations to try to obtain the votes of non-unionized workers; and (iii) the Government does not mention other platforms through which it negotiates exclusively with trade union organizations in the public health sector or the existence of collective bargaining agreements signed with unions in this sector.
.The Committee considers that the various points highlighted in the preceding paragraph should be taken into consideration when examining the complainant organization's allegations that the instruction document enables the public authorities to interfere in the representation of workers in the public health sector and undermines bipartite collective bargaining with trade union organizations in the sector. In this regard, the Committee recalls that measures should be taken to encourage and promote the full development and utilization of machinery for voluntary negotiation between employers or employers' organizations and workers' organizations, with a view to the regulation of terms and conditions of employment by means of collective agreements [see Compilation, para. ]. Noting also that El Salvador has ratified Convention No. , the Committee recalls that Article  of this Convention provides that ""[w]here there exist in the same undertaking both trade union representatives and elected representatives, appropriate measures shall be taken, wherever necessary, to ensure that the existence of elected representatives is not used to undermine the position of the trade unions concerned or their representatives and to encourage co-operation on all relevant matters between the elected representatives and the trade unions concerned and their representatives'  In view of the above, the Committee requests the Government, in consultation with the most representative trade union organizations in the sector, to take the necessary measures to ensure that the instruction document is revised so that dialogue with elected workers' representatives does not undermine the position of the trade union organizations and is not carried out to the detriment of the collective bargaining processes with these organizations.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to ensure from now on that any allegations of anti-union acts in the hospital in question are promptly followed up by effective investigations by the competent authorities so as to ensure full respect for freedom of association within the hospital.(b) The Committee invites the Government to take the necessary steps to establish a framework for constructive dialogue between the trade unions present in the hospital and the hospital management and the Office of the Human Rights Ombudsman on matters affecting their interests or those of their members.(c) Concerning the wage deductions for non-compliance with the attendance monitoring system, the Committee trusts that the courts have ensured that such deductions are applied objectively, irrespective of the trade union membership or union activity of the hospital workers.(d) The Committee trusts that the amparo action brought by the SIMEHR before the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice has been resolved promptly and in conformity with the principles of freedom of association.(e) The Committee trusts that the various criminal and legal actions arising from the strike action mentioned by the complainant organization have been brought to a close. The Committee also invites the Government to take the necessary steps to establish a framework for constructive dialogue between the hospital and the trade union organizations present in the hospital.(f) The Committee requests the Government, in consultation with the most representative trade union organizations in the sector, to take the necessary measures to revise the instruction document concerning the establishment and functioning of the labour relations roundtables of the Ministry of Health so that dialogue with elected workers' representatives does not undermine the position of the trade union organizations and is not carried out to the detriment of the collective bargaining processes with these organizations.(g) The Committee considers that this case does not call for further examination and is closed.",1,2015,El Salvador
37,".The Committee last examined this case at its October  meeting and on that occasion made the following recommendations [see th Report, para. ]:(a)	The Committee requests the Government, should the definitive acquittal of Ms Samayoa be confirmed, to provide information on reimbursement of the deduction corresponding to the period she spent in preventive custody.(b)	As regards the allegations of anti-union discrimination against Ms Samayoa, the Committee requests the Government to carry out an investigation to examine the allegations, inviting the complainant to provide the Government with any details and evidence at its disposal. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.(c)	As regards the allegations of anti-union discrimination against Ms Navarrete de Cantn, the Committee invites the complainant organization to provide the Government with any details and evidence at its disposal to enable the Government to conduct an investigation, failing which the Committee will not pursue its examination of this allegation.(d)	The Committee invites the Government to promote social dialogue between the complainant organization and the health service authorities concerned, with a view to addressing the question of trade union leave and promoting harmonious collective relations.
.In its communication dated  March , the Government indicates that on  May , the Suchitoto Court of First Instance dismissed the proceedings against Ms Samayoa. As regards the deduction corresponding to the period she spent in preventive custody, the Government indicates that before it can assess any potential reimbursement, Ms Samayoa must submit a written request for reimbursement along with the respective judicial decision dismissing the proceedings against her. The Government indicates that although Ms Samayoa did not submit a written request, she was reimbursed the equivalent of one day, five hours and  minutes of the four days on which her pay was allegedly deducted, having provided supporting evidence according to the institution s internal administrative mechanisms.
.As regards the Committee s request to carry out an investigation to examine the allegations of anti-union discrimination against Ms Samayoa, the Government indicates that although its domestic legislation prohibits labour-related investigations at public institutions, on  November  an inspection was carried out in exercise of the powers granted to the General Directorate for Labour Inspection under the Workplace Risk Prevention Act. The Government indicates that the inspection report states that infractions relating to occupational safety and health were observed and that a follow-up inspection report dated  March  shows that those infractions had been rectified.
.As regards the action taken by the Government to promote social dialogue between the complainant organization and the health service authorities concerned with a view to addressing the question of trade union leave and promoting harmonious collective relations, the Government indicates that the hospital director had not granted trade union leave because the documentation confirming the composition of the executive committees and the respective identity cards had not been submitted to the hospital. The Government indicates that the hospital director did not know why this documentation had not been submitted to the hospital, and that once the corresponding documentation had been received, trade union leave would be granted. The Government also referred to a set of measures adopted in  to strengthen spaces for dialogue, conciliation, consultation and the resolution of labour issues.
.The Committee takes note of the information supplied by the Government in relation to Ms Samayoa and observes that, although the proceedings against her were dismissed, of the four days she spent in preventive custody, she was reimbursed the equivalent of one day, five hours and  minutes, having provided supporting evidence according to the institution s internal administrative mechanisms. In that respect, the Committee expects that, according to the Government s indication, if Ms Samayoa were to provide supporting evidence according to the hospital s internal administrative mechanisms (a written request with a copy of the decision dismissing the proceedings against her), she would be reimbursed in full for the deduction corresponding to the period she spent in preventive custody.
.As regards the Committee s request that an investigation be carried out to examine the allegations of anti-union discrimination against Ms Samayoa, the Committee notes with regret that the Government merely indicates that its domestic legislation prohibits labour related investigations at public institutions and refers only to an inspection relating to occupational safety and health. The Committee recalls that where cases of alleged antiunion discrimination are involved, the competent authorities dealing with labour issues should begin an inquiry immediately and take suitable measures to remedy any effects of anti-union discrimination brought to their attention [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ]. The Committee notes, however, that the complainant organization has not provided the Government with information to facilitate the investigation. In these circumstances, the Committee trusts that the complainant organization will provide the Government with the necessary information so that, in case there are pending issues in this regard, the Government will carry out the corresponding investigation.
.The Committee also recalls that it had invited the complainant organization to provide the Government with details and evidence to facilitate the investigation in relation to the allegations of anti-union discrimination against Ms Navarrete de Cantn and that, failing this, the Committee would not pursue its examination of these allegations. Given that the Government does not mention in its communications whether it has received these details from the complainant and since the complainant has not submitted any details for the Committee s attention, these allegations will not be examined further.
.Finally, as regards the measures to promote social dialogue with a view to addressing the question of trade union leave and promoting harmonious collective relations, the Committee notes that the Government: (i) indicates that trade union leave had not been granted because the corresponding documentation confirming the role of the trade union officials had not been submitted to the hospital and that, once this documentation was submitted, the corresponding trade union leave would be granted; and (ii) cites a set of measures adopted in  to strengthen spaces for dialogue, conciliation, consultation and the resolution of labour issues. Although it observes that most of these measures had been adopted before the complaint was presented, the Committee trusts that these measures have helped strengthen harmonious labour relations and that the Government will continue to promote social dialogue between the complainant and the health service authorities concerned.
.The complaint is contained in communications dated  May and  July  from the Union of Health Workers (SITRASALUD).
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  May .
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Workers' Representatives Convention,  (No. ), and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communications of  May and  July , the Union of Health Workers (SITRASALUD) denounces the refusal of the authorities to register a branch of the union, to authorize a reform of the union s constitution changing the status of the organization and to register its executive committee, and also reports the detention of a trade unionist and acts of anti-union discrimination.
.The complainant organization alleges that on  November  it applied for registration of the executive committee of a branch of the trade union at the Dr Jos Molina Martnez National Psychiatric Hospital, with the aim of establishing a branch of SITRASALUD at the hospital. In reply to the application, the authorities called for the submission of copies of individual identity documents and payslips of the members of the branch. These documents were duly submitted (even though the complainant considered that these were unlawful requirements since they were not laid down in the union constitution or by law). Nevertheless, by a decision of  November , the Labour Organizations Department at the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare rejected the application for registration of the union branch with the observation that the members were public servants and there was no provision for establishing branches in public service unions or any possibility for unions of private-sector workers to have branches constituted by public servants.
.The complainant organization explains that, in view of the rejection of the application, the union s general assembly approved a reform of the union constitution, agreeing to change the status of the union ' from a union governed by the Labour Code to a union having public status. SITRASALUD adds that such reforms had been approved for other trade unions from  with the entry into force of Conventions Nos , ,  and  in El Salvador (the complainant supplies detailed information and documentation on the approval of these reforms and changes of status for other trade union organizations). However, the complainant reports that the Labour Organizations Department, by a decision of  April , rejected its request to change its status. Further to this decision, the trade union lodged an appeal on  April , alleging violations of the principle of equality and",0,2015,El Salvador
38,"of freedom of association. Moreover, the complainant reports that the Ministry of Labour suggested that the complainant organization should dissolve itself and form a new union, whereas SITRASALUD considers it unacceptable that a request to reform its union constitution, which had been granted to other unions, was rejected.
.Furthermore, the complainant reports that on  July  the Labour Organizations Department issued a decision rejecting the application for registration of the new executive committee of SITRASALUD, which had been elected by the general assembly that took place on  June .
.With regard to allegations of anti-union discrimination, the complainant organization denounces the fact that in September , after organizing trade union activity involving a four-hour cut in working hours in the administrative area of the national hospital in Suchitoto, the hospital director filed a complaint for deprivation of freedom against Ms Nora Samayoa, the general secretary of the union branch at the Suchitoto hospital. As a result of this complaint, the national civil police arrested and detained Ms Samayoa, who was subsequently released. The complainant also alleges that despite the fact that the Suchitoto Court of First Instance ordered a stay of proceedings in favour of Ms Samayoa, pay deductions were made on  February  for the days when Ms Samayoa was in custody. The complainant further alleges that other illegal deductions were made from Ms Samayoa s salary, with a double deduction for  January  ' the day when she was summoned by the Public Prosecutor s Office on the grounds that she had failed to provide notification of her absence, though in fact she had done so, according to SITRASALUD.
.The complainant organization adds that since her release Ms Samayoa has been the victim of workplace harassment by the hospital director, claiming that the director refuses to grant her trade union leave, places notes on her file without bringing them to her attention or discussing them with her, makes the human resources staff draft notes containing untruths with regard to Ms Samayoa and publicly accuses the union and its officers of working against the institution. Furthermore, the complainant denounces the fact that Ms Samayoa was demoted in retaliation for holding trade union office.
.The complainant organization further alleges that since  March  the general secretary of SITRASALUD, Ms Ana Silvia Navarrete de Cantn, has been subjected to workplace harassment on account of her union activity, being threatened with pay cuts and dismissal. The complainant indicates that in May  a pay cut was made ' even though she had submitted her work attendance cards and had been duly authorized to undertake union activities since  ' in violation of the agreements signed with the union, leaving her with a salary of only US$..
.The complainant organization also alleges that officials in various departments of the Ministry of Health refuse to grant union leave to branch officers on the grounds that they lack the relevant credentials, whereas they have been denied these documents by the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare.
.Lastly, the complainant organization alleges that on  June  it requested the Minister of Health to grant leave to enable its members to attend the general assembly for the election of the executive committee on  June  but that this had not been granted as of the date of presentation of the complaint.
.In its communication of  May , the Government sent its observations in response to the allegations of the complainant organization.
.As regards the allegations of violation of freedom of association and discriminatory treatment in refusing to accept the reform of the union constitution and the change in the status of SITRASALUD, the Government admits that, while the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare in previous years had allowed other trade unions (the General Union of Health Ministry Employees of El Salvador (SIGESAL), the Union of Nursing Professionals, Technicians and Auxiliaries of El Salvador (SIGPTESS), and the Rural, Urban and Peri-urban Education Teachers' Union of El Salvador (SIMEDUCO)) to reform their rules and modify their class and status, in April  it refused the request made by SITRASALUD to change its status from private to public. The Government explains that this decision was based on the finding that in the legal, institutional and jurisprudential context there was no possibility to modify the status of a trade union. The Government also states that the appeal against the decision was rejected by the Labour Organizations Department. Nevertheless, the Government explains that the rejection of the change in status ' since it lay outside the scope of the applicable regulations ' did not deprive the complainant of the possibility of satisfying its claim through other channels. Accordingly, the Government states that on  October , SITRASALUD composed of public servants was established, and was granted legal personality by a decision of  December . The Government also states that SITRASALUD of private status is maintained. The Government therefore considers that the complainant s allegation is unfounded and also denies that the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare suggested that the union should dissolve itself in order to establish a new union.
.The Government further indicates, in general terms, that after the reform of the National Constitution in  ' which recognized the right of freedom of association for public officials, public employees and municipal employees ' the Government had the difficult task of adjusting the respective administrative procedures and, with a view to speeding up claims in the sector, the change of status from private to public was permitted between  and . The Government also states that the decision was taken to establish new institutional guidelines and criteria relating to the approval of reforms of trade union constitutions in order to ensure uniformity of reasoning in decisions issued by the Labour Organizations Department from  onwards, the objective being to achieve consistency with the regulations in force and to uphold trade union rights.
.As regards the allegation of refusal to register the executive committee of the union branch at the Dr Jos Molina Martnez National Psychiatric Hospital requested in November , the Government indicates that there is provision for the establishment of branches for private unions in enterprises but not for state institutions, since the collective rights of public servants do not cover this possibility. The Government explains that the registration of executive committees is a regulated function of the administration and not a discretionary act, and that the requirement to submit individual identity documents and payslips is not an arbitrary or illegal criterion but a mechanism for verifying compliance with the requirements laid down in the Labour Code.
.As regards the allegation of refusal to renew the executive committee of the complainant organization elected on  July , the Government indicates that on  August  the union submitted a request that was rejected when it proved to be a case of public servants who were members of a private union. The Government states that the  private' SITRASALUD nevertheless resolved the problem of lack of leadership by holding an extraordinary assembly on  December  and submitting the relevant documentation to the Labour Organizations Department, which then registered the executive committee. The  public' SITRASALUD was established on  October  and its executive committee was registered on  February .
.As regards the alleged detention of Ms Samayoa, the Government indicates that, as the police record of  September  shows, Ms Samayoa s arrest was due to a complaint that she committed the offence of depriving the director of the national hospital of Suchitoto of her freedom. The Government explains that Ms Samayoa was released on  October , four days after she was arrested, with the imposition of non-custodial measures obliging her to appear before the Court of First Instance and forbidding her to change residence during the proceedings or to communicate with certain persons, including the victim, except on work-related matters. The Government adds that a preliminary hearing was held on  February , where a stay of proceedings in favour of Ms Samayoa was ordered, as a result of which the non-custodial measures were revoked ' reserving for one year the prosecutor s right to reopen the proceedings if fresh evidence emerged (the Government indicates that it was unaware of the latter scenario, since after one year a definitive acquittal would be issued where possible).
.As regards the allegations of anti-union discrimination, the Government states that, according to the information supplied by the director of the Suchitoto national hospital: (i)  members of SITRASALUD work at this institution and no complaints of any kind have ever been received; Ms Samayoa is the only person who has claimed to be a victim of harassment; (ii) the deductions from Ms Samayoa s salary were justified and carried out in accordance with the national legislation; (iii) union leave could not be granted to Ms Samayoa since she did not submit any credentials issued by the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare accrediting her as branch general secretary; (iv) as regards",0,2015,El Salvador
39,"the notes placed on file, it is untrue that Ms Samayoa was not notified; and (v) as regards the allegations accusing the hospital director of drawing up notes containing untruths and publicly denigrating the union, the hospital director indicated that she was unaware of these accusations and claimed that there was no evidence in this respect. Furthermore, as regards the allegation of a double pay deduction imposed on Ms Samayoa ' when she was summoned to the Public Prosecutor s Office ' the Government indicates that this was done in accordance with the national legislation since at no time did she report her absence or submit any documentation to justify it.
.As regards the allegation of pay deductions imposed on Ms Samayoa in relation to her four days in custody, the Government indicates that these were effected in accordance with the regulations in force, including article  of the Labour Code, which provides that  where non-attendance at work is due to detention of the worker by order of the authorities followed by legal proceedings in which a penalty is imposed, such non-attendance shall not be considered justified' 
.As regards the allegations of demotion of Ms Samayoa in retaliation for her trade union activities, the Government states that, by virtue of an inspection record issued by the Medical Profession Board of Control, it was established that Ms Samayoa was not authorized to undertake professional duties in the area of social work to which she was assigned. Consequently, the Medical Profession Board of Control, at its meeting of  November , ordered the hospital management to assign Ms Samayoa to different duties.
.As regards the allegations of workplace harassment, threats and pay deductions relating to SITRASALUD general secretary, Ms Navarrete de Cantn, the Government indicates that, according to the information supplied by the Ministry of Health, there is no evidence of workplace harassment or threats against Ms Navarrete de Cantn and, since the complainant does not provide any details or identify any person(s) who supposedly carried out such actions, it is difficult to supply precise information in turn. As regards the allegation of unjustified deductions, the Government indicates that Ms Navarrete de Cantn brought a claim in October  before the Civil Service Tribunal alleging unjustified pay deductions and a ruling was issued on  October  dismissing the claim on the following grounds: it had been established that the deduction (relating to May ) was made on the basis of internal administrative procedures; the employee did not provide any credentials for the trade union office she claimed to occupy; she did not show that she had obtained any leave from the hospital director; and she failed to provide any justification for her absence from work in March, April and May .
.As regards the allegation that leave was not granted to the officers of union branches, the Government indicates that for such leave to be granted the person concerned must make the relevant application accompanied by the credentials issued by the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare. It is not possible for trade union leave to be granted without the person concerned formally accrediting his/her position as union officer; otherwise the authorities would risk a reprimand from the Court of Auditors for authorizing unjustified absences.
.As regards the allegation that leave was not granted for attending the ordinary general assembly for the election of the executive committee on  June , the Government points out that the allegation is unfounded since by official communication of  June  the Health Minister authorized paid leave for the members of SITRASALUD so that they could attend the general assembly (the Government forwards documents with the respective authorizations issued to the trade union and to the various hospitals concerned).
.The Committee observes that the complaint is concerned with allegations of the Government s refusal to register a branch of a trade union, to authorize a reform of the union constitution modifying its status and to register its executive committee, and also allegations of the detention of a trade union officer, refusal to grant trade union leave and anti-union discrimination against union officers.
.The Committee observes that the complainant organization denounces the Government s refusal to register a trade union branch in November , to approve the change in union status from private to public adopted by reform of its constitution in April  and to register its executive committee in August . While duly noting the difficulties faced by the complainant in this process of change and noting with regret the resulting temporary lack of leadership, the Committee also recognizes the problems indicated by the Government concerning the absence of legal mechanisms for changing organizational forms that are subject to different sets of regulations. The Committee appreciates that, according to the Government s indications, the complainant s wishes could nevertheless be satisfied through the establishment of a new union with the same name composed of public servants and that, also according to the Government s indications, the current executive committees of both unions (public and private) are registered, and so the problem of lack of leadership appears to have been resolved. Moreover, the Committee notes the Government s statement that it decided to adopt new institutional guidelines and criteria for approving reforms of trade union constitutions, with a view to ensuring consistency with current regulations and upholding trade union rights. The Committee expects that this process will be completed in consultation with the most representative organizations and will enable the issue of establishing branches in unions of public servants to be addressed, and also trusts that the adopted guidelines and criteria will be in full conformity with the principles of freedom of association. The Committee recalls that the right to official recognition through legal registration is an essential facet of the right to organize since that is the first step that workers' or employers' organizations must take in order to be able to function efficiently, and represent their members adequately (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth edition, , para. ).
.The Committee observes that the complainant organization also denounces the detention of a trade unionist, her exposure to discrimination and harassment, and other acts of anti-union discrimination against union members and officers, including pay deductions and refusals of union leave.
.As regards the allegation of the detention of Ms Samayoa, the Committee observes that, according to the Government, the trade unionist was released four days after her arrest, on  October , with the imposition of non-custodial measures, that on  February  a stay of proceedings was ordered in favour of Ms Samayoa, as a result of which the aforementioned measures were revoked, and that since one year has elapsed since the stay of proceedings, a definitive acquittal should be issued.
.As regards the allegation of pay deductions imposed on Ms Samayoa in relation to her four days in custody, the Committee observes that one of the regulations cited by the Government to justify such deductions applies in the case of  legal proceedings in which a penalty is imposed' on the person concerned. The Committee requests the Government, in the case that the definitive acquittal of Ms Samayoa is confirmed, to provide information on reimbursement of the deduction corresponding to the period she spent in preventive custody.
.As regards the allegation of the anti-union demotion of Ms Samayoa, the Committee notes the explanations and documents supplied by the Government indicating that, as a result of the inspection proceedings conducted by the Medical Profession Board of Control at the hospital, establishing that this person did not have the necessary qualifications to perform the duties assigned to her, the Board ordered a change in her duties.
.As regards the other allegations of anti-union discrimination and harassment against Ms Samayoa, the Committee observes that there are discrepancies in the accounts of the facts provided by the complainant and the Government and that most of the declarations made by the Government to deny the allegations are based on information supplied by the hospital director, who was accused of carrying out these acts. The Committee therefore requests the Government to carry out an investigation to examine the allegations, inviting the complainant to provide the Government with any details and evidence at its disposal to facilitate the investigation. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.As regards the allegations of workplace harassment, threats and anti-union discrimination against SITRASALUD general secretary, Ms Navarrete de Cantn, the Committee notes the Government s indications that it has no evidence of the foregoing and that the complainant s allegations do not include precise details that make it possible to provide further information. The Committee invites the complainant organization to provide any details and evidence at its disposal relating to the allegations to enable the Government to conduct an investigation, failing which the Committee will not pursue its examination of this allegation.
.As regards the allegation of unjustified pay deductions imposed on the general secretary in May , the Committee notes that, according",0,2015,El Salvador
40,"to the information supplied by the Government, the Civil Service Tribunal considered that internal administrative procedures concerning deductions had been followed; that Ms Navarrete de Cantn did not provide any credentials for the trade union office she claimed to occupy; that she did not show that she had obtained any leave from the hospital director; and that she failed to provide any justification for her absence from work in March, April and May . Should it not receive any specific additional information from the complainant, the Committee will not pursue its examination of this allegation.
.As regards the allegation that trade union leave was not granted for attendance at the general assembly of  June , the Committee observes that, according to the information and documents supplied by the Government, paid leave was authorized for SITRASALUD members so that they could attend the general assembly.
.As regards the allegation that leave was not granted to branch officers for lack of credentials when the provision of those credentials had been refused by the authorities, the Committee observes that the allegation is related to the non-recognition of branches for public sector unions and trusts that the consultations previously recommended to the Government will make it possible to establish the basis for finding shared solutions to this issue. The Committee also invites the Government to promote social dialogue between the complainant organization and the health service authorities concerned, with a view to addressing the question of trade union leave and promoting harmonious collective relations.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government, should the definitive acquittal of Ms Samayoa be confirmed, to provide information on reimbursement of the deduction corresponding to the period she spent in preventive custody.(b) As regards the allegations of anti-union discrimination against Ms Samayoa, the Committee requests the Government to carry out an investigation to examine the allegations, inviting the complainant to provide the Government with any details and evidence at its disposal. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.(c) As regards the allegations of anti-union discrimination against Ms Navarrete de Cantn, the Committee invites the complainant organization to provide the Government with any details and evidence at its disposal to enable the Government to conduct an investigation, failing which the Committee will not pursue its examination of this allegation.(d) The Committee invites the Government to promote social dialogue between the complainant organization and the health service authorities concerned, with a view to addressing the question of trade union leave and promoting harmonious collective relations.",0,2015,El Salvador
41,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the Trade Union of Workers of the Salvadoran Institute for Comprehensive Rehabilitation (SITRAISRI) dated  June .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  September .
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ) and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  June , the Trade Union of Workers of the Salvadoran Institute for Comprehensive Rehabilitation (SITRAISRI) alleges that the Ministry of Labour and Social Security imposed discretionary guidelines relating to the registration of the general executive committee of SITRAISRI and the issuing of accreditation and cards to its elected members, thus violating the right to a guarantee of trade union immunity.
.The complainant organization states that, on  March , it submitted a request for the registration of its general executive committee and the issuing of accreditation and cards to the officials of SITRAISRI to the National Department of Social Organizations of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security. According to the complainant organization, the response time set for such a request is  working days. The complainant organization adds that  working days later, on  April , it received a resolution from the National Department of Social Organizations stating, prior to ruling on the request for registration, that based on the documentation submitted, it was not possible to verify compliance with a number of the requirements set for membership of the executive committee in light of section  of the Labour Code, i.e. that members should: (i) be a national of El Salvador by birth; (ii) be over the age of  years; and (iii) not be employees in positions of trust or representatives of the employer. Consequently, as a part of the resolution, the trade union was called on to submit photocopies of individual identity documents and recent payslips, or certificates of employment setting out the duties performed by the elected officials.
.The complainant organization considers that the resolution essentially constitutes a refusal to register the new committee, thereby violating and preventing the enjoyment of the constitutional right to trade union immunity. The complainant organization considers that the applicable legislation does not establish an obligation to provide the documents requested in the contested resolution. SITRAISRI alleges that the resolution has no legal basis and that it introduces a discretionary requirement which consequently left the trade union leaderless.
.SITRAISRI also alleges that the request for additional documents required by the Ministry of Labour constitutes an arbitrary change in criteria that undermines legal security. The complainant organization states that, since the founding of SITRAISRI in , five requests for registration and the issuing of accreditation and cards had been submitted and granted without any requirement to provide copies of the individual identity documents and payslips of the persons elected.
.In its communication of  September , the Government emphasizes that the resolution of  April  contested by the complainant organization did not constitute a refusal but was, rather, an invitation to address the shortcomings of the request through the submission of the documents required. In that regard, the Government states that SITRAISRI was instructed to submit copies of the individual identity documents and payslips of the persons elected solely in order to enable verification: (i) through the individual identity documents, that the requirements relating to nationality and the age of majority had been met; and (ii) through the payslips, or, where required, certificates of employment, for the posts held by the persons concerned within the institution, in order to ensure that they were not employees in positions of trust or representatives of the employer.
.The Government states that, in light of the national case law, registration of executive committees is not a discretionary act but rather a regulated function of the administration and that, as a part of the process, checks must be completed to ensure that the legal requirements have been met. Furthermore, although the relevant provisions do not explicitly require the submission of the documents in question, this step is necessary in order to enable verification of compliance with the requirements set out in the national Constitution (Salvadoran nationality ' article ) and in the Labour Code (among other things, attainment of age of majority and the fact of not being employed in a position of trust or a representative of the employer ' section ).
.The Government admits that previous administrations did not check compliance with some of the legal requirements for membership of executive committees. The Government considers, however, that this approach led to grave problems in practice, including the existence of executive committees made up of foreign nationals or employees in positions of trust and representatives of the employer.
.Lastly, the Government reports that, on  June , the complainant organization addressed the shortcomings in the request submitted by providing the national identity documents and payslips required by the resolution of  April . The Government states that, once the documentation required was submitted, steps were taken to register the executive committee of SITRAISRI and its members were issued with their accreditation on  July . Consequently, the Government considers that the complaint is without merit or foundation.
.The Committee observes that, in the present case, the complainant organization alleges the refusal to register the general executive committee of SITRAISRI through the imposition of discretionary guidelines in a resolution of the National Department of Social Organizations of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security. The Committee also observes that, according to the Government, the contested resolution did not constitute a discretionary refusal to register the committee, but rather merely a request for the necessary documentation to be submitted (national identity documents and payslips) in order to enable verification of compliance with the requirements applicable to the members of the executive committee, in light of the Constitution of El Salvador and the Labour Code. Furthermore, the Committee observes that, according to the Government, once the complainant organization submitted the national identity documents and the respective payslips, steps were taken, a few days later, to register the executive committee and to issue its members with their accreditation.
.In this regard, the Committee wishes to recall that the requirements established in national law relating to the registration of executive committees must be in conformity with the principles of freedom of association, in particular the right of the workers freely to elect their representatives. The Committee notes that the Government states that it required the submission of copies of individual identity documents and payslips in order to verify compliance with the legal requirements that members of executive committees should: be nationals of El Salvador by birth; have attained the age of majority; and not be employed in positions of trust or representatives of the employer. As to the requirement that members should be nationals of El Salvador by birth, the Committee recalls the principle that legislation should be made flexible so as to permit the organizations to elect their leaders freely and without hindrance, and to permit foreign workers access to trade union posts, at least after a reasonable period of residence in the host country [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , paragraph ]. Furthermore, the Committee observes that the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations (CEACR) has requested the Government to take measures to amend article () of the national Constitution, section  of the Labour Code and section  of the Civil Service Act, which establish the requirement to be  a national of El Salvador by birth' in order to hold office on the executive committee of a trade union. As to the requirement that members of an executive committee must have attained the age of majority, the Committee considers that its imposition constitutes a restriction of the right of the workers freely to elect their representatives.
.In view of the fact that El Salvador has ratified Convention No. , the Committee requests the Government to send detailed information to the CEACR on the measures taken to adapt the regulations on the formation and registration of executive committees in line with the principles of freedom of association, and draws the attention of the CEACR to the legislative aspects of this case.
.In light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:In view of the fact that El Salvador has ratified Convention No. , the Committee requests the Government to send detailed information to the CEACR on the measures taken to adapt the regulations on the formation and registration of executive committees in line with the principles of freedom of association, and draws the attention of the CEACR to the legislative aspects of this case.",1,2015,El Salvador
42,".The complaint is contained in a communication dated  January  from the Union of Water Workers (SITIAGUA).
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  October  and  March .
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  January , SITIAGUA alleges that the competent authorities imposed discretionary guidelines not envisaged by law with regard to the registration of its executive committee, violating the right to a guarantee of trade union immunity and leaving the union with no official leadership.
.The complainant maintains that on  October , its General Secretary submitted to the National Department of Social Organizations in the Ministry of Labour and Social Security a request for the registration of its general executive committee and the issuance of accreditation and cards to its elected officers. Although the law requires a reply within  working days, none was received until  working days had passed. In order to rectify the application, the reply requested submission of: (i) a copy of the individual identity document, passport or birth certificate of each of the elected officers; and (ii) a payslip or other recent document showing that they were currently employed.
.SITIAGUA alleges that these requirements exceed the powers of the National Department of Social Organizations because they are not envisaged by law. The complainant also indicates that these requirements were not listed on the Department s website when the request was made.
.The complainant argues that this refusal to register the executive committee violated its constitutional right to trade union immunity. It had met the criteria established by law but because it had not fulfilled a discretionary requirement set by the authorities,  days had passed since the election of the executive committee s members and their respective credentials had yet to be issued as at the date on which the complaint was made. Thus, the authorities' decision left the union with no official leadership and prevented it from bringing legal proceedings in defence of its members' rights.
.In that connection, SITIAGUA states that the authorities' actions violated not only its constitutional right to trade union immunity, but also the principle of legal certainty; since , it has submitted five requests for the registration of and issuance of accreditation to the members of its executive committee and the authorities have granted these requests without requesting the submission of copies of individual identity documents (or passports or birth certificates) or payslips for the elected individuals. The trade union contests this change in administrative criteria and maintains that the authorities may not arrogate to themselves powers not expressly envisaged in the Labour Code or other legislation.
.In its communication of  October , the Government indicates that the security notice of  November  contested by the complainant was not a denial of the request, but rather an invitation to rectify it by submitting the necessary documents. Thus, it cannot be considered an obstacle to trade union activity as SITIAGUA claims.
.The Government emphasizes that rectificatory security measures (requests for copies of the passport or birth certificate of each of the elected officers and of payslips or other recent documents as proof of current employment) is grounded in national legislation and case law. As the country s Supreme Court has recognized, the registration of executive committees is not a discretionary act but a regulated function of the administration and the process entails verification that the legal requirements have been met. The Government stresses that the security measure was not discretionary or arbitrary; submission of the requested documents was necessary in order to show that the criteria established in the country s Constitution (article  on nationality) and Labour Code (article  of which requires that the applicant be a national of El Salvador, have attained the age of majority, be a member of the trade union and not be employed in a position of trust or a representative of the employer).
.The Government maintains that the authorities are not responsible for the fact that the trade union has no official leadership since that situation could have been rectified; it is a consequence of the complainant s obstinacy despite the authorities' many attempts to facilitate rectification. In that regard, the Government states that: (i) in order to facilitate compliance, the security notice offered as an alternative the submission of documents other than the individual identity document (for example, the passport or birth certificate); (ii) on  October , after the security notice had been sent, an effort to communicate with the founder of SITIAGUA (who signed the complaint presented to the Committee) was made with a view to dialogue aimed at rectifying the request so that the requested registration and granting of accreditation could be carried out, but there was no reply of any kind; and (iii) a final notification was sent to this trade union leader by note dated  April , in which the General Director for Labour invited him to meet with her on  May  in order to discuss the legal status of the executive committee of SITIAGUA and to urge the organization to submit the remaining documents so that it could receive its accreditation and cards. The elected General Secretary of the executive committee of SITIAGUA (Mr Alejandro Alvarenga Vsquez) and a lawyer representing the trade union s leader attended the meeting, during which it was explained to them that the purpose of the meeting was to share the Ministry s concern that over a year had passed since the date on which the trade union had been notified and to explain the legal reasons for the requirement. Although the union s representatives took note of this explanation, as at the date of the Government s most recent communication no other representative of SITIAGUA had contacted the authorities in order to meet the requirement. The Government requests the Committee to urge the complainant to come to the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare in order to rectify the security measures taken so that the trade union can be registered, the members of its executive committee can be issued accreditation and its status can be legalized.
.With respect to the alleged change in administrative practice, the Government states that while previous administrations did not verify compliance with some of the legal requirements for the registration of executive committees, this approach led to serious problems in practice, including the existence of executive committees made up of foreign nationals or of employees in positions of trust and representatives of the employer, and to legal issues regarding the identity of the officers (the names of the individuals in question were not checked against official documents because they were wrongly listed in the minutes of the assembly).
.The Committee observes that, in the present case, the complainant organization alleges the refusal to register the general executive committee of SITIAGUA through the imposition of discretionary guidelines by the National Department of Social Organizations in the Ministry of Labour and Social Security. The Committee also observes that, according to the Government, the contested decision did not constitute a discretionary refusal to register the executive committee, but merely a request for the necessary documentation (national identity documents and payslips) to be submitted in order to enable verification of compliance with the requirements applicable to the members of the executive committee under the Constitution of El Salvador and the Labour Code.
.In this regard, the Committee wishes to recall once again that the requirements established in national law relating to the registration of executive committees must be in conformity with the principles of freedom of association, in particular the right of the workers freely to elect their representatives. The Committee takes note of the Government s statement that it required the submission of copies of individual identity documents and payslips in order to verify compliance with the legal requirements, in particular that members of executive committees should be nationals of El Salvador by birth, have attained the age of majority and not be employed in positions of trust or representatives of the employer.
.The Committee recalls: (i) as to the requirement that members should be nationals of El Salvador by birth, the principle that legislation should be made flexible so as to permit the organizations to elect their leaders freely and without hindrance, and to permit foreign workers access to trade union posts, at least after a reasonable period of residence in the host country; and (ii) as to the requirement that members of an executive committee must have attained the age of majority, that its imposition constitutes a restriction of the right of the workers freely to elect their representatives (see Case No.  (El Salvador), para. , th Report). Furthermore, the Committee observes that the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations (CEACR) has requested the Government to take measures to amend article () of",1,2015,El Salvador
43,"the national Constitution, section  of the Labour Code and section  of the Civil Service Act, which establish the requirement to be  a national of El Salvador by birth' in order to hold office on the executive committee of a trade union.
.In view of the fact that El Salvador has ratified Convention No.  and the special situation in the country, the Committee requests the Government to send detailed information to the CEACR on the measures taken to adapt the regulations on the formation and registration of executive committees in line with the principles of freedom of association, and draws the attention of the CEACR to the legislative aspects of this case.
.Lastly, taking due note of the Government s statement regarding its efforts to enter into dialogue with SITIAGUA so that the trade union can rectify its request and obtain the registration of its executive committee, the Committee invites the complainant to contact the authorities in order to rectify its status in accordance with the principles of freedom of association.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:In view of the fact that El Salvador has ratified Convention No.  and the special situation in the country, the Committee requests the Government to send detailed information to the CEACR on the measures taken to adapt the regulations on the formation and registration of executive committees in line with the principles of freedom of association, and draws the attention of the CEACR to the legislative aspects of this case.",1,2015,El Salvador
44,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the Salvadorian Social and Trade Union Front (FSS), dated  July .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  June and  October .
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Workers' Representatives Convention,  (No. ), and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  July , the complainant organization alleges that the posts occupied at the Ministry of Finance by trade union leaders and members of the General Association of Employees of the Ministry of Finance (AGEMHA), Mr Marcos Obdulio Alas Alas (who held the position of technical officer at the Directorate of Customs Revenue) and Mr Miguel ngel Alfaro Snchez (who held the position of administrative assistant at the General-Directorate of the Treasury), were abolished under Legislative Decrees Nos  (Budget Act) and  (Wages Act) of the Legislative Assembly, of  December , which retrenched thousands of workers in the public sector (Legislative Decree No.  retrenched , public sector employees, , contractual employees and  daily-hire employees). As a result of these measures, on  December , both trade union leaders received a communication informing them that their posts had been abolished and that they would be compensated in accordance with the Civil Service Act. However, no valid reason for this action had been previously authorized by the competent authority. The complainant organization considers that its constitutional right to work, to job security and to a hearing was violated, and, in particular its right, as a body of trade union members, not to be dismissed without a valid reason previously authorized by the competent authority, as established in section  of the Labour Code.
.The complainant organization reports that a large number of employees from the state institutions concerned filed several complaints regarding the abolishment of their posts with the Office of the Ombudsman for Human Rights, which supported the dismissed workers, including the trade unionists. The complainant organization adds that a group of workers affected by the retrenchment initiated amparo (remedy for the protection of constitutional rights) proceedings, claiming that their right to job security and to a hearing had been violated. This appeal was rejected by the decision of the Supreme Court of Justice of  August .
.In its communication of  June , the Government states that the posts occupied by Mr Marcos Obdulio Alas Alas and Mr Miguel ngel Alfaro Snchez were abolished in accordance with the Budget Act, which was adopted through Legislative Decree No. , and that pursuant to the Civil Service Act, the two individuals received the appropriate compensation. The Government considers that, as the compensation was granted in  and was accepted by both individuals, due process was observed.
.Accordingly, the Government believes that there was no violation of the constitutional rights protected by trade union status and that compliance had been demonstrated with the provisions of Conventions Nos ,  and . The Government adds that, since , two collective labour agreements have been concluded with the Union of Workers of the Ministry of Finance (SITRAMHA), which guarantee the right to job security, trade union immunity and other benefits for trade unions, their leaders and all employees.
.The Committee takes note of the complainant s allegations that the abolishment of the posts of two trade union leaders, which was part of the retrenchment of thousands of public sector workers, went against the principles of freedom of association, and that a valid reason with prior authorization by the competent authority, as required by law, was not provided. According to the allegations, the Office of the Ombudsman for Human Rights spoke out against this abolishment of posts but the Supreme Court of Justice issued a decision dismissing the claim.
.The Committee wishes to recall that:  The Committee can examine allegations concerning economic rationalization programmes and restructuring processes, whether or not they imply redundancies or the transfer of enterprises or services from the public to the private sector, only in so far as they might have given rise to acts of discrimination or interference against trade unions' [See Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revise) edition, , para. ].
.The Committee observes from the allegations that the dismissal of the two trade union leaders was part of a staff reduction process which affected thousands of civil servants, and that the complainant organization provides no evidence that the abolishment of the posts of the two trade union leaders was related to a collective dispute or the exercise of trade union rights and activities. The Committee also observes the Government s denial that Conventions Nos ,  and  were violated, and notes that the measure in question was established in the Budget Act for , and that the two leaders accepted the corresponding statutory compensation.
.The Committee observes that the appeal before the Supreme Court of Justice referred to in the allegations, which was lodged by dismissed workers with a view to calling into question in general the abolishment of posts imposed by the Budget Act, and which alleged that the right  to work, to job security and to a hearing' had been violated, was rejected in .
.Bearing in mind the different elements mentioned above and the lengthy period of time between the dismissals in  and the submission of the complaint in  and that the complainant did not provide sufficient information to support its claim that their dismissals were due to their trade union status or activities, the Committee will not pursue its examination of the case.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.",1,2014,El Salvador

These organizations presented additional information and new allegations in a communication dated  May .
.The Government sent new observations in a communication dated  October .

.The complainants indicate that in February  the term of office of the worker representatives to the CST was coming to an end. Hence, on  February, a formal request was sent in writing to the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare and ex officio president of the CST to issue the relevant call for nominations, in accordance with the CST rules of procedure. No reply was received to this request.
.In view of this situation, the trade union organizations, by a note dated  May , sent a second request in writing for the call for nominations to be issued.
.The representatives of the legally registered and constituted federations and confederations, meeting on  May , appointed their representatives (titular and alternate) to the CST, at the same time appointing the adviser for their sector and their representatives on its executive committee, in accordance with section (c) of the CST rules of procedure, which provides as follows:  The worker members shall be appointed by the trade union federations and confederations registered at the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare. Their appointment will be communicated to the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare.' ,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:
.On  May , the federations and confederations duly registered at the Ministry informed the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare of the appointment of the worker representatives so that they could be sworn into their posts and commence their duties.
.In fact the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare and ex officio CST president failed to swear in the appointed persons as prescribed by law for the sector. On the contrary, he held meetings with trade union officials who shared his party-political ideology, further to which, by a decision of  May , he instructed the legally registered federations and confederations, using administrative formalism, that communication had to be effected by the federations and confederations participating in the appointment of representatives, and not by the worker representatives on the CST, giving a deadline of  hours to comply with that instruction.
.A total of  out of the  legally registered federations and confederations complied with the abovementioned requirement and, on  May , within the deadline specified in the abovementioned decision, they sent the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare two lists of worker representatives comprising  members (titular and alternate), each one having the support of the corresponding federations and confederations, as shown in the communication in question. It is crucial to mention here that  trade union organizations (federations and confederations) are duly registered at the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare, four of which did not participate in the appointment of representatives, as one of these organizations is without a leader or executive committee, nor does it have judicial or extra-judicial representation to manage its normal operations, and the other three organizations abstained from participating in the process.
.As a result of the above, only  trade union organizations (federations and confederations) participated in the appointment of worker representatives.
.As a result of the call for nominations and election in question, one of the submitted lists was approved by  federations and confederations, which voted for the same  representatives (titular and alternate) for the CST. This represents . per cent of all accredited organizations that took part in the appointments.
.Despite the existence of a list accounting for the majority of appointments, on the basis of the election referred to in the previous paragraph, the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare held a series of meetings to  give continuity to the procedure for the appointment of worker members to the Higher Labour Council'  in relation to which he issued the call for nominations dated  June .
.Having failed to achieve his objective in the abovementioned meetings, the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare issued a decision dated  July , which was notified on  July, in which, on the basis of subjective criteria not previously established in the applicable laws and regulations, he did not recognize the appointment of the representatives on the list that obtained the majority of votes and urged the legally registered federations and confederations to reach an agreement as soon as possible and send the Ministry a single list of nominations for the representation of the workers on the CST, the number of representatives to be determined by the CST rules of procedure. The complainants construe this as further obstruction by the Government of the work of the CST aimed at achieving the undemocratic appointment of representatives who share its party-political ideology.
.With this decision, the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare has not only breached the laws of the country but, blatantly interfering in the decision-making of trade union organizations and thereby violating Article  of ILO Convention No. , ratified by El Salvador, has based his action on a subjective interpretation of the CST rules of procedure which disregards the fact that, under section  of the Labour Code, the organizations are governed by the  democratic principle of the prevalence of majorities'  Even though it is true that section  of the CST rules of procedure does not lay down a specific procedure, section  of the Labour Code provides that  trade unions may not grant privileges or advantages to any of their members. They shall be governed without exception by the democratic principles of the prevalence of majorities and  one person, one vote'  ? This provision, in conjunction with section  of the Labour Code, establishes that the provisions concerning trade unions are applicable to federations and confederations. In other words, the Minister cannot require or urge the workers to submit a single list.
.The complainants emphasize that their complaint holds even more weight if account is taken of the fact that it had been agreed to hold a plenary session of the CST on  July , the agenda for which had included examination of the recommendations made in Case No.  of the Committee on Freedom of Association (a case presented by the employers' organization), with a view to reaching mutual agreement on ensuring a balanced tripartite composition of the management boards of autonomous institutions, with workers' and employers' representatives on tripartite bodies being freely appointed by the organizations.
.The complainants emphasize that the CST s inability to function has major consequences for labour legislation and policies, since tripartite consultations are prevented with respect to the discussions concerning the Voluntary Retirement Benefit Bill, the draft Code of",1,2013,El Salvador
46,"Labour Procedure, the Labour and Social Welfare Bill, the draft amendments to the implementing regulations for the Occupational Risk Prevention Act, and the draft amendments to section  of the Labour Code (concerning bonus payments).
.It is clear that the proposal contained in the  July  decision of the Minister of Labour has continued to prevent the CST from being properly constituted, this being the body that has the task of discussing the abovementioned draft legislation and the recommendations of the Committee on Freedom of Association made in Case No. .
.According to the complainants, the Government continues to violate Conventions Nos  and , in particular the right to elect representatives of the workers and their organizations without interference from the public authorities, even disregarding the fact that the elected representatives had obtained . per cent of the total votes of the federations and confederations.
.In their communication of  May , the complainants allege that the items of draft legislation referred to in their previous communication (except the draft Labour Code of Procedure) were discussed and adopted by the Legislative Assembly without prior tripartite consultation and without the CST being able to express its views, despite being mandated to institutionalize social dialogue and promote economic and social cooperation.
.Lastly, the complainants allege that the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare stated publicly that he was in the process of formulating and revising rules concerning the election of worker representatives in the various institutions that have tripartite bodies, with a view to establishing the terms and conditions for the election of trade union representatives to such institutions. The complainants insist that these statements are further evidence of the Minister s intention to continue his arbitrary and legally unfounded involvement in the free appointment of representatives of the workers' organizations, thereby explicitly violating the terms of Article  of ILO Convention No. .
.The purpose of this interference is to prevent the various proposals for reform of the labour legislation from being the subject of due tripartite discussion, on account of the standstill with respect to the CST.
.In its communication of  October , the Government indicates that, with regard to the reference made by the complainant organizations to the workers' request to issue the call for nominations of worker representatives on the CST, the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare responded on  May  to the request from the former worker representatives by publishing a public notice in a leading national newspaper, calling on the trade union federations and confederations registered with the National Department for Labour Organizations at the aforementioned Ministry to submit in writing the names of the persons to be considered as titular and alternate candidates for membership of the CST. As a result of this call for nominations,  proposals were received between  and  May  supporting three lists of nominees, two of which contained  persons each and one of which contained two independent candidates, resulting in a total of  nominees. This demonstrates that the Minister, as ex officio president of the CST, met the workers' request.
.Furthermore, the complainants indicate that they communicated two lists of representatives comprising  members (titular and alternate), but that the nominees could not be sworn in on account of there being  worker representative proposals instead of the  nominations required under section  of the CST rules of procedure. In view of the large number of nominations and considering the grounds which had been cited for the nomination of worker representatives, the representatives were asked to make their nominations in accordance with the law and were given  working hours to do so. This situation was addressed through the individual presentation by the federations and confederations of the endorsed candidates.
.Nevertheless, the Trade Union Confederation of Salvadorian Workers (CSTS), the Workers' Unity Federation of El Salvador (FUERSA), the Federation of Public and Autonomous Institution Unions of El Salvador (FESIPAES), the Workers' Unity Confederation of El Salvador (CONFUERSA), the Federation of Independent Associations and Trade Unions of El Salvador (FEASIES), the Trade Union Federation of Food, Beverage, Hotel, Restaurant and Agro-Industry Workers of El Salvador (FESTSSABHRA), the Federation of Public Sector Workers' Unions (FESITRASEP), the Trade Union Federation of Municipal Workers of El Salvador (FESITRAM) and the Trade Union Federation of El Salvador (FESS), submitted various different lists of nominations making it clear that there was no unanimity in the nominations made by the representatives.
.Accordingly, in the absence of appropriate nominations, a first meeting was held on  June  with the representatives of the professional associations which had submitted candidates ( federations and six confederations) with a view to making the election process more transparent and bringing about a rapprochement between the various federations and confederations in order to reach a joint agreement. In spite of this, two blocs formed at the meeting of  June , each supporting a separate list of  elected representatives. With no single list chosen, the only agreement reached was as follows:  After two hours of discussion, during which the representatives of the federations and confederations present failed to reach an agreement regarding the nominations, the Minister of Labour issued an official invitation to another meeting at the Vocational Training Centre of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare on  June .' ,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:
.In the wake of this meeting and given the lack of consensus, the trade union associations were invited on  June  to another meeting, which was held on  June  and was attended by  federations and eight confederations, some participating without having submitted candidate proposals. This meeting resulted in the following agreement:  The representatives of the federations and confederations here present did not reach an agreement regarding nominations, some considering that the nominees on the list with the greatest number of votes should be sworn in.' This demonstrates the willingness of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare to create forums for dialogue to enable the workers to reach an agreement on the nominations of the members who would represent them on the CST, despite their inflexibility and lack of willingness to achieve a positive outcome in the election process.
.Nevertheless, it is important to note that an invitation was issued on  July  to a meeting of the CST executive committee and, since the workers had not yet elected any representatives, those who had previously acted as worker representatives (members who had finished their two-year term of office in March ) were asked to attend. At that meeting, the worker representatives called on the then Minister of Labour and Social Welfare to swear in the nominees on one of the lists that they had submitted, claiming that this list best represented the interests of the workers as a whole. In response to this demand, the adviser of the CST employers' group also supported the representatives' choice of one of the lists submitted, whereby those who had previously represented the workers would continue to perform that function.
.It should be noted that the nominations submitted by the trade union federations and confederations were concerned with the representation of a total of , people who, according to the information provided by the various trade union associations, had been union members up to that date. It would therefore seem clear that representativeness is directly proportional to membership numbers and that, accordingly, the larger the number of people registered with the federations that endorse a nomination, the greater the representativeness of the candidate for a seat on the CST. Accordingly, it can be assumed that the appointment of candidates to the aforementioned body should be carried out in accordance with procedures that ensure the democratic participation of the union members. Here it should be reiterated that any selection process should have the consent of all the parties involved to avoid creating a precedent of arbitrarily adopting decisions that lack legitimacy as a result of the de facto exclusion of legitimate parties.
.Consequently, it should be stressed that if the Ministry had opted for the list submitted by one of the trade union federation or confederation groups, despite the clear opposition of the other group and with a possible disregard for the procedure previously established and approved by all the parties, it would imply that the State was setting itself up as the authority empowered to appoint and remove members of the CST, which runs counter to the provisions of the current legislation of El Salvador.
.Contrary to the claims made in the complaint, this public administration did not demand a unanimous agreement regarding the nominations to the CST but rather that the procedure for such nominations should have the legitimacy which can only be granted by the sector as a whole, which is not the case here. It should be stressed that at no point has this Ministry refused to recognize the appointment or swearing in of worker representatives, since it is not authorized to interfere in a process which is the exclusive purview of workers and the organizations",0,2013,El Salvador
47,"that represent their interests. Accordingly, in view of safeguarding the interests of the workers in matters under discussion in the CST, a communication dated  July  urged the legally registered federations and confederations to reach an agreement and communicate it to the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare, involving a single proposal indicating the names of the persons who would be appointed to the CST, with a total of eight titular and eight alternate members. This also failed to yield a positive outcome as the workers did not comply with the request.
.However, the above situation and the current lack of worker representatives on the CST have not signified any obstacle to the holding of tripartite consultations in compliance with the ILO Conventions, in particular the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention,  (No. ), since the '  reports submitted to the ILO on the application of ILO Conventions ratified by the country were sent in September  for consultation to all the federations and confederations legally registered at that time with the National Department for Labour Organizations. It should not therefore be assumed that the failure to swear in worker representatives totally prevented the relevant tripartite consultations from being conducted.
.This demonstrates that the regulations governing the nomination of members of the CST have been respected at all times and that each of the steps taken by the Ministry of Labour to facilitate the process has been documented, particularly in view of the fact that having a national tripartite body that includes members from representative, independent and democratic workers' organizations is essential in order to give the latter a forum in which to formalize their mission to effectively defend and protect the interests and rights of the country s working class, through dialogue and economic and social cooperation as assigned by law to this tripartite body.
.It is also important to note that one of the main concerns of the Government of El Salvador has been the promotion of dialogue with all national sectors, and that various forums for dialogue on strategic decisions are being established, in relation to matters such as the Government Five-Year Plan '  and investment for the promotion of employment. This establishes a culture of promoting and exercising rights as a priority and focus for the public service, alongside access to information and transparency.
.Further evidence of its wish to contribute to a way out of the impasse surrounding the workers' incapacity to operate within the CST is that the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare, under the auspices of its Minister, has held ten meetings since June  with various federations and confederations in order to raise awareness of the importance of resolving this problem. These bodies include: the CGS, CONSISAL, COCA, the CSTS, CONFUERSA, FETRASS, FESINCONSTRANS, FESTRAES, FESITRASEP and FEASIES.
.These meetings were intended as forums in which to reach agreements on a solution involving the creation of an alternative mechanism, since the previous mechanisms had failed to produce favourable effects and results or enable the CST to be constituted. It cannot therefore be claimed that El Salvador has violated ILO Conventions Nos  and , concerning freedom of association and the right to organize, because the constitutional reforms of articles  and  of the Constitution also incorporated public-sector trade union federations and confederations in the process to appoint worker representatives to the CST for the '  period.
.Regarding the complainants' allegations concerning the alleged violations of trade union rights and acts of interference by the public authorities, the Government indicates that:' As regards the fact that the Voluntary Retirement Benefit Act and the amendments to section  of the Labour Code were adopted without complying with the tripartite consultation procedure established under ILO Convention No.  since the CST could not convene, the Committee is informed that on this occasion it was indeed not possible to carry out consultations given that, as of  March , the lack of worker representation prevented the CST from meeting, despite all the steps taken by the Ministry of Labour to bring the situation to a satisfactory resolution. Although these reforms were not submitted to consultation, they do not imply a setback for, or a deterioration of, labour rights in national legislation. On the contrary, to avoid complex decisions such as those taken by previous governments regarding retirement procedures, this provides regulations governing voluntary, non-compulsory retirement and caters for workers who so wish to opt for retirement with the possibility of economic compensation and benefits in accordance with the law.' As regards the reform of the Labour Structure and Functions Act, through the Labour and Social Welfare Bill, on which substantive observations were made but were not attached to the preliminary draft presented to the Legislative Assembly, the Committee is informed that tripartite consultations in that regard were carried out through three public consultation workshops on  November ,  December  and  January  with the participation of representatives of the three national sectors (workers, employers and Government). However, whether or not to analyse the inputs from the consultations with employers' and workers' organizations not represented in the CST and whether or not to include the observations made by each of the sectors in relation to the abovementioned Bill was a decision solely for the labour subcommittee created by the CST under the agreement contained in Act No.  of  September  concerning the revision of the preliminary draft of the Labour and Social Welfare Bill, which is currently under discussion before the Legislative Assembly.' As regards the CST s incapacity to examine the draft Code of Labour Procedure, it should be noted that the Ministry did not overstep its competence in this regard, given that the process was carried out by the Supreme Court of Justice and resulted in the presentation of the draft Code of Labour Procedure to the Legislative Assembly on  September , as part of its remit under the Constitution of the Republic. The aforementioned preliminary draft Code of Labour Procedure is currently under examination by the Labour Committee of the Legislative Assembly, and the Committee on Freedom of Association will be notified of any progress as soon as the information becomes available. Regarding both preliminary drafts that are currently under legislative analysis and debate, coordination is undertaken between the Ministry of Labour and this body and, in this way, irrespective of whether or not the CST is constituted, consultations will be carried out with both employers and workers.' With regard to the drafting and reform of rules of procedure governing the election of worker representatives within various tripartite institutions, there is no current reform process. Consequently, the claim to that effect in the complaint is incorrect.
.Lastly, the Government reiterates that in order to be able to swear in the new members of the CST, the submission of a single list of nominations, resulting from a consultation procedure that is recognized by all the parties involved, is essential given that if the public administration were to arbitrarily accept one list over another, it would imply disregarding and trampling on the rights of the associations whose lists were rejected. Hence, the responsibility for settling this dispute lies with the trade union federations and confederations of El Salvador, not with the Government or the employers. This dispute falls outside the competence of this Ministry, which does not mean, however, that it will not take action to promote dialogue and contribute to the reactivation of the CST, avoiding any violation of article  of the Constitution of the Republic by requiring public servants to refrain from taking any measures not explicitly permitted by law.
.The Committee observes that in the present case the complainant confederations and federations allege that, since , the Government, in particular the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare, has been obstructing and interfering in the appointment of worker representatives to the CST, a tripartite body for consultation and economic and social cooperation in relation to labour matters, including draft legislation in this field, and that this has prevented a number of items of labour legislation being the subject of tripartite consultation prior to processing and adoption by the Legislative Assembly.
.The Committee notes that, according to the allegations: the purpose of the abovementioned action is to hamper the work of the CST and promote the appointment of worker representatives to the CST who share the Minister of Labour s party-political ideology; hence the Minister is applying a subjective interpretation to the applicable legal provisions (CST rules of procedure, Labour Code), obliging the  registered federations and confederations (, according to the Government) to submit a single list of eight titular members and eight alternate members, despite the fact that the elections held resulted in the complainants' list (of eight titular members and eight alternate members) receiving the backing of  federations and confederations, namely . per cent of the total votes of registered organizations that had taken part in the elections, whereas the list put forward by the other bloc",0,2013,El Salvador
48,"comprised only nine organizations; and the authorities thus disregarded the democratic principle of the prevalence of majorities as established in section  of the Labour Code and demanded an absolute, unanimous consensus from the  confederations and federations.
.The Committee notes that, according to the complainants, the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare also publicly announced that it was in the process of formulating and revising the rules of procedure concerning the election of worker representatives to various tripartite institutions. The Committee observes that the Government, in its reply, rejects these allegations and indicates that the rules in question are not being reformed.
.The Committee notes the Government s statements to the effect that: () it has tried to facilitate the process to appoint eight titular and eight alternate worker representatives to the CST through a public call for nominations made to the legally registered confederations and federations and through various meetings in , with a view to bringing about a rapprochement and creating forums for dialogue to reach an agreement on the presentation of a single proposal; () initially,  nominations were made involving three different lists; subsequently two different blocs of federations and confederations (representing six confederations and  federations) also supported different lists of elected representatives; one of those blocs further considered that the nominees on the list with the greatest number of votes should be sworn in; () in this context, on  July , the Ministry called a meeting of the CST executive committee and, since the workers had no elected representatives at that time, it called upon the persons who had acted in that capacity during the previous term of office of the CST, which expired in March . At that meeting, the worker representatives called on the Minister to swear in the nominees on one of the lists which they had submitted, claiming that it was the most representative of the interests of the workers as a whole; the employers also supported that list, which meant that the members who had previously represented the workers would remain in office on the CST; () however, to enable the new worker members to be sworn in, it was essential to have a single list of nominees submitted through a procedure recognized by all the organizations; the decision of the Ministry of Labour of  July  established the need for a single proposal approved by all the trade union organizations and associations which were entitled to participate; () the Government justifies this single list on the grounds that it is not authorized to interfere in a process which is the exclusive purview of the trade union organizations; () although the CST does not currently have any worker representatives, the Government has sought alternative consultation mechanisms, and in this regard it refers to meetings held with all the legally registered federations and confederations concerning the '  reports submitted to the ILO, and the establishment of various forums for dialogue with all national sectors in relation to strategic decisions (Government Five-Year Plan, investment for the promotion of employment); and () tripartite consultations were also carried out in the public consultation workshops in relation to the Labour and Social Welfare Bill; however, analysis of the inputs from the organizations was the responsibility of the labour subcommittee of the CST and could not, therefore, take place; the draft Code of Labour Procedure was not the work of the Ministry of Labour but was produced by the Supreme Court of Justice; regarding the draft texts that are currently under legislative debate, the Ministry of Labour will carry out consultations with the workers' and employers' organizations in its coordination capacity with the legislature; with regard to the Voluntary Retirement Benefit Act and the approval of the reform of section  of the Labour Code (concerning bonus payments), it was not possible to hold tripartite consultations but the new legal texts do not constitute a setback for labour rights.
.The Committee wishes to emphasize, as it has always done, the vital importance that it attaches to social dialogue and tripartite consultation, not only concerning questions of labour law but also in the formulation of public policy on labour, social and economic matters. The Committee notes with deep regret that the CST, the national tripartite body mandated to perform the abovementioned tasks, has not met since  and that the Government s reply does not refer to any initiatives taken in  or up to the present date to solve the problems arising from the non-appointment of worker representatives to the CST. The Committee observes that, at its June  meeting, when examining a complaint from the leading employers' organization in the country (Case No. ), it already noted problems concerning the absence of tripartite consultation on  drafts for the revision of  laws relating to autonomous institutions which had not been submitted to the CST, draft legislation in respect of which the Government had acknowledged that it allowed the public administration to select private sector representatives to tripartite bodies. In the present case the Committee emphasizes that the large number of complainant national confederations (four) (plus a Central American confederation) and of complainant national federations () shows that the situation concerning social dialogue and the functioning of labour relations is a source of great concern in the country s trade union movement.
.The Committee observes that the complainants highlight the fact that the CST rules of procedure do not establish a specific mechanism for appointing worker representatives. However, the Committee observes that ever since the Government has insisted on the need for a single list, it has been impossible in practice for the CST to be constituted and resume its functions. The Committee notes that, in these circumstances, the current rules did not resolve the situation with regard to the disagreement on a single list of worker representatives by all the higher-level trade union organizations and considers that the resolution of this type of conflict between trade unions should be the responsibility of the judicial authority or an independent arbitrator, and not the administrative authority.
.The Committee draws the Government s attention to the importance it attaches to the promotion of dialogue and consultations on matters of mutual interest between the public authorities and the most representative occupational organizations of the sector involved [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ]. Moreover, the Committee wishes to underline the principle whereby tripartite consultation should take place before the Government submits a draft to the Legislative Assembly or establishes a labour, social or economic policy, and also highlights the importance of prior consultation of employers' and workers' organizations before the adoption of any legislation in the field of labour law [see Digest, op. cit., paras  and ]. The Committee has emphasized the importance that should be attached to full and frank consultation taking place on any questions or proposed legislation affecting trade union rights [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. The Committee further recalls that the process of consultation on legislation and minimum wages helps to give laws, programmes and measures adopted or applied by public authorities a firmer justification and helps to ensure that they are well respected and successfully applied. The Government should seek general consensus as much as possible, given that employers' and workers' organizations should be able to share in the responsibility of securing the well-being and prosperity of the community as a whole. This is particularly important given the growing complexity of the problems faced by societies. No public authority can claim to have all the answers, nor assume that its proposals will naturally achieve all of their objectives [see Digest, op. cit., para. ].
.The Committee underlines the urgent need for in-depth consultations with the confederations and federations in order to establish clear and stable rules for the appointment of worker representatives to the CST (particularly when there is no single list of worker representatives) which respect the criterion of representativeness requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard. Taking into account the urgency of this situation the Committee invites the Government to accept an ILO technical assistance mission to help in finding a solution to the issues raised.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) Given the fact that this case involves a conflict between trade union organizations, hindering the establishment of the Higher Labour Council (CST), the Committee underlines the need for the CST to be constituted as a matter of urgency based on the criterion of representativeness of organizations so that its functions may resume.(b) The Committee underlines the urgent need for in-depth consultations with the confederations and federations in order to establish clear and stable rules for the appointment of worker representatives to the CST (particularly when there is no single list of worker representatives) which respect the criterion of representativeness and requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.(c) Taking into account",0,2013,El Salvador

50,".The Committee last examined this case, concerning allegations of the refusal of the Ministries of Economy and Finance to approve a collective agreement, at its June  meeting [see nd Report, paras ' ]. On that occasion, the Committee: (a) requested the Government to guarantee respect for the principles referred to in the conclusions in the future, and urged it once again to take steps to amend section  of the Labour Code so that collective agreements that have been concluded and signed by the parties in an autonomous official institution, such as the Salvadorian Tourism Institute (ISTU), do not have to be submitted for approval by the Ministry of Tourism, which itself has to seek the opinion of the Ministry of Finance; (b) referred once again the legislative aspect of this case to the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations; and (c) regretted that the collective agreement negotiated by the complainant organization and the ISTU had not been approved and requested the Government to take steps to bring the parties and the authorities in question together with a view to overcoming this situation.
.In the follow-up to the case, in a communication dated  October , the Government provided observations in relation to amending section  of the Labour Code ' a matter that is being examined by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations. Moreover, with regard to the collective labour agreement negotiated by the complainant union and the ISTU, the Government states that the Executive Directorate of the Ministry of Finance complied with agreement No. /, which stipulated that the collective labour agreement would enter into force as of  January . The Government also states that the collective agreement was subsequently revised by the parties and duly registered on  April , with a validity of three years from the time of its registration. The Government adds that, on the date of its communication, no complaints had been received in regard to the abovementioned collective agreement.
.The Committee notes with interest that, according to the Government s indications, the collective agreement negotiated between the complainant union and the ISTU was approved and registered, and so came into force, and therefore the Committee will not pursue its examination of this case.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the Trade Union of Workers in the Tourism, Hotel and Allied Industries (STITHS) dated  November .
.At its March  meeting [see st Report, para. ], since there had been no reply from the Government, despite the time that had elapsed since the presentation of the complaint, the Committee made an urgent appeal to the Government indicating that, in accordance with the procedural rules set out in paragraph  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session, it could present a report on the substance of the case at its next meeting, even if the requested information or observations had not been received in time. To date, the Government has not sent any information.
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Workers' Representatives Convention,  (No. ), and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  November , the STITHS alleges that, in March , it signed a collective agreement with the Salvadorian Tourism Institute (ISTU), which included a new version of the clause  financial compensation for the voluntary retirement of ISTU workers'  which considers two ways of paying the abovementioned financial compensation: (a) with Government funds; or (b) with its own resources, as, in accordance with the law governing the ISTU, that institute enjoys administrative, budgetary and financial autonomy. The text of the collective agreement was submitted to the Ministry of Tourism and the Ministry of Finance for approval on  April , in accordance with section  of the Labour Code.
.The complainant organization adds that, on  June , the President of the ISTU Board of Directors, anticipating the Ministry of Finance s unfavourable opinion in respect of the abovementioned clause of the collective agreement, informed the Deputy Finance Minister of the decision on point , taken during ordinary meeting No. / of the ISTU Executive Committee on  June , at which the members of the Executive Committee agreed that, in the event of the Ministry of Finance issuing an unfavourable opinion in respect of the payment of financial compensation for voluntary retirement for the tax years after , the ISTU would use its own funds to cover the benefit in question, thereby allaying any concerns over the availability of adequate resources.
.Nevertheless, the complainant organization states that, on  July , the Finance Minister issued the following opinion:  ...A legal and financial examination of the collective labour agreement in question was carried out in accordance with the abovementioned legal provision and has shown that the institution in question possesses the financial and budgetary resources to cover the cost entailed by the agreement signed between the Salvadorian Tourism Institute and the Trade Union of Workers in the Tourism, Hotel and Allied Industries; this fact notwithstanding and in accordance with the guidelines issued by the Office of the President of the Republic under Executive Decree No.  of  April , which sets out the savings and austerity policy for the public sector in , published in Official Journal No. , volume , on  April ; this ministerial office issues an unfavourable opinion  ?
.In this regard, the complainant organization states that when the Executive Committee of the ISTU and the STITHS negotiated the collective agreement on  and  March , and, prior to signing it on  April , Executive Decree No.  of  April , which sets out the savings and austerity policy for the public sector, published in Official Journal No. , volume , on  April , was not yet valid, as it only entered into force eight days after its publication in the Official Journal. In conclusion, it appears that the Executive Decree was applied retroactively to the detriment of the workers of ISTU.
.The complainant organization states that, after the Ministry of Finance had issued its unfavourable opinion, the Director of the ISTU sent a memorandum to the Deputy Finance Minister on  August , informing him that the ISTU Executive Committee had been informed of the unfavourable opinion issued by the Ministry of Finance, whereby it did not approve the collective labour agreement and that, in view of this fact, a decision was taken on point  at ordinary meeting No. / of the ISTU Executive Committee on  August , which stipulated that the collective labour agreement would enter into force as of  January .
.The complainant organization highlights that its right to bargain collectively has been infringed, despite it having presented two alternatives to avoid violating the guidelines issued under the savings and austerity policy for the public sector set out in Executive Decree No. . Indeed, the ISTU and the STITHS agreed that the ISTU s own funds would be used to pay the abovementioned benefit and that the abovementioned collective agreement would enter into force on  January  (that is, when the austerity policy came to an end).
.The complainant organization recalls that, in a previous case relating to El Salvador [see rd Report, March , Case No. ] concerning the violation of a collective agreement clause on regrading and wage adjustment, the Committee requested the Government to  guarantee respect for the principles referred to in the conclusions as regards observance of collective agreements and consultation with trade unions on matters affecting the workers' interests  ?and to  take steps to amend section  of the Labour Code so that collective agreements that have been concluded and signed by the parties in an autonomous official institution do not have to be submitted for approval by the Ministry of Tourism, which itself has to seek the opinion of the Ministry of Finance; in this regard, the Committee regrets the fact that the collective agreement negotiated by the complainant trade union and the ISTU could not be applied for that reason'  The Committee also drew the legislative aspects of the case to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, as section  of the Labour Code provides that  to be valid, a collective agreement signed with an autonomous official institution shall first be approved by the ministry concerned, after the Ministry of Finance has given its opinion. The official autonomous institution which has concluded the collective agreement shall forward it to the Court of Auditors of the Republic' [see rd Report, Case No.  (El Salvador), para. ].
.The Committee regrets that, despite the time that has elapsed since the presentation of the complaint, the Government has not replied to the complainant s allegations even",2,2012,El Salvador
51,"though it has been requested several times, including through an urgent appeal in March . The Committee requests the Government to be more cooperative in the future.
.Hence, in accordance with the applicable procedural rules [see th Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body], the Committee is obliged to present a report on the substance of the case without being able to take account of the information which it had hoped to receive from the Government.
.The Committee reminds the Government that the purpose of the whole procedure established by the International Labour Organization for the examination of allegations of violations of freedom of association is to promote respect for this freedom in law and in fact. The Committee remains confident that, if the procedure protects governments from unreasonable accusations, governments, in turn, will recognize the importance of presenting, for objective examination, detailed replies concerning allegations made against them [see First Report, para. ].
.The Committee notes that, in the present case, the complainant organization alleges that, despite having negotiated and signed a collective agreement in March April , the Ministry of Finance subsequently issued an unfavourable opinion in respect of the clause  financial compensation for the voluntary retirement of the ISTU workers'  even though it had been confirmed that the institution in question possessed the requisite financial and budgetary resources to cover the cost entailed by the collective agreement. The Committee notes that the opinion issued by the Ministry of Finance, contained in an official memorandum, is based on the guidelines issued under the savings and austerity policy for the public sector in  (set out in Executive Decree No. ).
.Since the Government has not replied, the Committee wishes to highlight that the examination of collective agreement clauses with a financial impact by the financial authorities should take place during the collective bargaining process and not, as has occurred in this, and in other cases brought before the Committee, after the collective agreement has been signed by the parties, as this is incompatible with the principle of free and voluntary collective bargaining and the principle according to which  agreements should be binding on the parties' [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ]. The Committee observes that the issues raised in this complaint are similar to those raised in the framework of Case No.  and requests the Government to guarantee respect for these principles in the future and urges it once again to take steps to amend section  of the Labour Code so that collective agreements that have been concluded and signed by the parties in an autonomous official institution, such as the ISTU, do not have to be submitted for approval by the Ministry of Tourism, which itself has to seek the opinion of the Ministry of Finance.
.In this regard, the Committee regrets that the collective agreement negotiated by the complainant organization and the ISTU has not been approved, particularly in view of the parties' willingness to apply the clause with a financial impact from  (when the Government s austerity policy comes to an end), which the Ministry of Finance rejected. The Committee requests the Government to take steps to bring the parties and the authorities in question together with a view to overcoming this situation, and to keep it informed of any developments in that regard.
.Lastly, the Committee refers the legislative aspect of this case to the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to guarantee respect for the principles referred to in the conclusions in the future and urges it once again to take steps to amend section  of the Labour Code so that collective agreements that have been concluded and signed by the parties in an autonomous official institution, such as the ISTU, do not have to be submitted for approval by the Ministry of Tourism, which itself has to seek the opinion of the Ministry of Finance.(b) The Committee once again refers the legislative aspect of this case to the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.(c) The Committee regrets that the collective agreement negotiated by the complainant organization and the ISTU has not been approved and requests the Government to take steps to bring the parties and the authorities in question together with a view to overcoming this situation, and to keep it informed of any developments in that regard.",0,2012,El Salvador
52,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the Trade Union of Workers of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal (STRATSE) dated  October . This organization sent additional information in a communication dated  April .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  July .
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Workers' Representatives Convention,  (No. ), and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  October , the STRATSE alleges that it initiated the collective bargaining process with the Supreme Electoral Tribunal on  July , and the representatives of both parties signed the first collective agreement on  December of the same year.
.However, this collective agreement had to be sent to the Ministry of Finance for validation (section  of the Civil Service Act), which on  March , stated that the benefits granted in the collective agreement were not viable from a budgetary point of view as the cost was significantly higher than the budget available to the Supreme Electoral Tribunal, and consequently it was issuing an unfavourable opinion regarding the collective agreement.
.Bargaining consequently resumed between the parties and alternatives were submitted to address the unfavourable opinion issued by the Ministry of Finance. The Supreme Electoral Tribunal asked the trade union to adjust its claims to US$ million and the trade union approved this proposal at an extraordinary assembly on  June . In October , the renegotiated collective agreement was sent to the Ministry of Finance, but in December , the Ministry of Finance again failed to approve the collective agreement and recommended that it be negotiated a third time.
.In its communication dated  April , the STRATSE indicates that the Civil Service Tribunal ordered that the matter be submitted to conciliation and, when this failed, to arbitration, but that the arbitrators have not yet been sworn in.
.The complainant trade union considers that the decisions made by the Ministry of Finance and the excessive delays that have occurred in the collective bargaining process infringe the ratified ILO Conventions on freedom of association and collective bargaining.
.In its communication dated  July , the Government refers to the allegation by the STRATSE concerning the  notification by the Ministry of Finance stating that the financial evaluation conducted into the benefits agreed in the collective labour agreement concluded by the STRATSE and the Supreme Electoral Tribunal indicated that the cost of the agreement in question was significantly higher than the budget available to the Supreme Electoral Tribunal and that consequently it was issuing an unfavourable opinion regarding its approval.
.The Government states in this respect that the allegations presented by the STRATSE lack any basis in fact or relevance, as according to the registers of the National Department of Social Organizations of the General Labour Directorate of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare, the STRATSE was granted the collective labour agreement through the registration on  July  of the arbitration award handed down by the respective arbitration tribunal, which put an end to the collective labour dispute initiated by the STRATSE against the Supreme Electoral Tribunal. The Government notes that the arbitration award contains the final consolidated version of the clauses approved at the direct discussion and arbitration stages, which have been numbered by the Civil Service Tribunal from  to , and that in accordance with section  of the Civil Service Act:  The award puts an end to the collective dispute and has the status of a collective labour agreement.' Consequently, the abovementioned department, without further administrative paperwork or formalities, proceeded to register the arbitration award in the corresponding register, and it will remain valid for three years as from the date of registration.
.On the basis of the above, the Government asks that the case be closed.
.The Committee observes that the complainant trade union alleges delays of over two years and obstacles to the collective bargaining process it initiated with the Supreme Electoral Tribunal in July , resulting from the legal requirement for the Ministry of Finance to approve the collective agreement, which it refused to do on two successive occasions, citing budgetary reasons in violation of the right to collective bargaining.
.The Committee notes the Government s statement that: (i) the cost of the collective agreement was significantly higher than the budget available to the Supreme Electoral Tribunal for the purpose, and that consequently the Ministry of Finance issued an unfavourable opinion regarding its approval; and (ii) the problem raised in the complaint was settled by way of an arbitration award registered on  July , which ended the collective dispute and which has the status of a collective labour agreement.
.The Committee observes that it has examined similar allegations on previous occasions. For example, at its June  meeting it examined a case relating to obstacles and delays in collective bargaining within the civil service (National Centre of Registries) in which the Ministry of Finance also issued an unfavourable opinion regarding the collective agreement concluded with the complainant trade union and more specifically its economic clauses [see nd Report, Case No.  (El Salvador), paras  et seq.], and on that occasion it highlighted that the examination of collective agreement clauses with a financial or budgetary impact by the financial or budgetary authorities should take place during the collective bargaining process and not, as has occurred in this, and in other cases brought before the Committee, after the collective agreement has been signed by the parties, as this is incompatible with the principle of free and voluntary collective bargaining and the principle according to which agreements should be binding on the parties [see nd Report, Case No. , para. , and Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ].
.The Committee notes that, while after the failure of conciliation proceedings, the matter was submitted to compulsory arbitration, which put an end to the dispute, and there is currently a collective agreement in place that was registered in July , it must express regret regarding the excessive delay that occurred in the collective bargaining process and settlement of this dispute (three years). It therefore reiterates in this case the conclusions it formulated in June  and requests that in future the principles mentioned in the previous paragraph be taken into account. Furthermore, observing that the problems mentioned keep recurring in the public sector, the Committee invites the Government to consider availing itself of ILO technical assistance in order to overcome these problems.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) While noting that the collective bargaining process was submitted to arbitration and that there is presently a collective agreement in place at the Supreme Electoral Tribunal, the Committee regrets the excessive delays in the bargaining process and requests the Government to take into account in future the principles mentioned in the conclusions on interference by the financial authorities in collective bargaining processes.(b) In this respect, the Committee invites the Government to consider availing itself of ILO technical assistance in order to overcome the problems raised in this and previous cases it has been called upon to examine.",1,2012,El Salvador
53,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the Union of Workers of the Ministry of Finance (SITRAMHA) dated  December .
.In view of the Government s lack of response despite the time elapsed since the submission of the complaint, at its March  meeting [see st Report, para. ] the Committee made an urgent appeal to the Government and brought to its attention that, in accordance with the procedural rules set out in paragraph  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session, it could present a report on the substance of the case at its next meeting even if it had not received the information or observations from the Government in due time. To date, no response has been received from the Government.
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Workers' Representatives Convention,  (No. ), and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  December , SITRAMHA alleges that on  July , at an extraordinary meeting of its general assembly, the union authorized a nationwide work stoppage for the whole of the Ministry of Finance from  to  June and from  to  July . The complainant adds that on ,  and  July , the President of El Salvador made threats on television through statements made in the press (the complainant provided newspaper clippings, articles and a DVD) to conduct large-scale dismissals of the participants in the work stoppage '  per cent of the , employees of the Ministry of Finance.
.SITRAMHA adds that, on  July , an announcement of a job fair was published, in collaboration with the Ministry of Labour, with a view to replacing the Ministry of Finance staff who were supporting the work stoppage.
.On ,  and  July, many people came to the offices of the Ministry of Labour of El Salvador aspiring to be part of the large-scale recruitment by the Ministry of Finance to replace the employees participating in the work stoppage.
.The complainant sends a certified copy of the national newspaper wherein it is stated that, on  July , the Legislative Assembly approved a decree entitled  Special temporary arrangements for foreign trade operations for a period of  days'  authorizing a contingency plan prepared by the Directorate General of Customs of the Ministry of Finance during the work stoppage. The draft decree was submitted to the President s office and provided for the mass dismissal of the workers who participated in the stoppage. However, in the final version of the decree of the same name (Decree No. ), which was approved by the Legislative Assembly on  July , the articles which threatened the job security of the Ministry of Finance workers who participated in the work stoppage were removed.
.Lastly, SITRAMHA states that it is presenting the complaint in order to prevent acts which pose a threat to the union members and freedom of association from being contemplated in the future.
.The Committee regrets that, despite the time that has elapsed since the presentation of the complaint, the Government has not provided the information requested, although being invited to do so by means of an urgent appeal at the Committee s March  meeting. The Committee requests the Government to be more cooperative in the future.
.Under these circumstances, and in accordance with the applicable procedural rules [see th Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body], the Committee finds itself obliged to present a report on the substance of the case without the benefit of the information which it had expected to receive from the Government.
.The Committee recalls that the purpose of the whole procedure established by the International Labour Organization for the examination of allegations of violations of freedom of association is to promote respect for this freedom in law and in fact. The Committee remains confident that, while the procedure protects governments from unreasonable accusations, governments will in turn recognize the importance of formulating, for the purposes of an objective examination, detailed replies concerning allegations made against them.
.The Committee observes that in the present case the complainant alleges that, after a nationwide work stoppage was declared and carried out at all workplaces of the Ministry of Finance from  to  June and  to  July , the President of El Salvador made statements to the media threatening mass dismissals of the participants. According to the allegations, the authorities published an advertisement for a job fair with a view to replacing the participants in the work stoppage en masse and the Legislative Assembly prepared a draft decree which provided for the mass dismissal of the said workers, which was submitted to the President s office; ultimately, however, those articles in the draft which threatened the job security of the workers in question were removed from the legislative decree (No. ) approved by the Legislative Assembly.
.The Committee notes that the complainant states that its intention is to prevent acts such as those described in the complaint from happening in the future.
.The Committee recalls generally the principle that dismissals of strikers on a large scale involve a serious risk of abuse and place freedom of association in grave jeopardy; the competent authorities should be given appropriate instructions so as to obviate the dangers to freedom of association that such dismissals involve [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ] and that dismissal threats for undertaking trade union activities constitute serious acts contrary to freedom of association principles. The Committee observes nonetheless that the complaint shows that the threatened large-scale dismissal of strikers did not in fact materialize.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.",1,2012,El Salvador
54,".The Committee last examined this case at its June  meeting, when it presented an interim report to the Governing Body [see nd Report, paras ' , approved by the Governing Body at its st Session (June )].
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  November ,  October  and  October .
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Workers' Representatives Convention,  (No. ), and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.In its previous examination of the case in June , the Committee made the following recommendations [see nd Report, para. ]:(a)	The Committee regrets the lack of response from the Government, even though it made an urgent appeal at its March  meeting, and requests the Government to be more cooperative in the future, responding to all the pending issues in this case and including information from the ISSS.Allegations concerning the SIMETRISSS(b)	The Committee stresses the importance for the authorities, together with the complainant union, to address the issues and problems raised in the complaint and, in this regard, requests the Government to take measures to promote dialogue between the ISSS and the complainant in order to find shared solutions to the doctors' wage problems and to the problems related to trade union facilities, taking into account the principles and considerations outlined above and the principles of Convention No.  (which El Salvador has ratified) and Recommendation No.  concerning workers' representatives. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.(c)	While it takes note of the allegations presented by the complainant union regarding: () the instructions that the ISSS Deputy Director for Health circulated among the directors and managers of local medical centres, in a memorandum in , which, according to the allegations, seriously restricts trade union rights (preventing contact between the trade union representatives and the media; not allowing time in administrative meetings for the trade union representatives to present problems related to trade union activities; and creating the obligation to inform superiors of meetings between trade union officials and members, and of trade union activities); and () the instructions given by a hospital director, on  April , to threaten doctors participating in activities organized by the trade union with sanctions. The Committee urges the Government to send its observations on these allegations without delay.Allegations concerning the STISSS(d)	While it observes that the complaint presented by the STISSS concerns allegations of acts of favouritism by the ISSS authorities in the context of a dispute between factions within the executive board, the Committee urges the Government to send its observations on these allegations without delay, so as to enable it to examine the complaint in full knowledge of the facts.
.In its communications dated  November ,  October  and  October , the Government responds to the complainant organizations' allegations.
.As to the alleged interference in the form of favouritism by the authorities in the context of a dispute between factions within the executive board, the Government reports that in late , an internal dispute arose in the STISSS, which divided the executive committee into factions following the election of its members on  December  (two groups emerged, with six officers, including the general secretary, who signed the complaint, on one side, and five officers on the other). The division become more apparent when, in late February, the group led by the general secretary stopped inviting the other group to board meetings and began taking decisions by majority vote. As the dispute escalated, the members of each group resorted to using violence and the national civil police were forced to intervene. Finally, on  March , the board members from the minority faction were unable to enter the trade union premises, as members of the other group took steps to prevent them from exercising the trade union duties for which they had been elected.
.The Government adds that, as a result of the dispute, each group organized and held its own general assembly in an attempt to resolve the situation by disqualifying and expelling the opposing officers. As a result, each group submitted to the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare its own request to establish a new executive board. Faced with the submission of differing requests, on  July , the National Department of Labour Organizations: (i) decided that the submitted requests were receivable and considered the decisions of each group in relation to the dismissal proceedings to be accepted (so that both groups were mutually excluded from the executive board); (ii) unable to register more than one new executive board, established that the STISSS had no official leadership and therefore suggested that a single executive board be elected at a general assembly; (iii) reiterated that the labour rights established in the collective agreement were retained and stated that all union members should continue to pay union dues, which would be transferred to the union in due course through a holding account overseen by the Ministry of Finance; and (iv) maintained the right of the parties to contest legally the validity of the respective general assemblies.
.The Government reports that when the General Labour Inspectorate investigated the alleged violations of union officers' trade union rights in the form of denied trade union leave, it was unable to verify the alleged discrimination due to the circumstances within the union: given the absence of an executive board, it could not be said that the union officers had been denied leave. The Government nevertheless indicates that while the STISSS might have lacked an executive committee, the rights established in the collective agreement were protected, and it was decided that the local trade union representatives should still be granted trade union leave so that they could address the various individual labour disputes that might arise in each centre.
.Moreover, with regard to the alleged withholding of union dues, the Government indicates that, owing to the absence of an executive board, in accordance with the aforementioned decision of  July , union dues continued to be collected, but were deposited in a special holding account overseen by the Ministry of Finance, since a new executive board had not taken office.
.The Government reports that the lack of official leadership came to an end when a new executive board was elected at a general assembly held on  December . The Government specifies that the elected general secretary and treasurer received from the Salvadorian Social Security Institute (ISSS) a sum of money corresponding to the collected union dues (for the months of July through to December ). In her certificate of acceptance, the general secretary of the STISSS stated that she had duly received a cheque for the appropriate sum, declaring the ISSS free of all liability, and therefore agreed to order the withdrawal of the complaint against the Director-General of the ISSS for alleged misappropriation.
.With regard to the allegations of disciplinary proceedings, the Government points out that trade union immunity, which is enshrined in the country s Constitution, must not be confused with so-called trade union impunity. The Government indicates that the disciplinary proceedings are merely the result of inappropriate actions taken by the persons in question. In particular, the procedure referred to by the STISSS concerning Ms Bonilla de Alarcn was the result of inappropriate actions taken by her, which, following due process, led to the issuance of a judgment by the Fourth Civil and Commercial Court of San Salvador on  January , whereby the judge established beyond a reasonable doubt the worker s misconduct and granted the ISSS authorization to dismiss her. The Government nevertheless indicates that, although the ISSS duly obtained judicial authorization for her dismissal, the administration, as a gesture of openness and goodwill, decided not to implement the judgment and, at the time of writing of the Government s last reply, the worker remained in her post under the same conditions as when she was hired.
.As to the alleged refusal to bargain with the SIMETRISSS and the Committee s recommendation that the authorities work with the union to address the issues raised (promoting dialogue between the ISSS and the SIMETRISSS in order to find shared solutions to the alleged problems concerning wages and trade union facilities), the Government reports that a high-level institutional commission has been established to meet with the union at a high-level round table in order to address and resolve issues placed on the agenda. The Government indicates that this round table has met on several occasions and has begun preparing agreements to safeguard the rights of ISSS workers, covering issues such as arbitrary movements of employees, workers' benefits and the establishment of requirements before the executive board for the authorization of employee wage levels. The Government states that, while the SIMETRISSS has not been able to bargain together with the STISSS (the majority union), the workers' rights are still protected, since collective bargaining ' a process",1,2013,El Salvador
55,"whereby the workers are properly represented ' has been negotiated with the established union (the STISSS). As to the regulations that govern collective bargaining, the Government points out that the Labour Code permits unions to unite when engaging in collective bargaining, provided that the unions concerned have given their consent in their respective assemblies.
.Furthermore, the Government denies the SIMETRISSS s allegation of non-observance of a  wage agreement. The Government specifies that it implemented that agreement through Executive Board Agreement No. -- of  June , which agreed to apply the wage scale agreed with the SIMETRISSS, as from  January , with the wages agreed upon. Moreover, with regard to the discontent relating to wage issues expressed by the SIMETRISSS, which alleges that wages have been frozen for over  years, the Government indicates that the ISSS has been committed to dialogue and guaranteeing the rights of the SIMETRISSS s members. The Government adds that over the past few years, the ISSS adjusted wages in two phases: the first wage adjustment occurred in January  through the Executive Board Agreement that authorized the implementation of a wage scale for practising physicians, coordinators and chief physicians for a sum of US$,,; while the second took place in February , when the remaining wage adjustment for the practising physicians was approved for the amount of US$,,.
.Moreover, the Government denies the allegation that the ISSS Deputy Director for Health circulated instructions among the directors and the management of the local medical centres to restrict trade union rights, in a memorandum in . The Government specifies, first, that the memorandum was circulated by the then ISSS Deputy Director for Health, not the ISSS Deputy Director-General. As to its content, the Government states that: (i) the alleged instruction to prevent contact between the trade union representatives and the media does not appear in any part of the memorandum ' the provision in question simply requests that  persons approached by the media refer any consultation or request for an interview to the communication department'  (ii) the allegation that trade unions are not allowed time in administrative meetings to raise their concerns is untrue: while point  of the memorandum establishes that  during administrative meetings held in the medical centres, time should not be allotted, at the request of the trade unions, for the discussion of situations relating to trade union activities'  the Government stresses that the memorandum for local administrative authorities respects freedom of association in so far as this provision is restricted to meetings where institutional management plan and coordinate working methods, where it would be inappropriate to discuss union-related matters; and (iii) the allegation that the memorandum creates the obligation to inform superiors of meetings between trade union officials and members, and of activities of an official nature, is also unfounded, as point  of the memorandum simply establishes that  every director must report to hospital and outpatient care management any cases of staff absence from work on employment-related or duly justified grounds, in accordance with regulations' (recalling that all workers, including trade union leaders, must comply with the regulations concerning the grounds for absence established in the collective agreement, the Government also reiterates that trade union immunity must not be confused with so-called trade union impunity, which would enable workers neither to attend to nor to perform the work for which they have been hired).
.As to the alleged instructions given by a hospital director, on  April , supposedly to threaten doctors participating in activities organized by the trade union with sanctions, the Government clarifies that the then director of the specialized treatment hospital, upon receiving the memorandum on  April , merely forwarded it to management and at no point did she hold a meeting in which she instructed management to sanction doctors participating in activities organized by the trade union.
.The Committee recalls that this case concerns allegations of obstacles to trade union activities, refusal of facilities for union representatives and obstacles to engagement by the SIMETRISSS in collective bargaining; favouritism, failure to transfer union dues and refusal to grant trade union leave in the context of a STISSS internal dispute, and disciplinary proceedings against its leaders.
.With regard to the allegations of favouritism, refusal to grant trade union leave and withholding of union dues in the context of a dispute between factions within the executive board, the Committee notes the information provided by the Government in relation to the situation of undefined leadership during which: (i) each group organized an assembly to expel the members of the opposing group and propose a new executive board; (ii) as a result of the conflicting requests of both groups, a new executive board could not be registered and therefore its members were not entitled to union leave ' the local trade union representatives were nevertheless still granted leave and the collective agreement still enforced; and (iii) union dues continued to be collected, but were deposited in a special holding account that was set up for this purpose at the Ministry of Finance. The Committee further notes that, according to the Government: (i) the dispute was resolved in late  when a new executive board was elected at a general assembly; and (ii) the union dues were subsequently transferred to the new board, whose members formally stated that they had been duly received and agreed to withdraw the complaint against the Director-General of the ISSS for the alleged misappropriation of these dues. Noting that, according to the Government, these issues have been resolved, and in the absence of conflicting information from the STISSS, the Committee will not pursue its examination of these allegations.
.Finally, as to the allegation of disciplinary proceedings against STISSS leaders (the trade union alleged that in all the hearings the courts ruled in favour of the officers, except in the case of Ms Bonilla de Alarcn, even though the proceedings had twice been declared null and void), the Committee notes the following information provided by the Government: (i) in a judgment of the Fourth Civil and Commercial Court of San Salvador, dated  January , the judge established beyond a reasonable doubt the worker s misconduct and granted the ISSS authorization to dismiss her; and (ii) the administration nevertheless, as a gesture of openness and goodwill, decided not to implement the judgment and, at the time of writing of the Government s last reply, the worker remained in her post under the same conditions as when she was hired.
.In relation to the Committee s recommendation that the authorities, together with the union, address the issues raised (in particular, the doctors' wage problems and the problems related to the trade union facilities) and promote dialogue between the ISSS and the SIMETRISSS in order to find common solutions, the Committee observes that, according to the Government: (i) a high-level round table including the trade union has been established, met on several occasions and begun preparing agreements to safeguard the rights of ISSS workers, covering issues such as arbitrary movements of employees, workers' benefits and employee wage levels; (ii) the alleged non-observation of the  wage agreement, mentioned by the SIMETRISSS in its complaint, is unfounded ' the Government specifies that it implemented the agreement through Executive Board Agreement No. -- of  June , whereby it agreed to apply the wage scale agreed with the SIMETRISSS as from  January , with the wages agreed upon; and (iii) the ISSS adjusted wages in two phases in  and  (by a total amount of over US$ million). As to the allegation of refusal of trade union facilities and obstacles to the posting of trade union announcements, the Committee notes with regret that the Government has not provided information on these matters. The Committee reiterates its previous recommendation in this regard and trusts that, as these issues have not been resolved, the authorities will ensure that they are addressed through the ongoing dialogue between the ISSS and the SIMETRISSS in order to find common solutions based on the principles of freedom of association referred to by the Committee in its previous examination of this case.
.With respect to the allegation that the ISSS Deputy Director for Health circulated instructions, in a  memorandum, among the directors and the management of the local medical centres to restrict trade union rights, the Committee duly notes the Government s explanations describing the content of the memorandum so as to demonstrate that it does not seek to restrict the exercise of freedom of association. The Committee observes the Government s indication that the text of the memorandum: (i) does not seek to prevent contact between the trade union representatives and the media, but rather, simply establishes that persons approached by the media should refer any consultation or request for an interview to the communication department; (ii) restricts the discussion of union related matters only to meetings where institutional management plan and coordinate working methods; and (iii) does not create an obligation to inform superiors of",0,2013,El Salvador
56,"meetings between trade union officials and members, or of activities of an official nature, and simply reminds directors that they must report any absences from work and the grounds for those absences, in compliance with the regulations on grounds for absence established in the collective agreement. Moreover, the Committee duly notes that the Government denies the allegation that a hospital director circulated instructions among management to penalize doctors participating in activities organized by the trade union ' clarifying that this director simply sent the memorandum in question to management. In the light of the foregoing and in the absence of additional information from the complainant organization, the Committee will not pursue its examination of these allegations on the understanding that, when implementing the memorandum, the competent authorities will ensure full respect for the principles of freedom of association.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to consider that this case does not call for further examination.
.The complaints are contained in a communication from the Trade Union of Workers of the Salvadorian Social Security Institute (STISSS), dated  January , and in a communication of the Union of Doctors of the Salvadorian Social Security Institute (SIMETRISSS), dated  June .
.In view of the lack of response from the Government, at its March  meeting [see st Report, para. ] the Committee made an urgent appeal to the Government and drew its attention to the fact that, in accordance with the procedural rules set out in paragraph  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session, it would present a report on the substance of the case at its next meeting, even if it had not received the information or observations from the Government in due time. To date, it has not received any information from the Government.
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Workers' Representatives Convention,  (No. ), and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  January , the STISSS alleges serious acts of interference in trade union affairs by the Director-General of the Salvadorian Social Security Institute (ISSS) in  and repeated public statements in the media to discredit the STISSS and its national executive board, accusing a group within the executive board of bankrupting the trade union with a deficit of more than US$,. According to the allegations, the Director-General acknowledged a minority group within the executive board; declared that the proposed nominations of union representatives did not comply with its statutes; suspended bilateral meetings claiming internal divisions and lack of leadership; did not recognize trade union leave; provided financial backing for five union officials with whom the ISSS Director-General continued to meet  and reach agreements'  and, although the extraordinary general assembly of  November'  December  elected the executive board, which was re-elected on  December at the ordinary general assembly, he illegally withheld the union dues (which had still not been received at the date of the complaint).
.The STISSS, moreover, reports that a series of criminal or labour proceedings to impose penalties were filed against various union officials, allegedly violating due process. In the end, the courts ruled in favour of the officials, except in the case of Ms Andrea Concepcin Bonilla de Alarcn, whose dismissal by the ISSS was authorized by the judicial authority, even though the proceedings had twice been declared null and void.
.In its communication dated  June , SIMETRISSS indicates that its members include , doctors of the ISSS, which employs , workers distributed across  workplaces, including a total of , doctors. The holder of the rights to the collective agreement ' which applies to all workers ' is not SIMETRISSS (which is the only trade union for doctors) but another trade union (STISSS). In this regard, the legislation states that only a trade union representing  per cent of the workers of the company or public institution is authorized to negotiate a collective agreement, which will thereafter apply to all the workers of that institution.
.SIMETRISSS indicates that it is not seeking to enter into a collective agreement with the ISSS, but that it wishes to reach an economic agreement to adjust the medical staff s wages, which have been frozen for the last  years. The ISSS administration refuses to do this on the grounds that it can only bargain with the trade union holding the bargaining rights. In this regard, the complainant indicates that, in , as a result of a strike held by the trade union, an agreement was signed amending the wage scale in force in the ISSS, increasing doctors' wages through the payment of three instalments, but that the successive ISSS administrations have, unfortunately, failed to comply with the agreement, refusing to enter into negotiations on the subject, especially when, in , the complainant requested the launch of collective bargaining. As a result, the purchasing power of doctors' wages has fallen by  per cent.
.Furthermore, the complainant reports the systematic and unjustified refusal of the facilities to carry out its trade union duties. In particular, the complainant refers to the following obstacles to its trade union activities:' refusal of paid trade union leave to enable its representatives to carry out trade union activities, despite having requested leave on various occasions, providing assurances that the leave will not impinge upon the quality of health services and, to that end, proposing that the administration only grant leave to five members of the executive board, at specific times in their working day. The employer (ISSS) argues, however, that the Labour Code only provides for paid union leave in respect of the bargaining rights holder;' the members of the executive board are prevented from accessing the institution s different workplaces, thereby violating their right to represent the members of the trade union (under the institutional regulations, workers can only enter the establishments in which they work);' obstacles to posting trade union announcements in workplaces, thereby interfering with the announcement of assemblies and other meetings organized by the union;' undue delays in communications with the ISSS administration, and the institutional representatives with decision-making powers, with a view to resolving collective disputes affecting the interests of doctors; this has occurred on a number of occasions leading to the suspension of meetings of the high-level round table set up with the ISSS to address socio-economic grievances, and to resolve labour disputes;' refusal to give union officials the information they need to carry out their duties, such as job descriptions, financial statements, institutional agreements, etc.;' the ISSS illegally withholds the union dues of members of the complainant union.
.Lastly, the complainant alleges restrictions to trade union activities through anti-union instructions that the ISSS Deputy Director for Health circulated among the directors and the management of the local medical centres, in a memorandum dated  April  entitled  administrative instructions'  containing a series of mandatory instructions aiming to prevent trade union activities. The contents of those instructions have the following effects:' they do not allow time for the trade unions to present situations or problems related to trade union activities in the administrative meetings held in the medical centres and attended by the doctors working in those centres;' they require the directors and management to report cases of dereliction of duty by staff under their authority, thereby seeking to prevent both the members of the executive board and the local trade union representatives from meeting workers to give them information on trade union objectives and provide the respective guidance on the trade union s operations, which does not, of course, prejudice the effective operation of health services given the brevity of those meetings. Furthermore, they require the Head of the Security Department to be informed of incidents affecting the proper operation of the workplace, thereby seeking to suppress the defence of just and legitimate grievances by the trade union through peaceful means of pressure not affecting patients;' they prevent contact between union representatives and the media by designating the communications officer as the only person authorized to deal with consultations and requests for interviews from the press. This restricts the freedom of expression and, worse still, violates citizens' right to receive accurate information regarding the situation of the ISSS health services.
.The complainant indicates that, in line with this approach, the ISSS management has sought to threaten the medical staff with disciplinary sanctions for supporting public complaints and means of pressure of the trade union, as was the case on  April , when the director of the specialized treatment hospital circulated instructions to the management of that centre to threaten doctors participating in activities organized by the trade union with sanctions.
.SIMETRISSS requests that Conventions Nos ,  and  and Recommendation No.  be respected.
.The Committee regrets that, despite the time that has elapsed since the presentation of the complaints, the",0,2013,El Salvador
57,"Government has not sent the requested information, even though the Committee requested it to do so through an urgent appeal at its March  meeting. The Committee urges the Government to be more cooperative in the future.
.Hence, in accordance with the applicable procedural rules [see th Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body], the Committee is obliged to present a report on the substance of the case without being able to take account of the information which it had hoped to receive from the Government.
.The Committee recalls that the purpose of the whole procedure established by the International Labour Organization for the examination of the allegations of violations of freedom of association is to ensure respect for trade union rights in law and in practice. The Committee is confident that, while this procedure protects governments against unreasonable accusations, they must recognize the importance of formulating, for objective examination, detailed replies concerning allegations brought against them.
.The Committee notes that in the present case the complainant alleges that: () the ISSS administration refuses to bargain with the complainant union on an agreement to adjust doctors' wages, which have been frozen for over  years, on the grounds that, in accordance with the Labour Code, it can only bargain with the trade union holding the bargaining rights within the ISSS, and it persists in ignoring an agreement that it signed in  with the complainant union, which would increase doctors' wages through the payment of three instalments; and () it refuses to provide trade union facilities and, in particular, to provide the union officials with the information that they need to carry out their duties, to provide paid union leave for the members of the executive board of the complainant union, as well as preventing union announcements from being posted in workplaces; the ISSS illegally withholds the union dues of the members of the complainant union and prevents communication with trade union representatives, suspending on a number of occasions the meetings of the high-level round table to address labour grievances and resolve disputes.
.The Committee observes that part of the problems raised in this case concern the refusal of the right to bargain collectively and trade union facilities for a minority trade union of doctors, while the ISSS majority trade union has signed a collective agreement which applies to everyone given that the trade union represents at least  per cent of the workers.
.In this regard, the Committee wishes to highlight the following principles [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , paras  and ]:' The Committee has pointed out on several occasions, and particularly during discussion on the draft of the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention, that the International Labour Conference referred to the question of the representative character of trade unions, and, to a certain extent, it agreed to the distinction that is sometimes made between the various unions concerned according to how representative they are. Article , paragraph , of the Constitution of the ILO includes the concept of  most representative' organizations. Accordingly, the Committee felt that the mere fact that the law of a country draws a distinction between the most representative trade union organizations and other trade union organizations is not in itself a matter for criticism. Such a distinction, however, should not result in the most representative organizations being granted privileges extending beyond that of priority in representation, on the ground of their having the largest membership, for such purposes as collective bargaining or consultation by governments, or for the purpose of nominating delegates to international bodies. In other words, this distinction should not have the effect of depriving trade union organizations that are not recognized as being among the most representative of the essential means for defending the occupational interests of their members, for organizing their administration and activities and formulating their programmes, as provided for in Convention No. .' Minority trade unions that have been denied the right to negotiate collectively should be permitted to perform their activities and at least to speak on behalf of their members and represent them in the case of an individual claim.
.The Committee notes that the allegations in this case indicate that the complainant doctors' union does not consider itself sufficiently represented, at least in terms of wages, by the majority trade union and that it reports that wages have been frozen for over  years, that the purchasing power of doctors' wages has fallen by  per cent since  and that, under an agreement signed in  (which, according to the allegations, the ISSS refuses to honour), the wage scale for doctors should have been adjusted at that time.
.In the absence of a reply from the Government, the Committee stresses the importance for the authorities, together with the complainant union, to address the issues and problems raised in the complaint and, in this regard, requests the Government to take measures to promote dialogue between the ISSS and the complainant in order to find shared solutions to the doctors' wage problems and to the problems related to trade union facilities, taking into account the principles and considerations outlined above and the principles of Convention No.  (which El Salvador has ratified) and Recommendation No.  concerning workers' representatives. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.The Committee takes note of the allegations of the complainant union regarding: () the instructions that the ISSS Deputy Director for Health circulated among the directors and the management of the local medical centres, in a memorandum in , which, according to the allegations, seriously restricts trade union rights (according to the allegations, they aim to prevent contact between the trade union representatives and the media; do not allow time in administrative meetings for the trade union representatives to present problems related to trade union activities; and create the obligation to inform superiors of meetings between trade union officials and members, and of industrial action by the union); and () the instructions given by a hospital director, on  April , to threaten doctors participating in activities organized by the trade union with sanctions. The Committee urges the Government to send its observations on these allegations without delay.
.The Committee takes note of the allegations presented by the STISSS concerning acts of favouritism by the authorities in the context of a dispute between factions within the executive board. The Committee underlines that respect for the principles of freedom of association requires that the public authorities exercise great restraint in relation to intervention in the internal affairs of trade unions. It is even more important that employers exercise restraint in this regard. They should not, for example, do anything which might seem to favour one group within a union at the expense of another [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ]. The Committee urges the Government to send its observations on these allegations, without delay, to provide it with sufficient information for the complaint to be examined.
.The Committee expects that the Government will respond to all the pending issues, submitting also information from the ISSS.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee regrets the lack of response from the Government, even though it made an urgent appeal at its March  meeting, and requests the Government to be more cooperative in the future, responding to all the pending issues in this case and including information from the ISSS.Allegations concerning SIMETRISSS(b) The Committee stresses the importance for the authorities, together with the complainant union, to address the issues and problems raised in the complaint and, in this regard, requests the Government to take measures to promote dialogue between the ISSS and the complainant in order to find shared solutions to the doctors' wage problems and to the problems related to trade union facilities, taking into account the principles and considerations outlined above and the principles of Convention No.  (which El Salvador has ratified) and Recommendation No.  concerning workers' representatives. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.(c) While it takes note of the allegations presented by the complainant union regarding: () the instructions that the ISSS Deputy Director for Health circulated among the directors and managers of local medical centres, in a memorandum in , which, according to the allegations, seriously restricts trade union rights (preventing contact between the trade union representatives and the media; not allowing time in administrative meetings for the trade union representatives to present problems related to trade union activities; and creating the obligation to inform superiors of meetings between trade union officials and members, and of trade union activities); and () the instructions given by a hospital director, on  April , to threaten doctors participating in activities organized by the trade union with sanctions. The Committee urges the Government to send its observations on",0,2013,El Salvador
58,"these allegations without delay.Allegations concerning STISSS(d) While it observes that the complaint presented by STISSS concerns allegations of acts of favouritism by the ISSS authorities in the context of a dispute between factions within the executive board, the Committee urges the Government to send its observations on these allegations without delay, so as to enable it to examine the complaint in full knowledge of the facts.",-1,2013,El Salvador
59,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the Union of Workers of the National Centre of Registries (STCNR) dated  August . This organization sent additional information and new allegations in communications dated  October  and  March .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  May .
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  August , the STCNR alleges that, having negotiated and signed a collective agreement with the National Centre of Registries (CNR) in April , following the corresponding legal and financial examination by that Centre (which verified that the institution had the necessary budgetary resources), it received a ruling from the Minister of Finance, dated  July , containing an unfavourable opinion with respect to the approval of the collective agreement.
.In its communication of  October , the STCNR indicates that, in view of the above, the parties to the negotiation agreed to make the clauses relating to the duration of the collective agreement clearer, specifying that it would come into force on  January . They accordingly signed a new collective agreement, adding a text signed by the parties and addressed to the Minister for the Economy (indicating that the workers will continue to receive the current financial benefits with some slight increases, thereby demonstrating that the collective agreement was reasonable and could be funded) and another explanatory text addressed to the Minister of Finance.
.In its communication of  March , the STCNR reports that eventually, on  February , the collective agreement was registered by the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare following its approval by the Minister for the Economy and the Minister of Finance.
.In its communication of  May , the Government responds to the complaint by the STCNR and reports that on  September  the trade union presented a draft collective labour agreement to the CNR authorities to initiate the procedure for the agreement to be negotiated, signed and registered. In accordance with section  of the Labour Code, which states that:  To be valid, a collective agreement signed with an autonomous official institution shall first be approved by the ministry concerned, after the Ministry of Finance has given its opinion'  the CNR authorities submitted the draft collective labour agreement to the Minister of Economy and the Minister of Finance, and received an unfavourable opinion on the grounds that the financial clauses could not be funded under the public sector cost-saving and austerity policies for .
.The Government further indicates that, for that reason, the CNR and the trade union of that institution examined the grounds for the unfavourable opinion issued in relation to the collective labour agreement with a view to addressing the observations regarding the public sector cost-saving and austerity policies for , and that the corresponding amendments were made.
.Subsequently, on  September , the CNR sent the collective labour agreement to the Minister of Economy, addressing the observations made by the Minister of Finance. On  February , the Minister of Economy indicated that it had no objection to the approval of the collective labour agreement including the new changes, considering that they addressed the observations made by the Minister of Finance regarding clauses  (salary adjustments) and  (Voluntary Retirement Fund).
.The Government adds that, on  February , members of the trade union executive board submitted the collective labour agreement to the National Department of Social Organizations of the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare for registration on  February , and that the agreement was registered.
.The Committee observes that the complainant in this case alleges that the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Economy issued an unfavourable opinion regarding the collective agreement between the STCNR and the CNR.
.The Committee observes that the Government reports that both ministries indicated that the financial clauses of the collective agreement could not be funded under the public sector cost-saving and austerity policy for . The Committee notes that the Government indicates that, having addressed the observations made by the financial authority and introduced the corresponding amendments, the parties resubmitted the draft collective agreement to both ministries and that the Minister of Economy confirmed that the observations had been duly addressed.
.Lastly, while it highlights that the examination of collective agreement clauses with a financial impact by the financial authorities should take place during the collective bargaining process and not, as has occurred in this, and in other cases brought before the Committee, after the collective agreement has been signed by the parties, as this is incompatible with the principle of free and voluntary collective bargaining and the principle according to which  agreements should be binding on the parties' [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ], the Committee notes with interest that the complainant and the Government confirm that the collective agreement was registered by the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare on  February . In that light, and given that the problem that gave rise to this complaint has been resolved, the Committee will not pursue the examination of this case.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.",1,2012,El Salvador
60,".The complaint in this case is contained in a communication from the General Trade Union of Transport Workers and Affiliated Industries of El Salvador (SGTITAS) and the Autonomous Confederation of Salvadorian Workers (CATS) dated  August .
.In the absence of a reply from the Government, the Committee was obliged to postpone its examination of this case. At its May June  meeting [see th Report, para. ], the Committee made an urgent appeal to the Government indicating that, in accordance with the procedural rules set out in paragraph  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body, it could present a report on the substance of the case at its next meeting, even if the requested information or observations had not been received in time. To date, the Government has not sent any information.
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communication dated  August , the SGTITAS and the CATS allege that, on  May , the United Mexican Transport Enterprise (TRUME SA de CV) verbally dismissed without just cause the General Secretary of the SGTITAS branch, Mr Porfirio Andrs Marroqun Serrano. The complainants state that the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, through the Special Unit on Prevention of Discriminatory Labour Practices of the General Labour Inspection Directorate, conducted an initial inspection on  May , during which it noted that the company s legal representative had violated sections  and () of the Labour Code governing, respectively, trade union immunity and the obligation to pay compensation for any stoppage for which the employer bears responsibility; on that occasion, the enterprise claimed to be unaware of the union s existence and of the dismissed employee s status as union officer; the inspection report recommended that Mr Porfirio Andrs Marroqun Serrano be reinstated and that he be paid compensation in the amount of US$, and set a time limit of three working days to remedy the reported violations. The Special Unit on Prevention of Discriminatory Labour Practices conducted a second inspection on  June  and found that the violations noted during the first inspection had not been remedied.
.The complainant organizations state that in order to exert pressure on the enterprise to reinstate Mr Marroqun Serrano, they stopped work on  transport units on enterprise premises for approximately  hours on  June . On that occasion, the Special Unit on Prevention of Discriminatory Labour Practices carried out a third inspection, during which it noted that the observed violations had still not been remedied and set a time limit of three working days to do so. On  June , a meeting was held on enterprise premises which was attended by the General Secretary of the Autonomous Trade Union Federation of Salvadorian Workers; the General Secretary of the Trade Union Federation of Independent Workers; Mr Porfirio Andrs Marroqun Serrano; and the enterprise s President and legal representative. The complainants state that, in the course of that meeting, the enterprise representative informed those present that it had been agreed in a meeting with the company partners not to reinstate Mr Marroqun Serrano. On  June , the Special Unit on Prevention of Discriminatory Labour Practices carried out a fourth inspection, during which it noted that the observed violations had still not been remedied. The complainant organizations add that a complaint has been filed with the Fourth Labour Court of San Salvador and that the proceedings are in the evidence gathering phase.
.The complainant organizations also allege that the enterprise, through its legal representative, had coerced the workers to revoke their membership of the SGTITAS branch, including the members of the branch s executive committee. The branch members submitted their membership cancellations to the General Secretary of the SGTITAS.
.The Committee regrets that, despite the time that has passed since the complaint was presented, the Government has not replied to any of the allegations made by the complainant, although it has been invited several times, including by urgent appeal, to send its observations or information on this case. The Committee urges the Government to be more cooperative in the future.
.Under these circumstances, and in accordance with the applicable rules of procedure [see th Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session], the Committee is obliged to present a report on the substance of the case without being able to take account of the information which it had hoped to receive from the Government.
.The Committee reminds the Government that the purpose of the whole procedure established by the International Labour Organization for the examination of allegations of violations of freedom of association is to promote respect for the freedom of association rights of workers and employers, both in fact and in law. The Committee is confident that, while this procedure protects governments against unreasonable accusations, they must recognize the importance of formulating, for objective examination, detailed replies concerning allegations brought against them [see First Report of the Committee, para. ].
.The Committee notes that this case concerns allegations of dismissal of a trade union officer by TRUME SA de CV and allegations of coercion of workers to revoke their trade union membership.
.Concerning the first allegation, the Committee notes that the Special Unit on Prevention of Discriminatory Labour Practices of the General Labour Inspection Directorate carried out four inspections, on  May and ,  and  June , in which it found that Mr Porfirio Andrs Marroqun Serrano s dismissal on  May  violated articles  and () of the Labour Code, relating respectively to trade union immunity (prohibiting the dismissal of trade union officers during their term of office) and to payment of compensation for any stoppage (of work) for which the employer bears responsibility; and that the enterprise had hitherto (at the time of the fourth inspection) failed to remedy those violations. The Committee also notes that a complaint has been filed with the Fourth Labour Court of San Salvador and that the legal proceedings are in the evidence gathering phase. The Committee requests the Government to send its observations, obtain the enterprise s comments through the relevant employers' organization, and keep the Committee informed of the progress of the ongoing judicial proceedings. The Committee recalls in general terms that no person should be dismissed or prejudiced in employment by reason of trade union membership or legitimate trade union activities, and it is important to forbid and penalize in practice all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of employment [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ]. The Committee requests the Government to ensure that, if the court rules that the union officer s dismissal was anti-union in nature, steps will be taken to reinstate him immediately.
.As regards the allegations that the enterprise coerced workers to revoke their union membership, the Committee notes that according to the allegations, the enterprise coerced all of its workers, including the members of the branch s executive committee, to revoke their membership of the SGTITAS branch, resulting in the branch members submitting their membership cancellations to the General Secretary of the organization. The Committee requests the Government to send its observations in this regard and to obtain the enterprise s comments on the allegations through the relevant employers' organization. The Committee requests the Government and the complainant organizations to state whether any official complaints have been lodged with the authorities in relation to these allegations. In general terms, the Committee notes that any coercion of workers or trade union officers to revoke their union membership constitutes a violation of the principle of freedom of association, in violation of Convention No. .
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee regrets that, despite the time that has passed since the complaint was presented, the Government has not replied to any of the allegations made by the complainant organizations, although it has been invited several times, including by urgent appeal, to send its observations or information on this case. The Committee urges the Government to be more cooperative in the future.(b)	As regards the dismissal of the trade union officer, Mr Porfirio Andrs Marroqun Serrano, the Committee requests the Government to send its observations, obtain the enterprise s comments through the relevant employers' organization, and keep the Committee informed of the progress of the ongoing judicial proceedings. The Committee requests the Government to ensure that, if the court rules that the union officer s dismissal was anti-union in nature, steps will be taken to reinstate him immediately.(c)	Concerning the allegations that the enterprise pressured workers to revoke their union membership, the Committee requests the Government to send its observations in this regard. It requests the Government and the complainant organizations to state whether any formal complaints have been lodged with the authorities in relation to these allegations.",1,2012,El Salvador
61,".The complaint was presented in a communication dated  August  from the National Association of Private Enterprises (ANEP).
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  February .
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  August , the ANEP alleges that, on  August , the President of the Republic introduced a proposal to reform  organic laws on official autonomous institutions, without consulting the employers' and workers' organizations, and that the reform would modify the former s participation in the said institutions by empowering the President to designate the employer sector s representatives on their management boards, thereby violating ILO Convention No.  and, specifically, the right of employers' organizations to choose their representatives freely and the obligation for public authorities to abstain from any intervention that is liable to restrict that right or impede its legal exercise.
.The ANEP states that the proposed reform violates the principle of independence of employers' and workers' organizations and, by empowering the President to decide who should represent the employer sector in autonomous institutions (which currently have joint or tripartite management boards), constitutes a form of interference that goes against the provisions of Conventions Nos  and .
.The ANEP alleges that this is contrary to the principles laid down by the Committee on Freedom of Association with regard to tripartite consultation and the participation of employers' and workers' organizations in joint and tripartite bodies. According to the Committee on Freedom of Association, preventing an organization from taking part in the joint and tripartite bodies of a sector or industry in which it is representative is an infringement of the principles of freedom of association.
.The ANEP adds that the Committee of Experts has drawn attention to organizational principles for the governance and proper administration of social security institutions, whereby the process is supervised by the public authorities and administered jointly by employers and workers, whose contributions account for the bulk of the social security system s revenue. A reform such as that proposed, under which it would be the President who appoints the employers' representatives in institutions as important as social security, is contrary to the organizational principles for their proper administration laid down by the ILO in defence of the workers and employers who contribute to the system.
.The ANEP emphasizes that El Salvador has ratified the ILO s Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention,  (No. ), which requires States Members to hold national tripartite consultations on any proposed reform of the law. The statutes/rules of El Salvador s Higher Labour Council, which is a tripartite body, stipulate that the Council must be consulted on any proposed new law prior to its introduction. However, no formal or informal tripartite consultations of the workers' and employers' organizations within the Council has been held on the proposed reform of  laws, and this violates both the letter and the spirit of ILO Convention No. , as well as of the law establishing the Higher Labour Council as the designated consultative body.
.The ANEP adds that the proposed reform of  laws on official autonomous institutions, so as to restrict the free exercise of the employer sector s right to appoint its representatives on the management boards of such institutions as the Social Security Institute (ISSS) and the Social Housing Fund (FSV), undermines the sector s representative capacity. The ANEP recalls that, under article , paragraph (d), of the ILO Constitution, a State Member that ratifies a Convention commits itself to take such action as may be necessary to make its provisions effective, that is to say the State is under an obligation not just to include the Convention in the country s domestic legislation but also to ensure its implementation in practice.
.The application of ILO Conventions Nos , ,  and  entails the conduct of tripartite consultations on any proposal to reform the Social Security Act, the Social Housing Fund Act, etc., and it is thus a fundamental responsibility of the State to consult the sectors concerned before introducing any such reform.
.The ANEP states that its complaint against the State and Government of El Salvador is presented on the grounds that they are violating the provisions of ILO Conventions Nos , ,  and  and infringing the Association s right to appoint its representatives freely in  autonomous institutions (notably the ISSS, the FSV, etc.), and that the public authorities are guilty of acts of interference in that they are promoting legislative reforms that violate the principle of the independence of employers' organizations in the exercise of their activities, the principle whereby the State is required to hold tripartite consultations before introducing legislative reforms and the principle of equity in the membership of tripartite bodies.
.Among the reforms it challenges, the ANEP includes that of the National Institute for Vocational Training (NIVT), which the Committee on Freedom of Association has already examined at its March  meeting [see th Report, Case No. ].
.In its response to the ANEP s complaint, the Government states in a communication dated  February  that on  August  the President of the Republic, through the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare, sent three communications calling on the Legislative Assembly to introduce three draft legislative decrees revising the Vocational Training Act (examined by the Committee on Freedom of Association in a previous case), the Social Security Act and the Social Housing Fund Act.
.The Government states that the constitutional basis and grounds for the proposed legislative decrees can be found in article . of the Constitution of El Salvador, which empowers the President of the Republic to introduce legislation through the government ministries, and in article . of the Constitution, which confers on the President the responsibility and obligation to ensure the efficient management and conduct of public affairs. The proposed legislative reforms are designed to establish a legal mandate for the public administration to select the most competent officials from the private sector by broadening and diversifying the number of the appointees so as to enhance the participation and representation of the employer sector in official autonomous institutions such as the ISSS and the FSV, in full compliance with the President s constitutional powers and duties.
.The Government notes that, far from reducing the employer sector s participation in the said institutions' management boards, the proposed reforms are designed to broaden, democratize and enhance the representativity of the various branches of private enterprise in official autonomous institutions. The institutions will continue to be autonomous, that is to say they will retain their juridical personality, their own assets and their technical, administrative and financial independence, in accordance with the terms of the Acts under which they were created, but they will be subject to the authority, management and guidance of the central administration so as to be able to provide the community rapidly, appropriately and efficiently with the public services called for under their respective mandates.
.Regarding the ANEP s allegation that the proposed reforms violate ILO Conventions Nos , ,  and  by undermining the ANEP s right to appoint its representatives freely on  autonomous institutions (notably the ISSS and the FSV), the Government considers that the complainant s claims have no basis in fact and are irrelevant, inasmuch as the proposals are made in the legitimate exercise of the President s attributions and responsibilities under article . of the Constitution, where they are defined as including  the efficient management and conduct of public affairs' 
.The Government concludes that the international labour standards ratified by El Salvador have not been violated and, in so far as the complainant s allegations have in its opinion no basis in fact, requests that Case No.  be dismissed.
.The Committee observes that in the present complaint the ANEP alleges that, without consulting the Higher Labour Council (national tripartite body), the President of the Republic presented the Legislative Assembly with a proposal to reform  basic laws on official autonomous institutions in areas that affect the interests of the employers' sector (notably the ISSS, the FSV, etc.) and that the proposed reforms would empower the President to appoint the employers' and workers' representatives on the institutions' management boards. The ANEP states that this is an infringement of the right of employers' organizations to elect their representatives freely, of the principle of non interference by the authorities in the exercise of their activities, of the principle of independence of employers' organizations and of the principle of tripartite consultation and of equity in the membership of bipartite and tripartite bodies, in violation of ILO Conventions Nos , ,  and  ratified by El Salvador.
.The Committee takes note of the Government s statement in its reply that: () the President s right to propose legislation is recognized by the Constitution, as is its responsibility and obligation to ensure the efficient management and conduct of public affairs",1,2012,El Salvador
62,"(article . of the Constitution), and the Government therefore considers that the President s action falls within his legitimate powers and that ILO Conventions Nos , ,  and  have not been violated; () in order to fulfil the said obligation effectively, the President s proposed reforms are designed to enable the public administration to select the most competent officials from the private sector by broadening and diversifying the number of appointees so as to enhance the participation and representation of the employer sector in official autonomous institutions; and () the purpose of the proposed reforms is to broaden, democratize and enhance the representativity of the various branches of private enterprise in official autonomous institutions.
.The Committee concludes from the Government s reply that: () the proposed reform of  laws on autonomous institutions (the ISSS, the FSV and the NIVT) which the Executive presented to the Legislative Assembly were not submitted to the Higher Labour Council so that it could hold the prior consultations provided for in the law establishing this tripartite body; and () the Government recognizes that the proposed reform enables the public administration to appoint the representatives of the private sector, which it justifies by the reform s objective of enhancing the representativity of the various branches of private enterprise in official autonomous institutions. In these circumstances, the Committee can only conclude that the legislative proposals in question are in grave conflict with the principle of autonomy, the principle of non interference by the authorities in the activities of employers' and workers' organizations, the right of those organizations to elect their representatives freely and the principle of prior tripartite consultation in matters of legislation, and that they therefore constitute a direct and serious violation of ILO Conventions Nos , , and . The Committee deplores this situation.
.Given the circumstances, the Committee draws the Government s attention to the principle that tripartite consultation should take place before the Government submits a draft to the Legislative Assembly or establishes a labour, social or economic policy and to the importance that the introduction of draft legislation affecting collective bargaining or conditions of employment should be preceded by full and detailed consultations with the appropriate organizations of workers and employers [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , paras  and ]. The Committee has emphasized the importance that should be attached to full and frank consultations taking place on any questions or proposed legislation affecting trade union rights [see Digest, op. cit., para. ], and recalls that the process of consultation on legislation helps to give laws, programmes and measures adopted or applied by public authorities a firmer justification and to ensure that they are well respected and successfully applied; the Government should seek general consensus as much as possible, given that employers' and workers' organizations should be able to share in the responsibility of securing the well-being and prosperity of the community as a whole, this being particularly important in light of the growing complexity of the problems faced by societies and of the fact that no public authority can claim to have all the answers or assume that its proposals will naturally achieve all of their objectives [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. The Committee calls upon the Government to abide by these principles fully in the future.
.Consequently, the Committee requests the Government to ensure that the representatives of workers' and employers' organizations on tripartite bodies are appointed by them freely, and that in-depth consultations are urgently held with those organizations within the Higher Labour Council, so that mutual agreement can be reached on ensuring the balanced tripartite composition of the management boards of the autonomous institutions referred to in the complaint (notably the ISSS, the FSV and the NIVT), and that the shared decision so reached is submitted without delay to the Legislative Assembly in the course of its examination of the legislative reform previously proposed by the Government.
.In the light of the foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee draws the attention of the Government to the principles set out in its conclusions with respect to the free appointment of employers' representatives and to tripartite consultation, and requests the Government to respect those principles fully in the future.(b)	The Committee requests that the Government urgently conduct in-depth consultations with the workers' and employers' organizations within the Higher Labour Council so that mutual agreement can be reached on ensuring the balanced tripartite composition of the management boards of the autonomous institutions referred to in the complaint (notably the ISSS, the FSV and the NIVT), and that the shared decision so reached be submitted without delay to the Legislative Assembly in the course of its examination of the legislative reform previously proposed by the Government.(c)	The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the developments in this regard.",-1,2012,El Salvador
63,".The Committee last examined this case at its October November  meeting and, on that occasion, presented a provisional report to the Governing Body [see th Report, paras ' , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (October November )].
.The complainant organization submitted additional information in a communication of  February .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication of  December .
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Workers' Representatives Convention,  (No. ), and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.At its October November  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendation on the matters still pending [see th Report, para. ]:With regard to the alleged death threats, regretting that the Government has not provided information about the trade unionist whose full name it already knows, and that the complainant trade union has not provided the additional information requested concerning the identities of the two other trade unionists concerned, the Committee: (i) firmly expects that the Government will follow up, with the trade union, the allegation of death threats against Mr Jorge Augusto Hernndez Velsquez; and (ii) again requests the complainant trade union to furnish the Government with the full names of the other trade unionists mentioned in its complaint so that the Government can pursue the matter and inform the Committee of the outcome.
.In its communication of  February , in response to the Committee s request, the complainant union submits the names of the other unionists that it alleges have been affected by threats of being burnt alive by road transport workers affected by the labour stoppage: Ms Krissia Meny Guadalupe Flores (Women s Secretariat), Ms Odila Dolores Marroqun Cornejo (General Secretary of the Union Governing Body), Mr Daniel Rivas and Mr Jos Manuel Lima Hernndez.
.In its communication of  December , the Government indicates that the National Civil Police provided protection for the persons mentioned by the complainant union, who were inside the Customs Administrator s Office at the time when the crowd of road transport workers was trying to enter and attack them. The Government states that the police kept watch over the unionists until a staff vehicle of the Directorate-General of Customs arrived to evacuate them, which was done by an alternative route, as a security measure for these people. The Government specifies that, according to the National Civil Police, at no time did these people receive threats of being burnt alive.
.The Committee observes that the only matter pending in relation to this case concerns the allegation of death threats against various unionists by road transport workers that are alleged to have been affected by a stoppage of activities in the context of a collective labour dispute. The Committee observes that the Government states that, according to the police, the alleged death threats did not occur but that, in the face of imminent risk of attack by the road transport workers, it protected and kept watch over the above unionists, and also evacuated them so as to ensure their security. Furthermore, the Committee observes that the complainant union does not state that it has made criminal complaints concerning the alleged death threats. In these circumstances and on the understanding that the Government will continue to provide all necessary protection measures, as appropriate and in full collaboration with the complainant organization, the Committee will not pursue its examination of this allegation.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions and on the understanding that the Government will continue to provide all necessary protection measures, as appropriate and in full collaboration with the complainant organization, the Committee invites the Governing Body to consider that this case requires no further examination.
.The Committee examined the case at its meeting in October  and presented, on that occasion, an interim report to the Governing Body [see rd Report, paras ' , approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session (October  November )].
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  May .
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Workers' Representatives Convention,  (No. ) and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.At its October  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendations on the matters still pending [see rd Report, para. ].(a)	As the versions of the complainant organization and the Government relating to the alleged detention of two trade unionists are contradictory, the Committee invites the complainant union to provide additional information.(b)	The Committee requests the complainant organization to provide additional information to the Government and the Committee, and to indicate whether it has lodged a criminal complaint with the Office of the Public Prosecutor in respect of the alleged threats made by road transport workers to kill three trade unionists, who were denied police protection, and to indicate the full names of the trade unionists in question (only the name of Mr Jorge Augusto Hernndez Velsquez was mentioned in the allegations). The Committee requests the Government to provide detailed information on these allegations and, if the allegations are confirmed, to provide protection to the trade unionists in question.(c)	The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed about the result of the arbitration procedures initiated by the Civil Service Tribunal regarding collective bargaining between the complainant trade union and the Ministry of Finance.
.In its communication of  May  the Government provides information on the collective bargaining process which was initiated in November . With regard to the outcome of the arbitration process mandated by the Civil Service Tribunal on collective bargaining between the complainant trade union and the Ministry of Finance, the Government states that through a Tribunal resolution of  December , the clauses agreed at the arbitration were added to the clauses which the parties had already agreed upon in the earlier stages of the collective bargaining, and that these clauses together constituted the arbitration decision. In this way, the collective labour agreement between SITRAMHA and the Ministry of Finance for the period '  was drawn up. On  December  the Civil Service Tribunal, through a resolution, authorized the certification of this final document, so that the collective labour agreement could be registered with the Ministry of Labour. On  December  the General Secretary of SITRAMHA submitted the copies of the arbitration decision for registration and through a Ministry of Labour resolution of  December  the decision was registered as a collective labour agreement with a term of three years, expiring on  December .
.The Government also indicates that SITRAMHA has initiated a new collective bargaining process with a view to promoting the revision of the collective labour agreement for the period ' , and that discussions are at the direct negotiation stage.
.With regard to the allegations of death threats made to three trade unionists by transport workers and the police s refusal to provide protection, the Government requests the Committee to reiterate to the complainant trade union that it must give the full names of the trade unionists who allege that they were being threatened. It recalls that without this information it cannot conduct a thorough search of the registers of the National Civil Police, which it must do in order to be able to respond comprehensively to the allegations of denial of police protection.
.The Committee duly notes that the collective bargaining process that was initiated in November  concluded in December  with the registration of a new collective bargaining agreement for the period ' , which incorporated clauses agreed upon by the parties in the direct negotiation and conciliation stages and other clauses that were agreed at the arbitration stage. The Committee also notes that a new collective bargaining process initiated by the complainant trade union, with a view to promoting the revision of the collective labour agreement for the period ' , is currently under way.
.As regards the alleged detention of two trade union leaders the Committee recalls that, on the one hand, the complainant alleged that the leaders were handcuffed and detained temporarily in police custody without being informed of the charges against them; and on the other hand, that the Government responded that the alleged arrest and detention never happened and that the police had provided protection to these individuals when a mob of transport workers attempted to assault them [see th Report, para. , and rd Report, para. ]. Presented with these contradictory versions of events at its previous examination of the case, the Committee requested the complainant trade union to provide additional information. The Committee regrets not having received any such information and, given the time that has elapsed without any attempt by the complainant trade union to supply more details, it will not pursue an investigation of these allegations.
.With regard to the allegation of death threats made to",1,2012,El Salvador
64,"three trade unionists the Committee regrets that the Government has not provided the full information that was requested, stating that it needs the names of the three trade unionists while disregarding the fact that the complainant trade union provided the name of one of them (Mr Jorge Augusto Hernndez Velsquez) in its communication of  May , which was reproduced in the Committee s previous reports related to this case [see th Report, para. , and rd Report, para. ]. The Committee firmly expects that the Government will follow up, with the complainant trade union, the allegation of death threats made against Mr Jorge Augusto Hernndez Velsquez. The Committee also notes with regret that the complainant trade union has not provided the requested information relating to the identities of the two other trade unionists concerned. The Committee again requests the complainant trade union to furnish the Government with the full names of the other trade unionists mentioned in its complaint so that the Government can pursue the matter and inform the Committee of the outcome.
.In the light of the foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:With regard to the alleged death threats, regretting that the Government has not provided information about the trade unionist whose full name it already knows, and that the complainant trade union has not provided the additional information requested concerning the identities of the two other trade unionists concerned, the Committee: (i) firmly expects that the Government will follow up, with the trade union, the allegation of death threats against Mr Jorge Augusto Hernndez Velsquez; and (ii) again requests the complainant trade union to furnish the Government with the full names of the other trade unionists mentioned in its complaint so that the Government can pursue the matter and inform the Committee of the outcome.
.The Committee examined this case at its meeting in October  and presented an interim report to the Governing Body [see th Report, paras ' , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (October )].
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  May .
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Workers' Representatives Convention,  (No. ), and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.At its meeting in October , the Committee made the following recommendations on the matters still pending [see th Report, para. ]:' The Committee requests the Government to provide as a matter of urgency full information on all of the allegations (including the two union officers' arrest and detention, their current situation and the police s alleged failure to take action on death threats which three union members received from transport workers) and on the administrative or judicial proceedings initiated in this regard. ?The Committee requests the complainant and the Government to send information about the current status of the collective bargaining process.
.In its communication dated  May , the Government states in relation to the alleged detention of Ms Krissia Meny Guadalupe Flores and Ms Odilia Dolores Marroqun Cornejo, who, according to the complaint presented, are the Secretary for Women s Issues and the Secretary-General of the executive committee of the Union of Workers of the Ministry of Finance (SITRAMHA), on  November , at the El Amatillo customs office, that the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare has conducted the relevant consultations, from which it appears that the allegations of the arrest and detention of the trade unionists are untrue and without any legal basis. The documentation provided by the National Civil Police indicates that the procedure followed on  November  at the El Amatillo customs office by police officers consisted of providing protection to the persons referred to above, who were inside the customs administrator s office, when a mob of road transport workers tried to enter and assault them. The police officers took them into custody as a safety measure until a vehicle from the General Directorate of Customs, which transports customs officials, arrived to evacuate them. At no time were they detained. The Office of the Public Prosecutor of the Republic has also indicated that the persons referred to above were never reported as detainees by the National Civil Police and no complaints against them are either currently under investigation or have been closed.
.In view of the above, the Government considers that there is no legitimate basis for the complaint and that the case should be closed.
.With regard to the allegations concerning: () the detention of two trade union leaders (Ms Krissia Meny Guadalupe Flores and Ms Odilia Dolores Marroqun Cornejo); () the alleged sexual intimidation suffered by the Secretary-General Ms Krissia Meny Guadalupe Flores; and () the refusal to provide protection to two trade unionists and to a trade union leader (Mr Jorge Augusto Hernndez Velsquez), who had received death threats from some road transport workers; the Committee notes the Government s statements to the effect that the trade unionists were not detained, but were protected from a mob of road transport workers threatening to assault them when they were in the customs administrator s office, and were taken to a vehicle used to transport employees of the General Directorate of Customs in order to evacuate the trade unionists as a safety measure.
.The Committee notes this information and also that, according to the Government, no proceedings have been initiated against these trade unionists. Given that the versions of the complainant and the Government relating to the alleged detentions are contradictory, the Committee invites the complainant union to provide additional information.
.The Committee notes with regret that, despite being expressly requested to do so, the Government has not sent any information about the current status of the collective bargaining process that began in November  between the complainant trade union and the Ministry of Finance. In this respect, the Committee recalls that the Civil Service Tribunal had issued an order initiating arbitration procedures, which were delayed as a result of the reallocation of the arbitrators appointed by the Ministry of Finance [see th Report, para. ]. The Committee therefore requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.The Committee regrets that the Government has not sent its observations on the death threats against three trade unionists, who were allegedly threatened by international road transport workers with being burned alive, and to whom the police allegedly denied police protection [see th Report, para. ]. The Committee notes in this respect that the complainant organization only indicated the full name of one of the threatened trade unionists (Mr Jorge Augusto Hernndez Velsquez), but not of the other two. The Committee requests the complainant organization to provide additional information to the Government and the Committee, and to indicate the names of the other two trade unionists and whether a criminal complaint has been lodged with the Office of the Public Prosecutor in respect of the alleged threats. The Committee also requests the Government to provide full information on these allegations and, if the allegations are confirmed, to provide protection to the trade unionists in question.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) As the versions of the complainant organization and the Government relating to the alleged detention of two trade unionists are contradictory, the Committee invites the complainant union to provide additional information.(b) The Committee requests the complainant organization to provide additional information to the Government and the Committee, and to indicate whether it has lodged a criminal complaint with the Office of the Public Prosecutor in respect of the alleged threats made by road transport workers to kill three trade unionists, who were denied police protection, and to indicate the full names of the trade unionists in question (only the name of Mr Jorge Augusto Hernndez Velsquez was mentioned in the allegations). The Committee requests the Government to provide detailed information on these allegations and, if the allegations are confirmed, to provide protection to the trade unionists in question.(c) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed about the result of the arbitration procedures initiated by the Civil Service Tribunal regarding collective bargaining between the complainant trade union and the Ministry of Finance.
.The complaint in the present case is contained in a communication from the Union of Workers of the Ministry of Finance (SITRAMHA) dated  May .
.In the absence of a reply from the Government, the Committee was obliged to postpone its examination of the case. At its May June  meeting [see th Report, para. ], the Committee made an urgent appeal to the Government indicating that, in accordance with the procedural rules set out in paragraph  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body, it could present a report on the substance of the case at its next meeting, even if the requested information or observations had not been received in",1,2012,El Salvador
65,"time. To date, the Government has not sent any information.
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Workers' Representatives Convention,  (No. ), and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.In a communication dated  May , the SITRAMHA explains that, on  November , it presented a list of demands to the Civil Service Tribunal, and that the delay in the commencement of bargaining gave rise to a collective labour dispute. The direct negotiation phase of the dispute began on  February and ended in April ; in the conciliation phase, which began on  June  and ended on  July , only  of the  clauses in the draft collective agreement were approved. The complainant adds that members at an extraordinary general meeting held on  July  agreed to take direct action in the form of a nationwide work stoppage (to obtain a financial bonus, payment of incapacity benefit, etc. through bargaining). On  August , the Civil Service Tribunal issued an order initiating arbitration procedures. However, the complainant states that the arbitration was also delayed as a result of the resignation on  September  of the arbitrators appointed by the Ministry of Finance, one hour before they were due to be sworn in. The work stoppage agreed on at the  July  extraordinary general meeting went ahead on ,  and  November .
.The complainant alleges that, on  November , the National Civil Police arrested the General Secretary, Ms Krissia Meny Guadalupe Flores, and the Secretary for Women s Issues, Ms Odilia Dolores Marroqun Cornejo. Both officers of the complainant organization were in the El Amatillo customs offices, where they were handcuffed and taken into police custody at different times, without being informed of the charges against them. The complainant adds that in the case of Ms Krissia Meny Guadalupe Flores, the intimidation was of a sexual nature, since she was taken in a patrol car with eight male police officers via back roads, without knowing where they were going.
.The complainant also alleges that the National Civil Police denied police protection to three trade union members, including the National and International Relations Secretary, Mr Jorge Augusto Hernndez Velsquez, who had been threatened by international road transport workers with being burned alive.
.The Committee regrets that, despite the time that has elapsed since the complaint was presented, the Government has not responded to the complainant s allegations, although it has been invited on several occasions, including by means of an urgent appeal, to send its observations or information on this case. The Committee urges the Government to be more cooperative in the future.
.Under these circumstances, and in accordance with the applicable rules of procedure [see th Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session ()], the Committee is obliged to present a report on the substance of the case without being able to take account of the information which it had hoped to receive from the Government.
.The Committee reminds the Government that the purpose of the whole procedure established by the International Labour Organization for the examination of allegations of violations of freedom of association is to ensure respect for employers' and workers' freedom of association rights in law and in practice. The Committee is confident that, while this procedure protects governments against unreasonable accusations, they must recognize the importance of formulating, for objective examination, detailed replies concerning allegations brought against them [see First Report of the Committee, para. ].
.The Committee notes that this case concerns allegations of excessive delay in the collective bargaining process initiated in November , of measures taken by the authorities after a work stoppage from  to  November  (when the arbitrators appointed by the authorities in the lengthy collective bargaining process resigned); according to the allegations, these measures consist of: (a) the arrest of two union officers (Ms Krissia Meny Guadalupe Flores and Ms Odilia Dolores Marroqun Cornejo) without being informed of the charges against them; the General Secretary, Ms Krissia Meny Guadalupe Flores, also suffered intimidation of a sexual nature; (b) refusal to provide protection to two union members and one union officer who had received death threats from road transport workers.
.The Committee requests the Government to provide as a matter of urgency full information on all of the allegations, including the two union officers' arrest and detention, their current situation and the police s alleged failure to take action on death threats which three union members received from transport workers, as well as on the administrative or judicial proceedings initiated in this regard. The Committee recalls that the detention of trade union leaders or members for trade union activities or membership is contrary to the principles of freedom of association. It further recalls that the rights of workers' and employers' organizations can only be exercised in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind against the leaders and members of these organizations, and it is for governments to ensure that this principle is respected [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , paras  and ]. With regard to the allegation that there are no provisions in law granting public servants in the customs service the right to strike, the Committee draws this aspect of the case to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations. Lastly, the Committee requests the complainant and the Government to send information about the current status of the collective bargaining process.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee regrets that, despite the time that has elapsed since the complaint was presented, the Government has not replied to any of the complainant s allegations, although it has been invited on several occasions, including by means of an urgent appeal, to send its observations or information on the case. The Committee urges the Government to be more cooperative in the future.(b)	The Committee requests the Government to provide as a matter of urgency full information on all of the allegations (including the two union officers' arrest and detention, their current situation and the police s alleged failure to take action on death threats which three union members received from transport workers) and on the administrative or judicial proceedings initiated in this regard.(c)	The Committee draws to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations the allegation according to which there are no provisions in law granting public servants in the customs service the right to strike.(d)	The Committee requests the complainant and the Government to send information about the current status of the collective bargaining process.",1,2012,El Salvador
66,".The complaint in the present case is contained in a communication from the Union of Judiciary Workers (SITTOJ) dated  December , which was received in the Office on  March . The Government sent its observations in communications dated  October and  November .
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Workers' Representatives Convention,  (No. ), and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.In a communication dated  December , which was received in the Office on  March , SITTOJ alleges that Agreement No. -P issued by the Supreme Court of Justice on  July  constitutes a restriction on the trade union leave granted to all officers of the trade union organizations of the judiciary, by limiting it to three officers and to one day per -hour working week. The complainant organization explains that it was customary at the Supreme Court of Justice for all union officers of the complainant organization to be granted full-time leave, since the Ministry of Labour recognized SITTOJ s legal personality and provided for its registration in August . However, the complainant organization also explains that the Supreme Court of Justice issued Agreement No.  P on  July , which grants applicant organizations only one day of union leave per -hour working week, and that only three union officers designated by each organization are entitled to this union leave.
.The complainant organization states that it lodged an appeal against the decision on  August . Following a complaint by various trade unions and associations in the sector, on  August  the Office of the Human Rights Ombudsperson established interim measures under which the Supreme Court of Justice was to: (a) refrain from applying the measures contained in Agreement No.  P of  July , pending the outcome of the appeal; and (b) establish a dialogue involving representatives of the various labour organizations and trade unions working in the judiciary in order to address the issue. Notwithstanding the foregoing, on  October , the plenary of the Supreme Court of Justice ruled on the aforementioned appeal and upheld all provisions of Agreement No.  P of  July  (decision) of the Supreme Court of Justice, thus maintaining the restrictions on trade union leave.
.In its communications dated  October and  November , the Government states that the representatives of SITTOJ and another trade union lodged an application against the rulings of the Supreme Court of Justice before its Administrative Disputes Chamber; the Government does not however specify the content of this application. On  February , the judges of the aforementioned chamber excused themselves from the case; on  May , it was remanded to the plenary of the Supreme Court of Justice, where it is still pending.
.The Committee notes that the present case refers to allegations of a significant restriction of the union leave granted to all officers of the trade union organizations of the judiciary.
.The Committee notes that, according to the allegations, there was a unilateral change in the granting of trade union leave for the complainant organization as a result of the issuance by the Supreme Court of Justice of Agreement No.  P on  July  (decision issued by the Court upon a first appeal), which provides that applicant organizations [of judiciary employees] may be granted one day within the -hour working week; and that leave may be granted for three union officers, who shall be designated by each organization (trade union leave previously covered all union officers and was full time). The Committee further observes that, according to the allegations, on  August , the Office of the Human Rights Ombudsperson requested the establishment of a dialogue on the issue of trade union leave. The Committee notes the Government s indication that a new application lodged by the complainant organization and another trade union before the Administrative Disputes Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice (submitted to the plenary of the Court in May ) is still pending, but observes that the Government does not specify the content of this application. The Committee regrets the unilateral change in practice for trade union leave and the fact that, contrary to the request by the Office of the Human Rights Ombudsperson in , no dialogue has been established.
.The Committee reminds the Government that Convention No. , which El Salvador has ratified, provides that such facilities shall be afforded to the representatives of recognized public employees' organizations as may be appropriate in order to enable them to carry out their functions promptly and efficiently, both during and outside their hours of work (Article ()), but that the granting of such facilities shall not impair the efficient operation of the administration or service concerned (Article ()). The Committee stresses the importance of agreed rules concerning trade union leave and emphasizes that the parties should resume dialogue, as recommended by the Office of the Human Rights Ombudsperson. The Committee underscores that the dialogue should take into account the aforementioned criteria of Convention No. . The Committee requests the Government to take steps to promote dialogue between the parties concerned in order to find an appropriate solution to the union leave issue.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee requests the Government to take steps with a view to promoting dialogue between the parties concerned in order to find an appropriate solution to the issue of trade union leave.",1,2011,El Salvador
67,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the National Association of Private Enterprise (ANEP) dated  March .
.The Government sent its observations by communication dated  February .
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  March , ANEP alleges that, on  March , the Government, without consulting employers' and workers' organizations, instituted a reform of the Vocational Training Act intended to alter the structure of the management board of the National Institute for Vocational Training (INSAFORP) so that it would be made up of ten directors, distributed as follows: five Government representatives, nominated by the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, the Economy, Tourism, Education, and Labour and Social Welfare; one representative nominated by the President of the Republic; two representatives nominated by the private sector; and two representatives nominated by the labour sector. The reform initiative provides for the same number and distribution of alternates, and also stipulates that the chairperson and vice-chairperson of the board are to be appointed by the President from among the Government representatives. It is important to point out that INSAFORP was created through the promulgation of the Vocational Training Act, in accordance with section  thereof. This Act is a labour law that aims to meet the need for qualified human resources arising from the country s social and economic development and to promote improved living conditions for workers and their families.
.ANEP points out that El Salvador has also ratified the Human Resources Development Convention,  (No. ), Article  of which states:  Policies and programmes of vocational guidance and vocational training shall be formulated and implemented in co operation with employers' and workers' organisations and, as appropriate and in accordance with national law and practice, with other interested bodies.' This provision clearly establishes the obligation for States that have ratified the Convention to implement vocational training policies jointly. Logically, it entails equitable participation by public institutions, employers and workers, both in implementation itself and in the decision-making process, for implementing these policies. The above legislative initiative departs drastically from this principle, as the majority attributed to the Government representatives within the INSAFORP management board which is responsible for making decisions on the implementation of vocational training policies will render collaboration with and participation by the employer and worker sectors irrelevant.
.ANEP adds that, if a country such as El Salvador has ratified the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention,  (No. ), this implies that the State is obliged to undertake national tripartite consultations on draft reforms and measures relating to Conventions and their application within the country s territory, particularly those that refer to the tripartite composition of public institutions responsible for implementing policies such as those covered by Convention No. .
.ANEP alleges that the reform of the Vocational Training Act, if adopted, would violate the provisions of Article  of the Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), as it reduces the capacity for employer representation in the INSAFORP and undermines Conventions Nos  and . ANEP emphasizes that the legislative initiative to reform the composition of the INSAFORP management board was not even submitted in advance to the Higher Labour Council, a tripartite body, or to employers' or workers' organizations. This contravenes section (c) of the Higher Labour Council s rules of procedure, which states:  The Higher Labour Council shall have the following functions: ... (c) to give its opinion on any advance drafts of reforms to labour and social welfare legislation and relevant regulatory measures that, in view of their importance, may be submitted to it by the Government.' ,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:
.This obligation to consult, continues ANEP, is recognized in the Tripartite Consultation (Activities of the International Labour Organisation) Recommendation,  (No. ), (paragraph (c)), which provides for consultations of representatives of employers' and workers' organizations, subject to national practice, on the preparation and implementation of legislative or other measures to give effect to Conventions ' especially when ratified ' and Recommendations, particularly those that relate to consultation and collaboration with employers' and workers' representatives. Furthermore, in accordance with article ()(d) of the ILO Constitution, a State that ratifies a Convention commits itself to taking such action as may be necessary to make effective the provisions of the Convention. The obligation does not only consist of incorporating the Convention into national legislation, but also involves the need to ensure its application in practice, as well as giving it effect in law or other means that are in accordance with national practice.
.ANEP states that the application of Conventions Nos  and  carries with it the obligation to hold tripartite consultations on any plans to reform the Vocational Training Act. It is therefore an essential obligation upon the State to carry out such consultations before instituting legal reforms, but consultations have not been held with any employers' or workers' organizations, which violates the letter and spirit of the above Conventions and of Convention No. .
.In its communication dated  February , the Government indicates that, on  March , it submitted to the Legislative Assembly a draft Legislative Decree containing amendments to the Vocational Training Act, based on article , paragraph , of the Constitution, which confers on the President of the Republic, through the Ministers, the legislative initiative in all fields within the remit of the Executive. The objective of the draft is the enable INSAFORP to better fulfil its duties, by strengthening the institution through the adjustment and modification of its directorial and management structure, and, thus, meeting its purpose or raison d tre of satisfying the needs of qualified human resources so as to conduce to the economic and social development of the country and the improvement of the living conditions of workers and their families.
.The Government adds that the draft Legislative Decree retains the tripartite structure of INSAFORP s management board, as provided for since its establishment in Legislative Decree No.  of  June ; the proposal only modifies the number of board members per sector.
.As regards the allegation by the complainant organization ANEP that the legislative initiative has impaired the representative capacity of the employers and breached the principle of collaboration resulting in the purported violation of Conventions Nos ,  and , the Government considers that this allegation lacks any basis and is impertinent, given that the draft Decree falls under the purview of the responsibilities and, at the same time, duties assigned to the President of the Republic by the Constitution of El Salvador in its article , paragraph , according to which:  The duties and responsibilities of the President of the Republic include: Ensure the effective management and execution of public affairs.' ,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:
.The Committee notes that in this complaint, the complainant organization alleges that, in contravention of Convention No.  and Conventions Nos  and , the Government instituted a reform of the Vocational Training Act, altering the structure of the management board of the INSAFORP. The Committee notes that, according to the allegations, this initiative: () violates the principle of tripartite consultation, having been introduced without prior consultation of employers' and workers' organizations or submission to the Higher Labour Council (a tripartite body), despite the fact that section  of the Council s rules of procedure includes  giving its opinion on any advance drafts of reforms to labour and social welfare legislation' among its functions; and () results in an excessive majority of Government representatives on the INSAFORP management board, such that it impedes equitable participation in the decision-making process by representatives of employers' and workers' organizations.
.The Committee notes the Government s observations according to which: (i) the legislative initiative was in conformity with the Constitution and aimed at enabling INSAFORP to better fulfil its duties and objective by strengthening the institution through the adjustment and modification of its directorial and management structure; and (ii)the said initiative retains the tripartite structure of INSAFORP s management board, although modifying the number of board members.
.The Committee observes that, as emphasized in the allegations, the legislative initiative contested by ANEP provides for the management board of the INSAFORP to be made up of ten directors, distributed as follows: five Government representatives, nominated by the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, the Economy, Tourism, Education, and Labour and Social Welfare; one representative nominated by the President of the Republic; two representatives nominated by the private sector; and two representatives nominated by the labour sector. The reform initiative provides for the same number and distribution of alternates, and also stipulates that the chairperson and vice-chairperson of the board are to be appointed by the President from among the Government representatives.
.The Committee observes that the composition of the INSAFORP management board is indeed clearly unbalanced, in terms of both members and alternates, and should be adjusted so that the authorities, employers' representatives and workers' representatives are represented more equitably. Furthermore, given that the Government",1,2012,El Salvador
68,"has not denied the lack of consultations with the most representative employers' and workers' organizations, the Committee regrets that the legislative initiative to alter the management board was not submitted to the Higher Labour Council, as signalled in the allegations, despite this body having a specific mandate to examine draft labour legislation, particularly taking into account that El Salvador has ratified Conventions Nos , ,  and , as ANEP points out.
.This being the case, the Committee draws the Government s attention to the principle whereby tripartite consultation should take place before the Government submits a draft to the Legislative Assembly or establishes a labour, social or economic policy, and to the importance of prior consultation of employers' and workers' organizations before the adoption of any legislation in the field of labour law [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , paras  and ]. The Committee recalls that such consultation should be detailed, full and frank [see Digest, op. cit., paras  and ], and that the process of consultation on legislation and minimum wages helps to give laws, programmes and measures adopted or applied by public authorities a firmer justification and helps to ensure that they are well respected and successfully applied; the Government should seek general consensus as much as possible, given that employers' and workers' organizations should be able to share in the responsibility of securing the well-being and prosperity of the community as a whole. This is particularly important given the growing complexity of the problems faced by societies. No public authority can claim to have all the answers, nor assume that its proposals will naturally achieve all of their objectives [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. The Committee requests the Government to ensure that these principles are fully respected in future.
.In view of the above, the Committee requests the Government to hold in-depth consultations with workers' and employers' organizations, within the framework of the Higher Labour Council, with a view to reaching a joint decision that will ensure a balanced tripartite composition for the INSAFORP management board and to submit the joint decision to the Legislative Assembly without delay, as part of the consideration of the legislative initiative previously submitted by the Government.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee draws the attention of the Government to the principles concerning tripartite consultation referred to in its conclusions and requests it to ensure that these principles are fully respected in future.(b)	The Committee requests the Government to hold in-depth consultations with workers' and employers' organizations, within the framework of the Higher Labour Council, with a view to reaching a joint decision that will ensure a balanced tripartite composition for the INSAFORP management board and to submit the joint decision to the Legislative Assembly without delay, as part of the consideration of the legislative initiative previously submitted by the Government.",1,2012,El Salvador
69,".The Committee last examined this case at its March  meeting, when it presented an interim report to the Governing Body [see rd Report, paras ' , approved by the Governing Body at its st Session (March )].
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  October .
.At its March  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendations [see rd Report, para. ]:The Committee urges the Government and all the competent authorities to make in a coordinated manner, as a matter of urgency and priority, all the necessary efforts to expedite the investigations under way in order to identify and punish without delay both the instigators and the perpetrators of the murder of Mr Victoriano Abel Vega. In particular, the Committee urges the Government to take the necessary measures so that the competent authorities are provided with the required human and financial resources and that they ensure that when conducting the investigations, special attention is paid to exchanging information with the complainant organizations in the present case with a view to clarifying whether this crime has had an anti-union nature. Firmly hoping that tangible progress will be made in this regard, the Committee asks the Government to keep it informed of all developments in the investigation and criminal proceedings.(b) The Committee once again draws the Governing Body s attention to the extremely serious and urgent nature of this case.
.In its communication of  October , the Government indicates that on  May  it asked the Public Prosecutor of the Republic to reopen the file related to the murder of Mr Victoriano Abel Vega, general secretary of the Union of Municipal Workers of Santa Ana (SITRAMSA), in accordance with section () of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which states that:  the public prosecutor may, ex officio or at the request of a party, reopen the case until the investigation has been exhausted when new evidence or proof emerges that nullifies the reasons for which it was closed, unless the public action has been converted ? The Government indicates that this request was made to exhaust the investigation, take the necessary measures to uncover the truth and identify the perpetrators.
.The Government states that on  October , the Public Prosecutor of the Republic indicated that the investigation remains open. The Government also states, as indicated by the Specialized Prosecutorial Unit for Extortion and Organized Crime, that the investigation into suspects for the offence of aggravated homicide (section  of the Criminal Code) against Mr Victoriano Abel Vega was reopened and that directives have been issued to the Central Investigation Division of the National Civil Police of El Salvador to interview possible informants concerning the homicide and prepare the corresponding reports.
.The Committee recalls once again that the case refers to the murder, on  January , of Mr Victoriano Abel Vega, general secretary of SITRAMSA, who, according to the complainant organizations, had already received death threats for his union activities.
.The Committee takes note of the Government s indication that, in May , the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare requested that the Public Prosecutor of the Republic reopen the file on the murder of Mr Victoriano Abel Vega, general secretary of SITRAMSA, in order to conclude the investigation, take the necessary measures to uncover the truth and identify the perpetrators. The Committee also takes note that the Government conveyed the information provided by the Public Prosecutor of the Republic in October , which indicate that the Specialized Prosecutorial Unit for Extortion and Organized Crime reopened the investigation into the suspects for aggravated homicide (section  of the Criminal Code) against Mr Victoriano Abel Vega and that directives have been issued to the Central Investigation Division of the National Civil Police of El Salvador to interview possible informants concerning the homicide and prepare the corresponding reports.
.The Committee regrets to note that, in spite of repeated requests made by the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare to the Public Prosecutor of the Republic to shed light on the case, it was closed without the perpetrators being identified or punished and later reopened for further investigation at the request of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare. The Committee deplores that, more than  years since the murder of Mr Victoriano Abel Vega, no tangible progress has yet been made towards identifying and punishing the perpetrators of this serious crime. The Committee is obliged therefore to recall once again that it is important that all instances of violence against trade union members, whether these be murders, disappearances or threats, are properly investigated. Furthermore, the mere fact of initiating an investigation does not mark the end of the Government s work; rather, the Government must do all within its power to ensure that such investigations lead to the identification and punishment of the perpetrators [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , para. ].
.The Committee also observes that, as indicated by the Government, possible informants will be interviewed as part of the murder investigations, and in view of the different lines of investigation indicated by the Government in the previous examination of the case (of which two are linked to Mr Victoriano Abel Vega s union activities, and the most probable theory is that Mr Vega was murdered by accident by gang members that were attempting to murder another municipal worker who was a witness in another homicide case), the Committee further recalls that the Government is under a responsibility to take all necessary measures to have the guilty parties identified and punished ' in particular by ensuring that witnesses, who are crucial for the successful identification and prosecution of suspects, are effectively protected ' and to successfully prevent the recurrence of human rights violations. Even in the absence of a formal filing of charges, each case should be thoroughly investigated and, where witnesses have come forward, appropriate and adequate protection should be provided [see Compilation, para. ].
.In the light of the foregoing, the Committee firmly urges the Government and all the competent authorities to make, in a coordinated manner and as a matter of urgency and priority, all the necessary efforts to expedite and conclude the investigations under way in order to identify and punish as soon as possible both the instigators and the perpetrators of the murder of Mr Victoriano Abel Vega, while ensuring the protection of all witnesses who could be instrumental in the resolution of the case. In particular, the Committee urges the Government to take all appropriate measures so that the competent authorities are provided with the required human and financial resources and ensure that when conducting the investigations, special attention is paid to exchanging appropriate information with the complainant organizations in the present case with a view to clarifying whether this crime is of an anti-union nature. Firmly expecting that tangible progress will be made in this regard, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any progress in the investigation and criminal proceedings.

70,", the Committee made the following recommendations [see th Report, para. ]:(a)	The Committee once again urges the Government and all the competent authorities to make in a coordinated manner, as a matter of urgency and priority, all the necessary efforts, including the provision of the required human and financial resources to expedite the investigations under way, in order to identify and punish without delay both the instigators and the perpetrators of the murder of Mr Victoriano Abel Vega. In particular, the Committee urges the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that the competent authorities pay special attention to exchanging information with the complainant organizations in the present case with a view to clarifying whether this crime has had an anti-union nature.

.In its communication of  March , the Government confirms that its efforts to shed light on the crime continue and indicates that it contacted the Public Prosecutor of the Republic on  February  to ask for more resources to dedicate to the investigation. The Government conveys the information provided by the new Public Prosecutor of the Republic through a communication dated  March , which: (i) reiterates the information previously sent to the Committee regarding the investigations and procedures undertaken; (ii) underscores that, if there are still four lines of investigation, of which two are linked to Mr Victoriana Abel Vega s union activities, the most probable theory still holds, which is that Mr Vega was murdered by accident by gang members that were attempting to murder another municipal worker that was a witness in a murder case; (iii) confirms that this theory would be supported by the ballistic analysis, which showed that a weapon that had been seized from another member of the same gang had been used in the murder of Mr Vega; (iv) communicates that focus has been redirected to as to ensure that investigative efforts continue to be concentrated on searching for other sources of information (to shed light on existing lines of investigation or to generate new theories); and (v) indicates that the investigator on the case has confirmed ongoing efforts to obtain information that will identify the perpetrators in spite of existing difficulties, including insufficient resources and a significant workload in the division, and the fact that the only possible suspect in the case, who supported the theory of mistaken identity mentioned above, will already have been sentenced for his involvement in another murder. It was difficult to make contact with him in prison and, with an -year prison sentence, it is unlikely that he will cooperate. As a result, efforts have been focused on finding another informant or witness.
.In its communication of  February , the Government indicates that the Minister of Labor and Social Welfare has been following up on the investigations carried out by the Office of the Public Prosecutor of the Republic and that it has insisted to the Public Prosecutor the importance that the case merits and the need to expedite the investigations so that this crime does not go unpunished and to set a precedent in the defence of the exercise of the right to freedom of association. The Government indicates that it is awaiting the report of the Prosecutor, which it will transmit to the Committee as soon as it is received.
.The Committee recalls once again that the present case refers to the murder, on  January , of Mr Victoriano Abel Vega, general secretary of the Union of Municipal Workers of Santa Ana (SITRAMSA), who, according to the complainant organizations, had already received death threats for his union activities.
.The Committee takes note of the information provided by the Government in relation to the ongoing efforts of the Office of the Public Prosecutor of the Republic to obtain information that will identify the perpetrators in spite of existing difficulties, including insufficient resources and a significant workload, and the fact that the only possible suspect in the case, would have already been sentenced for his involvement in another murder.

.The Committee notes with regret that, in spite of repeated requests made by the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare to the Public Prosecutor of the Republic to take the necessary steps to progress in the case, no tangible progress has been made towards identifying and punishing the perpetrators of this serious crime more than ten years since the murder of the union leader.
.In this respect, the Committee once again recalls that acts of intimidation and physical violence against trade unionists constitute a grave violation of the principles of freedom of association and the failure to protect against such acts amounts to a de facto impunity, which can only reinforce a climate of fear and uncertainty highly detrimental to the exercise of trade union rights. The Committee also emphasizes that it is important that all instances of violence against trade union members, whether these be murders, disappearances or threats, are properly investigated and that the mere fact of initiating an investigation does not mark the end of the Government s work; rather, the Government must do all within its power to ensure that such investigations lead to the identification and punishment of the perpetrators [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , paras  and ].

71,"Government to keep it informed of developments relating to the criminal proceedings initiated, and trusts that tangible progress will be made without delay regarding clarification of the facts, identification of the guilty parties and the imposition of commensurate punishment in accordance with the law, with a view to preventing such types of criminal offences. The Committee once again urges the Government and all the competent authorities to take all possible steps in accordance with the law to identify the perpetrators of this murder without delay and to ensure that the alleged anti-union motives behind it also keep on being investigated in depth.(b)	The Committee once again requests the Government and the complainant organizations to keep it informed of any pending issues relating to the allegations of dismissal of the union s founding members, including referring the allegations to the competent authorities.(c)	Lastly, the Committee draws the Governing Body s attention to the extremely serious and urgent nature of this case.
.In its communication of  April , the Government reiterates that the murder of Mr Victoriano Abel Vega is considered a serious case by the competent authorities and the Ministry of Labour, and that appropriate steps are being taken to shed light on the murder. In this respect, the Government indicates that, during the direct contacts mission concerning the application of Convention No.  that took place in July  as follow-up to the  conclusions of the Committee on the Application of Standards of the International Labour Conference, the Office of the Public Prosecutor said that  four lines of investigation were being examined, including possible anti-union motives, but they did not seem to be the most likely motives'  The Government then states that, in March , the Minister of Labour sent an official communication to the Public Prosecutor, requesting that he send her an updated report on the investigation of the case. The Government adds that, on  April , the Public Prosecutor responded to her request, indicating that: (i) the investigation remains open and is being handled by the Special Investigation Unit against Organized Crime; (ii) certain proceedings that were pending have been conducted by the Elite Division against Organized Crime of the National Civil Police; (iii) the investigation still has not produced concrete material evidence on the perpetrators or the involvement of any persons in the events concerned; and (iv) once such evidence has been obtained, the appropriate criminal proceedings will be launched and reported in detail. Lastly, the Government states that the Ministry of Labour is taking all steps at its disposal to shed light on the murder of Mr Vega; however, the Ministry notes with regret that, despite all its requests to expedite the investigation, it has not yet been completed. In its second communication dated  January , the Government indicates that on  January , the Ministry of Labour sent a note to the new National Public Prosecutor in order to inform him of the importance of the investigation into the assassination of Mr Vega to the ILO supervisory bodies and in order to once again request the submission of an updated report on the process undertaken by the Office of the General Prosecutor s Special Unit on Organized Crimes.
.The Committee recalls that the present case refers to the murder, on  January , of Mr Victoriano Abel Vega, general secretary of the Union of Municipal Workers of Santa Ana (SITRAMSA), who, according to the complainant organizations, had already received death threats for his union activities.
.In its last examination of the case, after highlighting once again the extremely serious nature of the allegations, the Committee noted the Government s statement that meetings and communication with the competent bodies had continued in order to expedite the investigation but that, despite such measures, it had not yet been possible to identify the perpetrators. The Government also indicated that the possibility of a link between Mr Victoriano Abel Vega s trade union activities and his murder had been included in the lines of investigation. The Committee notes the Government s observations of April  and January , according to which: (i) in , the Office of the Public Prosecutor indicated that four lines of investigation were being examined, including possible anti-union motives, but they did not seem to be the most likely motives; (ii) according to the information provided by the Office of the Public Prosecutor in , the investigation remains open and is being handled by the Special Investigation Unit against Organized Crime, with various proceedings conducted by the Elite Division against Organized Crime of the National Civil Police; (iii) the investigation still has not produced concrete material evidence on the perpetrators or the involvement of any persons in the events concerned; and (iv) the Minister of Labour sent a note to the new National Public Prosecutor in January  in order to inform him of the importance of the investigation into the assassination of Mr Vega to the ILO supervisory bodies and in order to once again request the submission of an updated report on the process undertaken by the Office of the General Prosecutor s Special Unit on Organized Crimes.
.While noting the information provided and the Government s reiterated commitment to ensuring that crime does not go unpunished, the Committee notes with deep concern that, nine years after the events, the authorities have still not identified the perpetrators of this murder or any accomplices, and that no tangible progress has been reported regarding the investigation. Moreover, the Committee notes with regret that it has not received specific information on the investigative measures taken to date by the competent authorities and, in particular, on the contact made by the Office of the Public Prosecutor with the trade union organization of which the victim was general secretary in order to gather any available evidence on the possible anti-union motives of the murder. Lastly, the Committee observes that the Ministry of Labour notes with regret that its various requests to expedite the investigation have not resulted in its completion.
.In this respect, the Committee recalls that acts of intimidation and physical violence against trade unionists constitute a grave violation of the principles of freedom of association and the failure to protect against such acts amounts to a de facto impunity, which can only reinforce a climate of fear and uncertainty highly detrimental to the exercise of trade union rights. The Committee also emphasizes that it is important that all instances of violence against trade union members, whether these be murders, disappearances or threats, are properly investigated and that the mere fact of initiating an investigation does not mark the end of the Government s work; rather, the Government must do all within its power to ensure that such investigations lead to the identification and punishment of the perpetrators [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , paras  and ]. In the light of the foregoing, recalling that the obligation to comply with the principles of freedom of association falls not only on the Ministry of Labour but also on the Government and on all the public authorities in the country, the Committee once again urges the Government and all the competent authorities to make, in a coordinated manner and as a matter of urgency and priority, all the necessary efforts, including the provision of the required human and financial resources, to expedite the investigations under way in order to identify and punish without delay both the instigators and the perpetrators of the murder of Mr Victoriano Abel Vega. In particular, the Committee urges the Government to take the necessary measures so that the competent authorities (especially the Office of the Public Prosecutor, the police and the judiciary) ensure that when conducting the investigations, special attention is paid to exchanging information with the complainant organizations in the present case with a view to clarifying whether this crime has had an anti-union nature. Firmly hoping that tangible progress will be made in this regard, the Committee requests the Government to ensure that the Office of the Public Prosecutor of the Republic will provide detailed information on the status and findings of the investigations and the relevant criminal proceedings without delay.
.As regards the alleged dismissals of founding members of the Union of Municipal Workers of San Sebastin Salitrillo (SITMASSS), the establishment of which had been supported by Mr Victoriano Abel Vega, and the Committee s reiterated request to the Government and the complainant organizations to keep it informed of any pending issues relating to these allegations, including the referral of the cases of dismissals to the competent authorities, the Committee observes that neither the Government nor the complainant organizations have provided the information requested in recommendation (b) of its previous examination of this case and therefore is not in a position to pursue its examination of this aspect of the case.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee once again urges the",-1,2012,El Salvador
72,"Government and all the competent authorities to make in a coordinated manner, as a matter of urgency and priority, all the necessary efforts including the provision of the required human and financial resources to expedite the investigations under way, in order to identify and punish without delay both the instigators and the perpetrators of the murder of Mr Victoriano Abel Vega. In particular, the Committee urges the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that the competent authorities pay special attention to exchanging information with the complainant organizations in the present case with a view to clarifying whether this crime has had an anti-union nature.

.The Committee last examined this case at its March  meeting, when it presented an interim report to the Governing Body [see th Report, paras ' , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (March )].
.The Government sent new observations in a communication dated  October .
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Workers' Representatives Convention,  (No. ), and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.In its previous examination of the case in March , the Committee made the following recommendations [see th Report, para. ]:' The Committee, deeply deploring and condemning the murder of union leader Mr Victoriano Abel Vega, firmly urges the Government to provide information on the criminal proceedings initiated, and trusts that tangible progress will be made in the near future that will lead to clarification of the facts, identification of the guilty parties and the imposition of commensurate punishment in accordance with the law, with a view to preventing such types of criminal offences. The Committee firmly urges the Government and all the competent authorities to take without delay all possible steps in accordance with the law to identify the perpetrators of this murder and to ensure that the alleged anti-union motives behind it are investigated in greater depth.' Accordingly, as the complainant organizations have linked the murder of the trade union leader to his union activities, and in particular to his advocacy for the establishment of a union in the municipal services of San Sebastin, the Committee urges the Government to refer the allegations relating to the dismissal of the union s founding members to the competent authorities and, to this end, invites the complainant organizations to provide further information relating to the allegations and to any complaints filed in connection with them. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.' Lastly, the Committee once again draws the Governing Body s attention to the extremely serious and urgent nature of this case.
.In its communication of  October , the Government reiterates its strong commitment to shedding light on the murder of Mr Victoriano Abel Vega. In this respect, the Government states that the investigation was referred to the Special Unit against Organized Crime of the National Civil Police to clarify the facts and identify those responsible. The Government indicates that the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare also requested the establishment of a special committee to conclude the investigation into the case but that the Office of the Public Prosecutor considered it inappropriate since the investigation had been assigned to a special unit of the Public Prosecution Service.
.With regard to the conduct of the investigations, the Government indicates that in March  the new Public Prosecutor reported that the possibility of a link between Mr Abel Vega s trade union activities and his murder had been included in the lines of investigation but that, to date, the only new detail uncovered was that one of the firearms used to commit the crimes was connected with gangs.
.In addition, the Government states that it has continued its work to facilitate the progress of the investigation, highlighting the referral of communications and bilateral meetings between the parties concerned to gather information on progress made and report on the international implications of the case in relation to the Committee s conclusions, and to those of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations and of the Committee on the Application of Standards. In this regard, the Government indicates that the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare met once again with the Public Prosecutor in August , that both reaffirmed the desirability of concluding the investigation and resolving the case as soon as possible and that in September  the Minister made a request to the Public Prosecutor for a new hearing. The Government reaffirms its commitment to shedding light on the crime so that it does not go unpunished and states that it will continue to take the necessary steps to help the competent bodies to expedite the investigation process.
.The Committee recalls that the allegations in the present case refer to the murder, on  January  in the city of Santa Ana, of Mr Victoriano Abel Vega (general secretary of the Union of Municipal Workers of Santa Ana (SITRAMSA)). He died from multiple gunshot wounds received as he was leaving the City Sanitation Services office, where he had gone to submit a letter requesting leave to attend a union meeting of the Autonomous Confederation of Salvadorian Workers (CATS). The complainant organizations highlighted the fact that, upon leaving the office, Mr Victoriano Abel Vega, who had already received death threats for his union activities, was killed by five persons who had been lying in wait for him and who then fled in a waiting vehicle.
.In its last examination of the case, the Committee noted the Government s statement to the effect that, despite the various steps taken, it had not been possible to identify the perpetrators, that the investigation remained open and that the Public Prosecutor had expressed the wish that the investigation be expedited. The Committee notes the Government s latest observations, according to which: (i) meetings and communication with the competent bodies, in particular with the Public Prosecutor, have continued in order to expedite the investigation, in which the desirability of resolving the case as soon as possible has been reaffirmed; and (ii) despite the various steps taken, it has not yet been possible to identify the perpetrators but the investigation remains open in a special unit of the Public Prosecution Service, and the possibility of a link between Mr Victoriano Abel Vega s trade union activities and his murder has been included in the lines of investigation.
.While duly noting the actions indicated by the Government and its commitment to shedding light on the crime so that it does not go unpunished, the Committee deeply deplores the murder of union leader Mr Victoriano Abel Vega and deeply regrets that, although it took place on  January , more than seven years later the authorities have still not identified the perpetrators of this heinous murder or any accomplices. Noting once again that, despite the steps taken, it seems that no tangible progress has been made regarding the investigation, the Committee once again urges the Government and all the competent authorities to take all possible steps to identify the perpetrators of the murder without delay and to ensure that the alleged anti-union motives behind it also keep on being investigated in depth.
.The Committee highlights once again the seriousness of the allegations, deeply deplores and condemns once again the murder of the trade union leader and again reiterates the recommendation made at its June  meeting requesting the Government to keep it informed of developments relating to the criminal proceedings initiated, and trusts that tangible progress will be made in the near future regarding clarification of the facts, identification of the guilty parties and the imposition of commensurate punishment in accordance with the law, with a view to preventing such types of criminal offences.
.As regards the allegations of dismissal of the union s founding members, the Committee notes with regret that the Government has not responded to the Committee s recommendation to refer the investigation into the allegations to the competent authorities and observes that the complainant organizations have not provided additional information on the matter either. The Committee recalls that no person should be dismissed or prejudiced in employment by reason of trade union membership or legitimate trade union activities, and it is important to forbid and penalize in practice all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of employment [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ]. The Committee reiterates its previous recommendation and requests the Government and the complainant organizations",-1,2012,El Salvador
73,"to keep it informed of any pending issues in this regard.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee, deeply deploring and condemning the murder of trade union leader Mr Victoriano Abel Vega, once again firmly urges the Government to keep it informed of developments relating to the criminal proceedings initiated, and trusts that tangible progress will be made without delay regarding clarification of the facts, identification of the guilty parties and the imposition of commensurate punishment in accordance with the law, with a view to preventing such types of criminal offences. The Committee once again urges the Government and all the competent authorities to take all possible steps in accordance with the law to identify the perpetrators of this murder without delay and to ensure that the alleged anti-union motives behind it also keep on being investigated in depth.(b)	The Committee once again requests the Government and the complainant organizations to keep it informed of any pending issues relating to the allegations of dismissal of the union s founding members, including referring the allegations to the competent authorities.(c)	Lastly, the Committee draws the Governing Body s attention to the extremely serious and urgent nature of this case.
.The Committee last examined this case at its June  meeting, when it presented an interim report to the Governing Body [see th Report, paras ' , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (June )].
.The Government sent new observations in a communication dated  September .
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Workers' Representatives Convention,  (No. ), and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.In its previous examination of the case in June , the Committee made the following recommendations [see th Report, para. ]:' The Committee, deeply deploring and condemning the murder of union leader Mr Victoriano Abel Vega, once again requests the Government to provide information on the criminal proceedings initiated and to take all measures at its disposal to ensure that investigations are intensified to clarify the facts, identify the guilty parties and impose commensurate punishment in accordance with the law, with a view to preventing such types of criminal offences. The Committee requests the Government and the competent authorities to take all available measures in accordance with the law to identify the perpetrators of this murder and to investigate further into its alleged anti-union motives.' In this connection, as the complainant organizations have linked the murder of the union leader to his union activities, and in particular to his advocacy for the establishment of a union in the municipal services of San Sebastin (allegedly impeded through dismissals of the union s founding members and the silence of the labour administration concerning the trade union complaints), the Committee urges the Government to carry out an investigation in this regard and to keep it informed.' Lastly, the Committee once again draws the Governing Body s attention to the extremely serious and urgent nature of this case.
.In its communication of  September , the Government states that the murder of Mr Victoriano Abel Vega has been repeatedly condemned in El Salvador, that it respects and guarantees freedom of association, and that the Office of the Public Prosecutor and the National Civil Police are still investigating the case. Although, on account of the separation of powers, the prosecution service has complete operational independence, in the interests of speeding up the investigation and complying with the Committee s recommendations, the Government notified the Office of the Public Prosecutor of the present complaint, emphasizing its seriousness and placing the highest priority on its resolution, and again requested information on the progress of the investigation. In a note of  May , the Chief Public Prosecutor reported on the investigative work carried out, including various expert opinions and interviews with witnesses, stating however that the perpetrators of the offence had not yet been identified and that the investigation was still ongoing, with requests having been made to the Central Investigation Department of the National Civil Police for new investigations, the results of which are still pending. In that regard, in July , the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare met with the Chief Public Prosecutor to emphasize the extremely serious and urgent nature of the case and the importance of moving ahead with and concluding the investigation. Consequently, the Chief Public Prosecutor expressed his wish that the investigation should be expedited. The Government states that it will keep the Committee informed of any developments in this regard.
.As to the complainants' allegations linking the murder of the union leader to his union activities, and in particular to his advocacy for the establishment of a union in the municipal services of San Sebastin Salitrillo, the Government again states that such allegations are unsubstantiated given that, according to the records of the National Department of Social Organizations, the creation of the Union of Municipal Workers of San Sebastin Salitrillo was registered on  November  and that, to date, the union and its executive committee remain active.
.As to the alleged silence of the labour administration referred to by the complainants in their complaint, the Government states that it has not found any processed files in the relevant Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare archive. Indeed, the Labour Code does not cover municipal administrative careers, the municipal commissions having the power to hear any complaints filed by municipal officials or employees concerning violations of the rights enshrined in the relevant legislation (the Municipal Administrative Careers Act). The Government states that the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare does not have the right to deal with requests for inspections into violations of labour rights within municipal services. Lastly, the Government reports that there are a number of other bodies competent to deal with the complaints of municipal service workers ' namely, the Office of the Attorney General, the Office of the Human Rights Ombudsman and the Office of the Public Prosecutor.
.The Committee recalls that the allegations in the present case refer to the murder, on  January , in the city of Santa Ana, of Mr Victoriano Abel Vega (general secretary of the Union of Municipal Workers of Santa Ana (SITRAMSA)). He died from multiple gunshot wounds received as he was leaving the City Sanitation Services office, where he had gone to submit a letter requesting permission to attend a union meeting of the Autonomous Confederation of Salvadorian Workers (CATS). The complainant organizations highlighted that, upon leaving the office, Mr Victoriano Abel Vega, who had already received death threats for his union activities, was killed by five persons who were waiting for him, and who fled in a vehicle that was waiting for them. In its last examination of the case, the Committee took note of the Government s statement to the effect that it had not yet been possible to identify the perpetrator or perpetrators and that the investigation remained open and the Central Investigation Department continued to search for sources to enable it to identify the perpetrators of the crime.
.The Committee wises to recall that [t]he killing, disappearance or serious injury of trade union leaders and trade unionists requires the institution of independent judicial inquiries in order to shed full light, at the earliest date, on the facts and the circumstances in which such actions occurred and in this way, to the extent possible, determine where responsibilities lie, punish the guilty parties and prevent the repetition of similar events [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ].
.The Committee takes note of the Government s additional observations, according to which: () it has contacted the Office of the Public Prosecutor on various occasions to emphasize the serious and urgent nature of the case; and () despite the various steps taken, it has not been possible to identify the perpetrators, the investigation remains open and the Public Prosecutor has expressed the wish that the investigation be expedited.
.The Committee deeply regrets that, although the murder of union leader Mr Victoriano Abel Vega took place on  January , more than six years later the authorities have not identified the perpetrators of, or parties to, this abject murder. Noting that, despite the steps taken, it seems that no tangible progress has been made regarding the investigation, the Committee firmly urges the Government and all the competent authorities to take without delay all possible steps to identify the perpetrators of the murder.
.The Committee again highlights the seriousness of the allegations, deeply deplores and condemns the murder of the trade union leader and again reiterates the recommendation made at its June  meeting firmly urging the Government to provide information on the criminal proceedings initiated, and trusts that tangible progress will be made in the near future that will lead to clarification of the facts, identification",-1,2012,El Salvador
74,"of the guilty parties and the imposition of commensurate punishment in accordance with the law, with a view to preventing such types of criminal offences.
.As to the allegations linking the murder of the union leader to his union activities, and in particular to his advocacy for the establishment of a union in the municipal services of San Sebastin Salitrillo, the Committee noted, in its previous examination of the case, the Government s statements to the effect that the Union of Municipal Workers of San Sebastin Salitrillo (SITMASSS) was created on  November  and that both the trade union and its executive committee remain active. Taking into account the information provided by the complainant organizations relating to the union activities of Mr Victoriano Abel Vega, reflected in his request to attend a meeting of the CATS on the day he was killed, and to the fact that he had received death threats as a result of his union activities, the Committee considers that the subsequent creation of SITMASSS and the continued existence to date of its executive committee do not constitute sufficient grounds for rejecting the allegations linking the murder to union activities and, in particular, to advocacy for the establishment of SITMASSS. The Committee has already recalled in this regard that union official Mr Victoriano Abel Vega was murdered on  January  and that, prior to his murder, he carried out advocacy relating to SITMASSS. Consequently, the Committee is bound to request the Government once again to ensure that the statements of the complainant organizations concerning the anti-union motives for the murder are examined in greater depth within the criminal investigations.
.As to the allegations of dismissal of the union s founding members and the silence of the labour administration (the complainants alleged in their complaint that the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare failed to follow up their requests for an inspection), the Committee notes the Government s statement that there is no record of any files being processed by the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare because inspections at the municipal level are not the competence of the Ministry but rather of municipal bodies (the municipal commissions) and other state entities. However, the Committee regrets the fact that, apart from providing that information, the Government has not reported having taken any action to comply with the Committee s recommendation that the allegations of the dismissal of the union s founding members should be investigated, for example, by making inquiries with the competent bodies referred to in the Committee s most recent observations. The Committee urges the Government to refer the allegations relating to the dismissal of the trade union founders to the competent authorities and, to this end, invites the complainant organizations to provide further information relating to the allegations and to any complaints filed in connection with them. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee, deeply deploring and condemning the murder of trade union leader Mr Victoriano Abel Vega, firmly urges the Government to provide information on the criminal proceedings initiated, and trusts that tangible progress will be made in the near future that will lead to clarification of the facts, identification of the guilty parties and the imposition of commensurate punishment in accordance with the law, with a view to preventing such types of criminal offences. The Committee firmly urges the Government and all the competent authorities to take without delay all possible steps in accordance with the law to identify the perpetrators of this murder and to ensure that the alleged anti-union motives behind it are investigated in greater depth.(b)	Accordingly, as the complainant organizations have linked the murder of the trade union leader to his union activities, and in particular to his advocacy for the establishment of a union in the municipal services of San Sebastin, the Committee urges the Government to refer the allegations relating to the dismissal of the union s founding members to the competent authorities and, to this end, invites the complainant organizations to provide further information relating to the allegations and to any complaints filed in connection with them. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.(c)	Lastly, the Committee once again draws the Governing Body s attention to the extremely serious and urgent nature of this case.
.The Committee last examined this case at its May June  meeting, when it presented an interim report to the Governing Body [See nd Report, paras  to , approved by the Governing Body at its st Session (June )].
.The Government sent new observations in communications dated  June  and  February .
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Workers' Representatives Convention,  (No. ) and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.In its previous examination of the case in May June , the Committee made the following recommendations [see nd Report, para. ]:' The Committee, deeply deploring and condemning the murder of union leader Mr Victoriano Abel Vega, once again requests the Government to provide information on the criminal proceedings initiated and to take all measures at its disposal to ensure that investigations are intensified to clarify the facts, identify the guilty parties and impose severe punishment upon them, with a view to preventing such types of criminal offences.' Furthermore, as the complainant organizations have linked the murder of the union leader to his union activities, and in particular to his advocacy for the establishment of a union in the municipal services of San Sebastin (allegedly impeded by the dismissal of the union s founding members and the silence of the labour administration concerning the trade union complaints), the Committee once again requests the Government to send its observations on the matter and to ensure that the workers in question are able to establish a trade union without restriction.' Lastly, the Committee once again draws the Governing Body s attention to the extremely serious and urgent nature of this case.
.In its communication dated  June , the Government indicates that it is transmitting the information available regarding the murder of the trade union leader Mr Victoriano Abel Vega in the city of Santa Ana in January . The Government adds that, having carried out consultations regarding this case, a note was submitted by the Office of the Public Prosecutor, dated  March , indicating that the corresponding inquiries are being carried out to identify the perpetrators of, or other parties to, the act, whereby it is currently being treated as an  active investigation'  According to the aforementioned note, the case file contains the report of the removal of the corpse, the autopsy, the photographs and sketch of the crime scene, and witness interviews, which do not reveal the identity of any of the perpetrators. The note also indicates that this case has been reassigned to investigators in the Central Investigation Department of San Salvador, who are conducting investigations to find sources which could provide the information needed to identify the perpetrators of, or other parties to, the act.
.In its communication dated  February , the Government states that the Ministry of Labour and Social Security has contacted the Office of the Public Prosecutor, and in particular the Special Unit for Crimes against Life of the Office of the Public Prosecutor of Santa Ana, which was the body to which the case was referred under Reference No. -UDVA-, for the investigation of the murder of Mr Victoriano Abel Vega. This body initially abstained from making any declaration, being under the legal obligation not to disclose any details relating to the case in accordance with the Code of Criminal Procedure, which only grants access to the case to the parties; as of September  it had not been possible to identify the perpetrator or perpetrators.
.In spite of the information set out above, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security continues its monitoring and coordination work in order to demonstrate the importance of ensuring that freedom of association is respected and guaranteed by the Government. In its last communication, the Office of the Public Prosecutor indicated that it had all the documentation needed to establish the existence of a criminal offence. The Government reiterates that the investigation has been reassigned to the Central Investigation Department of San Salvador, which will continue to search for sources which could provide the information needed to identify the perpetrators of, or other parties to, the act. The Government adds that the case continues to be treated as an active investigation and that the Government will, accordingly, continue to provide information regarding any developments in this case.
.As regards the Committee s second-to-last recommendation and the complainants' allegation that the murder took place when the municipal services of San Sebastin had impeded the creation",-1,2012,El Salvador
75,"of trade unions, the Government indicates that the allegation is unsubstantiated given that, according to the records of the National Department of Social Organizations, the creation of the Union of Municipal Workers of San Sebastin Salitrillo was registered on  November , and to date the members of the executive committee continue to hold valid credentials.
.The Committee recalls that the allegations in the present case refer to the murder, on  January , in the city of Santa Ana, of Mr Victoriano Abel Vega (Secretary-General of the Union of Municipal Workers of Santa Ana (SITRAMSA)). He died from multiple gunshot wounds as he was leaving the City Sanitation Services office, where he had gone to submit a letter requesting permission to attend a union meeting of the Autonomous Confederation of Salvadorian Workers (CATS). The complainant organizations highlighted that, upon leaving the office, Mr Victoriano Abel Vega, who had already received death threats for his union activities, was killed by five persons who were waiting for him, and who drove away in a vehicle that was waiting for them. In its last examination of the case, the Committee took note of the Government s statement to the effect that criminal proceedings had been initiated for murder.
.The Committee takes note of the Government s additional observations, according to which: () initially, in accordance with the requirements of the Criminal Code of Procedure in cases of murder, the Office of the Public Prosecutor was not authorized to provide details in relation to the case of the murder of the trade union leader Mr Victoriano Abel Vega (to which only the parties were given access) and that as of September  it had not yet been possible to identify the perpetrator or perpetrators; and () the Office of the Public Prosecutor continues to treat this case as an active investigation and the Central Investigation Department continues searching for sources to enable it to identify the perpetrators of the crime.
.The Committee deeply regrets that, although the murder of trade union leader Mr Victoriano Abel Vega took place on  January , almost five and a half years later the authorities have not identified the perpetrators of, or parties to, this abject murder. The Committee regrets to note that, with regard to its request in its previous examinations of the case that investigations be intensified, the Government does not indicate all available measures under applicable laws taken to intensify investigations and only reports that the Office of the Public Prosecutor continues to treat this case as an active investigation. The Committee requests the Government and all the competent authorities to take all available measures in accordance with the law to identify the perpetrators of the murder.
.The Committee again highlights the seriousness of the allegations, deeply deplores and condemns the murder of the trade union leader and regrets that the Government s reply does not indicate that it has mobilized all the means and resources required to clarify this case, despite its extremely serious and urgent nature, which was specifically drawn to the attention of the Governing Body, and it therefore reiterates the recommendation made at its June  meeting. The Committee again requests the Government to provide information on the criminal proceedings initiated and to take all measures at its disposal to ensure that investigations are intensified to clarify the facts, identify the guilty parties and impose in accordance with the law, commensurate punishment, with a view to preventing such types of criminal offences.
.As regards the Committee s recommendation in relation to the fact that the complainant organizations have linked the murder of the union leader to his union activities, and in particular to his advocacy for the establishment of a union in the municipal services of San Sebastin (allegedly impeded through dismissals of the union s founding members and the silence of the labour administration concerning the trade union complaints), the Committee had requested the Government to send its observations on the matter and to ensure that the workers in question are able to establish a trade union without restriction. The Committee takes note of the Government s statement in its reply that these allegations are unfounded given that SITRAMSA was created on  November  and that its executive committee members' credentials are still valid.
.In this regard, the Committee wishes to highlight that the murder of the trade union leader Mr Victoriano Abel Vega took place on  January  and that the complainants link this murder with the activities taken to promote the trade union long before that. The Committee requests the Government to ensure that the criminal investigations go into sufficient depth with regard to the declarations of the complainants concerning the anti-union motives for the murder. Likewise, the Committee urges the Government to carry out an inquiry into the alleged dismissals of the founding members of the union of municipal workers and the alleged silence of the labour administration concerning the trade union complaints and to keep it informed in this regard.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee, deeply deploring and condemning the murder of union leader Mr Victoriano Abel Vega, once again requests the Government to provide information on the criminal proceedings initiated and to take all measures at its disposal to ensure that investigations are intensified to clarify the facts, identify the guilty parties and impose commensurate punishment in accordance with the law, with a view to preventing such types of criminal offences. The Committee requests the Government and the competent authorities to take all available measures in accordance with the law to identify the perpetrators of this murder and to investigate further into its alleged anti-union motives.(b) In this connection, as the complainant organizations have linked the murder of the union leader to his union activities, and in particular to his advocacy for the establishment of a union in the municipal services of San Sebastin (allegedly impeded through dismissals of the union s founding members and the silence of the labour administration concerning the trade union complaints), the Committee urges the Government to carry out an investigation in this regard and to keep it informed.(c) Lastly, the Committee once again draws the Governing Body s attention to the extremely serious and urgent nature of this case.
.The Committee last examined this case at its March  meeting, when it presented an interim report to the Governing Body [see th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (March ), paras ' ].
.At its March  meeting [see st Report, para. ], since the Government had not sent its observations despite the time that had elapsed since the last examination of the case, the Committee made an urgent appeal to the Government indicating that, in accordance with the procedural rules set out in paragraph  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session, it could present a report on the substance of the case at its next meeting, even if the requested information or observations had not been received in time. To date, the Government has not sent any information.
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Workers' Representatives Convention,  (No. ), and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.In its previous examination of the case in March , the Committee made the following recommendations [see th Report, paras ' ]:(a) The Committee, deeply deploring and condemning the murder of union leader Mr Victoriano Abel Vega, requests the Government to provide information on the criminal proceedings initiated and to take all measures at its disposal to ensure that investigations are intensified to clarify the facts, identify the guilty parties and impose severe punishment upon them, with a view to preventing such types of criminal offences.(b) Furthermore, as the complainant organizations have linked the murder of the union leader to his union activities, and in particular to his advocacy for the establishment of a union in the municipal services of San Sebastin (allegedly impeded by the dismissal of the union s founding members and the silence of the labour administration concerning the trade union complaints), the Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the matter and to ensure that the workers in question are able to establish a trade union without restriction.(c) Lastly, the Committee draws the Governing Body s attention to the extremely serious and urgent nature of this case.
.The Committee regrets that, despite the time that has elapsed since the presentation of the complaint, the Government has not provided the requested information, even though it was requested to do so through an urgent appeal at its meeting in March . The Committee requests the Government to be more cooperative in the future.
.In these circumstances and in accordance with the applicable procedural rules [see th Report, para. , approved by the",-1,2012,El Salvador
76,"Governing Body], the Committee is obliged to present a report on the substance of the case without being able to take account of the information that it had hoped to receive from the Government.
.The Committee recalls that the purpose of the whole procedure established by the ILO for the examination of allegations of violations of freedom of association is to ensure respect for trade union rights in law and in practice. The Committee is confident that, while this procedure protects governments against unreasonable accusations, they must recognize the importance of presenting, for objective examination, detailed and precise replies concerning allegations brought against them.
.The Committee recalls that the allegations in the present case refer to the murder, on  January , in the city of Santa Ana, of Mr Victoriano Abel Vega (Secretary-General of the Union of Municipal Workers of Santa Ana (SITRAMSA). He died from multiple gunshot wounds after leaving the City Sanitation Services office, where he had gone to present a letter requesting permission to attend a union meeting of the Autonomous Confederation of Salvadorian Workers (CATS). The complainant organizations highlighted that, upon leaving the office, Mr Victoriano Abel Vega, who had already received death threats for his union activities, was killed by five persons who were waiting for him, and who drove away in a vehicle that was waiting for them. In its last examination of the case, the Committee took note of the Government s statement to the effect that criminal proceedings had been initiated in relation to the murder.
.The Committee highlights the seriousness of the allegations, deeply deplores and once again condemns the murder of the trade union leader. The Committee regrets that the Government has still not sent the requested observations and additional information on this case, despite its extremely serious and urgent nature, which was specifically drawn to the attention of the Governing Body. The Committee therefore reiterates the recommendations made at its March  meeting.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee regrets that, despite the time that has elapsed since the last examination of the case in March , the Government has not sent the requested information and observations, even though it was requested to do so through an urgent appeal. The Committee urges the Government to be more cooperative in the future.(b) The Committee, deeply deploring and condemning the murder of union leader Mr Victoriano Abel Vega, once again requests the Government to provide information on the criminal proceedings initiated and to take all measures at its disposal to ensure that investigations are intensified to clarify the facts, identify the guilty parties and impose severe punishment upon them, with a view to preventing such types of criminal offences.(c) Furthermore, as the complainant organizations have linked the murder of the union leader to his union activities, and in particular to his advocacy for the establishment of a union in the municipal services of San Sebastin (allegedly impeded by the dismissal of the union s founding members and the silence of the labour administration concerning the trade union complaints), the Committee once again requests the Government to send its observations on the matter and to ensure that the workers in question are able to establish a trade union without restriction.(d) Lastly, the Committee once again draws the Governing Body s attention to the extremely serious and urgent nature of this case.
.The complaint is contained in a joint communication of the Union of Municipal Workers of Santa Ana (SITRAMSA) and the Autonomous Confederation of Salvadorian Workers (CATS) dated  January .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  February .
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communication of  January , the SITRAMSA and the CATS explained that SITRAMSA had been established on  July , with legal personality under a Ministry of Labour resolution of  September , with Mr Victoriano Abel Vega as the union s Secretary-General since them.
.The complainant organizations allege that on  January , in the city of Santa Ana, the union leader Victoriano Abel Vega arrived at the City Sanitation Services, where he was posted, to present a letter requesting permission to attend a meeting of the CATS in San Salvador. When he left the office, however, around five persons were waiting to murder him. He was murdered at . p.m., at the junction of a Calle Oriente and a Avenida Sur, along Anita Alvarado Park, in the city of Santa Ana. The perpetrators subsequently drove away in a vehicle which was waiting for them nearby. The forensic medical examiners determined that Mr Victoriano Abel Vega died from multiple gunshot wounds in different parts of his body.
.The complainant organizations emphasize that Mr Victoriano Abel Vega was a human rights and union rights advocate, defending employment and the resources of the Santa Ana municipal authorities in the previous municipal council. The municipal administration during the '  period was marked by serious labour rights violations, including the withholding of workers' wages, which were not paid to the corresponding institutions, such as the banks where the workers had their accounts, or to pension and social security funds, causing delays in the payment of wages to all the workers of the commune. Mr Victoriano Abel Vega led a tireless struggle to defend the rights of all the workers, most notably through complaints lodged with the Office of the Public Prosecutor of the Republic against the administration of the council, presided over Mr Orlando Mena. Mr Victoriano Abel Vega also led protests, marches, strikes, and even an indefinite stoppage of work in the municipality, for which he had received death threats. In addition, he had started to organize municipal workers in the western zone, prior to the entry into force of International Labour Organization Conventions Nos , ,  and , ratified by the Legislative Assembly on  August , and which entered into force following a reform of the Constitution of the Republic of El Salvador in June .
.In the light of the foregoing, on  November , Mr Victoriano Abel Vega s efforts were rejected by the municipal authorities of San Sebastin Salitrillo, in the department of Santa Ana. There was also a climate of harassment of workers who wished to be organized in the union, and a policy of persecution and discrimination against the trade union, through the dismissal of those who called for the establishment of a union in the municipality. In the light of this situation, a request for an unscheduled inspection was made to the Ministry of Labour so that the alleged anomalies could be verified and, if confirmed, brought to an end, although the Ministry of Labour did not carry out such inspection.
.In this context, and in the light of the complaint made on  January  by SITRAMSA (together with other municipal workers' unions and the Autonomous Confederation of Salvadorian Workers, thereby offering significant support for the municipal workers of San Sebastin Salitrillo, to defend and support their union rights), union leader Mr Victoriano Abel Vega, who consistently called for the municipal and central authorities to respond to the needs of workers, and for respect for the ILO Conventions ratified by El Salvador, was the victim of premeditated murder.
.Lastly, the complainant organizations note that the State of El Salvador has not undertaken any meaningful action to prosecute and punish the guilty parties who were complicit in such a heinous act against life and freedom of association.
.In its communication dated  February , the Government states that criminal proceedings have been initiated in relation to the murder of SITRAMSA s Secretary General, Mr Victoriano Abel Vega. The adds that the General Prosecutor of the Republic has been consulted on the state of the proceedings; however, the case being a criminal case ' to which the parties have a limited access ' the office of the Prosecutor of Santa Ana has refused to disclose details on the ongoing investigations. When information will be received it will be transmitted to the Committee.
.The Committee notes that in the present case the complainant organizations allege the murder, on  January , in the city of Santa Ana, of Mr Victoriano Abel Vega (Secretary-General of the SITRAMSA). He died from multiple gunshot wounds after leaving the City Sanitation Services office, where he had gone to present a letter requesting permission to attend a union meeting of the CATS. The complainant organizations emphasize that, upon leaving the office, Mr Victoriano Abel Vega, who had already received death threats for his union activities, was killed by five persons who were waiting for him, and who drove away in a vehicle that was waiting for them. The Committee notes the information provided by the Government that criminal proceedings have been initiated in relation to the murder.
.The Committee deeply deplores the murder of union leader",-1,2012,El Salvador
77,"Mr Victoriano Abel Vega and notes with concern that, according to the complainant organizations, he had previously received death threats, and that his murder took place in a climate of anti-union persecution and harassment, which the organizations link to his history of union action (which included the lodging of complaints with the Office of the Public Prosecutor of the Republic against the municipal authorities) and his role in the establishment of a union in the municipal services of San Sebastian Salitrillo. The Committee notes that, according to the allegations, the State has not undertaken significant action to identify and punish the guilty parties. The Committee notes the information provided by the Government that the Prosecutor has not disclosed details on the ongoing investigations as the parties have a limited access to the case because of its criminal nature.
.In these circumstances, the Committee draws the Government s attention to the fact that,  the right to life is a fundamental prerequisite for the exercise of the rights contained in Convention No. ' (ratified by El Salvador) [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, , para. ]. The Committee further recalls that  the rights of workers' and employers' organizations can only be exercised in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind against the leaders and members of these organizations, and it is for governments to ensure that this principle is respected' [see Digest, op. cit., para. ].
.The Committee wishes to draw attention to its fundamental principle by which  the killing, disappearance or serious injury of trade union leaders and trade unionists requires the institution of independent judicial inquiries in order to shed full light, at the earliest date, on the facts and the circumstances in which such actions occurred and in this way, to the extent possible, determine where responsibilities lie, punish the guilty parties and prevent the repetition of similar events' [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. The Committee wishes to emphasize that the judicial investigations must be carried out without delay in order to prevent the impunity, in practice, of the perpetrators.
.The Committee deeply deplores and condemns the murder of union leader Mr Victoriano Abel Vega and requests the Government to provide the information it is referring to in its observations in relation to the criminal proceedings initiated and to take all measures at its disposal to intensify investigations to clarify the facts, identify the guilty parties and impose severe punishment upon them, with a view to preventing such types of criminal offences.
.Furthermore, as the complainant organizations have linked the murder of the union leader to his union activities, and in particular to his advocacy for the establishment of a union in the municipal services of San Sebastin (allegedly impeded through dismissals of the union s founding members and the silence of the labour administration concerning the trade union complaints), the Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the matter and to ensure that the workers in question are able to establish a trade union without restriction.

78,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the Union of Workers of the enterprise AVX INDUSTRIES (SITRAVX) dated  October . The Workers' Trade Union Confederation of El Salvador (CSTS) supported the complaint.
.The Government sent its observation by communication dated  February .
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  October , SITRAVX states that the enterprise is part of the corporation known as AVX/KYOCERA, which produces capacitors (electrical storage devices), and that the factory has been operational since  in San Bartolo, located in the municipality of Ilopango,  kilometres to the east of the capital San Salvador. The complainant indicates that the trade union was established in  with  workers and that, despite the fact that the enterprise impugned six founders of the trade union for being employees in positions of trust, the authorities of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, in accordance with ILO resolutions and Conventions Nos  and , granted legal personality to the trade union in August .
.The complainant alleges that, in September , representatives of the enterprise AVX INDUSTRIES PTE LTD submitted a request to the judicial authority for SITRAVX to be dissolved (among other things, the enterprise argued that a number of workers who were members of the trade union held positions of trust and that others had resigned from the enterprise and that, therefore, the trade union did not possess the minimum number of members necessary, namely , in order for it to exist and function). The complainant also states that the First Labour Court of San Salvador denied the request for dissolution, but that the First Chamber for labour matters of the city of San Salvador overturned the ruling and declared the trade union dissolved for its perceived failure to comply with the provisions of section  of the Labour Act regarding the minimum number of members required to establish a workers' union. In June and July , it initiated amparo proceedings against the ruling and to suspend the administrative decision before the Supreme Court of Justice on the grounds that the decision to dissolve the trade union on the initiative and at the request of the enterprise was a violation of constitutional rights.
.In its response of  February , the Government indicates that, on  July , SITRAVX submitted to the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare a copy of its application for amparo (constitutional protection) filed with the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice, by which the union requests that the ruling of the First Chamber for labour matters to dissolve SITRAVX be rescinded. The Government indicates that, pending the judgment of the Supreme Court, and in order to avoid any irreversible damages that the liquidation of the union could give rise to, the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare decided, pursuant to article  of the Constitution of the Republic and Article  of ILO Convention No. , to revoke ex officio the decision of the National Department of Social Organizations of the Ministry to cancel the registration of SITRAVX. Furthermore, on  October , the said Department registered the names of the members of the executive committee of SITRAVX for the period  September '  August . Thus, the relevant union is currently active and valid.
.Additionally, the Government indicates that, in its view, the national labour legislation suffers from a huge deficit, given that the decisions issued in the second instance relating to the dissolution of a union are not challengeable, which creates a situation that violates the right to access to effective legal protection and to the constitutional rights of defence and hearing.
.The Committee takes note of the complainant s allegations that, in September , representatives of the enterprise AVX INDUSTRIES PTE LTD submitted a request to the judicial authority for SITRAVX to be dissolved (among other things, the enterprise argued that a number of workers who were members of the trade union held positions of trust and that others had resigned from the enterprise and that, therefore, the trade union did not possess the minimum number of members necessary, namely , in order for it to exist and function). The Committee also takes note of the complainant s statement to the effect that: () the First Labour Court of San Salvador denied the request for dissolution; () the First Chamber for labour matters of the city of San Salvador overturned the ruling and declared the trade union dissolved for its perceived failure to comply with the provisions of section  of the Labour Code regarding the minimum number of members required to establish a workers' union; and () in June and July , it initiated amparo proceedings against the ruling and to suspend the administrative decision before the Supreme Court of Justice on the grounds that the decision to dissolve the trade union on the initiative and at the request of the enterprise was a violation of constitutional rights.
.The Committee notes the Government s observations, in which it indicates that, pending the judgment of the Supreme Court and in order to avoid any irreversible damages that the dissolution of the union could give rise to, the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare decided to revoke ex officio the decision of the National Department of Social Organizations of the Ministry to cancel the registration of SITRAVX and that, on  October , the Department registered the names of the executive committee of SITRAVX for the period  September '  August ; thus the union is currently active and valid.
.The Committee firstly regrets the length of time that has elapsed (more than three years) since the application for the dissolution of SITRAVX, during which time the judicial authority has still not issued a final ruling on the substance of the case. As regards the minimum number of members required () in order for a trade union to be established and to function set out in section  of the Labour Code, the Committee recalls that, on numerous occasions, it highlighted that  while a minimum membership requirement is not in itself incompatible with Convention No. , the number should be fixed in a reasonable manner so that the establishment of organizations is not hindered' and that  the legal requirement laid down for a minimum of  workers to establish a trade union should be reduced in order not to hinder the establishment of trade unions at enterprises' [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , paras ' ]. Furthermore, the Committee notes that the Government, in its report on the implementation of Convention No.  in , stated that  a draft decree to amend section  of the Labour Code has been prepared and submitted for debate by the Higher Labour Council (CST)' 
.Under these circumstances, while it recalls that, as regards the dissolution of workers' and employers' organizations  judges should be able to deal with the substance of a case to enable them to decide whether or not the provisions pursuant to which the administrative measures in question were taken constitute a violation of the rights accorded to occupational organizations by Convention No. ' [see Digest, op. cit., para. ], and while taking due note of the revocation ex officio by the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare of the decision to cancel the registration of SITRAVX, the Committee expresses the firm hope that the Supreme Court of Justice will swiftly rule on the dissolution of SITRAVX and that it will take into account the principles mentioned in the conclusions, as well as the draft decree to amend section  of the Labour Act. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee expresses the firm hope that the Supreme Court of Justice will swiftly rule on the dissolution of SITRAVX and that it will take into account the principles mentioned in the conclusions, as well as the draft decree to amend section  of the Labour Act (regarding the minimum number of members required in order for a trade union to be established). The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.",1,2011,El Salvador
79,".The complaint is contained in a communication dated  August  from the Union of Workers of the Garments Company Gama (STECG) and supported by the Federation of Unions of Workers in El Salvador (FESTES) in a communication of  September .
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  August  and  September .
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Workers' Representatives Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants allege that the attempt by STECG to negotiate an initial collective agreement with the Garments Company Gama, SA of CV (hereinafter Gama) gave rise to the sudden closure of the textile company and the subsequent dismissal of its  workers.
.Established on  October , STECG presented a list of demands on  April  to the Director-General of Labour of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare to begin negotiating an initial collective company agreement governing employer employee labour relations. On  April, Gama made clear to the Ministry of Labour its refusal to enter into negotiations with STECG, claiming that the trade union did not have the number of members required by the Labour Code for collective bargaining. The Ministry of Labour then requested STECG to submit its list of members' names, which was submitted to the company by the Ministry without consultation.
.Once STECG s overall responsibility for negotiating a collective agreement was confirmed, the Ministry, setting aside the direct treatment phase which, according to national legislation, should constitute the first phase of collective bargaining, and summoned the parties directly for the following stage of conciliation of the collective dispute. From  to  June , four conciliation meetings were held in which STECG and the enterprise managed to approve  clauses of the collective agreement being prepared.
.On  June , the company s workers noted that the company was beginning to withdraw from the factory part of the machinery and also raw materials. On  June, the company informed the Ministry of Labour that it had taken the decision to close its operations owing to lack of profitability and that it had available funds to pay only  per cent of what the workers were owed. The organizations state that these declarations contrast with the information available in the Commercial Register of El Salvador, where on  February  the company s accountant had presented documents providing evidence of significant growth in the company s profits for . That same day, while the representatives of STECG and the company continued negotiating the draft collective agreement, the Director-General of Labour and the Director-General of Inspection of the Ministry of Labour appeared in order to state that there was no longer any point in negotiating that agreement in view of the company s closure.
.On  July , faced with the company s threats not to pay what all the workers were owed, STECG necessarily made a submission in which it renounced the process of negotiating the collective agreement if said payments were made.
.The complainant organizations allege that since that time Gama employees continue to be unable to find new jobs, since the other companies in the sector are making it perfectly clear to them that their previous employment makes it impossible to hire them. They consider that the handing over of the list of STECG members' names to the enterprise is related to this situation.
.The complainant organizations consider that the sudden and unjustified closure of the company in the midst of the negotiation of what would have been the first collective agreement in the maquila sector in El Salvador is a direct violation of Articles  and  of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), since the company s  workers were dismissed for having exercised their right to collective bargaining, which they are still denied.
.They also claim that the practice of the Ministry of Labour, based on Salvadorian legislation, of requesting the personal information of each of the company s union members and providing said information to the company to endeavour to meet the legal requirements as regards overall responsibility for collective bargaining constitutes interference by the public authorities, which contravenes Article () of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ). That practice discourages the exercise of freedom of association and makes it possible for black lists to be circulated, which would explain why it is impossible for Gama workers to be hired by other companies.
.On the basis of the above allegations, the complainants request the reinstatement of all the workers from the company Gama, which would continue operating, compensation for the damage suffered and relaunching of the collective bargaining process.
.In its response of  August , the Government of El Salvador indicates that the Ministry of Labour received a list of demands from STECG on  April , which was forwarded to the company Gama. On  April, the company expressed in writing its refusal to undertake negotiations with STECG, since it considered that the majority of workers were not members of the union in question, one of the three present in the company, contrary to the requirements of article  of the Labour Code. The following day, the company made a new submission in writing in which it requested that the list of workers who were members of STECG be collated with the company s current name. Having noted that STECG actually satisfied the legal requirements for negotiation, the company showed complete willingness to undertake negotiations on a collective labour agreement.
.As regards the interruption of the collective bargaining process, the Government states that the process was initially suspended owing to the fact that the employers had alleged that the company had been closed and that the process was finally shelved as a result of STECG s withdrawal, submitted in writing on  July , as a result of the agreement reached with the company, through which the trade union agreed to give up the negotiating process under way, in exchange for the workers being paid everything they were owed. On  September , STECG lodged an appeal for review of the decision to shelve the collective bargaining process. That appeal was declared non-receivable by the Ministry of Labour.
.The Government states also that when the company closed down in the middle of the negotiations on the collective agreement, the Ministry of Labour informed the trade union of the possibility of requesting its participation as a conciliator or also bringing legal action, and that, at the negotiating table set up to try to achieve a solution to the conflict that had arisen as a result of the company s closure, the Ministry reminded the employers of their legal obligation to pay to all workers everything owed to them.
.As regards the alleged anti-union practices and the reinstatement of the Gama workers, the Government states that STECG requested, in a submission of  February , verification of the dismissal of the union officials. In a visit that took place on  February, the labour inspectorate noted that the company s textile maquila unit was not operating, while unbleached fabric manufacturing activity was ongoing, employing  people. The inspectors also noted that the STECG union officials had signed their contract termination form and received payment of what was owed to them, for which reason they concluded that no infringement had taken place.
.In its communication of  September , the Government confirms that the visit by the labour inspectorate which took place on  February  consisted in noting the cessation of the textile maquila activity and the maintenance of reduced unbleached fabric activity with different machinery. The Government indicates that the dismissal of all the workers following the closure, irrespective of whether they were members of a trade union, was something which made the inspector s work more difficult at the time of reporting as to whether anti-union discrimination had occurred.
.The Committee notes that this case refers on the one hand to allegations relating to the sudden closure of a company in the maquila sector in the midst of collective bargaining in order to prevent a collective Convention being signed, leading to the anti-union dismissal of  workers and, on the other hand, to allegations concerning the circulation of a black list that would make it impossible for other companies in the sector to hire workers from the company concerned.
.The Committee notes the observations by the Government, in which it states that: in order to ensure that the STECG union had overall responsibility for collective bargaining, the Gama company requested that the list of STECG members be collated with the names of its active workers; the sudden closure of the company occurred in the middle of the collective agreement bargaining process and the trade union finally withdrew from the negotiating process, in exchange for the company paying everything owed to the workers; the labour inspectorate",1,2011,El Salvador
80,"noted the maintenance of reduced activity in the workplace but did not note the anti-union dismissal of the union officials, since those officials had signed their contract termination forms and received payment of what was owed to them; the STECG lodged an appeal for review of the decision taken by the Directorate General of Labour to shelve the collective bargaining process, but the appeal was declared irreceivable by the Ministry of Labour.
.As to the allegations that the list of STECG members' names was passed on to the company by the Ministry of Labour, the Committee notes that the Government states that the company requested the list of STECG members to be collated with the names of its active workers. In this regard, the Committee wishes to recall that the protection of data regarding union membership is a fundamental aspect of human rights and, in particular, the right to privacy [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, para. ] and that the determination to ascertain or verify the representative character of trade unions can best be ensured when strong guarantees of secrecy and impartiality are offered [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. In this connection, with a view to avoiding possible acts of anti-union discrimination, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures, including introducing legislation, to ensure that the lists of union members' names are not communicated to the employer and that it be kept informed in this regard.
.The Committee notes that the Government has not sent its observations regarding the allegations that, owing to the list of union members' names being passed on, the companies' employees appear to be the victims of anti-union discrimination by the other companies in the maquila sector, thereby making it impossible to hire those workers anywhere else. The Committee notes that these allegations are made in a context in which the union of the company in question was, it would appear, negotiating a collective agreement with the enterprise. Recalling that workers in export processing zones, like other workers, without distinction whatsoever, should enjoy the trade union rights provided for by the freedom of association Conventions [see Digest, op. cit., para. ], that the practice involving the blacklisting of trade union officials or members constitutes a serious threat to the free exercise of trade union rights and, in general, that governments should take stringent measures to combat such practices [see Digest, op. cit., para. ], the Committee requests the Government to investigate without delay the allegations referred to and to keep it informed of the outcome of the investigation.
.The Committee notes that both the allegations by the complainant and the Government observations coincide in that the company was closed down suddenly on  June  in the midst of the meetings to negotiate the collective agreement, held from  to  June . In the light of the records of the four collective agreement bargaining meetings produced by the Ministry of Labour, the Committee notes that the meetings held on , ,  and  June gave rise to substantive negotiations on the content of a collective labour agreement, and the approval of  clauses designed to govern labour relations and conditions within the company. It notes also that those negotiations do not mention the forthcoming closure of the company or its possible economic difficulties. Finally, based on the information provided by the Government, the Committee notes that the inspection visit following the dismissal of the company s  workers simply noted the cessation of the textile maquila activity in the workplace and its replacement with reduced unbleached fabric production activity but that, by contrast, no thorough investigation had taken place to determine the possible anti-union motives of the cessation of activities.
.In the light of the above information, the Committee recalls the importance which it attaches to the obligation to negotiate in good faith for the maintenance of the harmonious development of labour relations [see Digest, op. cit. para. ] and that although the genuine closure of companies is not contrary to the principle that both employers and trade unions should negotiate in good faith, and make efforts to reach an agreement, the closure and lay-off of employees specifically in response to the exercise of trade union rights is tantamount to the denial of such rights [see Case No. , Report No. , June , para. ].
.The Committee urges the Government to carry out without delay an investigation into the possible anti-union nature of the cessation of activities and to keep it informed of the outcome of the investigation. Should the alleged anti-union nature of the cessation be proved, and in noting that the company maintained reduced activity, the Committee requests the Government to seek, in proportion with the current scope of activity of the enterprise, the reinstatement of individual workers dismissed, and to ensure that the workers who cannot be reinstated be paid suitable compensation, which would represent a sufficiently dissuasive sanction, taking into account any indemnities already received in the framework of the agreement between the trade union and the enterprise in July .
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures, including introducing legislation, to ensure that the lists of union members' names are not communicated to the employer and that it be kept informed in this regard.(b) The Committee requests the Government to investigate without delay the allegations of anti-union discrimination that appear to prevent the hiring of Gama workers in the maquila sector and to keep it informed of the outcome of the investigation.(c) The Committee urges the Government to carry out without delay a thorough investigation into the possible anti-union nature of the cessation of activities within the company in question and to keep it informed of the outcome of the investigation. Should the alleged anti-union nature of the cessation be proved, and in noting that the company maintained reduced activity, the Committee requests the Government to seek, in proportion with the current scope of activity of the enterprise, the reinstatement of individual workers dismissed and to ensure that the workers who cannot be reinstated be paid suitable compensation, which would represent a sufficiently dissuasive sanction, taking into account any indemnities already received in the framework of the agreement concluded between the trade union and the enterprise in July .",0,2011,El Salvador
81,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the Union of Workers of the Ministry of Finance (SITRAMHA) dated  October .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  August .
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  October , SITRAMHA states that it was established on  July  and that towards the end of  it presented a list of demands to the Civil Service Tribunal, which the national legislation has appointed to monitor collective bargaining in the public sector for purposes of collective agreements.
.The complainant states that, although the direct bargaining stage between the parties should have begun in January , at the verbal request of the Office of the Ministry of Finance it started in February .
.Accordingly, the parties formally embarked upon the conciliation stage of the collective bargaining and a negotiating committee was set up by the Office of the Ministry and, albeit without any power to take decisions or enter into negotiations.
.At the end of July , the Ministry of Finance embarked upon a media campaign and sent a series of internal memorandums (which the complainant attached) that were contrary to the spirit of collective bargaining and interfered in the affairs of the trade union and its executive board.
.On  August , the Civil Service Tribunal issued an order for the third (arbitration) stage to begin. On  August, the Tribunal issued a further order listing the arbitrators appointed by the union and by the Ministry of Finance.
.On  September , the Civil Service Tribunal summoned the arbitrators designated by the Ministry of Finance (Jos Antonio Morales Toms Carbonell and Danilo Ernesto Flores Lpez) and by the union (Jos Dagoberto Gutirrez Linares and Jos Mara Esperanza Amaya) to be sworn in.
.On  September, however, the Civil Service Tribunal, in an obvious tactic to delay the negotiations, issued a report stating that the arbitrators appointed by the Ministry of Finance had resigned. On  September, the union sent the Ministry a note renewing its request for a hearing and proposing that the question of the resignation of the arbitrators appointed by the Ministry of Finance be placed on the agenda. The Ministry returned the note stating that the union had no right to demand anything.
.The complainant states that, owing to the Ministry s delaying tactics, the general budget was presented to the Legislative Assembly in September  without the provision which the collective agreement was intended for, thus signalling the breakdown in the collective bargaining process.
.In its communication, dated  August , the Government refers to the collective bargaining process between SITRAMHA and the Ministry of Finance before the Civil Service Tribunal, which is designated by the Civil Service Act to conduct negotiations on collective labour agreements in the public sector. The Government adds that the procedure laid down in article  to  of the said Act for collective agreements dealing with economic or group interest matters was strictly adhered to.
.The Government states that, on  November , SITRAMHA presented a list of demands containing  clauses. Of these,  were approved at the direct discussion stage,  were approved at the conciliation stage (when it was also agreed to delete seven clauses) and  clauses were left pending agreement. Once the conciliation stage had ended, the points on which disagreement remained were submitted to arbitration, pursuant to article  of the Civil Service Act, so that the clauses on which no agreement had been reached could be resolved.
.The Government states that, before the arbitration stage began and in accordance with article  of the Civil Service Act, each party appointed its representatives on the Arbitration Tribunal and so informed the President of the Civil Service Tribunal, who proceeded to swear in the Tribunal and its President. The Tribunal was called to order on  October  when it embarked on an examination and analysis of each of the clauses set aside for arbitration, as required by article  of the Civil Service Act. The Arbitration Tribunal handed down its ruling on  December , when it declared that state policy on the subject must reflect certain basic characteristics: () gradual implementation of the agreement over time; () financial sustainability in keeping with the country s economic situation; () the high quality of the public service, the ethical conduct of the services rendered, the vocational training of staff, technological development, the efficient use of resources and solidarity with the people in the conduct of their activities; () the equity and homogeneity of wage and labour union policies in all public institutions; () the responsible conduct of trade union affairs in a spirit of solidarity; and () the stability of the labour market, the promotion of careers according to personal merit and observance of the legal provisions in force. The ruling also approved  clauses, which the Tribunal ordered to be incorporated into those on which agreement had already been reached during the previous stages (i.e. inserted and numbered in the order in which they initially appeared in the list of demands).
.Finally, the clauses that were approved at the direct discussion, conciliation and arbitration stages were consolidated to form the collective labour agreement for '  of SITRAMHA and the Ministry of Finance. The agreement was registered with the National Department of Social Organizations of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare on  December .
.The Committee takes note that in the present case the complainant alleges that the Ministry of Finance employed delaying tactics and deliberately slowed down the negotiation of the collective labour agreement (which began in February ), that the Ministry appointed officials who had no training in collective bargaining and decision-making and that it did not inform the union of the swearing in of the Ministry s new representatives on the Civil Service Tribunal (as those who had been appointed initially resigned on  September). As a result, at the date the complaint was presented ( October ), the arbitration stage had not yet been concluded, which meant that no provision was submitted to the Legislative Assembly in the general budget presented in September  that took into account the demands of the complainant trade union.
.The Committee takes note that the Government states that on  December  the Arbitration Tribunal handed down its ruling, approving  clauses to be added to those on which the parties had already agreed '  at the direct discussion stage and  at the conciliation stage, at which it had also been agreed to delete seven clauses. According to the Government, the Arbitration Tribunal began its work on  October  ( days after the Ministry of Finance s arbitrators resigned and others had been appointed to replace them).
.In these circumstances and taking into account that the two parties approved a significant number of clauses during the direct discussion and conciliation stages and that the new arbitrators were appointed within  days, the Committee is unable to conclude that there was any lack of good faith by the Ministry of Finance by way of delaying tactics during the negotiations, especially since this was the Ministry s first collective agreement and would normally be expected to entail a longer bargaining process.
.The Committee also takes note of the complainant s allegation that, because of the delay in the negotiations, the general budget did not include any provision reflecting the financial clauses contained in their list of demands. However, the Committee observes that the complainant has not presented any further objections to the content or consequences of the Arbitration Tribunal s ruling and that it is not impossible that the said ruling touched on the union s wage demand or that the draft budget subsequently included a heading dealing with remuneration at the Ministry of Finance.
.Finally, the Committee takes note of the allegations concerning internal communications at the Ministry of Finance that were designed to interfere or to influence union leaders and members during the bargaining process and observes that the Government has not provided any observations on the subject. The Committee observes that the said communications (attached by the complainant to its complaint) refer, on the one hand, to the Ministry s refusal to authorize the holding of a union meeting on its premises during working hours and, on the other, to notification of decisions regarding certain perennial union demands (a basic food basket, recognition of mission expenses on a broader scale, an increase in the value of life insurance at the Ministry, more extensive medical and dental assistance and better coverage of transport costs), which the Ministry states were resolved independently of the negotiations on the collective agreement. The Committee states that, had these important decisions been reached during the collective bargaining, the strike called by the union to improve working conditions might have been averted. The Committee expects that decisions of this kind will in",1,2011,El Salvador
82,"future be taken in consultation or during negotiations with the trade union. That said, observing that the main problem in the case has been resolved by the new collective agreement, the Committee considers that the case does not call for further examination.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.",0,2011,El Salvador
83,".The complaint is contained in a communication dated  July  from the Association of Judiciary Workers (ASTOJ), the '  June' Judiciary Employees' Union of El Salvador (SEJE  de junio) and the Union of Judiciary Workers (SUTOJ).
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  August and  November  and  April .
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communication of  July , the complainant organizations allege obstacles to negotiations for a salary increase for judiciary workers and unjustified pay deductions for strike days.
.The complainant organizations allege that in January  they submitted a claim for a salary increase for  and that the competent authorities responded with delays and obstacles to negotiations in good faith, as follows: (i) they were silent for nine months, failing to respond to the initial claim for the pay rise; (ii) a copy of the draft budget, which was requested within the labour relations committee (the body for dialogue between representatives of the judiciary workers and the judiciary), was not made available even though the judges representing the Supreme Court of Justice in the committee had pledged to supply it; (iii) the representatives of the workers were informed that the budget did not contain a salary increase once the budget had been sent to the Ministry of Finance; and (iv) the competent authorities informed the trade union representatives in November  that there were funds in the  budget to cover the pay rise for all public employees announced by the President of the Republic, but then told them at the beginning of  that there were no resources to grant the salary increase.
.The complainants indicate that they subsequently submitted a claim for a salary increase of US$ for all judiciary workers. On  January , the complainants were called to a meeting of the labour relations committee, at which the pay increase was not initially on the agenda but it was agreed to include this item and a judge undertook to forward the claim to the plenary of the Supreme Court. The complainants state that, after once again receiving no reply, all the trade unions agreed to stop work from  to  January . The complainants add that, in response to this pressure, the competent authorities convened meetings with representatives of the labour relations committee on  and  January  with a view to reaching a settlement, requesting that the work stoppage at the Institute of Forensic Medicine be discontinued, to which the unions agreed. The judges then undertook to refer the unions' proposal to the plenary of the Supreme Court, confident that they would be able to announce a successful outcome that evening. However, the complainants claim that they were informed a few hours later that the President of the Supreme Court had broken off the negotiations, and the national police, through the Public Order Maintenance Unit, removed the workers from the premises of the Supreme Court and the Institute of Forensic Medicine. On  January , the complainants requested the intervention of the Human Rights Ombudsman to reconvene the negotiations, and this had a positive outcome: the Supreme Court established a high-level advisory board and the trade unions were invited to a meeting on  February  to launch the negotiations. However, the pay increase did not materialize on that occasion, further to the Supreme Court president s statement that no funds were available. At this refusal, the complainants submitted another proposal for a salary increase which was again rejected supposedly for lack of funds, despite the fact that the trade unions had demonstrated through a financial study that the Supreme Court did have the funds to cover the proposal. The complainants add that an agreement was subsequently reached with the authorities, namely to award a US$ bonus in March and the same amount again in September  to more than , workers.
.The complainants report that in February  the competent authorities requested all members of the trade union executive committees to provide evidence that they duly provided services during the period of the work stoppage, otherwise pay would be deducted, in accordance with section  of the general budgetary provisions. The complainants allege that, after they were denied their right to a hearing and due process as provided for in the national Constitution was violated, five double daily salary equivalents were deducted for absence from work. They add that this measure affected only the officers of the trade unions referred to above. The complainants consider that the salary deductions constituted intimidation to prevent the exercise of their rights and an abuse of power on the part of the authorities concerned, since the union officers in question had attended the meetings to which they had been invited and so the authorities had witnessed the fact that the officers had been present in the workplace.
.In its communications of  August and  November  and  April , the Government declares that the complainant organizations' rights to freedom of association have not been violated. It states that the Supreme Court of Justice has given considerable support to the trade unions at the Court, recognizing duly registered organizations and allowing them to participate in the labour relations committee to launch negotiations and settle any labour disputes.
.With regard to the allegations of obstacles to negotiations for a salary increase, the Government states that an impasse occurred which has been resolved inasmuch as the Supreme Court indicates that the trade unions have participated actively since  in the meetings of the labour relations committee bringing together the Supreme Court authorities and members of the trade union executive committees, at which any labour disputes have been settled. As an example of the agreements reached, the Government refers to the adoption on  September  of an additional salary increase of US$ for all employees and civil servants except judges and magistrates, which took effect as from January .
.With regard to the allegations of unjustified pay deductions for strike days, the Government states that representatives of the trade unions filed complaints for blatant injustice against the competent authorities and that the Civil Service Tribunal dismissed the complaints, ruling that the pay deductions imposed for not working during the period of the work stoppage were lawful.
.The Government explains that the deductions are justified by the Civil Service Act, the general budgetary provisions and the case law of the Supreme Court; due process was honoured and the deductions represented a payment or return of salaries to the state coffers for work not performed.
.The Government denies that the deductions were imposed in discriminatory fashion only on members of the trade union executive committees, indicating that they were also imposed on other Supreme Court employees who had failed to perform their duties. As an illustration of this, the Government refers to the proceedings initiated within the Civil Service Tribunal by the other employees who incurred the deductions, and attaches the relevant ruling of the Civil Service Tribunal of  May , which records the other deductions made.
.The Government adds that the employees who provided evidence that they actually worked on the dates concerned were repaid the salary amounts that had been deducted.
.With regard to the strike ban imposed on public and municipal workers under article  of the national Constitution, the Government indicates that El Salvador has taken note of the observations of the ILO supervisory bodies so that the aforementioned article can be revised by the competent authorities in accordance with Convention No. .
.The Committee observes that the complainant alleges obstacles to negotiations for a salary increase for judiciary workers and unjustified pay deductions for strike days.
.As regards reported obstacles to negotiations for a salary increase, the Committee notes the Government's statement that an impasse occurred which has been resolved, as borne out by the subsequent agreements on salaries concluded with the trade unions. Since it has not received any information to the contrary from the complainant organizations, the Committee acknowledges the efforts made by the competent authorities and encourages them to continue promoting social dialogue and voluntary collective bargaining conducted in good faith with the judiciary workers.
.As regards the allegation of unjustified pay deductions for strike days, the Committee notes the Government's indications that the deductions were made without distinction from all employees (not just the trade union officers) who were absent from work without good reason, in accordance with the legislation, due process and the applicable case law; that the competent courts dismissed the related appeals filed by the complainant organizations; and that the deducted salary amounts were repaid to workers who provided evidence that they had actually worked. The Committee wishes to recall that salary deductions for days of strike give rise to no objection from the point of view of freedom of association principles, however, in",1,2011,El Salvador
84,"a case in which the deductions of pay were higher than the amount corresponding to the period of the strike, the Committee recalled that the imposition of sanctions for strike action was not conducive to harmonious labour relations [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , paras  and ].
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee encourages the competent authorities to continue promoting social dialogue and voluntary collective bargaining conducted in good faith with the judiciary workers.",0,2011,El Salvador
85,".The Committee examined this case at its March  and June  meetings. At the last of these, it presented an interim report [see nd Report, paras  to , approved by the Governing Body at its st Session (June )].
.Subsequently, the Government sent its observations in a communication dated  November .
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its previous examination of the case in June , the Committee made the following recommendations on the matters still pending [see nd Report, para. ]:' b) The Committee again requests the Government to keep it informed of the implementation of the Committee s recommendations with regard to Case No. , notably that the legislation be amended to remove the excessive formalities that apply to the establishment of trade union organizations and that trade union leaders, Luis Wilfredo Berrios and Gloria Mercedes Gonzlez, be reinstated in their posts.(c) The Committee once again requests the Government to take the necessary steps to ensure that SITCOM s continued existence is not jeopardized for motives that run counter to the principles of freedom of association and to bring the principles concerning dual trade union membership to the attention of the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court. The Committee expects that those principles will be taken into account by the Court and requests the Government to keep it informed of the corresponding ruling handed down. The Committee moreover urges the Government to take the necessary steps to amend section  of the Labour Code prohibiting dual union membership.(d) Regarding the suspension by the CTE of the deduction of union dues for workers affiliated to SITCOM, the Committee once again requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the sanctions procedure that has been initiated and expects the sanctions imposed to be sufficiently dissuasive so that there is no recurrence of this kind of anti-union action in future in the company concerned.(e) Regarding the dismissal of trade union officials, Tania Gadalmez and Csar Leonel Flores, the Committee once again requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in the sanctions procedure that has been initiated and expects the sanctions imposed to be sufficiently dissuasive so that there is no recurrence of this kind of anti-union action in future in the company concerned.(f) The Committee once again requests the Government to send it information without delay on the alleged discriminatory dismissal of five trade union officials at Construcciones y Servicios Integrales de Telecomunicaciones SA de CV, a subcontractor, and on the alleged anti-union dismissals at the Atento company.(g) The Committee again requests the Government to send it detailed information without delay on the request for a special inspection into the alleged domination of SINTRABATES by the employer, on the outcome of the corresponding court action brought by SITCOM and on the measures taken to amend the legislation as it relates to acts of interference to the detriment of trade unions.(h) The Committee once again requests the Government to provide it with information on the measures taken, including legislative measures, to provide union officials with effective protection in the event of anti-union discrimination.(i) The Committee once again invites the Government to consider, in consultation with the social partners, the review of section  of the Labour Code which provides that no appeal may be lodged against decisions handed down by a court of second instance.
.In its communication dated  November , the Government indicates that, in relation to recommendation (b) in the previous examination of the case (the need to remove from legislation the excessive formalities for the establishment of trade union organizations), from  to  the number of registered trade unions has increased significantly from  active trade unions in the private sector in , to  in September of the current year; in  there were ten trade unions active in the public sector, compared to  in September . Consequently, the Government considers that the legislation in force has not hampered the registration process.
.Within its area of competence, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security is promoting a policy of dialogue and outreach with all employers' and workers' organizations to enable all professional associations to present their concerns regarding the way in which the Ministry of Labour and Social Security processes their requests, specifically through meetings with various trade union organizations and accountability procedures. The Ministry has carried out various administrative changes in the National Department of Social Organizations with a view to expediting proceedings and claims filed by trade union organizations, addressing them in accordance with legislation.
.The Government indicates that the establishment of a minimum number of members for the creation of a trade union (currently ) seeks to avoid the existence of a large number of organizations within the same company or institution and that it does not consider this measure to violate freedom of association and the right to organize.
.As regards the six-month delay before being able to present a new application for trade union registration, the Government indicates that the legislation is not restrictive. Internal administrative mechanisms have been established, including spaces for bilateral exchange with the founding members of the prospective trade union to provide them with guidance on meeting all the legal requirements. Among the public information circulated, this body indicates that if an application by a workers' organization is rejected following its failure to meet a requirement, it can present the relevant documentation on the following day under a new application for trade union registration.
.Regarding the reinstatement in their posts of the trade union officials Mr Luis Wilfredo Berrios and Ms Gloria Mercedes Gonzlez, the Government reports that the Ministry of Labour and Social Security is unable to carry out the relevant transactions because the institution ceased to exist when the National Telecommunications Authority (ANTEL), where the aforementioned union officials worked, was privatized under legislative decree No.  of  July . However, investigations were carried out in the archives of the General Directorate for Labour Inspection of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security which did not find any communication from the parties concerned to the labour inspection authority of San Salvador regarding these union officials. As a result, it was not possible to verify their reinstatement due to alleged unfair dismissal.
.As regards Committee recommendation (c) (measures to ensure that the Telecommunications Workers' Union s (SITCOM) existence is not jeopardized), the Government reports that general measures have been and will continue to be taken to ensure a guarantee of and compliance with trade union rights. The measures that are implemented include regular inspections to verify compliance with trade union rights and their effective protection, and to maintain the register of union members to guarantee its legal existence. Furthermore, note is taken of the request by the Committee and it will be informed in good time of any progress made or action taken with regard to the subject of dual trade union membership, which is before the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice, and of any ruling issued in that regard.
.As regards Committee recommendation (d) (the suspension of the deduction and the transfer of union dues), the Government indicates that, on  July , a worker requested an inspection when the employer stopped applying the deduction of union dues for workers; the inspectorate determined that the employer had violated section  of the Labour Code by failing to apply the deduction of the corresponding union dues in respect of  workers who are members of the aforementioned trade union; this was followed by another inspection which found that the reported violations had not been remedied, whereby the case entered the corresponding procedure for the imposition of sanctions.
.As regards Committee recommendation (e), the Government indicates that in the case of the dismissal of Ms Tania Vernica Gadalmez, the assistant general secretary of the SITCOM executive committee, on  January , said union official indicated that she had been dismissed de facto (without the application of due process), and therefore unfairly, for carrying out her duties as the general secretary of the aforementioned trade union; in this regard a special inspection was carried out at the request of Ms Tania Gadalmez, in which the employer was notified that it should immediately reinstate the aforementioned worker and union official. However, the employer representatives indicated that they could not provide an answer until they had consulted their superiors. The inquiries also found that the wages accrued and unpaid over the period from  to  December  had been settled with the official. Sanctions proceedings were initiated against the employer, which received a fine for the violation of section ., for the other unpaid wages accrued for causes attributable to the employer, and section  of the Labour Code, for the de facto dismissal of the aforementioned union official.
.As regards Mr Csar Leonel Flores Aguilar, who is also a SITCOM union official,",1,2011,El Salvador
86,"the employer paid him compensation and the worker signed the corresponding settlement, bringing an end to the employment relationship. It was therefore not possible to establish that there had been any kind of violation.
.As regards Committee recommendation (f), in particular with regard to the allegations of the discriminatory dismissal of five trade union officials working for the subcontractor Construcciones y Servicios Integrales de Telecomunicaciones SA de CV and at the company Atento El Salvador, the Government reports that the records kept for such cases by the General Directorate for Labour Inspection of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, and specifically by the Special Unit for the Prevention of Discriminatory Labour Practices, contained administrative proceedings under reference No. -UD---E-SS, setting out the details relating to the unfair dismissal of David Alberto Martnez and Jos Guillermo Rodrguez, on the grounds of their membership of the SITCOM sectoral executive committee for the company Atento El Salvador, SA de CV. The allegations established that on  October , the plant supervisor dismissed them unfairly, given their status as union officials and the absence of any procedure prior to their dismissal, violating section  of the Constitution, sections  and , paragraph  of the Labour Code, article  of ILO Convention No.  and article  of ILO Convention No. . The case is currently the subject of an appeal.
.The Government also requests the Committee to indicate the names of the three other union officials who were allegedly dismissed, given that only two of the five aforementioned union officials have been found in the records.
.As regards Committee recommendation (g) (alleged control of the Union of Workers of Atento El Salvador (SINTRABATES) by the employer), the Government reports that a special inspection was carried out as a result of the complaint submitted to the Special Unit for the Prevention of Discriminatory Labour Practices of the General Directorate for Labour Inspection of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, on  March . Among other things, this points to the promotion of an employer-controlled trade union with the acronym SINTRABATES; furthermore, administrative proceedings were filed under reference No. -UD---P-SS in view of the request submitted to the aforementioned Directorate on  March  by SITCOM. The labour inspection report, dated  April , found violations to section , prohibition  of the Labour Code, through discriminatory acts against workers on the grounds of their trade union membership where workers were asked to indicate, on the job application forms used by the company, whether they were members of a union; section  obligation , through the mistreatment of workers by submitting them to polygraph tests; section  of the Act on Equal Opportunities for People with Disabilities, by not hiring persons with disabilities when the company was required to hire  persons with disabilities. The proceedings entered the procedure for the imposition of sanctions owing to the failure to remedy this last violation. The Government also reports that, having reviewed its compliance with the legal requirements and the procedure established by the Labour Code, the administrative authority recognized the legal personality of SINTRABATES in a ruling of  January .
.As regards Committee recommendation (h), the Government reports that the measures taken to provide union officials with effective protection in the event of anti-union discrimination are established in legislation, specifically under section  of the Labour Code which establishes the immunity to which all union officials are entitled in so far as they may not be dismissed, transferred or subject to a deterioration in their conditions of work. Accordingly, in cases in which the General Directorate for Labour Inspection of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security is notified of the dismissal of one of the members of the executive board of a professional association, it shall carry out an inspection in order to attempt to reinstate the person(s) dismissed. The Government indicates, however, that the following illegal practices have been identified to date and the Ministry of Labour and Social Security is examining ways to redress these:' In cases where workers have been dismissed and the Ministry of Labour and Social Security intervenes to ensure their reinstatement, the workers are subsequently persuaded not to go to work and encouraged to draw their fortnightly or monthly wages on pay day, after which the employer alleges that the workers have abandoned their duties; they use evidence of their absences as grounds to file the corresponding legal proceedings for dismissal, without receiving settlement of the wages and other benefits to which they are entitled by law. These actions are being taken at a time of high demand for employment in which workers are being misled as a result of their need to hold on to their jobs;' According to the same scenario, where the employer accepts the reinstatement of workers, on the following day it prevents them from returning to their functions at their place of work, and alleges before the courts that they abandoned their duties, or using any other bogus reasons to dismiss them, without paying them the wages and other benefits to which they are entitled by law. The Ministry therefore urges workers affected by this practice to present the corresponding complaint, and it warns both employers and workers to abstain from practices that undermine labour rights.
.The Government indicates that it should recognize before the Committee that the judicial authorities are highly vulnerable to the interests of employers and that, while their legal appeals are subject to a certain level of scrutiny by the Ministry of Labour, it is not aware of the majority of the legal proceedings that are then filed by employers.
.As regards Committee recommendation (i) (consultation with the social partners regarding the review of section  of the Labour Code which provides that no appeal may be lodged against decisions handed down by a court of second instance in relation to violations by trade unions), the Government reports that, for the time being, this matter has not been considered in the meetings of the Higher Labour Council. However, the Committee s request is noted for discussion at future meetings of the Council and the Committee will be kept informed of any progress made on that front.
.The Committee recalls that the allegations in this case refer to numerous acts of anti-union discrimination by companies in the telecommunications sector in  and , including manoeuvres to bring about the dissolution of a branch trade union, anti-union dismissals and the establishment of a company union controlled by the employer, and that the complainants also claim that several provisions of El Salvador s legislation need to be amended to guarantee more effective protection of freedom of association.
.The Committee firstly wishes to indicate that it appreciates the positive and constructive attitude shown in the Government s reply concerning the recommendations made by the Committee, including those relating to certain legal provisions, and the administrative measures and mechanisms adopted to achieve better functioning of the National Department of Social Organizations to expedite administrative proceedings and establish a policy of dialogue and outreach towards workers' and employers' organizations. The Committee takes note of the statistics concerning the growth in the number of trade union organizations.
.As regards recommendations (b) and (c) in the previous examination of the case, the Committee recalls that an appeal by the complainant union (SITCOM) was pending before the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice against a court decision (at the request of the company Compaia de Telecomunicaciones de El Salvador, SA de CV (CTE)), ordering the cancellation of SITCOM s registration on the basis of the dual membership of some of the members of this trade union, which is prohibited under section  of the Labour Code. The Committee notes that the Government indicates that it has taken measures to guarantee the legal existence of the complainant union (SITCOM) and that regular inspections are carried out to verify the company s compliance with union rights and their effective protection.
.The Committee notes that the Government indicates that it will report on the ruling handed down by the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice and on its decision regarding the prohibition of dual union membership (to which the Committee had made objections in its previous examinations of the case). The Committee regrets the delay in the administration of justice and awaits the sentence and the information in question, while expressing the firm hope that the judicial authority will take its conclusions into consideration, highlighting the principle that workers should be able, if they so wish, to join trade unions at the branch level as well as the enterprise level at the same time [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ; th Report, Case No.  (El Salvador), para. ].
.The Committee takes note of the Government s declarations regarding the minimum number of workers required in order to establish a trade union ( according to legislation) and the requirement of a six-month delay before",0,2011,El Salvador
87,"a new application for the award of legal personality to a trade union when a previous application has been rejected. The Committee notes that, according to the Government, the new practice adopted by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security consists in providing better guidance for the founding members of prospective trade unions and ' where the application is rejected due to failure to meet the legal requirements ' allowing trade unions to submit the necessary documentation for a new application to constitute a union on the following day. The Committee appreciates this new approach but invites the Government to submit this matter to the Higher Labour Council (a tripartite body), along with the important matter of reducing the minimum number of workers required to form a trade union, so that when the Labour Code is amended it is in line with the Ministry s practice.
.As regards the request for the reinstatement in their posts of union officials Mr Luis Wilfredo Berrios and Ms Gloria Mercedes Gonzlez, the Committee notes that the Government indicates that it has found no communications from these persons in its records and that, as a result, the labour inspectorate was not able to verify their reinstatement following their alleged unfair dismissal. The Government also indicates that it does not have the authority to bring about reinstatements since the National Telecommunications Administration, where they worked, ceased to exist when it was privatized. The Committee requests the complainants to inform it of whether the officials Mr Luis Wilfredo Berrios and Ms Gloria Mercedes Gonzlez filed an appeal against their dismissals and, if this is the case, to keep it informed of the outcome.
.As regards recommendation (d) in relation to the suspension of the deduction of the union dues of the workers who are members of SITCOM, the Committee takes note of the Government s statements that the labour inspectorate conducted an inspection of the company when it failed to carry out the deduction of the union dues of  union members, and that it found that the violation had not been remedied, whereby the case was subject to sanctions proceedings. The Committee requests the Government to ensure the company s compliance with the legal provision concerning the deduction of union dues (section  of the Labour Code) and to inform it of the outcome of the proceedings for the imposition of sanctions against the company and, as it indicated in its previous examination of the case, it firmly expects the sanctions imposed to be sufficiently dissuasive so that there is no recurrence of this kind of anti-union action in future.
.As regards recommendation (e), the Committee observes that the Government declares that, in relation to the dismissal of union official Mr Csar Leonel Flores Aguilar, the official received compensation from the company and that he signed the corresponding settlement with it, bringing an end to the employment relationship. As regards the sanctions proceedings in relation to the dismissal of union official Ms Tania Gadalmez, the Committee notes that the Government reports that the case has been transferred to the sanctions stage. Considering that this union official was dismissed in January , the Committee regrets the excessive delay in the administrative procedure for the imposition of sanctions, firmly expects that it will be concluded without delay, and requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome. Furthermore, it reiterates the recommendation it made in its previous examination of the case that the sanctions imposed should be sufficiently dissuasive so that there is no recurrence of this kind of anti-union action in future.
.As regards recommendation (f), the Committee recalls that it requested the Government to send information without delay regarding the alleged discriminatory dismissals of five trade union officials by the subcontractor Construcciones y Servicios Integrales de Telecomunicaciones SA de CV, and the alleged anti-union dismissals by the company Atento El Salvador. The Committee notes that the Government s statements point to the illegal nature of the dismissal in October  of the union officials David Alberto Martnez and Jos Guillermo Rodrguez and that the action for violation brought by the Labour Inspectorate was appealed by the company Atento El Salvador. The Committee also regrets the excessive delay in proceedings and requests the Government to communicate the outcome of the administrative appeal filed by the company.
.As regards recommendations (g), (h) and (i) (the allegation that the union SINTRABATES was set up by the employer), the Committee notes that, according to the Government s reply, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security granted SINTRABATES legal personality on  January , having verified its compliance with the legal requirements, and that following the complaint filed by SITCOM, the Labour Inspectorate identified a series of anti-union practices ' most of which are included in the Government s reply ' which were remedied; accordingly, the company was only sanctioned for a matter which is unrelated to the exercise of union rights (the failure to hire persons with disabilities). The Committee wishes to recall that it had noted the proceedings filed by SITCOM concerning the alleged control that the employer exerts over the organization SINTRABATES. The Committee requests the Government to communicate the outcome of these proceedings.
.The Committee had requested the Government to send information regarding the measures taken to review legislation on anti-union discrimination against union officials and observes that it indicates that the legislation in general protects union officials from dismissal (union immunity) and that the administrative authority carries out labour inspections in the event of dismissal to  attempt' to reinstate officials dismissed; the Government adds that it has identified illegal practices among employers which it describes in its reply and which it is trying to redress. The Committee highlights the seriousness of the practices described by the Government in its reply and of the fact that the Government recognizes also that the judicial authorities are highly vulnerable to the interests of employers. The Committee requests the Government to submit these matters to tripartite dialogue with the most representative organizations of workers and employers, including with regard to measures leading to amendments to legislation.
.The Committee notes that in relation to recommendation (i), the Government indicates that: () it has taken note of the Committee s request regarding the need to review section  of the Labour Code (which provides that no appeal may be lodged against decisions relating to violations by trade unions of labour legislation handed down by a court of second instance) so that it may be taken into account at the meetings of the Higher Labour Council (a tripartite body); and () that it will keep the Committee informed.
.Observing that this case contains important legislative aspects which raise problems of consistency with the principles of freedom of association set out in the Constitution and the applicable ILO Conventions, the Committee requests the Government to submit all the legislative issues related to this case to the most representative workers' and employers' organizations, including the problems which the Government indicates are encountered in practice (minimum number of  workers for the creation of a trade union, the six-month delay before being able to present a new application for legal personality in respect of a trade union when a previous application has been rejected, prohibition of dual union membership, greater protection against acts of anti-union discrimination and interference, procedural delays, and lack of recourse against decisions handed down by a court of second instance where unions have violated labour law). The Committee also refers the legislative aspects of this case in light of the ratification of Conventions Nos and  by El Salvador to the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee appreciates the constructive attitude shown in the Government s reply and the measures taken to promote the exercise of union rights.(b) The Committee awaits the ruling on the appeal presented before the Supreme Court of Justice by the complainant union, SITCOM, against the court decision ordering the cancellation of its registration as well as information from the Government regarding the legal prohibition of dual union membership which will be examined in that ruling, and invites the Supreme Court of Justice to take into consideration its conclusions regarding the legitimacy of dual union membership.(c) The Committee requests the complainants to inform it of whether the union officials Mr Luis Wilfredo Berrios and Ms Gloria Mercedes Gonzlez filed an appeal against their dismissal and, if this is the case, to keep it informed of the outcome.(d) The Committee requests the Government to ensure the company s compliance with the legal provision concerning the deduction of union dues (section  of the Labour Code) and to inform it of the outcome of the procedure for the imposition of sanctions against the company. As indicated in its previous examination of the case, the Committee firmly expects the sanctions imposed to be sufficiently dissuasive so that there is no recurrence of this",-1,2011,El Salvador
88,"kind of anti-union action in the future.(e) The Committee regrets the excessive delay in the administrative procedure for the imposition of sanctions for the dismissal of union official Ms Tania Gadalmez, firmly expects that it will be concluded without delay and requests the Government to keep it informed of its outcome while it reiterates its recommendation in its previous examination of the case that the sanctions imposed should be sufficiently dissuasive so that there is no recurrence of this kind of anti-union action in the future.(f) The Committee regrets the excessive delay in the proceedings relating to the sanctions against the company Atento El Salvador for the dismissal of the union officials David Alberto Martnez and Jos Guillermo Rodrguez and requests the Government to inform it of the outcome of the administrative appeal filed by the company against the sanctions.(g) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the legal proceedings filed by the complainant union (SITCOM) against the decision of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security to grant legal personality to the union SINTRABATES, which the complainant union claims is under the control of the employer.(h) Observing that this case contains important legislative aspects which raise problems of consistency with the principles of freedom of association as set out in the ILO Constitution and applicable ILO Conventions, the Committee requests the Government to submit all the legislative problems mentioned in this case, including the problems which the Government indicates are encountered in practice, to tripartite dialogue with the most representative workers' and employers' organizations.
.The Committee examined this case at its March  meeting, when it presented an interim report to the Governing Body [see th Report, paras ' , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (March )].
.At its March  meeting [see st Report, para. ], in the absence of observations from the Government, despite the time that had elapsed since the last examination of the case, the Committee made an urgent appeal to the Government and drew its attention to the fact that, in accordance with the procedural rules set out in paragraph  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session, it could present a report on the substance of the case at its next meeting, even if it had not received the information or observations from the Government in due time. To date, it has not received any information from the Government.
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Workers' Representatives Convention,  (No. ).
.In its previous examination of the case in March , the Committee made the following recommendations on the allegations that remained pending [see th Report, para. ]:(a) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the implementation of the Committee s recommendations with regard to Case No. , notably that the legislation be amended to remove the excessive formalities that apply to the establishment of trade union organizations and that trade union leaders, Luis Wilfredo Berrios and Gloria Mercedes Gonzlez, be reinstated in their posts.(b) The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps to ensure that SITCOM s continued existence is not jeopardized for motives that run counter to the principles of freedom of association and to bring the principles concerning dual trade union membership to the attention of the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court. The Committee expects that those principles will be taken into account by the Court and requests the Government to keep it informed of the corresponding ruling handed down. The Committee moreover urges the Government to take the necessary steps to amend section  of the Labour Code prohibiting dual union membership.(c) Regarding the suspension by the CTE of the deduction of union dues for workers affiliated to SITCOM, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the sanctions procedure that has been initiated and expects the sanctions imposed to be sufficiently dissuasive so that there is no recurrence of this kind of anti union action in future in the company concerned.(d) Regarding the dismissal of trade union officials, Tania Gadalmez and Csar Leonel Flores, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in the sanctions procedure that has been initiated and expects the sanctions imposed to be sufficiently dissuasive so that there is no recurrence of this kind of anti-union action in future in the company concerned.(e) The Committee requests the Government to send it information without delay on the alleged discriminatory dismissal of five trade union officials at Construcciones y Servicios Integrales de Telecomunicaciones S.A. de C.V., a subcontractor, and on the alleged anti-union dismissals at the Atento company.(f) The Committee requests the Government to send it detailed information without delay on the request for a special inspection into the alleged domination of SINTRABATES by the employer, on the outcome of the corresponding court action brought by SITCOM and on the measures taken to amend the legislation as it relates to acts of interference to the detriment of trade unions.(g) The Committee requests the Government to provide it with information on the measures taken, including legislative measures, to provide union officials with effective protection in the event of anti-union discrimination.(h) The Committee invites the Government to consider, in consultation with the social partners, the review of section  of the Labour Code which provides that no appeal may be lodged against decisions handed down by a court of second instance.
.The Committee regrets that, despite the time elapsed since the presentation of the complaints, the Government has not provided the requested information, even though it was requested to do so through an urgent appeal at its March  meeting. The Committee requests the Government to be more cooperative in the future.
.Hence, in accordance with the applicable procedural rules [see th Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body], the Committee is obliged to present a report on the substance of this case without being able to take account of the information which it had hoped to receive from the Government.
.The Committee recalls that the purpose of the whole procedure established by the International Labour Organization for the examination of allegations of violations of freedom of association is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in practice. The Committee is confident that, while this procedure protects governments against unreasonable accusations, they must recognize the importance of formulating, for objective examination, detailed replies concerning allegations brought against them.
.The Committee also recalls that the case under examination refers to allegations of numerous anti-union acts by companies in the telecommunications sector, including manoeuvres to bring about the dissolution of a branch union, anti-union dismissals and the establishment of a company union controlled by the employer and that, in addition, the complainants claim that several provisions of El Salvador s legislation need to be amended to guarantee more effective protection of freedom of association.
.The Committee underlines the seriousness of these allegations, and again regrets that the Government has not sent the requested observations and information. It therefore reiterates the recommendations it made at its March  meeting.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee regrets that, despite the time elapsed since its last examination of the case in March , the Government has not provided the requested information and observations, even though it was requested to do so through an urgent appeal.(b) The Committee again requests the Government to keep it informed of the implementation of the Committee s recommendations with regard to Case No. , notably that the legislation be amended to remove the excessive formalities that apply to the establishment of trade union organizations and that trade union leaders, Luis Wilfredo Berrios and Gloria Mercedes Gonzlez, be reinstated in their posts.(c) The Committee once again requests the Government to take the necessary steps to ensure that SITCOM s continued existence is not jeopardized for motives that run counter to the principles of freedom of association and to bring the principles concerning dual trade union membership to the attention of the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court. The Committee expects that those principles will be taken into account by the Court and requests the Government to keep it informed of the corresponding ruling handed down. The Committee moreover urges the Government to take the necessary steps to amend section  of the Labour Code prohibiting dual union membership.(d) Regarding the suspension by the CTE of the deduction of union dues for workers affiliated to SITCOM, the Committee once again requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the sanctions procedure that has been initiated and expects the sanctions imposed to be sufficiently dissuasive so that there is no recurrence of this kind of anti-union action in future in the company concerned.(e) Regarding the dismissal",0,2011,El Salvador
89,"of trade union officials, Tania Gadalmez and Csar Leonel Flores, the Committee once again requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in the sanctions procedure that has been initiated and expects the sanctions imposed to be sufficiently dissuasive so that there is no recurrence of this kind of anti-union action in future in the company concerned.(f) The Committee once again requests the Government to send it information without delay on the alleged discriminatory dismissal of five trade union officials at Construcciones y Servicios Integrales de Telecomunicaciones SA de CV, a subcontractor, and on the alleged anti-union dismissals at the Atento company.(g) The Committee again requests the Government to send it detailed information without delay on the request for a special inspection into the alleged domination of SINTRABATES by the employer, on the outcome of the corresponding court action brought by SITCOM and on the measures taken to amend the legislation as it relates to acts of interference to the detriment of trade unions.(h) The Committee once again requests the Government to provide it with information on the measures taken, including legislative measures, to provide union officials with effective protection in the event of anti-union discrimination.(i) The Committee once again invites the Government to consider, in consultation with the social partners, the review of section  of the Labour Code which provides that no appeal may be lodged against decisions handed down by a court of second instance.
.The complaint was presented in a joint communication dated  July  from the Telecommunications Workers' Union (SITCOM) and the Workers' Trade Union Confederation of El Salvador (CSTS). SITCOM sent additional information in communications dated  September,  and  October , and  February .
.The Government sent partial observations on  October .
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Workers' Representatives Convention,  (No. ).
.SITCOM and CSTS allege that CTE S.A. de C.V. (AMERICA MOVIL S.A.B. de C.V. Mxico) and Atento El Salvador S.A. de C.V. (TELEFONICA S.A. Espaa) engage systematically in anti-union activities and that the Government is unable to prevent them from doing so. The anti-union activities include manoeuvring to have SITCOM dissolved, anti-union dismissals and the establishment of a company union controlled by the employer. The complainants also claim that several provisions of El Salvador s legislation on freedom of association need to be amended.
.The complainants recall that the principles of freedom of association have apparently already been violated in the past in El Salvador s telecommunications sector and that in  a complaint on the subject was presented to the Committee (Case No. ). They note that the Committee s recommendations in that case, notably that the legislation be amended to remove the excessive formalities that apply to the establishment of trade union organizations and that trade union leaders Luis Wilfredo Berrios and Gloria Mercedes Gonzlez be reinstated in their posts, have still not been complied with.
.The complainants allege that ever since SITCOM was set up, the CTE has constantly been attacking it in the courts in a bid to get rid of it. After six-and-a-half years of legal battles and a number of Supreme Court rulings in its favour, SITCOM s legal personality was eventually recognized in September , when the new Minister of Labour overturned earlier decisions of the Ministry of Labour not to comply with the rulings of the Supreme Court.
.In spite of that, the CTE lodged an official request on  April  to have SITCOM dissolved. The request was denied by a labour court of first instance. The company appealed against the decision to the First Labour Chamber of San Salvador, which on  March  ordered that SITCOM s registration be revoked. SITCOM thereupon lodged an appeal with the Supreme Court that was declared irreceivable on the grounds that section  of the Labour Code did not provide for any possibility of appeal against the revocation of a trade union s registration by a court of second instance. On  April  SITCOM submitted a request for court protection to the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court on the grounds that its constitutional rights to due process, to justice and to freedom of association were being infringed. In addition, having learnt that the son of the Constitutional Chamber s presiding magistrate who had ordered the union s dissolution was one of the legal representatives of the company that had requested its dissolution, SITCOM applied to the Supreme Court s judicial investigation section to request that he be investigated for influence peddling.
.On  September  the Ministry of Labour revoked SITCOM s registration, based on the decision of the First Labour Chamber. On  December  the Constitutional Court of the Supreme Court declared SITCOM s request for court protection to be receivable and ordered as a preliminary measure that the revocation of its registration as a trade union be suspended. In pursuance of the preliminary measure, the Ministry of Labour registered SITCOM provisionally and conditionally again in February .
.The complainants add that, instead of waiting for the judicial procedure to be resolved, the company proceeded illegally to suspend the deduction of union dues for SITCOM in June . SITCOM then applied to the Special Gender and Labour Discrimination Unit of the Ministry of Labour to request a special inspection of the company for placing obstacles in the way of freedom of association.
.The complainants allege that the CTE s anti-union policy also takes the form of anti-union discrimination against SITCOM officials by both the company and its subcontracting companies. By way of example, they cite the indirect dismissal by SERVILAB in December  of the union s Deputy Secretary-General, Tania Gadalmez, and the unlawful dismissal by one of the subcontractors, Construcciones y Servicios Integrales de Telecomunicaciones S.A. de C.V., on  March  of the members of the executive board of SITCOM s enterprise union (Oscar Armando Snchez Cortez, Carlos Alberto Olivas, Jos Mauricio Melgar Quionez, Roberto Carlos Rojas and Guillermo Ernesto Melndez Miranda) and the CTE s dismissal on  May  of two other SITCOM officials (Jos Rigoberto Garca Orellana and Csar Leonel Flores).
.Because of acts of anti-union discrimination, SITCOM on several occasions requested the Ministry of Labour s Special Gender and Labour Discrimination Unit to conduct special inspections and, on one occasion, denounced the CTE s director of human resources for circulating among all its subcontractors a blacklist of union officials who had been dismissed.
.The complainants also allege a number of other acts of anti-union discrimination in another telecommunications company, Atento El Salvador S.A. de C.V., following the creation of the executive board of a SITCOM enterprise union on  September . They state that on  November,  company employees were dismissed for supposedly working to rule, including the executive board s Secretary-General, Emilio Hernndez Galdmez, and the five other union officials (Jos Gabriel Garca Mndez, Sal Armando Navarro Garca, Francisco Javier Gmez Garca, Yolanda Carolina Lpez Durn and Zoraida Ivette Flores Rivas).
.The complainants state that on  November  Sal Armando Navarro Garca, Francisco Javier Gmez Garca and Zoraida Ivette Flores Rivas requested the Ministry of Labour to order a special inspection of the CTE for infringement of freedom of association. The inspection, which took place on  December , established that the dismissal of the three union officials was null and void as it violated the provisions of the Labour Code prohibiting the dismissal of trade union officials, but the company refused to reinstate them. On  December  all six union officials applied to the Labour Court to request the cancellation of their dismissal and their reinstatement. The complainants add that the dismissals and the company s refusal to reinstate the union officials were not only an infringement of the law but also went against official commitment to freedom of association in the code of practice of the TELEFONICA group, to which the Atento company belongs.
.The complainants further allege that the Atento El Salvador Trade Union (SINTRABATES), which was established on  November , four days before SITCOM s union officials were dismissed, and was registered by the Ministry of Labour on  January , is controlled by Atento. They add that several of SINTRABATES s founder members, presented as telephone operators, are in fact trusted company employees and that the union s Vice-President, Gloria Elizabeth Trinidad de Bove, holds a senior position in the company. SITCOM asked the Ministry of Labour to order a special inspection to investigate SINTRABATES s links with the employer and its fraudulent establishment. In the absence of any reply from the Ministry of Labour, SITCOM presented a request through the administrative dispute channels in April  to have SINTRABATES s legal personality revoked.
.Finally, the complainants allege that the following amendments need to be made to El Salvador s legislation on freedom of association: repeal of section  of the Labour Code establishing that rulings",0,2011,El Salvador
90,"by a court of second instance on the dissolution of trade unions are not open to any form of appeal, and reform of the Labour Code to make the reinstatement of union officials compulsory if they have been dismissed legally.
.In the light of their allegations, the complainants request that the Committee:' emphasize the need for the Government of El Salvador to comply with the recommendations the Committee formulated in Case No. ;' recommend that the Government ensure that the employer s attempts to have SITCOM dissolved do not succeed and take all appropriate measures so that workers in the telecommunications sector are able to enjoy their right to freedom of association effectively, whether or not they are members of SITCOM;' recommend that the Government ensure the reinstatement of all SITCOM s officials whose dismissal is cited in the allegations;' recommend that the Government introduce the amendments to the Labour Code indicated by the complainants.
.In its reply of  October  the Government states that the Supreme Court is conducting a reform of the procedural provisions of the Labour Code and that it will keep the Committee informed of developments. The Government also refers to the existence of a public service bill and points out that the increase in the number of occupational organizations registering with the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare attests to its commitment to freedom of association and collective bargaining.
.Regarding the procedure for dissolving, deregistering and winding up SITCOM, the Government states that the Ministry of Labour simply implemented the decisions of the judiciary when, following the ruling by the First Labour Chamber of San Salvador, it ordered the union s deregistration on September  and when, in the light of the provisional order issued by the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court, it adopted a resolution on  November  revoking its earlier decision. The Government confirms that following this latest decision SITCOM is now active.
.Referring to the CTE s alleged use of blacklists, the Government states that, due to an error in the work centre of the request submitted by the worker, the file was archived.
.Regarding the CTE s suspension of the deduction of union dues for workers affiliated to SITCOM, the Government states that an inspection was carried out that established that the employer had infringed section  of the Labour Code by ceasing to deduct the union dues of  members of SITCOM. Since no action was taken by the company to correct the situation, the procedure has moved on to the sanction stage.
.Regarding the alleged discriminatory dismissal of trade union officials at the CTE and its subcontractors, the Government states that:' in respect of the dismissal of trade union official Tania Vernica Galdmez, the labour inspectorate established that section  of the Labour Code on trade union immunity was infringed by her de facto dismissal, and that proceedings have now moved on to the sanctions stage;' in respect of the dismissal of Jos Rigoberto Garca Orellana, the labour inspectorate established the infringement of section  of the Labour Code; and' in respect of the dismissal of Csar Leonel Flores Aguilar, the labour inspectorate was unable to establish the existence of any infraction as the worker concerned had signed a document accepting full compensation for his dismissal.
.Regarding the granting of legal personality to the company union known as SINTRABATES, the Government states that, with its  founding members, the union was registered under the procedure laid down in the Labour Code after a number of errors of form in its by-laws had been rectified.
.The Committee recalls that the case under examination refers to allegations of numerous acts of anti-union discrimination by companies in the telecommunications sector, including manoeuvres to bring about the dissolution of a branch union, anti-union dismissals and the establishment of a company union controlled by the employer and that, in addition, the complainants claim that several provisions of El Salvador s legislation need to be amended to guarantee more effective protection of freedom of association.
.The Committee takes note of the partial observations sent by the Government describing the measures and decisions taken by the labour inspectorate in the light of allegations of acts of anti-union discrimination in the telecommunications sector, and informing it that amendments to the legislation are currently being considered.
.The Committee recalls that, in its examination of Case No. , it has twice already had occasion to examine allegations of acts of anti-union discrimination in El Salvador s telecommunications sector and that it issued a number of recommendations on the subject [see th Report, March , and th Report, March ]. It takes note of the complainants' allegations that most of its recommendations ' notably that the legislation be amended to remove the excessive formalities that apply to the establishment of trade union organizations and that trade union leaders Luis Wilfredo Berrios and Gloria Mercedes Gonzlez be reinstated in their posts ' have still not been complied with. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the implementation of the Committee s recommendations with respect to Case No. .
.Regarding the situation of SITCOM, the Committee notes with concern that, ten years after the union was established and despite its substantial number of members as reflected in the Government s observations (which refer to the illegal suspension of the union dues of at least  members of SITCOM by a company in the telecommunications sector), the union s legal personality has still not been firmly recognized.
.Moreover, judging from the decision of the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court on  December  declaring the receivability of the appeal lodged by SITCOM for court protection against the judicial ruling that its registration be cancelled, the Committee understands that the grounds for the ruling that cancelled its registration was apparently the dual union membership of several of its members, which remains prohibited by section  of the Labour Code. The Committee recalls that it has on several occasions pointed out that workers should be able, if they so wish, to join trade unions at the branch level as well as the enterprise level at the same time [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ]. It notes further that the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations (CEACR), in its direct request of  regarding the application of Convention No.  by El Salvador, made the following statement:  Workers who are engaged, whether in the public or private sector, in different activities in more than one job should be able to join the corresponding unions and [should, in any case,] be able, if they so wish, to join unions at the branch and enterprise levels at the same time. The Committee expresses the strong hope that the Government will take the necessary steps without delay to have section  of the Labour Code amended as indicated.' ,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:
.In the light of the foregoing considerations, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps to ensure that SITCOM s continued existence is not jeopardized for motives that run counter to the principles of freedom of association and to bring the principles concerning dual trade union membership to the attention of the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court. The Committee expects that those principles will be taken into account by the Supreme Court and requests the Government to keep it informed of the ruling handed down. The Committee moreover urges the Government to take the necessary steps to amend section  of the Labour Code.
.Regarding the suspension by the CTE of its deduction of union dues for workers affiliated to SITCOM, the Committee takes note that the labour inspectorate has established that this constituted an infringement of the Labour Code and that, in the absence of corrective measures by the employer, the matter has moved on to the sanction procedure. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the sanctions procedure that has been initiated and expects the sanctions imposed to be sufficiently dissuasive so that there is no recurrence of this kind of anti-union action in future by the company concerned.
.Regarding the alleged anti-union dismissals at the CTE and its subcontractors, the Committee takes note of the action taken by the labour inspectorate concerning the dismissal of trade union officials Tania Gadalmez, Jos Rigoberto Garca Orellana and Csar Leonel Flores, that it has established that Tania Gadalmez' and Csar Leonel Flores' trade union rights were infringed and that a sanctions procedure has accordingly been initiated. The Committee recalls that it has on numerous occasions requested the Government to take the necessary measures to enable trade union leaders and members who have been dismissed because of their legitimate trade union activities to secure their reinstatement and to ensure the application of the corresponding legal sanctions against the enterprises concerned [Digest, op. cit., para. ]. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in the sanctions procedure and expects",1,2011,El Salvador
91,"the sanctions imposed to be sufficiently dissuasive so that there is no recurrence of this kind of anti-union action in future in the company concerned.
.The Committee notes that the Government has not sent its observations on the alleged discriminatory dismissal of five trade union officials at Construcciones y Servicios Integrales de Telecomunicaciones S.A. de C.V., a subcontractor, or on the alleged anti union dismissals at the Atento company. The Committee requests the Government to send it detailed information on the subject without delay.
.Regarding the establishment of SINTRABATES, the Committee notes that the Government s observations do not mention the SITCOM officials' request that the labour inspectorate conduct a special investigation of alleged domination of SINTRABATES by the employer or why there was no response to their request. It recalls moreover that, in the CEACR s  observation on the application of Convention No.  by El Salvador, that Committee requested the Government to take the necessary measures to provide explicitly in the legislation for the prohibition of all actions which are designed to promote the establishment of workers' organizations under the domination of employers. The Committee therefore requests the Government to send detailed information without delay on the request for a special inspection into the alleged domination of SINTRABATES by the employer, on the outcome of the court action brought by SITCOM and on the measures taken to amend the legislation as it relates to acts of anti-union interference.
.Regarding the request that the Labour Code be amended to ensure that trade union officials be reinstated in the event of their unlawful dismissal, the Committee recalls that, in the case of a country in which there was no legislation providing for the reinstatement of workers who had been dismissed without justification, it requested the Government to take measures to amend the legislation so that workers dismissed for the exercise of their trade union rights could be reinstated in their posts [Digest, op. cit., para. ]. The Committee also recalls that such protection is particularly desirable in the case of trade union officials because, in order to be able to perform their trade union duties in full independence, they should have a guarantee that they will not be prejudiced on account of the mandate which they hold from their trade unions [Digest, op. cit., para. ]. Furthermore, the Committee takes note of the information that the Government provided in  in relation to the application of Convention No. , concerning its efforts to ensure that union officials were effectively reinstated in the event of anti-union dismissal. Recalling the principles cited above, the Committee requests the Government to provide it with information of the measures taken, including legislative measures, to provide union officials with effective protection in the event of anti-union discrimination.
.Regarding the request that the Labour Code be amended so that rulings handed down by courts of second instance in the course of trade union dissolution proceedings are open to appeal, the Committee recalls that it has on several occasions pointed out that the suspension of the legal personality of trade union organizations imposes a serious restriction on trade union rights and that in matters of this nature the rights of defence can only be fully guaranteed through due process of law [Digest, op. cit., para. ]. In this regard, the Committee considers that, given the fundamental nature of freedom of association, proceedings leading to the suspension or cancellation of the legal personality of an occupational organization, whether of employers or of workers, should offer the maximum legal guarantees. In the specific case at hand, the Committee notes that section  of the Labour Code dealing with rulings on infringements by trade unions reads as follows:  An appeal may be lodged with the relevant labour court against the ruling within three working days following its notification. The appeal shall be dealt with in the manner laid down in this Code and there shall be no further appeal whatsoever against the decision handed down'  The Committee therefore observes from this provision that an appeal against a court s rulings on infringements by trade unions is possible, but that no further appeals may be lodged against a decision handed down by a court of second instance. Furthermore, the Committee understands from the complainants' allegations that decisions by a court of second instance pronouncing the dissolution of a trade union can give rise to an appeal to the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court for the protection of the court. In addition, the Committee observes that, in its communication relating to Case No. , the Government indicates that the impossibility to challenge decisions issued in the second instance concerning the dissolution of a union creates a situation that violates the right to access to effective judicial protection and to the constitutional rights of defence and to be heard. Bearing in mind that, according to the Government, a procedural labour bill is currently being examined, the Committee invites the Government to consider, in consultation with the social partners, the review of the aforementioned provision of section  of the Labour Code.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the implementation of the Committee s recommendations with regard to Case No. , notably that the legislation be amended to remove the excessive formalities that apply to the establishment of trade union organizations and that trade union leaders Luis Wilfredo Berrios and Gloria Mercedes Gonzlez be reinstated in their posts.(b)	The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps to ensure that SITCOM s continued existence is not jeopardized for motives that run counter to the principles of freedom of association and to bring the principles concerning dual trade union membership to the attention of the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court. The Committee expects that those principles will be taken into account by the Court and requests the Government to keep it informed of the corresponding ruling handed down. The Committee moreover urges the Government to take the necessary steps to amend section  of the Labour Code prohibiting dual union membership.(c)	Regarding the suspension by the CTE of the deduction of union dues for workers affiliated to SITCOM, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the sanctions procedure that has been initiated and expects the sanctions imposed to be sufficiently dissuasive so that there is no recurrence of this kind of anti-union action in future in the company concerned.(d)	Regarding the dismissal of trade union officials Tania Gadalmez and Csar Leonel Flores, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in the sanctions procedure that has been initiated and expects the sanctions imposed to be sufficiently dissuasive so that there is no recurrence of this kind of anti-union action in future in the company concerned.(e)	The Committee requests the Government to send it information without delay on the alleged discriminatory dismissal of five trade union officials at Construcciones y Servicios Integrales de Telecomunicaciones S.A. de C.V., a subcontractor, and on the alleged anti-union dismissals at the Atento company.(f)	The Committee requests the Government to send it detailed information without delay on the request for a special inspection into the alleged domination of SINTRABATES by the employer, on the outcome of the corresponding court action brought by SITCOM and on the measures taken to amend the legislation as it relates to acts of interference to the detriment of trade unions.(g)	The Committee requests the Government to provide it with information on the measures taken, including legislative measures, to provide union officials with effective protection in the event of anti-union discrimination.(h)	The Committee invites the Government to consider, in consultation with the social partners, the review of section  of the Labour Code which provides that no appeal may be lodged against decisions handed down by a court of second instance.",0,2011,El Salvador
92,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the Autonomous Confederation of Salvadorian Workers (CATS) dated  June .
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  January and  October  and  May .
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Workers' Representatives Convention,  (No. ), and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.In a communication dated  June , CATS alleges that the Mayor and the Council of the Municipality of Santa Ana, in the department of Santa Ana in El Salvador, were in violation of ILO Convention No. , in the case of Ms Karla Beatriz Lpez Contreras, Secretary of the Organization and Statistician of the Executive Committee of the Union of Municipal Workers of Santa Ana (SITRAMSA).
.CATS explains that the problem began on  October  when an indefinite strike took place, demanding higher salaries and the payment of the social security contributions that the municipality owed banks, the office of the Public Prosecutor, the Salvadorian Social Security Institute (ISSS) and pension fund administrators, due to the failure to pay to these institutions the deductions made.
.The Labour Court declared the strike illegal and, in order to prevent contract terminations for which the employer could not be held responsible, the workers agreed in their general assembly to return to work.
.CATS adds that, on  November , by means of an administrative agreement, the Mayor suspended Ms Karla Beatriz Lpez Contreras, Secretary of the Organization and statistician, from work without pay for going on strike and due to her union work.
.On  February , representatives of the Municipal Council of Santa Ana filed a request in the Labour Court for authorization to dismiss Ms Karla Beatriz Lpez Contreras under section  of the Municipal Administrative Careers Act, which is in violation of ILO Convention No.  and article  of the Constitution.
.On  February , the Santa Ana Labour Court handed down its ruling, ordering the Municipal Council of Santa Ana to reinstate Ms Karla Beatriz Lpez Contreras to her post of computer operator and to pay her the wages which had been stopped on  November , when she had been suspended from work.
.The Municipal Council did not comply with the ruling of the Labour Court and lodged an appeal with the First Labour Chamber, which on  March , set aside the ruling for procedural reasons, which meant that the Santa Ana Labour Court had to begin the process again and issue a new ruling.
.In a communication dated  January , the Government declares, with regard to the allegations made by CATS concerning what the Government describes as the dismissal of Ms Karla Beatriz Lpez Contreras, that, on  November , the Municipal Council of Santa Ana filed a request with the Labour Court of Santa Ana to dismiss Ms Karla Beatriz Lpez Contreras, alleging suspected dereliction of duty to participate in a strike called in the municipality during the week of '  October , and for not obeying the order by the authorities to return to work within the period indicated by administrative order, as the strike had been declared illegal. It also accused her of action that seriously endangered the physical safety of another municipal official.
.In accordance with the legal procedure, the Labour Court of Santa Ana issued a ruling on  February , declaring the dismissal of Ms Karla Beatriz Lpez Contreras unlawful and ordering the municipal authorities of Santa Ana to reinstate her in her job, and to pay her the wages that she had not received for reasons attributable to her employer, from the date that she was suspended from work (a copy of the ruling is attached). Subsequently, the general legal representatives of the municipal authorities of Santa Ana appealed to the First Labour Chamber of San Salvador to review the ruling which, on  March , set aside the ruling, with all legal consequences, from the time of the notification of the opening of the investigation. Following this ruling, a representative of the Municipal Council of Santa Ana filed an appeal against the ruling of the Santa Ana Labour Court regarding the authorization to dismiss Ms Karla Beatriz Lpez Contreras. On  June , the First Labour Chamber of San Salvador found the appeal unreceivable as it was without merit.
.In a communication dated  October , the Government indicates that, on  November , after reviewing the evidence, the Labour Court of Santa Ana issued a final ruling, which found the authorization to dismiss Ms Karla Beatriz Lpez Contreras unlawful and ordered the Municipal Council of Santa Ana to reinstate her in her position and pay her the wages owed since  November . In view of the above, as the Municipal Council objected to the ruling, it appealed for the decision to be reversed in accordance with section  of the Municipal Administrative Careers Act, but the appeal was not successful as the ruling was found to have been made in accordance with the law.
.In a communication dated  May , the Government reports that the Santa Ana municipal authorities informed it that it implemented the ruling handed down by the First Labour Chamber of the city of San Salvador, reinstating Ms Karla Beatriz Lpez Contreras as of  January , in her post as computer operator in the Engineering Department of the Mayor s Office of Santa Ana, and paying her the wages that she had not received since her dismissal.
.The Committee observes that, in the present complaint, the complainant alleges that, following a decision by the Mayor s Office and Municipal Council of Santa Ana, union leader Ms Karla Beatriz Lpez Contreras was suspended from her job without pay on  November  for participating in a strike calling for higher wages and other claims, and that those authorities requested authorization from the judicial authorities, to dismiss her. The Committee also observes that, according to the complaint and the Government s reply, three separate appeals were made by the Municipal Council against the ruling of the first-level court ordering the reinstatement of the union leader and the payment of her outstanding wages (February ), the final ruling dated  November , confirmed the reinstatement and the payment of the wages due since she had been suspended from work (November ). The Committee observes that in its latest reply the Government confirms that the final ruling has been given effect by the Mayor s Office as of  January .
.Even though the Committee observes that the case of Ms Karla Beatriz Lpez Contreras has been resolved, it deeply regrets that, while she was suspended from work without pay in November , the final ruling was issued on  January , which is more than one year after her suspension. The Committee therefore regrets the negative consequences of this situation on the union leader who was suspended from work without pay for a long period of time. It also emphasizes the principle that justice delayed is justice denied [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ]. The Committee requests the Government, in consultation with the most representative workers' and employers' organizations, to consider measures to speed up the operations of its legal system in cases involving alleged acts of anti-union discrimination.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:While observing that the situation of the union leader who had been suspended from work without pay since November  has been resolved, the Committee emphasizes the principle that justice delayed is justice denied and requests the Government, in consultation with the most representative workers' and employers' organizations, to consider measures to speed up the operation of its legal system in cases involving alleged acts of anti-union discrimination.",1,2011,El Salvador
93,".The complaint is contained in a joint communication from the Union of Workers of the Digapan SA Company (SITREDAPSA) and the Workers' Trade Union Confederation of El Salvador (CSTC) dated  June .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  October .
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communications dated  June and  July , SITREDAPSA and the CSTC state that SITREDAPSA was established on  January  when it was found that the company had financial problems with other companies, that the workers' social security benefits were not being paid, that wages were declining and that in some cases they were not even being paid. During the period in question the company s Chairman of the Board and legal representative died. The complainants state that, on  February , the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare granted SITREDAPSA juridical personality but that on  February the union s founder members and the members of its executive board were dismissed, along with all the other workers (over ).
.According to the complainants, the company s representatives refused to allow the labour inspectors onto the premises and failed to appear at a conciliation hearing convened by the General Labour Directorate of the Ministry of Labour. The company was accordingly fined by the labour inspectorate.
.The complainants state that they have initiated judicial proceedings through the labour courts to obtain payment of the compensation and unpaid wages to which they are legally entitled, but they have been caught up in proceedings that have lasted up to  months and then been declared null and void or shelved because of the impossibility for the workers to prove the official status of the company s legal representative (owner/Chairman of the Board or sole owner/administrator). The complainants have, however, established the company s legal existence. They state that they have brought the matter to the attention of the Public Prosecutor responsible for criminal offences, the Ombudsman for Human Rights and the Legislative Assembly.
.In its communication dated  October , the Government declares that, after the enterprise failed to appear at the conciliation hearing, the Minister of Labour fined it, on  June , the amount of US$,.. The Ministry therefore used all the measures that it had in order to find a solution. The proceedings brought by certain workers of the enterprise are pending. The Committee will be informed of the decisions.
.The Committee observes that the present case refers to the dismissal in February  of all the employees of Digapan SA (over ), including the founder members of the union and the members of its executive board. The Committee also observes that, according to the allegations, the dismissals occurred after the Chairman of the Board and legal representative of the company had died and at a time when it was in financial difficulties. The Committee observes that, according to the allegations and despite the fact that the union had appealed to various authorities, including the judicial authorities, in particular criminal, they had not managed to obtain payment of the workers' unpaid wages or of the compensation and benefits to which they were legally entitled. According to the allegations, after proceedings some of which lasted up to  months, the labour courts had shelved the entire complaint lodged by the company s workforce since, although the dismissals proved that the company existed, they did not prove the official status of the legal representative.
.The Committee takes note of the difficult situation in which all the dismissed workers, including the founders of the union and the members of its executive board, find themselves. The Committee wishes to point out, however, that, given that the entire company workforce had been dismissed (whether union members or not), in the circumstances as described the case is not strictly speaking an issue of anti-union discrimination, that the dismissals are therefore outside the Committee s specific mandate, which is confined to violations of trade union rights, and that the Committee can only examine allegations regarding dismissals when they entail anti-union discrimination.
.The Committee takes note of the Government s declaration that it has fined the enterprise the amount of US$,. for failure to appear at the conciliation hearing and that it will inform the Committee of the decisions in the proceedings brought by certain workers.
.That said, the Committee observes that the documents sent by the complainants suggest that the founder members and officials of the union are entitled to special protection from dismissal by the existing legislation, including special forms of compensation. Therefore, considering that the founder members and officials of the union have not been able to prove the official status of the company s legal representatives before the labour courts and have not been able to obtain payment of the compensation and benefits to which they are legally entitled, the Committee, while waiting for the decisions mentioned by the Government, expects the labour court to ensure that they receive their unpaid wages and other legal compensation and benefits, taking into account the legal provisions on the priority afforded to workers' rights.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee, while waiting for the decisions mentioned by the Government, expects the labour court to ensure that the founder members and officials of the union receive their unpaid wages and other legal compensation and benefits, taking into account the legal provisions on the priority afforded to workers' rights.",1,2011,El Salvador
94,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the Union of Workers of the Salvadoran Institute for Rehabilitation of the Disabled (SITRAISRI) dated  May .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  October .
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Workers' Representatives Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  May , the SITRAISRI alleges that on  March  it wrote to the National Department of Social Organizations of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare (as required under clause  of article  of the Labour Code, which stipulates:  All employers with workers affiliated to a trade union are required to deduct union dues and remit them to the union, provided the latter has provided it with a list of unionized workers, through the National Department of Social Organizations of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare, which must transmit the communication within five days' . The complainant requested that arrangements be made as soon as possible to deduct SITRAISRI members' union dues.
.The complainant adds that on  March  it was notified of a ruling handed down by the National Department of Social Organizations requiring the union to ascertain within three working days from the date of notification that the workers whose names appeared on the list it attached were indeed union members. On  March  the union wrote to the National Department of Social Organizations of the General Labour Directorate claiming non-compliance with article  of the Labour Code.
.On  March  the union wrote to the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare informing her of the problem that had arisen with the Chief of the National Department of Social Organizations, who was not following the rapid procedure provided for in the law and that so far nothing had been resolved. On  April  the Ministry notified the union of its ruling of  April  reiterating the requirement that it submit the relevant documents certifying that the workers whose union dues it wished to have deducted were indeed union members, for which purpose it granted a further deadline of three working days from the date of notification. Some days later, on  April , the Ministry issued the following ruling:  the request presented by Nohemy Carmen Hidalgo Germn de Tochez is hereby declared irreceivable, and the request for deduction of union dues will have to be resubmitted'  The complainant objects to the refusal to deduct union dues on such whimsical grounds, for which there is no justification in the Labour Code, and which are prejudicial to the union s interests. The Ministry s ruling, which diverges from the criteria applied hitherto to such a request, is a violation of freedom of association, inasmuch as it unjustifiably prevents the union from obtaining the financial resources due to it, particularly since its  members are scattered about the country.
.In its communication dated  October , the Government indicates that the Minister of Labour issued a resolution on  November  ordering the deduction of union dues from the wages in favour of the complainant organization, in application of article  of the Labour Code.
.The Committee observes that in the present case the complainant alleges that the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare has made the deduction of union dues from a list of workers conditional on a requirement that is not provided for in the legislation (certification within three days that the workers whose dues the union asks to be deducted are indeed union members). The Committee observes that the complainant points out that article  of the Labour Code clearly stipulates that  all employers with workers affiliated to a trade union are required to deduct union dues and remit them to the union, provided the latter has provided it with a list of unionized workers, through the National Department of Social Organizations of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare (which must transmit the communication within five days)'  The complainant states that the Ministry s position is an obstacle to the functioning of the organization, whose  members are scattered about the country. The Committee takes note of the points made in the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare s ruling of  April  (which the complainant attached to its complaint), indicating that  the mere presentation of a list of names without documents attesting that the workers are members of the union and that they joined voluntarily, could undermine freedom of association in any number of ways if it were found that a worker was listed without the union itself having been consulted' 
.The Committee wishes to point out that both legislation which imposes accreditation or proof of affiliation of members of the trade union for their union dues to be deducted from their wages, and legislation which stipulates that it suffices for a union to submit a list of members for the union dues to be deducted, are compatible with Conventions Nos  and  ratified by El Salvador. In this particular case, the Committee observes that the complainant indicates that, in addition to failing to comply with the provisions of article  of the Labour Code (which requires only that a list be submitted ' and not proof of affiliation), the Ministry has unilaterally modified the criteria and practice that have been followed in the past.
.The Committee notes the indication of the Government that the Minister of Labour finally ordered, on  November , the deduction of union dues from the wages in favour of the complainant organization.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, and considering that the issue has been resolved in a satisfactory manner, the Committee invites the Governing Body to decide that the present case does not call for further examination.",1,2011,El Salvador
95,".The Committee examined this case at its November  and May June  meetings and, on the latter occasion, presented an interim report [see nd Report, paras ' , approved by the Governing Body at its st Session (June )].
.The Government sent new observations in a communication dated  February .
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.At its May June  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendations on the matters still pending [see nd Report, para. ]:' b) The Committee once again requests the Government to keep it informed of the revision requested by the trade union of the collective agreement at LIDO SA de CV, which is due to expire.(c) The Committee once again requests the Government to clarify whether union leader Guadalupe Atilio Jaimes Prez (whose release was ordered by the judicial authority) is still facing charges and, if so, to inform it of the court ruling.(d) With respect to the allegation relating to the declaration of the strike as illegal, the Committee observed in its previous examination of this case that the objective of the strike was a wage increase and that the declaration of the illegality of the strike on this basis did not appear to be justified. The Committee once again expresses its concern and requests the Government to inform it of the judicial ruling declaring the workers' strike at LIDO SA de CV to be illegal.(e) The Committee once again observes that the Government has still not responded to the allegation regarding the dismissal of trade unionists Ana Mara Barrios Jimnez, Mara Isabel Oporto Jacinta and Oscar Armando Pineda, and once again requests it to send its observations without delay.(f) The Committee requests the Government to send its observations relating to the complainants' additional information dated  July .(g) The Committee requests the Government to obtain the company s comments on the pending questions via the employers' organization concerned.
.With respect to the information provided on  July , mentioned in recommendation (g), the complainants stated that, on  September , as part of the collective bargaining taking place as the collective agreement was due to expire, the SELSA trade union requested the Ministry of Labour to invite the company to the direct negotiation and conciliation stages. Article  of the preliminary draft of the collective agreement which SELSA was expecting to negotiate included all workers working directly or indirectly for LIDO SA de CV at the Boulevard plant who were subcontracted by FAMOLCAS SA de CV (which shared the same owners as LIDO SA de CV). This also contributed to the company s intransigence, since it maintained a double standard by paying subcontracted workers less. The wages of the workers in the company are among the lowest in the industry in the country, at only US$. per month plus some benefits payable under the collective agreement. The wages of workers subcontracted by FAMOLCAS are even lower, at between $ and $ per month without any additional benefits.
.The complainants also state that the enterprise did not attend the direct negotiations or the conciliation meetings organized by the Ministry of Labour in , nor did it respond to the trade union s proposal of voluntary arbitration. As a result, the union was legally entitled to call a strike from  February to  March . Following a personal intervention from the Minister of Labour, the company participated in a dialogue forum. However, its representatives attended merely to argue that, as a result of family disputes, the companies, which were under the control of their family members, owed them $ million, and that, in order to absorb the debt, they had planned to recover $. million in expenses annually over four years between  and , during which period they were not in a position to increase wages. In other words, the company s proprietors requested the workers to accept a pay freeze, which had so far lasted four years, and it would take a further two years to pay the costs of the family dispute.
.In view of the company s intransigence concerning participation in the collective bargaining stages, SELSA completed all of the legal procedures and informed the Director General of Labour that the strike had broken out on  March . SELSA, through its General Secretary, requested that the action be characterized as a strike since the company did not wish to do so. Thus began the proceedings of the Fourth Labour Court of San Salvador. The bargaining unit party to the dispute leading to the strike comprised  workers of the company,  per cent of whom supported the strike, thus exceeding the  per cent required by law. However, as a result of undue influence from the company, the Fourth Labour Court unlawfully included the subcontracted workers in the count. (It was the union s intention to include them in the future, but they did not belong to the bargaining unit at that time.) The Court also included in the count  company directors who are registered with the company for social security purposes but who are its proprietors. The judge declared the strike unlawful without considering all these irregularities. This demonstrates, once again, the shortcomings of the existing mechanisms in the legislation of El Salvador.
.In its communication dated  February , the Government states, with regard to recommendation (b) from the previous examination of the case, that the revision of the collective agreement at LIDO SA was requested by SELSA on  September . The list of demands was sent to the enterprise on  October , but no rapprochement with the trade union was reached within the following  hours. The enterprise did not attend the direct negotiations and conciliation meetings organized by the Ministry of Labour on  October  and  January , nor did it respond to the trade union s request for voluntary arbitration. In light of the foregoing, the trade union adopted a decision to call a strike at a meeting attended by  of the company s  workers and the Ministry of Labour notified the company accordingly on  February .
.The Government adds that subsequently (on  March ) the two parties met to begin the revision of the collective labour agreement. They agreed to proceed on a clause-by-clause basis and to meet again on  March . However, the Ministry of Labour received a letter from the trade union, notifying, pursuant to article  of the Labour Code, the beginning of the strike. The Director-General of Labour decided to inform the parties, and particularly the company, of the strike and notified them that they must declare, within the legal time limit, whether they wished to exercise the right, enshrined in article  of the Labour Code, to meet with the trade union and determine the number, type and names of the workers who would remain on the job at the company; the two parties received this notification on the same day.
.The administrative proceedings in the General Directorate of Labour ended when, at the request of the competent court, it was certified that the necessary procedures for characterizing the action as a strike had been completed; it would be for the court to decide whether the strike was lawful. Since only the parties to the dispute were notified of the court s ruling, the Government has no knowledge of it.
.With respect to recommendation (c), in which the Committee requested the Government to clarify whether union leader Guadalupe Atilio Jaimes Prez (whose release was ordered by the judicial authority) is still facing charges and, if so, to inform it of the court ruling, the Government reproduces the ruling in question:At . p.m. on  June , in an initial hearing, the First Magistrates' Court of the Soyapango Integrated Judicial Centre issued judgment No. -UDV-SOY-, in which the court decided ' a) to move to the next (pre-trial) stage of these proceedings; and (b) to order the pre-trial detention of Guadalupe Atilio Jaimes Prez, charged under article  of the Penal Code with threats of physical violence against Jos Heriberto Pacas, and, in lieu of pre-trial detention, that the accused shall: (i) appear before the First Magistrates' Court every  working days throughout the pre-trial stage of the proceedings; (ii) be prohibited from leaving the country without the authorization of the First Magistrates' Court; (iii) continue to reside at the same address; and (iv) not approach or communicate with the alleged victim; (v) The request that a time limit be set for the pre-trial stage of the proceedings shall be referred to the First Magistrates' Court, which shall issue a ruling on the matter; (vi) the related civil proceedings shall be deemed to be brought at the request of the Public Prosecutor s Office; (c) the proceedings in the present case shall be referred to the First Magistrates' Court of this",1,2011,El Salvador
96,"city pursuant to the last paragraph of article  of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the accused, who has been released, shall remain at liberty; and (d) the accused, Guadalupe Atilio Jaimes Prez, shall follow the foregoing instructions' 
.Concerning the Committee s recommendation (d), requesting to be informed of the judicial ruling declaring the strike to be illegal, the Government states that, on  March , the Fourth Labour Court of San Salvador heard the arguments for characterization of a strike against LIDO SA de CV made by union leader Guadalupe Atilio Jaimes Prez in his capacity as General Secretary of the trade union SELSA. In a judgment issued on  April , the court ' ) in order to settle the dispute pursuant to article , paragraph , of the Labour Code and, in accordance with articles , ,  and (f) of the Code, declares that the strike called by Guadalupe Atilio Jaimes Prez in his capacity as General Secretary of the LIDO SA de CV Company Trade Union is unlawful (Section , article (f), of the Labour Code) since, as demonstrated and determined by the aforementioned inspection, of the company s  workers, only  are striking peacefully while  remain on the job,  of them working for LIDO SA de CV and  working for FAMOLCAS SA de CV. Thus, the striking workers do not constitute at least  per cent of the employees of LIDO SA de CV or of the affected enterprise or establishment; () declares unfounded the request to stop work and orders all workers at the plant where the strike occurred to leave the premises peacefully; and () orders the striking workers to report for work at their usual time on  April of the present year in order to carry out their respective tasks' 
.With respect to the alleged dismissal of trade unionists Ana Mara Barrios Jimnez, Mara Isabel Oporto Jacinta and Oscar Armando Pineda (the Committee s recommendation (e)), the Government indicates that the records kept by the general labour inspectorate in the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare have been reviewed and that no record of a request for a labour inspection by the persons in question has been found. It also states that the unfair dismissal of a member of a trade union s executive committee may be appealed not only through administrative channels, but also through the courts; thus, the claimants could have elected to initiate judicial proceedings. Therefore, according to the Government, the Committee should urge the claimants to provide additional information on the action taken so as to enable it to formulate the requested observations.
.Concerning the Committee s recommendation (g), the Government provides a copy of the company s comments on the pending questions via the employers' organization concerned:(a) Owing to the death of the brother of its Director, Manuel Roberto Molina Martnez, the company was not functioning properly. Some workers were affected by this and reported alleged criminal offences. In order to address their complaints, Mr Molina Martnez, as a shareholder in the company, entered into conciliation proceedings with all the complainant workers in the Fifth Magistrates' Court and, out of his own pocket, reimbursed them for the unpaid amounts retained by the then administrators of DIGAPAN SA de CV.(b) It is true that LIDO SA de CV was bound by a three-year collective labour agreement with SELSA, registered with the National Department of Social Organizations in the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare General Directorate of Labour in September , which expired in September . The trade union subsequently requested the Ministry to authorize a revision of the collective agreement ' not one clause, as the complainants maintain ' and since the temporary extension of the collective labour agreement was not effected as it had been agreed when requesting for revision, and in order to keep the agreement in force during the revision pursuant to article , paragraph , of the Labour Code, it was decided that it would remain in provisional effect for the duration of the revision process. During this period, no understanding on a new agreement was reached since the trade union itself walked away from the bargaining table that it had demanded; it surprised the company by calling an unlawful strike, which was declared unlawful by the Fifth Labour Court of San Salvador in  and the Fourth Labour Court of San Salvador in .(c) Concerning the alleged anti-union activities, particularly with regard to Guadalupe Atilio Jaimes Prez, the company states that it did not bring charges against him; he committed a crime by threatening and injuring another of the company s workers and it was the victim who complained to the authorities, who initially took Mr Jaimes Prez into custody.(d) Concerning the union representatives' statement that the company was guilty of exerting undue influence on the Fourth Labour Court and that the court responded positively to such influences, this implies that the judge also committed an offence. The company therefore considers that, pursuant to article , paragraph , of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the matter should be referred to an examining magistrate and the signatories of the complaint should be asked to substantiate their claim or face charges of slander. Lastly, the company states that some trade union leaders have not reported for work since  July  for no apparent reason or for frivolous reasons.
.In conclusion, the Government states that, for the foregoing reasons, the complainant s allegations concerning the unlawful nature of the strike, the arrest of a trade union leader and the dismissal of workers' representatives are unfounded.
.The Committee notes that the allegations in the present case concern the period ' .
.Concerning the alleged anti-union attitude of LIDO SA de CV, the Committee observes that the Government confirms the allegation that, when the trade union requested the Ministry of Labour to authorize a revision of the collective agreement of  September , the company refused to attend the direct negotiations or the conciliation meetings and did not respond to the trade union s request for compulsory arbitration; however, the Government notes that later, after the trade union had adopted a decision to call a strike and the union and the company had agreed (on  March ) to revise the collective agreement on a clause-by-clause basis and to meet again on  March , the Ministry of Labour received a letter from the trade union reporting that a strike had broken out. The company, for its part, states that, by law, the collective agreement remained in force provisionally for the duration of the revision and that the trade union itself walked away from the bargaining table that it had demanded and called a strike, which the court declared unlawful. The complainants allege that the dialogue forum was established through the good offices of the Ministry of Labour, but the company argued economic problems, disputes between the owners and millions of dollars in debt in an attempt to justify freezing wages for the next six years. The Committee would like to point out that it is not called upon to evaluate the positions and strategies of the parties in a collective bargaining process and, in general, to draw attention to the principle that it is important that both employers and trade unions bargain in good faith and make every effort to reach an agreement: moreover, genuine and constructive negotiations are a necessary component to establish confidence between the parties [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ]. It also underlines that the principle that both employers and trade unions should negotiate in good faith and make efforts to reach an agreement means that every unjustified delay in the holding of negotiations should be avoided [see Digest, op. cit., para. ].
.With respect to the court s ruling that the strike was unlawful, the Committee notes the content of the  April  judgment in which the Fourth Labour Court of San Salvador declared the strike unlawful, ordered all the workers present at the plant to peacefully leave the premises and the striking workers to report for work at their usual time on  April .
.The Committee observes that the court ruled that the strike was unlawful because it noted that, of the company s  workers, only  were striking peacefully while  remained on the job,  of them working for LIDO SA de CV and  working for FAMOLCAS SA de CV. Therefore, the striking workers did not constitute at least  per cent of the employees of LIDO SA de CV or of the affected enterprise or establishment as required by law.
.The Committee observes a disparity in the numbers of striking workers provided by the complainant union; it maintains that  per cent of the company s workers supported the strike and that the subcontracted workers should not have been counted; it also alleges that the company exerted undue influence on",0,2011,El Salvador
97,"the Fourth Labour Court, which included  company directors in its count.
.The Committee is not in a position to verify the irregularities alleged by the complainants, but would nevertheless recall the principle that the conditions that have to be fulfilled under the law in order to render a strike lawful should be reasonable and in any event not such as to place a substantial limitation on the means of action open to trade union organizations [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. The Committee invites the Government to refer these legislative issues for tripartite dialogue.
.Concerning the criminal proceedings against Guadalupe Atilio Jaimes Prez, General Secretary of the complainant trade union (whose release was ordered by the court), the Committee takes note of the company s statement that he committed a criminal offence against another of the company s workers, whom he threatened and injured, and that it was the victim who filed a complaint. The Committee also takes note of the judgment handed down on initial hearing by the First Magistrates' Court of the Soyapango Integrated Judicial Centre on  June , in which the aforementioned union leader was charged under article  of the Criminal Code with threats of physical violence against Jos Heriberto Pacas, and, in lieu of pre-trial detention, was granted conditional release and is still at liberty.
.Concerning the allegation regarding the dismissal of trade unionists Ana Mara Barrios Jimnez, Mara Isabel Oporto Jacinta and Oscar Armando Pineda, the Committee notes from the Government s reply that the labour inspectorate s involvement was not requested and that the Government, being unaware whether judicial proceedings have been initiated, would like the complainants to provide additional information. Since the company states in general terms, without mentioning specific names, that some trade union leaders have not reported for work since  July  for no apparent reason or for frivolous reasons, the Committee requests the complainants to indicate whether the three trade unionists that they mention by name have initiated legal proceedings and, if so, to inform it of the judgment in the case.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee recalls the principle that the conditions that have to be fulfilled under the law in order to render a strike lawful should be reasonable and in any event not such as to place a substantial limitation on the means of action open to trade union organizations. The Committee invites the Government to refer these legislative issues for tripartite dialogue.(b) The Committee requests the complainants to indicate whether the trade unionists Ana Mara Barrios Jimnez, Mara Isabel Oporto Jacinta and Oscar Armando Pineda have appealed their dismissals before the courts and, if so, to inform it of the judgment in the case.
.The Committee examined this case at its November  meeting and presented an interim report [see th Report, paras ' , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November )].
.In a communication of  July , the complainant organizations (the Trade Union Confederation of El Salvador Workers (CSTS), the Trade Union Federation of Food, Beverage, Hotel, Restaurant and Agro-Industry Workers of El Salvador (FESTSSABHRA), and the LIDO SA de CV Company Trade Union (SELSA)) sent additional information.
.At its March  meeting [see st Report, para. ], the Committee made an urgent appeal to the Government and drew its attention to the fact that, in accordance with the procedural rules set out in paragraph  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session, it could present a report on the substance of the case even if it had not received the information or observations of the Government in due time. To date, no information has been received from the Government.
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Workers' Representatives Convention,  (No. ), and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.In its previous examination of the case, the Committee formulated the following conclusions and recommendations on the pending matters [see th Report, paras ' ]:' The Committee observes that, in the present case, the complainants allege: () that the company placed  workers, and later another  workers, on compulsory annual leave, in clear violation of the right to strike; () that between  and  July , Guadalupe Atilio Jaimes Prez, General Secretary of SELSA, was arrested and that criminal charges were brought against him following a false accusation by the assistant production manager of LIDO SA de CV alleging that he had been threatened; () that, on  July , the strike was declared illegal by the judicial authority which ordered that it be called off despite the fact that the purpose of the strike was to seek a wage increase; and () that the company began dismissing the union s representatives at LIDO SA de CV and at FAMOLCAS SA de CV, a subcontractor (Ana Mara Barrios Jimnez, Mara Isabel Oporto Jacinta and Oscar Armando Pineda).' The Committee takes note of the Government s statement that the judicial authority ordered the release of Guadalupe Atilio Jaimes Prez, who had been accused by the assistant production manager of having threatened him on the LIDO SA de CV premises and that he had remained under arrest from  to  July . The Committee requests the Government to clarify whether this union leader is still facing criminal charges and, if so, to inform it of the sentence handed down.' The Committee take notes that, according to the Government, the SELSA union leader formally notified the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare that the collective dispute had been dropped, that the case had been shelved and that SELSA had reached this decision in order to focus on revising the collective agreement that was due to expire. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in this regard.' Regarding the allegation that the company placed workers on compulsory annual leave during the strike, the Committee notes the Government s indication that, according to the company, the workers' annual leave had been advanced at the request of a trade union leader. The Committee requests the complainants to reply to this assertion. With respect to the allegation relating to the declaration of the strike as illegal, the Committee observes that the objective of the strike was a wage increase and that the declaration of the illegality of the strike on this basis does not appear to be justified. The Committee expresses its concern and requests the Government to inform it of the judicial ruling declaring the workers' strike at LIDO SA de CV to be illegal.' Finally, the Committee observes that the Government has not responded to the allegation regarding the dismissal of trade unionists Ana Mara Barrios Jimnez, Mara Isabel Oporto Jacinta and Oscar Armando Pineda and requests it to send its observations without delay.
.In their communication of  July , the complainant organizations state categorically, in relation to the Government s previous statements to which the Committee referred in its penultimate recommendation, that the information from the Government that the workers' annual leave had been advanced at the request of a trade union leader is false, and that there is no documentation to prove that the annual leave had been advanced at the request of a trade union leader; the complainants characterize the advance of annual leave as an anti-union measure.
.The complainants state that, on  September , as part of the collective bargaining taking place as the collective agreement was due to expire, the SELSA trade union requested the Minister of Labour to invite the company to the direct negotiation and conciliation stages.
.Article  of the preliminary draft of the collective agreement which SELSA was expecting to negotiate included all workers working directly or indirectly for LIDO SA de CV at the Boulevard plant who were subcontracted by FAMOLCAS SA de CV (which shared the same owners as LIDO SA de CV). This also contributed to the company s intransigence, since it maintained a double standard by paying subcontracted workers less. The wages of the workers in the company are amongst the lowest in the industry in the country, at only US$. dollars per month plus some benefits payable under the collective agreement. The wages of workers subcontracted by FAMOLCAS are even lower, at between $ and $ per month without any additional benefits.
.The complainants state that, on  and  December , the Ministry of Labour invited the company to begin the direct negotiation process and the company did not attend. Hence, the direct negotiation stage ended on  January . The conciliation stage finished subsequently, on  January , despite the company not having attended three meetings organized by the Ministry of Labour. The company did not attend any of the official meetings. The union subsequently proposed arbitration as a solution in",0,2011,El Salvador
98,"an attempt to avoid a strike. The company did not respond to that proposal either. As a result, the union was legally entitled to call a strike as from  February and up to  March . Following a personal intervention from the Minister of Labour, the company participated in a dialogue forum. However, the representatives of LIDO attended merely to argue that, as a result of family disputes, the companies, which were under the control of their family members, owed them $ million, and that, in order to absorb the debt, they had planned to recover $. million in expenses over four years between  and , the same period in which they were not in a position to increase wages. In other words, the proprietors of LIDO requested the workers to accept a pay freeze, which has so far lasted four years, and it would take a further two years to pay the costs of the family dispute.
.In view of the company s intransigence concerning participation in the collective bargaining stages, SELSA completed all of the legal procedures and informed the Director General of Labour that the strike broke out on  March . On  March and  April, SELSA wrote to the Ministry of Labour, requesting it to conduct the procedure under article  of the Labour Code to determine those workers who were to be present at the workplace, in view of the fact that the company was denying the strikers access to the workplace and started hiring strike-breakers, a procedure wholly inconsistent with the provisions of article . On  March, the Director-General of Labour notified the company that it must declare, within the legal time limit, whether it would exercise the right enshrined in article  of the Labour Code to meet with the trade union and determine the number, type and names of the workers who would be present in the company to carry out the types of work referred to in article . Almost immediately, the General Secretary of the SELSA trade union requested that the action be characterized as a strike, since the LIDO management was not doing so. Thus began the proceedings of the Fourth Labour Court of San Salvador. The bargaining unit of the dispute leading to the strike was lawfully the  workers of LIDO SA de CV,  per cent of whom supported the strike, thus exceeding the  per cent required by law. However, as a result of undue influence from the company, the Fourth Labour Court unlawfully included the subcontracted workers in the count. It was the union s intention to include them in the future, but they did not belong to the bargaining unit at that time. The Court also included in the count  company directors who are registered with the company for social security purposes but who are its proprietors. The judge declared the strike unlawful without considering all these irregularities. This demonstrates, once again, the shortcomings of the existing mechanisms in the legislation of El Salvador.
.The complainants state that the trade union s struggle always included precisely those subcontracted workers, since article  of the preliminary draft of the collective agreement (the remaining articles of which were never discussed) provided that all benefits should be applicable to any worker, whether employed on a temporary, casual, occasional, interim or permanent basis, who performs work at the plant or in any LIDO subsidiary.
.The Committee regrets that, despite the time that has elapsed since the beginning of the case, the Government has not provided the information requested, despite being invited to do so by means of an urgent appeal (in March ). The Committee expects that the Government will be more cooperative in the future by providing the information requested.
.Under these circumstances and in accordance with the applicable rules of procedure [see th Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body], the Committee finds itself obliged to present a report on the substance of the case without the benefit of the information that it had expected to receive from the Government.
.The Committee recalls that the purpose of the whole procedure established by the International Labour Organization for the examination of allegations of violations of freedom of association is to promote respect for this freedom in law and in fact. The Committee remains confident that, while the procedure protects governments from unfounded accusations, governments must in turn recognize the importance of formulating detailed replies concerning allegations made against them for the purposes of an objective examination.
.The Committee notes the additional information provided by the complainants on  July  in response to its recommendations, whereby they: () deny that the workers' annual leave in  was advanced at the request of a trade union leader and consider the advanced annual leave to be an anti-union measure; and () explain the reasons and irregularities which, in their view, pertain to the declaration that the  strike was illegal. The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the complainants' latest communication without delay.
.Furthermore, given the total absence of any information from the Government, the Committee once again reiterates the recommendations of its November  meeting, and requests it to obtain the comments of the company, via the employers' organization concerned, before sending the information requested.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee regrets that the Government has not replied to the allegations, despite the fact that it has had to repeatedly postpone its examination of the case and has issued an urgent appeal. The Committee expects that the Government will be more cooperative in the future.(b) The Committee once again requests the Government to keep it informed of the revision requested by the trade union of the collective agreement at LIDO SA de CV, which is due to expire.(c) The Committee once again requests the Government to clarify whether union leader Guadalupe Atilio Jaimes Prez (whose release was ordered by the judicial authority) is still facing charges and, if so, to inform it of the court ruling.(d) With respect to the allegation relating to the declaration of the strike as illegal, the Committee observed in its previous examination of this case that the objective of the strike was a wage increase and that the declaration of the illegality of the strike on this basis did not appear to be justified. The Committee once again expresses its concern and requests the Government to inform it of the judicial ruling declaring the workers' strike at LIDO SA de CV to be illegal.(e) The Committee once again observes that the Government has still not responded to the allegation regarding the dismissal of trade unionists Ana Mara Barrios Jimnez, Mara Isabel Oporto Jacinta and Oscar Armando Pineda, and once again requests it to send its observations without delay.(f) The Committee requests the Government to send its observations relating to the complainants' additional information dated  July .(g) The Committee requests the Government to obtain the company s comments on the pending questions via the employers' organization concerned.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the Trade Union Confederation of El Salvador Workers (CSTS), the Trade Union Federation of Food, Beverage, Hotel, Restaurant and Agro-Industry Workers of El Salvador (FESTSSABHRA), and the LIDO SA de CV Company Trade Union (SELSA) dated  June . The trade unions sent additional information in communications dated  July and  October .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  August .
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In communications dated  June,  July and  October , the CSTS, the FESTSSABHRA, (the El Salvador affiliate of the International Union of Food, Agricultural, Hotel, Restaurant, Catering, Tobacco and Allied Workers' Association (IUF)) and the LIDO SA de CV Company Trade Union (SELSA) state that the LIDO SA de CV company has, for  years, been manufacturing several varieties of white bread, muffins (pan dulce), confectionery and cakes. For almost  years there has also been a collective labour agreement which is revised in its entirety every three years (latest revision in ) and whose clause on wages is reviewed every year.
.In December , the union asked for the wage scale to enter into effect in February , as laid down in clause  of the collective agreement. Because of the world economic crisis, however, it was agreed on this occasion that the wage increase would become effective in December  and there would be no annual review in February . In a show of flexibility, SELSA accepted this arrangement; in December , therefore, it again requested that the clause on wages be reviewed and that the new scale enter into effect in February . At that point the company, arguing that there was an economic crisis and that sales were down, refused outright to",0,2011,El Salvador
99,"agree to a wage increase. After complying with all the requisite legal stages and requirements, the union came out on strike, at which point the assistant production manager, Jos Heriberto Pacas, lodged false criminal charges that led to the arrest of trade union leader Guadalupe Atilio Jaimes Prez and his imprisonment for four days.
.In chronological order, the events were as follows:' On  December , SELSA requested the Ministry of Labour to initiate the direct procedure for revising the clause on wages and duly submitted the requisite documents to support its request.' On  January , negotiations convened by the Ministry of Labour began under the direct procedure. At this stage, no agreement was reached because the company would not offer any wage increase.' On  March , the conciliation procedure began under the good offices of the Ministry of Labour.' On  April, the Ministry notified the parties that the conciliation phase had come to an end and that the company had not offered any wage increase.' On  April, the union requested that the procedure enter the arbitration phase.' On  April, the company rejected the request for arbitration and, on  April, the Ministry of Labour informed SELSA accordingly.' On  April, SELSA informed the Ministry of Labour of the workers' decision to call a strike.' On  May, SELSA informed the Ministry of Labour of the strike agreement.' On  May, the Ministry of Labour informed of the company of the strike, following which the workers were, accordingly, at liberty to go on strike  days later.' On  May, the company ordered  workers to take annual leave in a clear violation of the right to strike. The same day the union called for an inspection by the Ministry of Labour.' On  July, the company ordered another  workers to take leave in a further infringement of the right to strike.' The Ministry of Labour conducted its inquiry into the incident on  May.' On  July, when the strike began, the civilian police proceeded to detain trade union leader Guadalupe Atilio Jaimes Prez (General Secretary), following a complaint by the assistant production manager that he had received death threats, and incarcerated him along with common prisoners at the police delegation of San Bartolo-llopango.' During the night of  July, the company s lawyer, Sergio Mndez, implied that the company might withdraw its charges against the union leader if the workers called off the strike.' The union leader was released in the afternoon of  July.' At a hearing on  July, held by the First Magistrates' Court of Ilopango, alternative measures were decreed in place of the union leader s arrest and formal proceedings began.' On  July, the Fifth Labour Court of San Salvador notified the striking workers, through the Magistrates' Court of Soyapango, that the strike had been declared illegal and must be called off on  July.' In the afternoon of  July, the workers called an end to the strike without having obtained any wage increase.
.The complainants emphasize that the workers complied with each and every principle governing the right to strike: () the requirement to give advance notice; () the requirement that they resort to the voluntary conciliation, mediation and arbitration procedures for collective disputes before calling a strike; () the requirement that a quorum be present and that the strike be decided upon by majority agreement and secret ballot; () the adoption of appropriate measures to guarantee safety and prevent accidents and the maintenance of a minimum service in specific cases; and () the guarantee that those not on strike were free to work.
.The complainants state that proceedings have begun with the labour authorities to have the union s representatives at LIDO SA de CV and of FAMOLCAS SA de CV (a subcontractor of LIDO SA) dismissed (Ana Mara Barrios Jimnez, Mara Isabel Oporto Jacinta and Oscar Armando Pineda).
.In its communication dated  August , the Government states that, according to proceeding No. / of the General Labour Directorate of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare regarding the complaint brought by SELSA against LIDO SA de CV over the clause on wages in the collective labour agreement, pursuant to article  of the Labour Code, the parties concerned were invited by a special inspection unit representing the Ministry to join them in monitoring the peaceful conduct of the strike and that during the inspection a forum for dialogue was set up with representatives of both the employer and the trade union. During the discussion the union s representatives stated that they had requested a special inspection because the representatives of LIDO SA de CV had violated their right to strike by placing  people on annual leave, including union leaders and other members. The purpose of the company s representatives had been to undermine the strike.
.The Government adds that during the discussions the union s representatives presented the following demands: () establishment of a dialogue committee with representatives from LIDO SA de CV with decision-making power; () a wage increase for all workers at LIDO SA de CV and FAMOLCAS SA de CV; () an agreement not to take reprisals against workers taking part in the strike; () the dismissal of the plant manager, Geovanny Sanchz, and assistant production manager, Heriberto Pacas; and () payment of wages deducted from trade union leaders during the period concerned.
.LIDO SA de CV denied the trade union s accusation that it was undermining the strike by placing workers on early annual leave and stated that it had done so at the request of a union leader. Regarding an increase in wages, it maintained its position that it was unable to meet such a demand and suggested an alternative, i.e. that the company acquire products for the basic food basket at wholesale prices.
.During the inspection, the representatives of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare were informed of a dispute between Guadalupe Atilio Jaimes Prez and Heriberto Pacas, allegedly involving punching and fighting. Three members of the civilian police were brought in who proceeded to arrest Mr Jaimes, since Mr Pacas claimed to be the injured party. The Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare was not informed of the outcome of the incident.
.Subsequently, on  September , SELSA s General Secretary, Guadalupe Atilio Jaimes Prez, went to the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare with a document stating that, since the legal procedures for collective disputes had been exhausted without any agreement and since the collective labour agreement was due to expire, it had been agreed to leave the dispute aside in order to proceed with the collective agreement s revision. The General Labour Directorate of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare accordingly decided to shelve the case.
.Moreover, civilian police file No. PNC/DG/nm. -- reveals that, on  June , Jos Heriberto Pacas went to the investigations department of the police delegation of Soyapango to lodge a complaint against Guadalupe Atilio Jaimes Prez who, he claimed, had, at around  p.m. that very day, threatened him and physically aggressed him inside the LIDO SA de CV plant located at th km of Boulevard del Ejrcito Nacional, where they both worked. At . p.m. on  June , Mr Pacas, who declared himself to be the injured party, brought penal charges against Guadalupe Atilio Jaimes Prez for threatening him.
.On  June , the duty officer of the Prosecutor s Office of Soyapango issued resolution No. -UDV-SOY- calling for appropriate steps to be taken against Guadalupe Atilio Jaimes Prez for having proffered threats against Jos Heriberto Pacas. At  p.m. on  June , police officers from the investigations department of the police delegation of Soyapango arrested Guadalupe Atilio Jaimes Prez and charge him with threatening Jos Heriberto Pacas. Finally, in ruling No. --, the First Magistrates' Court of Soyapango ordered the release of Guadalupe Atilio Jaimes Prez.
.The Committee observes that, in the present case, the complainants allege: () that the company placed  workers, and later another  workers, on compulsory annual leave, in clear violation of the right to strike; () that between  and  July , Guadalupe Atilio Jaimes Prez, General Secretary of SELSA, was arrested and that criminal charges were brought against him following a false accusation by the assistant production manager of LIDO SA de CV alleging that he had been threatened; () that, on  July , the strike was declared illegal by the judicial authority which ordered that it be called off despite the fact that the purpose of the strike was to seek a wage increase; and () that the company began dismissing the union s representatives at LIDO SA de CV and at FAMOLCAS SA de CV, a subcontractor (Ana Mara Barrios Jimnez, Mara Isabel Oporto Jacinta and Oscar Armando Pineda). The Committee observes that, according to the Government, the Ministry of Labour accompanied the opposing parties in discussions during the strike.
.The Committee takes note of the Government s statement that the",0,2011,El Salvador
100,"judicial authority ordered the release of Guadalupe Atilio Jaimes Prez, who had been accused by the assistant production manager of having threatened him on the LIDO SA de CV premises and that he had remained under arrest from  to  July . The Committee requests the Government to clarify whether this union leader is still facing criminal charges and, if so, to inform it of the sentence handed down.
.The Committee take notes that, according to the Government, the SELSA union member formally notified the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare that the collective dispute had been dropped, that the case had been shelved and that SELSA had reached this decision in order to focus on revising the collective agreement that was due to expire. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in this regard.
.Regarding the allegation that the company placed workers on compulsory annual leave during the strike, the Committee notes the Government s indication that, according to the company, the workers' annual leave had been advanced at the request of a trade union leader. The Committee requests the complainants to reply to this assertion. With respect to the allegation relating to the declaration of the strike as illegal, the Committee observes that the objective of the strike was a wage increase and that the declaration of the illegality of the strike on this basis does not appear to be justified. The Committee expresses its concern and requests the Government to inform it of the judicial ruling declaring the workers' strike at LIDO SA de CV to be illegal.

101,".The complaint is contained in the communication of April  presented by the Federation of Independent Associations or Trade Unions of El Salvador (FEASIES). The organization sent additional information on  June .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  June .
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communications of April  and dated  June , the FEASIES alleges that, ever since it was established on  December , the Workers' Trade Union of the Mayor s Office of Ilopango (SITTAMI) has been the victim of anti-union pressure.
.The FEASIES states that in April  SITTAMI presented a list of demands for improved safety and health at the workplace and full compliance with the Administrative Career Act and that, with the Mayor s Office, it set up a joint integration forum (five members from SITTAMI and five from the administration), of which very little eventually came.
.The FEASIES alleges that in January  the Ilopango Municipal Council unilaterally decided to invite representatives of another association (ATRAM), which supports the Mayor s Office, to join the forum and granted it a number of local and other advantages. This meant that the forum could no longer deal with the issues before it properly, and SITTAMI therefore decided not to take part.
.The complainant alleges that SITTAMI accordingly called a strike at the Mayor s Office on  March . The next day the workers were expelled from the area by the police without the trade unionists putting up any opposition. The same day the Mayor rejected the FEASIES' offer of mediation on the grounds that a forum for dialogue already existed; this the trade union had already rejected for the reason stated above.
.The complainant states that on  March  workers who had remained in front of the Mayor s Office were beaten and attacked with tear gas by police from other municipalities. As a result, five trade unionists (including the union s general secretary, disputes secretary and press officer) sustained injuries that left them unable to work for two to five days. In response, they initiated legal proceedings with the Public Prosecutor. On  March  the Mayor in turn brought criminal charges against the  members of the union s Executive Committee and other trade unionists for public disorder. The union took the matter to the Office of the Ombudsman for Human Rights, which set up a meeting with the Mayor and with the leaders of SITTAMI. On  April  the two parties signed an agreement in which both undertook to enter into a dialogue and to defuse the conflict; the strikers would return to work and would not have to face reprisals.
.Finally, on  April  the administration denied trade unionists (including members of the union s Executive Committee) access to the Mayor s Office and the police arrested them for their alleged involvement in crimes of public disorder, the violent exercise of trade union rights and damaging public property. The trade unionists concerned appealed to the Constitutional Chamber for their release.
.The complainant emphasizes that the incidents referred to occurred during the peaceful, democratic and legal exercise of the right to strike and constituted a violation of the agreement between the parties whereby the Mayor s Office had undertaken not to take reprisals.
.In its communication dated  February  the Government states that it appears from its inquiries that on  April  the following  people were indeed placed under temporary arrest: Jos Walter Salas Rodrguez, Nubia Antonia Espinoza Posada, Rafael Humberto Placidn, Edgardo Evenor Aguilar, Juan Pablo Gallardo Salazar, Jorge Alberto Garca Flores, Rubn Antonio Araujo Guzmn, Teresa del Carmen Avils Morn, Carlos Antonio Fuentes Menjvar, Jos Ricardo Moreno, Jos Gil Ingls, Sonia Aracely Caldern Rivera, Christian Alexander Cruz Cruz, Ren Galdmez Escobar, Hugo Alfredo Callejas de la Cruz, Arnulfo Federico Melndez Cruz, Jos Roberto Hernndez, Juan Bautista Castillo Martnez and Edwin Alberto Contreras Campos. Their arrest was subsequent to a complaint lodged with the Prosecutor s Office by the Mayor of Ilopango, Alba Elizabeth Mrquez. On  April , in application of article  of the Penal Code, the Prosecutor formally requested the temporary arrest of the  people as a precautionary measure, on charges of causing public disorder (article  of the Penal Code) such as to disturb the peace, the violent exercise of their rights (article  of the Penal Code) such as to hinder the administration of justice, damaging public assets (article  of the Penal Code) and thereby causing prejudice to the Mayor s Office of Ilopango, and the unlawful appropriation or possession of assets (article  of the Penal Code) belonging to the Mayor s Office.
.The Government adds that, after due investigation by the Justice of the Peace of Ilopango, an initial hearing was set for  April , as a result of which alternative precautionary measures were imposed on the  people concerned, one of them being a ban on their leaving the country without judicial authorization.
.That said, and according to information provided by the general labour directorate, it would appear from the latter s records that at no time did the workers concerned apply to the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare to intervene. On the other hand, it is on record that a plea of habeas corpus was entered by SITTAMI with the Constitutional Chamber of the Constitutional Court of Justice. The matter is being dealt with under the normal legal procedure, and the Committee will be informed of the outcome in due course.
.Finally, the Mayor s Office of Ilopango was requested to report on the current state of its employment relationship with the  workers; in reply, the Mayor of Ilopango stated that they were currently working normally.
.In the light of the foregoing, and in accordance with Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), stipulating that workers and employers and their respective organizations must respect the law of the land, and since the incidents alleged by the complainant do not constitute a violation of the exercise of trade union rights, the Government feels justified in requesting that the complaint presented by the FEASIES be dropped.
.The Committee observes in the present case that the complainant alleges the arrest and criminal prosecution of  trade unionists (including the members of the Executive Committee of SITTAMI, which operates in the Mayor s Office of Ilopango) following the peaceful and legitimate exercise of their right to strike, as well as the expulsion of the strikers by the police on  and  March , the violent and brutal expulsion of the strikers who were still in front of the Mayor s Office and the use of tear gas against them by police from other municipalities; as a result, three union officials and two trade unionists were medically certified as being unable to work for two to five days. According to the allegations, the Mayor ignored an undertaking she had entered into with the trade union in the presence of the Ombudsman for Human Rights not to take reprisals, inasmuch as she brought criminal charges against  trade unionists (including the members of the union s Executive Committee) for exercising their right to strike ' legitimately and peacefully, according to the complainant. Because of the charges brought against them, the  trade unionists were arrested and taken to court, after which they entered a plea of habeas corpus. According to the complainant, the dispute stemmed from the failure to resolve a set of demands (safety and health in employment, compliance with the Administrative Career Act, and the decision of the Mayor s Office to include representatives of a pro-employer association in the forum for dialogue (on this point, however, the complainant provides little information)).
.The Committee takes note of the Government s statement that: () the arrests of the  employees followed the presentation of a complaint by the Mayor of Ilopango to the Public Prosecutor on  April  which led to the temporary arrest of  people charged with public disorder, the violent exercise of their rights, damage to public property and the unlawful appropriation and possession of municipal assets; () in the dispute referred to by the complainant no request was made to the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare to intervene; () the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice examined a plea of habeas corpus presented by SITTAMI, the outcome of which the Government will inform the Committee; () the  employees concerned have now returned to their workplace; and () the alleged incidents are a violation of the exercise of trade union rights inasmuch as Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), stipulates that trade unions must respect the law in the exercise of their rights.
.The Committee observes",1,2011,El Salvador
102,"that the versions presented by the complainant and by the Government differ as to the peaceful and legal nature of the strike called by the union (which the Government refutes). The Committee observes that the Government has not responded to the allegation that the Mayor s Office infringed the terms of an agreement entered into with the trade union in the presence of the Ombudsman for Human Rights on  April , in which it undertook not to take reprisals (the complainant sent the Committee a copy of the Ombudsman s ruling). The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the subject, as well as on the injuries sustained by three union leaders and two other trade unionists, with an indication of whether the union has initiated legal proceedings in that connection.
.Given the contradiction between the allegations and the Government s reply regarding the peaceful and legitimate nature of the strike and observing that the temporary arrests of the  trade unionists has ended (although they have been charged), the Committee requests the Government to send it a copy of any sentence that may be handed down in connection with the plea of habeas corpus presented by the union and on the sentences concerning the criminal charges brought by the Mayor of Ilopango against  trade unionists for the commission of crimes against public assets, public disorder and other crimes. Taking into account the situation as a whole and the Mayor s promise (according to the allegations) not to take reprisals, the Committee suggests that the Government take steps to promote a negotiated solution to the dispute.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	Observing that the Government has not responded to the allegation that the Mayor s Office has infringed an agreement entered into with the trade union in the presence of the Ombudsman for Human Rights on  April  in which it undertook not to take reprisals (the complainant has sent the Committee a copy of the Ombudsman s ruling), the Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the matter, as well as on the injuries allegedly sustained by three union leaders and two other trade unionists, with an indication of whether the union has taken legal action in that connection.(b)	Given the contradiction between the allegations and the Government s reply regarding the peaceful and legitimate nature of the strike and observing that the temporary arrest of the  trade unionists has ended (although they have been charged), the Committee requests the Government to send a copy of any sentence that may be handed down in connection with the plea of habeas corpus presented by the union and on the sentences concerning the criminal charges brought by the Mayor of Ilopango against  trade unionists for the commission of crimes against public assets, public disorder and other crimes.(c)	Taking into account the situation as a whole and the Mayor s promise (according to the allegations) not to take reprisals, the Committee suggests that the Government take steps to promote a negotiated solution to the dispute.",0,2011,El Salvador
103,".In its previous examination of the case, the Committee made the following recommendations on matters still pending [see th Report of the Committee, paragraph ]:The Committee urges the Government to take all the necessary steps, including through dialogue in the Commission consisting of the Human Rights Ombudsman and several religious authorities, to ensure that the governing body of the Legislative Assembly proceeds to reinstate the Secretary-General of SITRAL, Mr Luis Alberto Ortega Ortega, and that this trade union is recognized without delay.
.In its communication dated  June , the Trade Union of Workers of the Legislative Assembly (SITRAL) stated that the Legislative Assembly continued to refuse to reinstate union leader Mr Luis Alberto Ortega Ortega, despite the provisional order issued by the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court ordering his reinstatement.
.In its communication dated  January , the Government states that, in accordance with the Committee s recommendations, it forwarded its conclusions and recommendations to the Legislative Assembly specifically so that the governing body of the Legislative Assembly could proceed to reinstate the Secretary-General of SITRAL, Mr Luis Alberto Ortega Ortega, and to recognize the trade union without delay. The Government adds that, in light of the above, the Legislative Assembly complied with the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court s decisions and the Committee s recommendations, namely by reinstating Mr Luis Alberto Ortega Ortega in his post, who has been working as usual in the institution in question since July  and, moreover, continues to serve as Secretary-General of SITRAL.
.Regarding the recognition of SITRAL, the Committee takes note that the Government states that the National Department of Social Organizations of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare approved the statutes of SITRAL through Resolution No. / of  September , and at the same time granted legal status to the trade union. It also granted credentials to the governing body of SITRAL for the period of  July  to  July .
.The Committee notes with satisfaction the reinstatement of the trade union leader, Mr Luis Alberto Ortega Ortega, and the granting of credentials to the governing body of the complainant union.
.The Committee last examined this case, concerning the refusal by the governing body of the Legislative Assembly to recognize the Trade Union of Workers of the Legislative Assembly (SITRAL) and anti-union practices, including non-renewal of the employment contract of SITRAL s Secretary-General, at its November  meeting [see nd Report, paras ' ]. On that occasion, the Committee made the following recommendations:(a)	While the Committee is fully aware of the consequences of the separation of powers, it requests that the Government communicate its conclusions and recommendations to the Legislative Assembly and firmly expects that the governing body of the Legislative Assembly will, pending the final outcome of this official s application for amparo, immediately extend the employment contract of the Secretary-General of SITRAL, Mr Luis Alberto Ortega Ortega so that he is reinstated without loss of pay, recognize the trade union without delay and open a constructive dialogue with that organization.(b)	The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any measures taken to follow up the aforementioned conclusions and recommendations.
.In a communication dated  February , the Government informs the Committee that the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare forwarded the Committee s conclusions and recommendations on this case to the Legislative Assembly. In its communication dated  May , the complainant informs the Committee that the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court, in a decision of  October , declared inadmissible the application for amparo filed by Luis Alberto Ortega Ortega, ruling that the worker could not claim stability of employment, as he held a contract of personal service. The organization states further that, starting on  January , the Metropolitan Cathedral of San Salvador was peacefully occupied for three months in support of the demand for Luis Alberto Ortega s reinstatement, among other demands. As a result of this movement, a Commission was set up, consisting of the Human Rights Ombudsman and several religious authorities, to seek a favourable solution to the demands, including compliance with the recommendations of the Committee on Freedom of Association concerning this case. Lastly, on  February  the Secretary-General of SITRAL filed an individual petition against the State of El Salvador with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights for violation of human and labour rights.
.The Committee takes note of the decision of the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court declaring inadmissible the amparo proceedings filed by the Secretary-General of SITRAL against the non-renewal of his contract of employment. The Committee notes that the Supreme Court has not ruled on whether or not there were anti-union reasons for the non-renewal of the contract of Luis Ortega Ortega, considering that the worker was not entitled to stability of employment. The Committee recalls in this regard that the non renewal of a contract for anti-union reasons constitutes a prejudicial act within the meaning of Article  of Convention No.  [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, para. ] and that no one should be subjected to anti-union discrimination because of legitimate trade union activities and the remedy of reinstatement should be available to those who are victims of anti-union discrimination [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. In the light of these principles and of its previous recommendations concerning this case, the Committee urges the Government to take all the necessary steps, including through dialogue in the Commission consisting of the Human Rights Ombudsman and several religious authorities, to ensure that the governing body of the Legislative Assembly proceeds to reinstate the Secretary-General of SITRAL, Mr Luis Alberto Ortega Ortega, and that this trade union is recognized without delay. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any measures taken to follow up the aforementioned conclusions and recommendations.
.The complaint is contained in communications from the Democratic Workers' Confederation (CTD) and the Trade Union of Workers of the Legislative Assembly (SITRAL), dated  December  and  February  respectively.
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  May .
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Workers' Representatives Convention,  (No. ), and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee notes that in the present case the complainant organizations claim that the members of the governing body of the Legislative Assembly have refused to recognize and open a dialogue with SITRAL since it was granted legal personality on  September , and have, in particular through the members of a political party, mounted an anti-union campaign and engaged in anti-union practices aimed at forcing trade union members to leave the union,  cases of which have been recorded (the complainant organizations enclose a copy of three letters of withdrawal). Furthermore, they have taken the decision not to extend the contract of the Secretary-General, Mr Luis Alberto Ortega Ortega, which violates the Constitution, the relevant ILO Conventions and the Labour Code.
.The Committee takes note of the Government s statement, according to which: () it is obvious that the Legislative Assembly (by taking the decision not to extend the employment contract of SITRAL s Secretary-General) has violated the right to freedom of association, as well as the guarantees to preserve the job security of the members who form trade union governing bodies; () The Secretary-General of SITRAL has submitted an application for amparo to the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice on the grounds that his constitutional right, to freedom of association and occupational stability have been violated, the admissibility of which is currently being determined. The Committee will be kept informed of any developments in proceedings and the final ruling on the case; and () The Ministry of Labour and Social Security was not in a position to follow up the request it received to investigate whether union rights had indeed been violated, given that hearing and taking a decision on public sector labour disputes is outside its area of competence (the Government states that the competent authorities are the civil service commissions and tribunal or, failing that, the administrative litigation division or the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice).
.With regard to the failure by the governing body of the Legislative Assembly to recognize SITRAL and its refusal to open a dialogue with the union, the Committee notes that the Government has made no specific reply to this allegation. The Committee wishes to recall that freedom of association is a fundamental labour right and that all State bodies should therefore recognize and open a dialogue with trade unions that have been legally established within this framework, as is the case with SITRAL.
.The Committee firmly expects that the governing body of the Legislative Assembly will recognize the trade union SITRAL without delay and will open a constructive dialogue with this organization.
.With regard to the",-1,2010,El Salvador
104,"alleged decision not to renew the employment contract of SITRAL s Secretary-General, Mr Luis Alberto Ortega Ortega, the Committee notes that the Government views this decision as having violated the right to freedom of association and the guarantees to preserve the job security of trade union officials and is awaiting the ruling of the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice after the trade union official, Mr Luis Alberto Ortega Ortega submitted an application for amparo. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the contents of the final ruling. The Committee stresses that the public authorities must lead by example in guaranteeing the exercise of the trade union rights enshrined in ILO Conventions Nos , , , and , especially when the Legislative Assembly is the branch of the State that approved and ratified these fundamental Conventions and when both the Constitution and national legislation protect trade union officials against anti-union dismissal.
.In the light of the above, the Committee considers that, in order to ensure compliance with both national legislation and ILO Conventions Nos , ,  and , the employment contract of the Secretary-General of the trade union should, pending the final ruling, be extended so that he is reinstated without loss of pay.
.With regard to the alleged pressure applied by the members of a political party of the Legislative Assembly, causing various members of SITRAL to leave the union, the Committee emphasizes that, according to these allegations, this proved effective in a dozen cases and that the complainant organizations have enclosed copies of three letters of withdrawal. The Committee notes the Government s statement regarding these allegations and, moreover, that the Government indicates that, apart from the letters of withdrawal in which some members cite personal reasons for leaving the union and, in one case, even management responsibilities, there is no evidence to suggest that these union members were indeed put under pressure. However, if such pressure was applied, it would undoubtedly constitute a serious violation of the right to freedom of association. Furthermore, the Government reiterates that it remains outside the competence of the branch of the public administration responsible for labour, in other words, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, to deal with this type of complaint, which relates to situations that occurred in the public sector. However, there remains the possibility of instituting legal proceedings before the competent jurisdictional authorities with a view to restoring those union rights that were allegedly violated. The Committee considers the complainant organizations' allegations, which are consistent with the anti-union context depicted in the preceding paragraphs, to be serious enough to justify the conduct of a rapid investigation in order to clarify the facts. Should the allegations of anti-union pressure prove to be founded, this practice should be remedied and sufficiently dissuasive sanctions should be imposed. The Committee takes note of the Government s statement to the effect that matters involving labour relations in the public sector remain outside the competence of the Secretary of State for Labour, which prevents the Secretary from ordering an investigation, but points out that failure to investigate is tantamount to absolving in this case those allegedly responsible for pressuring members of the trade union SITRAL into leaving the union. An independent authority should therefore be in a position to investigate these allegations in order to gather sufficient evidence to support the case when it is brought before the jurisdictional authorities. The Committee requests that measures be taken to carry out the aforementioned investigation.
.While the Committee is fully aware of the consequences of the separation of powers, it requests that the Government communicate its conclusions to the Legislative Assembly and firmly expects that the governing body of the Legislative Assembly will immediately extend the employment contract of the Secretary-General of SITRAL, Mr Luis Alberto Ortega Ortega, pending the final outcome of this official s application for amparo, recognize the trade union without delay, and open a constructive dialogue with that organization.
.Lastly, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any measures taken to follow up the aforementioned conclusions and recommendations.
.In light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) While the Committee is fully aware of the consequences of the separation of powers, it requests that the Government communicate its conclusions and recommendations to the Legislative Assembly and firmly expects that the governing body of the Legislative Assembly will, pending the final outcome of this official s application for amparo, immediately extend the employment contract of the Secretary-General of SITRAL, Mr Luis Alberto Ortega Ortega so that he is reinstated without loss of pay, recognize the trade union without delay and open a constructive dialogue with that organization.(b) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any measures taken to follow up the aforementioned conclusions and recommendations.",0,2010,El Salvador
105,".At its June  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendations on the matters still pending [see th Report, para. ]:The Committee again requests the Government, in consultation with the most representative workers' and employers' organizations, to accelerate the procedure for amending the legislation, ensuring that it fully guarantees respect of the principles of freedom of association for municipal employees, and expresses the firm hope that in the very near future the SITESMUES will be able to represent employees of several municipal authorities.
.In its communication of  February , the Government states that it is continuing to take a tripartite approach to the process of amending and reforming the Civil Service Act by ensuring that measures aimed at guaranteeing and protecting the labour rights of municipal workers are incorporated.
.The Committee takes note of this information and requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in the social dialogue process undertaken. The Committee hopes to see progress in the near future and reminds the Government that it may avail itself of the ILO s assistance to that end.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the Trade Union of Municipal Workers and Employees of El Salvador (SITESMUES) dated  October .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  November .
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  October , the SITESMUES states that, according to a notarized record issued on  February , the trade union was established in the presence of  founding members, who are employees of the municipal authorities of San Salvador, Chalchuapa, Atiquizaya, Rosario de Mora and Apopa. The chairperson of the provisional executive committee submitted an application in due legal form on  March  to the Ministry of Labour and Social Security for approval of the by-laws and the granting of legal personality to the trade union.
.The complainant organization states that the application was submitted in accordance with the applicable legislation, under section () of the Civil Service Act, which provides that  Public servants have the right to associate freely to defend their common economic and social interests, by establishing professional associations or trade unions, in keeping with the powers and restrictions laid down in the Constitution of the Republic, international conventions and this Act,' read together with section  of the Act, which defines a trade union as  a permanent association consisting of at least  public servants employed in the same institution of the public administration ...'  The complainant organization adds that the Ministry of Labour rejected the application made by SITESMUES by decision No. / of  April , on the grounds that the incipient trade union failed to comply with the requirements laid down in the abovementioned section  of the Civil Service Act, since, as indicated in the notarized record issued on  February , it was established by workers who said they were employed by different municipal authorities, and thus did not meet the requirement laid down in that section to the effect that the public servants establishing a trade union must be employed in the same institution of the public administration, in this case the same municipal authority.
.The complainant organization states that the chairperson of the provisional executive committee, together with representatives of other trade unions of municipal employees, wrote to the Minister of Labour and Social Security requesting a meeting to discuss the issue of the refusal to grant it legal personality. No reply has been received to date.
.In its communication dated  November , the Government states that the stance taken by the current administration of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security has been one of respect for the right to work and hence the human right of freedom of association of working men and women, as well as respect for the rule of law. However, in the case presented by SITESMUES, the Government points out that section  of the Civil Service Act provides that  for the purposes of this Act,  trade union' means a permanent association consisting of at least  public servants employed in the same institution of the public administration, in order to study, improve and protect their common economic and social interests'  this requirement has not been met by the trade union in question, as its founding members belong to five different municipal authorities. Nonetheless, according to the Government, each of the municipal authorities can establish its own trade union.
.The Government points out that Article () of ILO Convention No.  provides that  In exercising the rights provided for in this Convention workers and employers and their respective organisations, like other persons or organised collectivities, shall respect the law of the land.' In other words, the Convention offers the possibility of applying each country s domestic legislation in regard to compliance with its requirements; thus, the Convention, being general in scope, does not go into specific aspects or situations, such as the minimum number required to establish a trade union, or the situation occurring in the present case, i.e. the possibility of public servants ' municipal employees ' of different municipal authorities being founding members of a single trade union.
.The Government adds that it has begun a process of revision and amendment of the Civil Service Act, which will include revision of Chapter XI on collective labour law (sections ' ), and an analysis of section  mentioned above with a view to amending it so that it will not constitute an obstacle to the unionization of officials and employees working in different municipal authorities. The Government highlights the fact that, in order to help strengthen and ensure respect for the right of freedom of association, it held a consultation on  August  with the International Labour Standards Department of the ILO (which is actively involved in the process of revision of the Civil Service Act) concerning the direct application of Convention No.  to the present case.
.The Government concludes by stating that, starting on  July , the Ministry of Labour has granted legal personality to  public sector unions in line with its intention and commitment to make progress on promoting the rights to organize and collective bargaining, which are the fundamental pillars of justice and social peace.
.The Committee observes that in this case the complainant organization alleges refusal by the authorities to grant legal personality to a trade union of workers employed in different municipal authorities.
.The Committee notes that, according to the complainant organization: (i) according to a notarized record issued on  February , the trade union was established in the presence of  founding members, who are employees of the municipal authorities of San Salvador, Chalchuapa, Atiquizaya, Rosario de Mora and Apopa; (ii) in March  an application was submitted for approval of the by-laws and the granting of legal personality to the trade union; (iii) the Ministry of Labour rejected the application made by the trade union, on the grounds that it failed to comply with the requirements laid down in section  of the Civil Service Act, since the incipient trade union was established by workers who said they were employed by different municipal authorities; and (iv) a letter was sent to the Minister of Labour and Social Security requesting a meeting, but no reply has been received to date.
.The Committee notes further the Government s statement to the effect that, starting in July , it has granted legal personality to  public sector unions. It also notes that, in the present case, the Government states that: (i) section  of the Civil Service Act provides that  for the purposes of this Act,  trade union' means a permanent association consisting of at least  public servants employed in the same institution of the public administration, in order to study, improve and protect their common economic and social interests'  (ii) this requirement was not met by the trade union in question, as its founding members belong to five different municipal authorities; and (iii) it has begun a process of revision and amendment of the Civil Service Act, which will include revision of Chapter XI on collective labour law (sections ' ), and an analysis of section  mentioned above with a view to amending it so that it will not constitute an obstacle to the unionization of officials and employees working in different municipal authorities.
.The Committee wishes to emphasize that the issue of conformity of section  of the Civil Service Act with ILO Convention No.  has been raised on a number of occasions in which the Government had already expressed its firm intention to comply with the principles of Convention No.  and said that work was under way on amendment of the Civil Service Act. The Committee stresses once again in this regard that, under Article  of Convention No.",1,2010,El Salvador
106,", workers have the right to establish organizations of their own choosing, including organizations grouping together workers from different workplaces and different cities. The Committee adds that, with regard to restrictions limiting all public servants to membership of unions confined to that category of workers, it is admissible for first-level organizations of public servants to be limited to that category of workers on condition that their organizations are not also restricted to employees of any particular ministry, department or service, and that the first-level organizations may freely join the federations and confederations of their own choosing [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth edition, , paras  and ]. The Committee again requests the Government, in consultation with the most representative workers' and employers' organizations, to accelerate the procedure for amending the legislation, ensuring that it fully guarantees respect of the principles of freedom of association for municipal employees, and expects that in the very near future the SITESMUES will be able to represent employees of several municipal authorities. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the status of the amendment process and to accept rapidly the technical assistance of the ILO aimed at ensuring that the trade union in question may effectively represent employees of several municipalities.

107,".The Trade Union Association of Nursing Professionals, Technicians and Aides (SIGPTEES) lodged its complaint in a communication dated  May .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  October .
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  May , the SIGPTEES indicates that it lodges a formal complaint against the Government of El Salvador owing to the limits placed on its right to draw up its statutes.
.The complainant organization indicates that, as announced in the Official Journal, it was granted legal personality on  April  as a trade union. It adds that it held an extraordinary general assembly on  March  with a view to amending its statutes and that the quorum voted unanimously to amend article  as follows:  Membership of the Trade Union Association of Nursing Professionals, Technicians and Aides of El Salvador is open to persons with diplomas in nursing, nursing technologists, professional nurses, nursing technicians and nurses' aides who are duly registered with the Nursing Profession Board of Supervisors of the Higher Health Council and who provide services in any part of the territory of the Republic of El Salvador, whether in public, private or official autonomous institutions' 
.The complainant organization indicates that, in a written communication to the Ministry of Labour and Social Insurance dated  March , it requested that the abovementioned article be amended in the statutes to allow it to affiliate both public and private sector workers.
.On  March , the representatives of the complainant organization, together with its secretary for disputes and a lawyer from the Human Rights Institute of Jos Simen Caas Central American University, acting as an observer, met with the director of the collective labour rights section of the Ministry of Labour. The complainant organization indicates that the director informed it on that occasion that the statutes could not be amended as proposed because the same trade union could not affiliate members from both the private and the public sectors.
.On  April , the same representatives and the persons accompanying them met with the legal adviser of the Ministry of Labour and Social Insurance. On that occasion, the complainant organization received confirmation that the statutes could not be amended as requested because section  of the Civil Service Law stipulates that:  for the purposes of the law,  trade union' shall refer to any permanent association of public servants working for the same public administration institution'  meaning that it was not possible to mix public sector and private sector workers in the trade union association.
.The complainant organization concludes by indicating that, to date, the matter of the denial or approval of the amendment to article  of the statutes has not been formally resolved, as it has received no written communication on the subject. The Ministry legal adviser promised to provide a denial within  days, but the only indication received is that the matter continues to be investigated with a view to providing the right response.
.In its communication dated  October , the Government confirms that, in resolution No. / of  March , the Ministry of Labour and Social Insurance granted legal personality to the SIGPTEES, which was established as a trade union under the provisions of section  of the Labour Code.
.The Government indicates that the request presented on  March  to the Ministry of Labour and Social Insurance to amend article  of the statutes is inadmissible because trade unions cannot affiliate workers from both the private and the public sectors, given that section  of the Civil Service Law stipulates that:  for the purposes of the law,  trade union' shall refer to any permanent association of at least  public servants working for the same public administration institution, for the study, improvement and protection of their respective common economic and social interests' 
.The Government emphasizes that there is a clear legal impediment to the constitution of mixed trade unions, or trade unions made up of public and private sector workers, given that section  mentioned above clearly stipulates that trade unions of public servants must be composed of employees working  for the same public administration institution'  The Government adds that, in El Salvador, the exercise of labour rights is the remit of various institutions: in the case of private sector workers, the Ministry of Labour and Social Insurance; in that of public sector employees, the Civil Service Tribunal. This is because there are substantial differences between public and private sector trade unions, for example with regard to: (i) the competent authority in the event of a collective labour dispute, which is the Civil Service Tribunal for the public sector, by virtue ofsections '  of the Civil Service Law, and the Ministry of Labour and Social Insurance for the private sector, by virtue of sections '  of the Labour Code; (ii) article , paragraph , of the Constitution, which prohibits the right to strike in the public sector ( Strikes by public and municipal workers are prohibited, as is collective abandonment of duty  ?; and (iii) collective work agreements, which in the public sector are limited in ways that do not apply to the private sector: unlike private sector agreements, public sector collective agreements involve the Finance Ministry. In addition, article  of the Constitution establishes that  the public interest shall take precedence over private interests'  which is why there are limits to the exercise of freedom of association in the public sector.
.After referring to the principles of the supervisory bodies in respect of the application of Convention No.  to both public and private sector workers, the Government indicates that: () it is firmly committed to upholding the principles of Convention No.  and has made efforts to that end, even though the existing legal order does not allow it to comply with certain of the Convention s provisions, owing to the impossibility to constitute trade unions of civil servants working in different public institutions; and () work is moving forward on an amendment to the Civil Service Law for submission to the legislative body. In addition, since article  of the Constitution was amended in , it has been recognized that civil servants, public employees and municipal employees have the right to associate freely in the defence of their respective interests, forming professional associations or trade unions, it being nevertheless prohibited for such trade unions to affiliate private sector workers for the purposes of making up mixed trade unions.
.The Government asserts that, without breaking with the country s institutional system, the approach adopted by the Ministry of Labour and Social Insurance is in compliance with that prescribed by Convention No. . Likewise, it can be concluded that as concerns the SIGPTEES, no action has been taken that infringes on the freedom of association of the public and private sectors, nor has the right to form professional associations enshrined in Article  of Convention No.  has been violated.
.The Government nonetheless goes on to say that, while it is true that article , paragraph , of the Constitution recognizes the right of  private employers and workers, without distinction of nationality, sex, race, creed or political beliefs and no matter what their activity or the nature of their work, to associate freely for the defence of their respective interests by establishing professional associations and trade unions'  and stipulates that the  same right shall be enjoyed by workers employed by autonomous official institutions, public servants and employees and municipal employees'  that right must be exercised within the legal provisions governing it, namely section  of the Public Service Law, and that it is not legally possible to apply two legal texts simultaneously to one professional association (the Civil Service Law and the Labour Code).
.The Committee observes that the complainant organization in the present case alleges limits to the right to draw up its statutes and to affiliate nursing staff from both the private and the public sectors.
.The Committee takes note that, according to the complainant organization: (i) on  March , an extraordinary general assembly convened to amend the statutes and that the quorum voted unanimously to amend article ; (ii) in a written communication to the Ministry of Labour and Social Insurance dated  March , the trade union requested that the abovementioned article be amended in the statues to allow it to affiliate workers from both the public and the private sectors; (iii) on two occasions, the Ministry of Labour informed the trade union that the amendments to the statutes could not be given effect because one trade union could not affiliate both public and private workers; and (iv) to date, the matter of the denial or approval of the amendment to article  of the statutes has not been formally resolved, as there has",1,2010,El Salvador
108,"been no written communication on the subject.
.The Committee takes note of the Government s statements, according to which: (i) the request presented on  March  to the Ministry of Labour and Social Insurance to amend article  of the statutes is inadmissible because, under the provisions of section  of the Civil Service Law, trade unions cannot affiliate workers from both the private and the public sectors; (ii) there is a clear legal impediment to the establishment of mixed trade unions; (iii) this is because there are substantial differences between trade unions from the private sector and trade unions from the public sector; (iv) work is being done on a proposed reform of the Civil Service Law for submission to the legislative body; (v) since article  of the Constitution was amended in , it has been recognized that civil servants, public employees and municipal employees have the right to associate freely in the defence of their respective interests, forming professional associations or trade unions, it being nevertheless prohibited for such trade unions to affiliate private sector workers for the purposes of making up mixed trade unions; (vi) while it is true that article , paragraph  of the Constitution recognizes the right of private employers and workers to associate freely in the defence of their respective interests, forming professional associations or trade unions, there exists a clear legal impediment to the establishment of mixed trade unions, meaning trade unions made up of public and private sector workers, so long as section  of the Civil Service Law clearly stipulates that trade unions of public servants must be made up of employees working  for the same public administration institution'  and (vii) without breaking with the country s institutional system, the approach of the Ministry of Labour and Social Insurance is in compliance with that prescribed in Convention No. .
.The Committee concludes that the legislation as it currently stands does not allow a trade union to affiliate both public sector and private sector workers. Likewise, it can be deduced from the Government s response that there are technical problems, given that the exercise of labour rights (constitution of trade unions, system for collective disputes and collective work agreements, right to strike, which is prohibited in the public sector, etc.) is regulated by different laws (the Labour Code and the Civil Service Law) and by different institutions: in the case of private workers, the Ministry of Labour and Social Insurance, and in the case of public employees, the Civil Service Court. In the Committee s view, the demand of the SIGPTEES to be permitted to affiliate nursing professionals, technicians and aides from both the private and the public sectors is perfectly legitimate, and it recalls that, with regard to restrictions limiting all public servants to membership of unions confined to that category of workers, it is acceptable for first-level organizations of public servants to be limited to that category of workers on condition that their organizations are not also restricted to employees of any particular ministry, department or service, and that the first-level organizations may freely join the federations and confederations of their own choosing [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, para. ].
.The Committee notes with interest that the Government states that it firmly intends to comply with the principles of Convention No.  in view of the legal impossibility to constitute mixed trade unions of private and public sector workers, and that it is working on a draft reform of the Civil Service Law for submission to the legislative body. The Committee asks the Government, in consultation with the most representative workers' and employers' organizations, to accelerate the procedure for amending the legislation, ensuring that it fully guarantees the respect of the freedom of association principles for civil servants, and expresses the firm hope that in the very near future the SIGPTEES will be able to modify its statutes in order to represent nursing professionals, technicians and aides from not just the private but also the public sector. The Committee asks the Government to keep it informed of the status of that reform and, in the meantime, to allow the trade union in practice to represent nursing professionals, technicians and aides from the private and the public sectors.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee notes with interest that the Government states that it firmly intends to comply with the principles of Convention No. , in view of the legal impossibility to constitute mixed trade unions of private and public sector workers, and that it is working on a draft reform of the Civil Service Law for submission to the legislative body.

109,".The complaints are contained in communications of May  from the Trade Union of Salvadorian Public Transport Workers (STITCPAS), the Trade Union of Employees and Workers of the Municipality of Mejicanos (SETRAMME), the Trade Union of Workers of the Municipality of Nejapa (ASITAMUNE) and the Trade Union of Schoolteachers with Community Participation (SIMEDUCO).
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  November .
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  May , STITCPAS claims that, according to a notarized record issued on  February  in San Salvador, STITCPAS was established as an industrial trade union in the presence of  founding members who endorsed and approved the record along with the  articles of the trade union s by-laws. On  February , the union submitted an application for legal personality to the Ministry of Labour and Social Security together with a list of the founding members.
.According to STITCPAS, on  February , Mr Juan Uclides Hernndez, Mr Isaac Ernesto Treminio Orellana, Mr Luis Alonso Mndez Lovo and Mr Luis Alonso Baires Ramrez were dismissed on the grounds that their services were no longer required, when in fact they were dismissed for establishing the trade union, which runs counter to article  of the Constitution of the Republic, human rights treaties, the ILO Constitution, and section  of the Labour Code, as all these workers are founding members of the union. The workers requested the Ministry of Labour and Social Security to carry out an inspection to ascertain the facts but their request went unanswered.
.On  March , the Ministry of Labour and Social Security requested the trade union to provide the exact address of the companies  FBF'   Violeta' and  Manolo'  The same day, the trade union sent a written reply containing the information requested.
.In a telephone call made on  March , the head of the National Department for Social Organizations of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security requested the trade union to prove the employment status of a number of workers who were members of the new trade union. The trade union representative replied that he could only provide the daily rosters for workers on the eastern routes. The head of the National Department for Social Organizations indicated that this information was sufficient to establish that there was an employment relationship between the workers and the employer.
.On  April , the trade union sent a written reply containing proof of the employment relationship in the form of: the daily roster of the workers on the eastern routes as issued by Mr Ernesto Anzora, the manager responsible for the eastern routes; and a sworn statement by Mr Rosember Guardado Rodrguez, Mr Santos Miguel Crespn and Mr Luis Alonso Baires, together with various testimonies, as the workers never signed an employment contract or received social security benefits. However, despite having submitted the aforementioned documentary evidence and testimonies in order to confirm the employment status of another  workers, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security on  April  saw fit to deny legal personality to the trade union, as reflected in decision /, which, in its third preambular paragraph states: ' .. that pursuant to the provisions laid down in section , paragraph (), of the Labour Code, according to which a minimum of  members is required to establish a trade union and enable it to operate, a requirement that was not met in this case, given that these formalities have served to confirm the employment status of only  of the workers who participated in the establishment of the trade union, which may be deduced from the aforementioned facts and numbered provisions, it is not possible for the Ministry of Labour and Social Security to grant legal personality to the trade union'  However, STITCPAS maintains that  workers were founding members of the trade union.
.In its communication of  May , SETRAMME claims that on  June  an unscheduled inspection was carried out on the premises of the Mejicanos Municipal Authority by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, during which it was noted that the Municipality of Mejicanos, of which the Mayor is the legal representative, had committed  contraventions under section  of the Labour Code for not having signed an extension of the individual employment contracts of the following workers: Jos Israel Menjvar Guardado, Johny Alexander Garca, Marcial Alvarado Herrera, Santos Erasmo Garca Lpez, Guillermo Antonio Lpez Carranza, Carmen Elena Hernndez Escobar, Jos Modesto Crdova Murillo, Reyna Vsquez Hernndez, Jorge Humberto Lpez Molina, Julin Hernndez Morales and Domingo Sorto Hernndez. These individuals, who on that date were members of the Municipal Workers' Association (ATRAM), were threatened with dismissal by the municipal government if they did not leave the trade union. A time limit of ten working days was set for the contraventions committed under section  of the Labour Code to be remedied, but the Municipality of Mejicanos failed to act on the Ministry s recommendation.
.On  September , the Ministry of Labour and Social Security carried out a second inspection on the premises of the Mejicanos Municipal Authority to ascertain whether the contraventions noted during the previous inspection had been remedied. The second inspection had a negative outcome as the Municipality of Mejicanos had failed to rectify the contraventions of section  of the Labour Code which it had committed by not signing the extension of the individual employment contracts of the  workers. A management representative stated that:  every possible measure is being taken to transfer those workers to other posts pursuant to the Municipal Administrative Careers Act'  As a result of the municipal government s threats of dismissal, several members of ATRAM left the association.
.On  July , SETRAMME was established as a trade union of public servants in the presence of  founding members who provide services for the Municipality of Mejicanos.
.Pending the decision of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security of the Republic of El Salvador allowing ATRAM to become a trade union of public servants, on  September , some members of ATRAM approached the Labour Rights Centre of the Central American University s Human Rights Institute to call on the staff of that institution to lodge a complaint with the labour inspectorate regarding unlawful acts against both union members and the members of the union s executive committee. The allegations relate specifically to the following points:' the establishment of two payrolls, the first of which was signed on  August  and the second on  August . The second reveals a deduction of between US$ and US$ from union members' wages, including those of executive committee members on days when it convened;' threats of dismissal against organized workers, the executive committee, and in particular against Mr Carlos Enrique Salinas, made by the head of the municipal government and the head of the municipal department for the environment;' the fact that since September , staff employed by the Municipality of Mejicanos have not received social security certificates for the month of September;' the five-month delay in payments from the Pension Funds Administrator for the months of May, June, July, August and September ;' delays in paying administrative staff;' harassment and arbitrary transfers of field staff, especially members of ATRAM and its executive committee;' threats and workplace harassment directed at all Municipality of Mejicanos staff by the head of the municipal government, the head of the municipal department for the environment, the head of the municipal department for environmental sanitation and the overall supervisor, stating that if they supported the trade union in its protest action in support of legal entitlements, they would be dismissed;' non-payment of group life insurance, which is administered by a central insurance body; and' the Mejicanos municipal government s refusal to recognize ATRAM as an organization.
.ATRAM and SETRAMME requested the Mayor of the Municipality of Mejicanos and the Municipal Council, firstly, to revoke the decision taken by the Municipal Council on  August , whereby it suspended Thursday as a weekly rest day for ATRAM members until it could provide the municipal authorities with proof of legal personality, despite the fact that ATRAM had unsuccessfully applied for legal personality on several occasions; and, secondly, to cancel any time off granted in this context by any public servant during the period ' . SETRAMME explains that Thursday is not a rest day for union members but is the day set aside for the activities of ATRAM and the new trade union, SETRAMME.
.On  September , ATRAM lodged a complaint with the labour inspectorate regarding unlawful acts against union members, namely, two administrative penalties comprising deductions from wages not provided for under the Municipal Administrative Careers Act of the Republic of El Salvador, for having missed",1,2010,El Salvador
110,"the deadline for submitting social security certificates and delayed payments from the Pension Funds Administrator. On  September , the Ministry of Labour and Social Security granted SETRAMME legal personality. That same month, the trade union lodged a complaint with the labour inspectorate regarding unlawful acts against union officials Mr Julio Trejo Beltrn, Mr Franklin Samuel Parada Prez and Mr Carlos David Martnez, which included an administrative penalty consisting in a deduction from wages not provided for under the Municipal Administrative Careers Act of the Republic of El Salvador while, in addition, all union members and other workers were obliged to sign two payrolls. One payroll reflected the deduction while the other showed their full wages without deductions. Furthermore, they are currently receiving their social security certificates between ten and  days after the deadline. The trade union also complained of the constant harassment of workers in the workplace at the hands of their immediate superiors, the head of the municipal department for the environment, the head of the municipal department for environmental sanitation and the overall supervisor, intended to force the workers to resign.
.In October , a complaint was filed regarding unlawful acts against union member Mr Jos Mauricio Andrade, who in August had been forced to sign two payrolls. It was then that he realized that unlawful deductions were being made from the other workers' wages by means of the two payrolls, one of which reflected the deduction while the other showed their full wages without deductions.
.SETRAMME alleges that to date no inspector has been sent by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security to investigate the situation. In October , the trade union was told that the Ministry of Labour and Social Security was not competent to carry out such an inspection, as those workers were covered by the Municipal Administrative Careers Act.
.In October , nine union officials filed a complaint against the Municipality of Mejicanos in the form of a request for an inspection, with the Directorate-General of Inspections of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, stating that, since , the administration had failed to provide the members of ATRAM and other employees of the Municipality of Mejicanos with the means necessary to do their work and protect their health, and that their working conditions were insalubrious. Furthermore, they complained of constant harassment in the workplace at the hands of their immediate supervisors, the head of the municipal department for the environment, the head of the municipal department for environmental sanitation and high-ranking officials, intended to force the workers to resign.
.In its communication of  May , ASITAMUNE alleges that, on  July , the workers of the Municipality of Nejapa met in order to establish the Trade Union of Workers of the Municipality of Nejapa (ASITAMUNE) and duly submitted the relevant documents to the Ministry of Labour and Social Security. As part of the process of granting legal personality, the Ministry sent an official letter to the Nejapa Municipal Council in order to verify the employment status of the union s founding members, as provided for under the Civil Service Act, the stated aim of which is to regulate relations between the State or municipalities and public servants, to offer them protection and employment stability, to ensure the effectiveness of public institutions, and to ensure that the public administration is based on the recruitment and promotion of staff by merit.
.ASITAMUNE also claims that, on  July , the municipality dismissed several founding members of the trade union, including Mr Manfredo Garca Nerio, Ms Deisy Yanira Meja Velsquez and Mr Jos Lino Mendoza Arias, who are members of the union s executive committee, which in fact is the main reason why they cannot be dismissed. This was clearly retaliation for the officials having incited the workers to exercise their constitutional right to freedom of association in the defence of their rights. They were dismissed after taking the preliminary steps towards establishing the trade union before it was legally registered. On  October , the Ministry of Labour and Social Security acknowledged that, when it dismissed the three workers, the trade union was already in the process of being registered.
.According to the municipality, the legal and constitutional protection granted to union officials does not apply in the case of employees of the Municipality of Nejapa because their employment conditions are governed by a special law, distinct from the Labour Code, which is the Municipal Administrative Careers Act. This claim is inaccurate, as it is the Constitution itself that protects union officials. The Ministry of Labour and Social Security has neglected its duties by failing to carry out inspections or take steps to verify the violations allegedly perpetrated by the municipality. The administration claims that it is not competent to carry out inspections within decentralized bodies such as municipalities, and despite the workers' request for the Attorney-General s Office to intervene, since September , it has neither acted on the request nor taken steps to ensure that due process of law is followed.
.In its communication of  May , SIMEDUCO, a trade union established on  September , alleges that, on  December , Mr Amado de Jess Ramos Prieto, the trade union relations secretary, a Nahuatl language teacher in the Nahuatl-speaking areas of the indigenous Izalcos region and a trade union official, was dismissed. Since  April , he had worked for the non-governmental organization (NGO)  Crculo Solidario de El Salvador' 
.In the light of this unfair dismissal, the trade union requested and secured from the Directorate-General of Inspections of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security an unscheduled inspection of the premises of the non-governmental organization in question, which found that Mr Amado de Jess Ramos Prieto, owing to his position as a trade union official, had been the object of labour discrimination when an arbitrary decision was taken not to renew his contract for another year. The inspection confirmed the contraventions reported by the worker and led to a report ordering the organization to remedy the contraventions or face a fine. However, even following a second inspection and a subsequent conciliation hearing, the worker was not reinstated.
.On  December , Mr Amado de Jess Ramos Prieto received a memorandum from his employer notifying him of his dismissal with effect from  December , which prompted him to apply to the Attorney-General s Office for the purpose of instituting legal proceedings against the NGO  Crculo Solidario de El Salvador' on the grounds of unfair dismissal by his employer; these proceedings are still ongoing.
.In its communication of  November , the Government, with regard to the case brought by STITCPAS, states that sections  and  of the Labour Code provide that a minimum of  members is required in order to establish a trade union and that in order for it to exist legally, it must obtain legal personality, which is granted following the approval of the union s by-laws and confirmation of the employment status of the  founding members.
.The trade union, on applying for legal personality from the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, submitted a copy of the minutes of the meeting at which the trade union was established by  founding members, as well as two copies of the union s by-laws and a certified copy of the minutes of the meeting at which they were approved. In this context, on  February , the Ministry of Labour and Social Security ordered the relevant letters to be sent to the employers, requesting them to confirm the employment status of the union s  founding members. Each one of the employers received an official notification of the order with the exception of three that were not notified owing to the inaccuracy of the address provided. The trade union was informed of the situation and was asked to provide the correct addresses of the employers in order to expedite its application for legal personality.
.The Government states that the replies fell into three categories: (a) employers that confirmed the employment status of  of the union s founding members; (b) employers that failed to confirm the employment status of  of the union s founding members; and (c) employers that did not reply at all. This means that the employment status of only  of the union s founding members is legally recognized (section  of the Labour Code).
.With regard to case (b) employers that failed to confirm the employment status of  of the union s founding members, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security ordered inspections to be carried out, which led to confirmation of the employment status of three of the  founding members in question. It should be noted that the  inspections'  although not provided for in such cases by the Labour Code or the Act on the structure and functions of the labour and social security sector, have proved to be an essential tool in establishing the employment status of union members, which is a",0,2010,El Salvador
111,"legal requirement that must be fulfilled before trade unions can be granted legal personality.
.The employment of  of the  founding members of STITCPAS has thus been confirmed. However, the fact remains that a minimum of  members with confirmed employment status is required for the union to obtain legal personality, according to section  of the Labour Code.
.With regard to the trade union s arguments cited above, the submission of a record of attendance for one working day ( February ) is not sufficient to allow an employment relationship to be established by presumption, given that, for such a presumption to be valid, proof is required that one person provides a service to another for more than two consecutive working days, as stipulated in section  of the Labour Code.
.With regard to the allegations made by the interested party (the refusal to grant legal personality to STITCPAS without receiving the testimonies that otherwise would have confirmed the employment status of a number of the union s founding members), the Ministry of Labour and Social Security has revoked its previous decision to refuse legal personality to the trade union and has requested the testimonial evidence offered by STITCPAS.
.With regard to the trade union s allegations concerning the failure to carry out the necessary inspections following the dismissal of Mr Juan Uclides Hernndez, Mr Isaac Ernesto Treminio Orellana, Mr Luis Alonso Mndez Lovo and Mr Luis Alonso Baires Ramrez, the Directorate-General of Inspections of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security has ordered the relevant inspections, which are currently ongoing.
.With regard to the complaint lodged by SETRAMME, the Government notes that municipal labour relations are governed by section  of the Municipal Administrative Careers Act, while the bodies responsible for implementing it in the interests of settling any internal labour disputes arising within the municipal administration are the municipal commissions for administrative careers, as stipulated in section  of the Municipal Administrative Careers Act. Moreover, section , paragraph , of the Labour Code states that:  The Code is not applicable in cases where the relationship between the State, municipalities, autonomous or semi-autonomous official institutions, with their employees is of a public nature, as in the case of appointments to posts specified in the Wages Act as dependent on the General Fund or Special Fund of the institution in question or included in the municipal budget, or when the relationship originates from a contract for the provision of technical or professional services'  In the light of this, the Government explains that, as the SETRAMME case concerns employees who were appointed to their post, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security declined to carry out unscheduled inspections requested by SETRAMME members.
.The Ministry of Labour and Social Security is competent in cases involving municipal public servants employed under temporary or casual contracts for educational, consultative, advisory and training purposes among others, as set out in section , paragraph , of the Municipal Administrative Careers Act; this stipulates that employment relationships involving such temporary workers are governed by the Labour Code. The Ministry is therefore only competent to hear cases involving alleged violations of labour rights affecting temporary workers hired by municipalities; cases involving municipal public servants who are part of the municipal administrative careers system come under the terms of the Municipal Administrative Careers Act, which establishes the relevant procedures and designates the authorities competent to settle internal disputes arising from an employment relationship.
.With regard to the workers' allegations concerning unlawful acts committed by the Mejicanos municipal government (unlawful deductions from wages of between US$ and US$, threats of dismissal against the members of SETRAMME s executive committee, failure to provide them with the relevant social security certificates, delayed payments from the Pension Funds Administrator in May, June, July, August and September , delay in paying administrative staff, harassment and arbitrary transfers of field staff, threats and harassment directed against all staff by the heads of various municipal departments, non-payment of group life insurance, and refusal to recognize ATRAM, the Government reiterates that it is the Municipal Administrative Careers Act that regulates municipal labour relations and that the municipal commissions for administrative careers are the authority responsible for settling any internal disputes arising within the municipal administration, as stipulated in section , paragraph , of the Act. The Ministry of Labour and Social Security is therefore not competent to deal with applications from workers of the Municipality of Mejicanos. The Government nevertheless maintains that the municipal workers  are not left without legal protection or in a legal limbo because there is no law to protect them' as they claim; it is rather that the complainant organizations failed to direct their requests to the competent authority, which is the Mejicanos municipal commission for administrative careers.Complaint concerning the violation of the right to freedom of association of ASITAMUNE officials
.With regard to the case brought by ASITAMUNE concerning the dismissal of the municipal employees and union officials Mr Manfredo Garca Nerio, Ms Deisy Yanira Meja Velsquez and Mr Jos Lino Mendoza Arias, the Government notes that this case also relates to an employment relationship arising from an administrative act in the form of an  appointment'  In this case, the competent authority is the Nejapa municipal commission for administrative careers, as stipulated in section  of the Municipal Administrative Careers Act and section  of the Labour Code. That being the case, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security was unable to carry out the labour inspection requested by the trade union, for the reasons cited in the previous case involving SETRAMME.
.Moreover, between November and December , the union officials referred their case to the Attorney-General s Office in order for it to be settled in court. The Ministry of Labour and Social Security accordingly requested information on the steps taken by the Attorney-General s Office. The Ministry will inform the Committee of these once it has received a reply.
.These considerations notwithstanding, the Salvadorian State acknowledges that the Municipality of Nejapa has adversely affected the exercise of the right to freedom of association by abolishing the posts of Mr Manfredo Garca Nerio, Ms Deisy Yanira Meja Velsquez and Mr Jos Lino Mendoza Arias, without placing them in posts of a similar or higher grade in accordance with section  of the Municipal Administrative Careers Act, offering instead to compensate them for the loss of their posts, which constitutes a violation of the right to adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment set out in article , paragraph , of the Constitution of the Republic and Article  of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ). In view of this and in accordance with the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), steps will be taken to raise awareness of both the protection given to the right to freedom of association and the special protection given to trade union officials. It is important to note that the full exercise of the right to freedom of association is a work in progress in the country owing to the scant protection currently given to labour rights and the lack of cooperation between workers and employers in ensuring the protection of those rights. With its lead role in the public labour administration, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security is making every effort to establish and consolidate a State that is genuinely governed by the rule of law.
.With regard to the case brought by SIMEDUCO concerning the dismissal of the trade union official Mr Amado de Jess Ramos Prieto, the Government notes that on  March , Mr Jess Ramos Prieto visited the offices of the Directorate-General of Inspections of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security and requested an inspection in order to confirm his employment status. The request was granted and a special inspection was carried out on  March , followed by a second inspection on  April , which revealed that the NGO  Crculo Solidario de El Salvador'  where Mr Ramos Prieto was employed, had not remedied the contravention noted during the initial inspection. As a result, the case was referred to the Department for Industry, Commerce and Services Inspections for the appropriate fine to be imposed. At that stage, the special representative of the NGO  Crculo Solidario de El Salvador' contested the special inspection, describing it as inaccurate and arguing that the case had been detrimental to the foundation as it was forced to pay wage arrears attributed to the employer without any legal basis. The Department for Industry, Commerce and Services Inspections determined that line of argument to be invalid and pointed out that, in accordance with article , paragraph , of the Constitution of the Republic and section , paragraph , of the Labour Code, trade union officials cannot be dismissed, transferred or given less favourable employment conditions. Furthermore,",-1,2010,El Salvador
112,"it determined that the foundation had violated section , paragraph , of the Labour Code by dismissing Mr Amado de Jess Ramos Prieto without due process and by owing him wage arrears which had arisen from factors attributable to the employer. The Ministry is currently considering the matter of a fine.
.Mr Ramos Prieto is fully entitled to bring his case before a court, and accordingly visited the offices of the Attorney-General on  January  in search of a labour attorney to represent him. On  February , he referred his case to the Santa Tecla labour court in the Department of La Libertad in order to institute the relevant proceedings, which are ongoing.
.However, on  May  an out-of-court settlement was reached (a copy of which is provided by the Government) whereby Mr Amado de Jess Ramos Prieto receives from the NGO  Crculo Solidario de El Salvador' the sum of US$, in wage arrears attributable to the employer, which fulfils his legal entitlement to protection from dismissal during the period of his election and term of office as a trade union official; and the sum of US$. in compensation. In the record of the settlement, Mr Amado de Jess Ramos Prieto is declared free of any further liability that might arise from the employment relationship and the NGO  Crculo Solidario de El Salvador' is similarly granted a full and final settlement. Therefore, while Mr Amado de Jess Ramos Prieto s rights were violated by the organization he worked for, the fact remains that the State responded in the appropriate way through the relevant institutions.
.With regard to the alleged dismissal of four STITCPAS officials (Mr Juan Uclides Hernndez, Mr Isaac Ernesto Treminio Orellana, Mr Luis Alonso Mndez Lovo and Mr Luis Alonso Baires Ramrez) on  February  following the trade union s establishment by  workers on  February of the same year ( being the legal minimum), the Committee notes that the labour inspectorate is currently carrying out inspections, requests the Government to inform it of the outcome of those inspections and, should the anti-union dismissal of the four officials be proven, to take measures to reinstate them without loss of pay or statutory benefits. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any developments in this regard.
.The Committee also takes note of the allegation made by STITCPAS that, despite having submitted proof of the employment status of  of its members with various transport companies, as requested by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security (given that, according to STITCPAS, they are genuine workers despite not having an employment contract or receiving social security benefits), the Ministry subsequently refused to grant legal personality to STITCPAS as it could confirm the employment status of only  of the workers (instead of the legal minimum of ).
.The Committee takes note of the Government s statements in which it confirms that, in the course of the registration procedure, during which a number of employers opted not to divulge the employment status of some union members, the employment status of  of the  founding members of STITCPAS was confirmed, although the fact remains that a minimum of  members with confirmed employment status is required in order for a trade union to obtain legal personality, under the terms of section  of the Labour Code. With regard to the trade union s argument that it had submitted a record of attendance for one working day ( February ), this was not sufficient to prove the existence of an employment relationship by presumption, given that, for such a presumption to be valid, proof is required that one person provides a service to another for more than two consecutive working days, as stipulated in section  of the Labour Code. Nevertheless, the Committee welcomes the fact that, in the light of the complaint lodged with the Committee (regarding the refusal to grant legal personality to STITCPAS without having received the testimonies that otherwise would have confirmed the employment status of a number of the union s founding members), the Ministry of Labour and Social Security has revoked its previous decision to refuse legal personality to the trade union and has requested the testimonial evidence offered by STITCPAS. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any developments in this regard.
.With regard to SETRAMME s complaint, the Committee takes note of the allegations regarding: acts of anti-union discrimination against its officials and members of the previous workers' association ATRAM; threats of dismissal; the refusal to extend the contracts of  members of ATRAM after the municipal government threatened them with dismissal if they did not leave the trade union, which resulted in the departure of several members from ATRAM; the refusal to recognize ATRAM; unlawful financial penalties, including deductions from the wages of officials and other members of SETRAMME; considering Thursday to be a rest day for workers who are members of ATRAM and SETRAMME when it is in fact the day set aside for the organizations' activities; as well as other violations of labour laws and the Ministry of Labour and Social Security s failure to carry out the inspections requested by the trade union.
.The Committee takes note of the Government s statements according to which: () municipal labour relations are governed by section  of the Municipal Administrative Careers Act, and the bodies responsible for implementing the Act in the interests of settling any internal labour disputes arising within the municipal administration are the municipal commissions for administrative careers, as stipulated in section  of the Municipal Administrative Careers Act, which establishes the relevant procedures and designates the authorities competent to settle internal disputes arising from a given employment relationship. Section , paragraph , of the Labour Code states that:  The Code is not applicable in cases where the relationship between the State, municipalities and autonomous or semi-autonomous official institutions and their officials is of a public nature, as in the case of appointment to a post specified in the Wages Act as dependent on the General Fund or Special Fund of the institution in question or included in the municipal budget, or when the relationship originates from a contract for the provision of technical or professional services'  In the light of this, the Government explains that, as the SETRAMME case concerns employees who were appointed to their posts, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security declined to carry out the unscheduled inspections requested by SETRAMME members; () the Ministry of Labour and Social Security is only competent in cases involving public servants employed under temporary or casual contracts for educational, consultative/advisory and training purposes, among others, as stipulated in section , paragraph , of the Municipal Administrative Careers Act, which stipulates that employment relationships involving such temporary workers are governed by the Labour Code; and () with regard to the workers' allegations concerning unlawful acts (including unlawful deductions from wages of between US$ and US$, threats of dismissal made against the members of SETRAMME s executive committee, failure to provide them with the relevant social security certificates, delayed payments from the Pension Funds Administrator in May, June, July, August and September , delay in paying administrative staff, harassment and arbitrary transfers of field staff, threats and harassment directed against all staff by the heads of various municipal departments, non-payment of group life insurance, and refusal to recognize ATRAM), the Government reiterates that it is the Municipal Administrative Careers Act that regulates municipal labour relations and that the municipal commissions for administrative careers (and not the Ministry of Labour and Social Security) are the authorities responsible for settling any internal disputes arising within the municipal administration, as stipulated in section , paragraph , of the Act. Nonetheless, the municipal workers  are not left without legal protection or in a legal limbo'  rather, the complainant organizations failed to direct their requests to the competent authority, which is the Mejicanos municipal commission for administrative careers.
.The Committee draws attention to the number and seriousness of these allegations which, should they prove to be founded, would constitute serious violations of ILO Conventions Nos  and . Noting the Government s insistence that the authority competent to hear the allegations in the present case is not, contrary to SETRAMME s claim, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security but rather the Mejicanos municipal commission for administrative careers, the Committee invites SETRAMME to formally present its allegations to the municipal commission, and requests SETRAMME and the Government to inform it of the outcome of this process. The Committee notes, however, that in another part of its reply, the Government states that:  the full exercise of the right to freedom of association is a work in progress in the country owing to the scant protection currently given to labour rights and the lack of cooperation between workers and employers in ensuring the protection of those rights'  The Committee considers that various aspects of the present case",0,2010,El Salvador
113,"bear testament to the fragility and ineffectiveness of the framework protecting union rights at the municipal level, and requests the Government to hold consultations without delay with the most representative organizations of workers and employers in order to examine and improve the situation so as to afford adequate protection to union rights in the municipal sector, and to keep it informed of any developments in this regard.
.However, the Committee wishes to point out that, with regard to one of the allegations made by SETRAMME, concerning the refusal to extend the contracts of  members of ATRAM who had previously been threatened with dismissal by the municipal government if they did not leave the union (the Ministry of Labour and Social Security was the competent authority as the case involved temporary workers), SETRAMME claims that the Municipality of Mejicanos did not respect the time frame established by the labour inspectorate for rectifying the alleged contraventions. The Committee considers that the situation of workers under temporary contracts in the Municipality once again bears testament to the shortcomings of the framework protecting trade union rights at the municipal level. The Committee urges the Government to take steps to give effect to the decisions of the labour inspectorate to extend the employment contracts of the  ATRAM members and to keep it informed of any developments in this regard.
.With regard to the allegation concerning the dismissal of the union officials Mr Manfredo Garca Nerio, Ms Deisy Yanira Meja Velsquez and Mr Jos Lino Mendoza Arias on  July  following the establishment of ASITAMUNE ' and specifically, according to the allegations, for establishing the union and for having encouraged workers to exercise their constitutional right to freedom of association ' the Committee takes note of the Government s statements according to which: () the Ministry of Labour and Social Security was unable to carry out the inspection requested by ASITAMUNE as it is not competent in such matters, since municipal labour relations are regulated by the Municipal Administrative Careers Act and are the responsibility of the municipal commissions for administrative careers, in this case, the Nejapa municipal commission for administrative careers, which is responsible for resolving internal disputes arising from an employment relationship; () the trade union referred the case to the Attorney-General s Office in order for it to be settled in court, and requests to be kept informed by the latter; () the Municipality of Nejapa has adversely affected the exercise of the right to freedom of association by abolishing the posts of the three union officials without placing them in posts of a similar or higher grade in accordance with section  of the Municipal Administrative Careers Act, offering instead to compensate them for the abolition of their posts, which constitutes a violation of the right to adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment as stipulated in article , paragraph , of the Constitution of the Republic and Article  of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ); () steps will be taken to raise awareness of both the protection given to the right to freedom of association and the special protection given to union officials; and () the Ministry of Labour and Social Security is making every effort to establish and consolidate a State that is genuinely governed by the rule of law.
.The Committee notes with regret that, according to the Government s reply, the Municipality of Nejapa failed to honour its obligation to ensure respect for section  of the Municipal Administrative Careers Act by abolishing the posts of the three union officials without placing them in posts of a similar or higher grade. The Committee notes that, according to the Government, the question of the dismissal of the three union officials has been referred to the Attorney-General s Office in order for it to be settled in court, and requests the Government to keep it informed of any measures adopted by that authority. The Committee requests the Government to communicate its conclusions to the Municipality of Nejapa, to draw attention to the importance the Committee attaches to the Municipality s effective implementation of section  of the Municipal Administrative Careers Act, and to reinstate the union officials without loss of pay or statutory benefits.
.With regard to the allegation concerning the dismissal on  December  of the SIMEDUCO official Mr Amado de Jess Ramos Prieto following the decision not to renew his contract owing to his status as a union official, the Committee takes note of the Government s statements according to which: () inspections were carried out on the premises of the NGO  Crculo Solidario de El Salvador' (his employer) in March and April  and revealed a breach of legislation that had not been remedied by the employer, and for which a fine is currently being considered; () the administrative authority determined that the employer s appeal was invalid, given that, in accordance with article , paragraph , of the Constitution of the Republic and section , paragraph , of the Labour Code, union officials cannot be dismissed, transferred or given less favourable employment conditions; furthermore, it determined that the foundation had violated section , paragraph , of the Labour Code by dismissing Mr Amado de Jess Ramos Prieto without due process and by owing him salary arrears attributable to the employer; () the trade union official referred his case to the Santa Tecla labour court in the Department of La Libertad in order to institute the relevant proceedings but, on  May , he concluded an out-of-court settlement under which he received from the NGO  Crculo Solidario de El Salvador' the sum of US$, in salary arrears attributable to the employer, which fulfils his legal entitlement to protection from dismissal during the period of his election and term of office as a union official; and the sum of US$. in compensation; in the record of the settlement, Mr Amado de Jess Ramos Prieto is declared free of any further liability that might arise from the employment relationship, and the NGO  Crculo Solidario de El Salvador' is similarly granted a full and final settlement. Under these circumstances, while the Committee regrets the anti-union dismissal of the union official, it notes that he reached an out-of-court settlement with his employer, thereby ending his employment relationship with the latter and forgoing the right to reinstatement guaranteed to him under national law. The Committee will therefore not pursue its examination of this allegation.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) With regard to the alleged dismissal of the four STITCPAS officials (Mr Juan Uclides Hernndez, Mr Isaac Ernesto Treminio Orellana, Mr Luis Alonso Mndez Lovo and Mr Luis Alonso Baires Ramrez) on  February  following the establishment of the trade union, the Committee notes that the labour inspectorate is carrying out inspections, and requests the Government, should the anti-union dismissal of the four union officials be proven, to take steps to reinstate them without loss of pay or statutory benefits. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.(b) With regard to the allegations concerning the refusal to grant legal personality to STITCPAS after being able to confirm the employment status of only  of its  members (the legal minimum being ), the Committee, in the context of the present complaint, welcomes the fact that the Government has revoked its decision to refuse to grant legal personality to STITCPAS in order to receive the testimonial evidence offered by STITCPAS regarding the employment status of a number of its members. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.(c) With regard to SETRAMME s allegations, the Committee invites the trade union to formally present its allegations to the Mejicanos municipal commission for administrative careers and requests SETRAMME and the Government to inform it of the outcome of these proceedings. The Committee draws attention to the number and seriousness of these allegations which, should they be confirmed, would constitute serious violations of ILO Conventions Nos  and .(d) With regard to the allegations concerning the refusal to extend the contracts of  members of ATRAM who had previously been threatened with dismissal by the Mejicanos municipal authorities if they did not leave the union, the Committee urges the Government to take steps to give effect to the decisions of the labour inspectorate to extend the employment contracts of these  workers, and to keep it informed in this regard.(e) With regard to the allegation concerning the dismissal of the union officials Mr Manfredo Garca Nerio, Ms Deisy Yanira Meja Velsquez and Mr Jos Lino Mendoza Arias on  July  following the establishment of ASITAMUNE, the Committee notes with regret that, according to the Government s reply, the Municipality of Nejapa failed to honour its obligation to ensure observance of section  of the Municipal Administrative Careers Act by abolishing the",0,2010,El Salvador
114,"posts of the three union officials without placing them in posts of a similar or higher grade. The Committee also notes that the question of the dismissal of the three union officials has been referred to the Attorney-General s Office in order for it to be settled in court, and requests the Government to keep it informed of any measures adopted by that authority. The Committee also requests the Government to communicate its conclusions to the Municipality of Nejapa, to draw attention to the importance the Committee attaches to the Municipality s effective implementation of section  of the Municipal Administrative Careers Act, and to reinstate the union officials without loss of pay or statutory benefits.(f) The Committee considers that various aspects of the present case bear testament to the fragility and ineffectiveness of the framework protecting union rights at the municipal level, and requests the Government to hold consultations without delay with the most representative organizations of workers and employers in order to examine and improve the situation.",0,2010,El Salvador
115,".The complaint is contained in a communication of the Union of Family Physicians of the Salvadoran Institute for Teachers' Welfare (SIMEFISBM) dated  March .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication of  July .
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  March , the Union of Family Physicians of the Salvadoran Institute for Teachers' Welfare (SIMEFISBM) states that, in accordance with the notarial certificate granted in San Salvador, on  June , it was constituted as an occupation-based union, in the presence of  founder members, including Dr Jos Alberto Calidonio Burgos, who works for the Salvadoran Institute for Teachers' Welfare (ISBM).
.The complainant organization adds that, in accordance with the procedure established under national law, on  September , the labour inspector appointed to deal with the case of the trade union being formed visited the premises of the ISBM and met with the Head of the Contracts and Procurement Department of the Institute. The inspector explained the reason for his visit to the Head of the department, who, in turn, stated that the  workers in question  are not employees of the Salvadoran Institute for Teachers' Welfare, given that they are contracted to provide professional services and participate in a public tender process in order to obtain contracts, in accordance with the Public Administration Procurement and Recruitment Act (LACAP)'  The trade union being formed was made aware of this act so that it might present the necessary documentation to the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare of El Salvador, in order to prove the employment relationship.
.Through a document presented to the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare, on  September , Dr Jos Alberto Calidonio Burgos, acting in his capacity as president of the provisional executive committee of the trade union being formed, made the following statements: () that the workers providing services for and on the orders of ISBM are in a legal situation known in law as  fraudulent contract or simulated contract'  quoting the corresponding jurisprudence on which his argument is based; () based on the  Principle of the primacy of reality'  it is clear that an employment relationship exists between the founder members of the trade union and the ISBM, given that  what must prevail or determine the regulations to be applied is the actual situation on the ground; such as the clear employment relationship between the contracted worker and the employer institution, where all the elements of an employment relationship are combined in an undeniable fashion: the performance of certain duties, in conditions of subordination and in exchange for a salary...thus we find ourselves before a true individual labour contract'  and () the contracts concluded with the ISBM are individual labour contracts (according to section  of the Labour Code of El Salvador) and not administrative contracts governed by the LACAP, given that the contracts of the founding members contain the requirements established by national law and jurisprudence to be considered as such, and therefore a clear employment relationship exists given that the workers provide their services subject to an established schedule, subordinate to the institution and in exchange for remuneration.
.The complainant organization states that it was decided, through ruling No. / of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare, in San Salvador, of  September , to: ' a) approve the text of the  articles making up the statutes of the trade union being formed known as the Union of Family Physicians of the Salvadoran Institute for Teachers' Welfare (SIMEFISBM), at the same time granting it the legal personality requested; (b) let the said statutes be published in the Official Journal, along with the present ruling; and (c) let said trade union be recorded in the corresponding register ...' 
.The complainant organization states that, on  November , document No. / of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare was issued ordering that the membership of the general executive committee of SIMEFISBM (which was elected on  October ) for the period beginning on  October  and ending on  June  be registered. One name on the list of members of the general executive committee was that of Dr Jos Alberto Calidonio Burgos, secretary general of SIMEFISBM. SIMEFISBM states that, even though the Ministry of Labour issued an official ruling recognizing the existence of fraudulent contracts or simulated contracts in the case of the doctors who provide services for and on the orders of ISBM, the institute continues to claim that said contracts are administrative in nature and governed by the LACAP, with those workers providing their services to said institute being obliged to participate in public calls for tender (as they have been doing for years) in order to be recruited to provide medical services for another year. The complainant organization adds that, in the light of the refusal by the institute to recognize the true legal status of the doctors and the verbal warning issued by the president of the ISBM to Doctors Carlos Mauricio Rivera and Jos Alberto Calidonio Burgos that their respective contracts would no longer be renewed, the two doctors, in their capacity as SIMEFISBM representatives, submitted a request on  November  with the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare, based on section  of the Constitution of El Salvador, for a meeting with the Minister of Labour as soon as possible, to set up a forum for dialogue with the aim of resolving the labour issues existing between the doctors and the said institute. Following this request, the respective governmental authorities failed to do enough to reconcile the parties or to mediate effectively in the dispute.
.The complainant organization states that, on  December , at the request of SIMEFISBM, negotiations began on the premises of the ISBM involving the trade union and the executive council of the ISBM, in order to prevent the definitive and arbitrary dismissal of doctors Carlos Mauricio Rivera and Jos Alberto Calidonio Burgos, an antiunion measure which poses a threat to all the rights to organise freely enjoyed by the doctors of the trade union. The aim was to convince the executive council that proceeding with the dismissal of the doctors (members of the general executive committee of the trade union) would constitute a serious violation of the Constitution, the international agreements on trade union rights and the national labour law in force, given that the Constitution and labour legislation guarantee employment stability for those doctors members of the general executive committee of SIMEFISBM (including Dr Jos Alberto Calidonio Burgos, secretary general) for the period during which they occupy official trade union positions (they also enjoy protection for up to a year after they have left their trade union posts). During said negotiations, the Office of the Attorney for the Defence of Human Rights of El Salvador was asked to attend as a mediator, together with a legal expert from the Institute of Human Rights of the Central American  Jos Simen Caas' University as an observer. The negotiations did not produce any solutions to the dispute between the parties and the only undertaking obtained from the executive council of the ISBM was that talks would continue to be held in order to resolve the dispute. However, at the time that this complaint to the ILO was drafted this undertaking had not been fulfilled, neither had the Office of the Attorney for the Defence of Human Rights of El Salvador played any role in conciliating the parties and thus resolving the dispute. This failure by the Office of the Attorney to act means that the dispute between the parties has become more serious, with the legal security of the doctors who provide their services to the ISBM being undermined.
.The complainant organization states that, on  December , a special, unscheduled inspection of the premises of the ISBM was carried out by the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare, which revealed that the contracts of the unionized doctors (including that of Dr Jos Alberto Calidonio Burgos, secretary general of the trade union, as well as those of all the other doctor who provide services at the institute) meet the requirements for individual labour contract status. Furthermore, the same inspection uncovered the fact that Dr Jos Alberto Calidonio Burgos was subjected to labour discrimination in his capacity as trade union leader when it was arbitrarily decided not to renew his contract for a further year. It was also discovered that the clause in the ISBM contract, which establishes the duration of that same contract as being a year, violates the Constitution of the Republic, more specifically, section  which establishes that the rights of the workers are inalienable. In conclusion, according to the complainant organization, the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare determined that the contracts of the doctors providing services at the ISBM fulfil",1,2010,El Salvador
116,"the requirements set out for individual labour contracts. Therefore, Dr Jos Alberto Calidonio Burgos cannot be dismissed owing to his position as a trade union leader, given that the special procedure set out for such cases in section  of the Labour Code was not followed. The ISBM was given two days to rectify its mistakes, but once the deadline passed the institute had still not complied with the Ministry of Labour s recommendation.
.The complainant organization adds that, on  January , the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare carried out a further inspection of the premises of the ISBM to check whether said institute had rectified the violations identified during the unscheduled inspections carried out on , ,  and  of November . The results of the new inspection were also negative, with the institute continuing to carry out anti-union and discriminatory acts against Dr Jos Alberto Calidonio Burgos, secretary general of SIMEFISBM. The institute arbitrarily refused to renew Dr Jos Alberto Calidonio Burgos' employment contract, leaving him unemployed as of  December . The complainant organization states that, on not being reinstated in his post, Dr Jos Alberto Calidonio Burgos, secretary general of SIMEFISBM, requested a conciliatory hearing before the Ministry of Labour (file No. /), on  January . The doctor requested the hearing with the sole aim of being reinstated in his post. The hearing was scheduled for  and  of January , but the institute yet again refused to reinstate Dr Jos Alberto Calidonio Burgos, maintaining its anti-union and discriminatory behaviour.
.The complainant organization states that, on  January , Dr Jos Alberto Calidonio Burgos, in his capacity as secretary general of SIMEFISBM (his term of office was due to end on  October ), received an official notification from the president of the ISBM stating that, as of  December , he was no longer employed by the institute, owing to the fact that he had failed to participate in the respective call for tender set out under the LACAP. This decision violates the unionized doctors' employment stability and other trade union rights, which are recognized by the Constitution of the Republic, as well as international legislation and agreements. On  January , Dr Jos Alberto Calidonio Burgos denounced the ISBM to the Office of the Superintendent of Pensions for failing to provide social benefits to the doctors providing services at said institute, such as Pension Funds Administrator payments or invalidity/old age/survivor pension contributions. To date, the Office of the Superintendent of Pensions has delayed the processing of the denunciation and finally, the Office made a verbal announcement that it would not act upon the denunciation given that the ruling issued by the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare recognizing the existence of individual employment contracts was not sufficient to initiate proceedings. On  January , Dr Jos Alberto Calidonio Burgos went to the premises of the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic in order to file labour proceedings against the IBSM for unfair dismissals. This procedure is ongoing.
.On  January , another unscheduled inspection was carried out at the premises of the IBSM, at which time it was established that: (a) an employment relationship exists between the doctors and the institute, and therefore, the LACAP does not apply; (b) based on the labour legislation, the doctors at the institute, and in particular Dr Calidonio and Dr Rivera, cannot be forced to tender for their posts, given that those posts are permanent in nature and individual employment contracts are open ended; and (c) Dr Jos Alberto Calidonio Burgos, in his capacity as a trade union leader, may not be dismissed, or subject to a worsening in his conditions of work, etc, during his term of office , and until after one year from having ceased his functions other than for just cause as previously determined by the competent authority, unless the special proceedings set out under section  of the Labour Code are brought against him before the Ministry of Labour. Therefore, it was again found that the institute had committed a violation in the form of the dismissal of Dr Jos Alberto Calidonio Burgos, a member of the general executive committee of the trade union, and it was recommended that the institute should reinstate the doctor in his post within three working days. Despite said violation and recommendation, the institute refused to reinstate the dismissed trade union leaders, again reiterating its anti-union, discriminatory stance.
.On  February , a special inspection was carried out at the premises of the ISBM, as a result of which it was determined that said institute had committed another violation in the form of non-payment of salary arrears for the month of January  to Dr Jos Alberto Calidonio Burgos due to causes attributable to the employer. The institute again denied the accusation that it had committed a violation, ignoring it and reiterating its anti-union stance (a stance which contravenes the laws of the Republic). On  March , an inspector of the Department of Membership and Inspection of the Salvadorian Social Security Institute (ISSS) told Dr Jos Alberto Calidonio Burgos that the ISBM was being fined for failing to pay the workers' (the doctors) contributions, given that, in the opinion of the ISSS, the legal basis put forward by the Ministry of Labour in its respective inspection actions was sufficient. The complainants are waiting for the ISS to notify the parties officially of this ruling in writing. According to the complainant organization, the Constitution of El Salvador, Conventions Nos ,  and  and the Labour Code have all been violated.
.In its communication of  July , the Government states that the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare granted legal personality to SIMEFISBM through ruling No. /, dated  September . In the light of the request for registration of the executive committee of the trade union, submitted by the interested parties on  November , and the documentation contained in an annex to said request, in which it is stated that as a result of the process of election of the executive committee Doctors Jos Alberto Calidonio Burgos and Carlos Mauricio Rivera took office as secretary general and organization and statistics secretary respectively, it was ruled that the executive committee of the trade union in question should be registered.
.The Government states that in the ruling through which the secretary of State granted legal personality to SIMEFISBM, it was established that an employment relationship existed between the doctors who participated in the founding of the trade union and the ISBM, with this fact being confirmed during the respective labour inspections which determined that services were being provided in conditions of subordination, a key characteristic of employment relationships. This situation suggests that an individual employment contract exists in accordance with section  of the Labour Code, contradicting the statements made by the employer to the effect that the institute is linked to the founders of the trade union by administrative, rather than employment, contracts. Consequently, it having been demonstrated that the founders of the trade union are employees of the institute, they enjoy the right of association for trade union purposes recognized by section  of the Constitution of the Republic, Article  of ILO Convention No.  and section  of the Labour Code, with the inclusion of said trade union in the register kept by the Ministry being admissible.
.The ruling issued by this Ministry of State granting legal personality to SIMEFISBM is irrefutable proof, as stated by the complainants, that in its role as the regulatory body which implements labour standards, the Government recognizes and protects the right to freedom of association, ensuring that the necessary conditions exist to allow the doctors to exercise fully their right to organise freely, in compliance with the mandate set out in article (b) of the Labour and Social Welfare Sector Organization and Functions Act, which states that: The specific functions of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare are: (b) to facilitate the constitution of trade union organizations, complying fully with Articles ,,  and  of ILO Convention No. .
.As to the dismissals of Dr Jos Alberto Calidonio Burgos, secretary general of SIMEFISBM, and Carlos Mauricio Rivera, organization and statistics secretary of the trade union, the interventions of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare were designed to protect the right to organise of the abovementioned trade union leaders, in accordance with Article  of ILO Convention No. . The following administrative actions were carried out in the same spirit:(a) On  November , Doctors Calidonio Burgos and Rivera, SIMEFISBM trade union leaders for the period  October  '  June , lodged the corresponding request for special labour inspection, in which they claimed that they were being discriminated against owing to their status as trade union members and that, owing to the fact that they were unionized, the employer had taken the decision not to renew their respective contracts for the January-December  period.",0,2010,El Salvador
117,"This decision was made because the doctors were founder members of the trade union. The ISBM also pointed to the fact that the contract with the doctors was administrative rather than one of employment and that they must participate in a public tender process in order to compete for another contract with the institute. In response to the doctors' request, the General Labour Inspection Directorate carried out the corresponding inspection procedure, noting in the respective inspection records contained in file No. -UD--, dated  December , that the ISBM had infringed: section () of the Labour Code, which states that  Employers are forbidden to: directly or indirectly discriminate against workers owing to their unionized status or take reprisals against them for the same reason'  Article (b) of ILO Convention No. ; and section  of the Labour Code which states that  Members of executive committees of trade unions with legal personality or in the process of obtaining such legal personality may not be dismissed transferred or subject to a worsening in their conditions of work nor suspended for disciplinary reasons during the period of their election and term of office and until after one year from having ceased their functions other than for just cause as previously determined by the competent authority.' Consequently, the ISBM was warned to rectify the abovementioned violations by immediately reinstating the trade union leaders in their posts in the light of the trade union immunity which gives them job security and protects them from dismissal for anti-union motives.(b) On  January , the General Labour Inspection Directorate carried out a further inspection to check whether the employer had complied with the warning issued by the labour inspectors regarding the reinstatement of the dismissed trade union leaders. On that occasion it was noted in the corresponding inspection record that the ISBM had not rectified the violation noted during the special inspection of  December . Consequently, sanctions proceedings were initiated, in accordance with articles  and  of the Labour and Social Welfare Sector Organization and Functions Act and section  and the following sections of the Labour Code.(c) In addition to the inspection procedures carried out by the Ministry of State, the General Labour Directorate was requested by the illegally dismissed trade union leaders to intervene in a conciliatory capacity in an attempt to restore their trade union rights. The General Labour Directorate summoned the parties in dispute with the aim of brining about a conciliation that would lead to the reinstatement of the abovementioned trade union representatives in their respective posts. A conciliatory hearing was held on  January , but no solution to the labour dispute was found, despite the fact that the ministerial delegates were determined to resolve said labour dispute through dialogue and negotiation.(d) In the light of the refusal by the employer to reinstate the trade union representatives in their posts, on  January , Dr. Carlos Mauricio Rivera requested the legal assistance and support of the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic, in order to bring the corresponding legal action against ISBM for his unfair dismissal. These proceedings are currently ongoing before the labour courts.
.As can be seen from the facts referred to in this report, the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare, in its capacity as Ministry of State responsible at the administrative level for safeguarding labour rights, duly carried out all the institutional actions within its remit in order to bring about the reinstatement of the illegally dismissed trade union leaders. The administrative authority duly noted the violations and initiated sanctions proceedings against the employer. Conciliatory interventions were also carried out to resolve the dispute, but no satisfactory outcome has to date been achieved owing to the position adopted by the ISBM.
.In accordance with its mandate to safeguard the labour rights of the workers of the country, the Ministry of Labour shall continue to carry out nay necessary institutional actions, in order to achieve the reinstatement of the dismissed doctors in the shortest possible time and to ensure that they are granted the guarantees and facilitates necessary for the full exercise of the trade union rights recognized by law in the case of both workers and employers. The legal proceedings initiated by Dr Rivera will be monitored and their outcome reported on.
.The Government states that it will continue to work to ensure that this case is resolved and the rights of the trade unionists of the country are not violated and that it is aware of its obligation to promote and guarantee respect for the rights of the workers, as an indispensable element in achieving peace and social justice. Furthermore, the Government renews its undertaking to make the necessary effort to guarantee the practical observance of trade union freedoms in the country.
.The Committee notes that, in the present case, the Union of Family Physicians of the Salvadoran Institute for Teachers' Welfare (SIMEFISBM) alleges the anti-union dismissal of the trade union leaders Doctors Jos Alberto Calidonio Burgos, secretary general, and Carlos Mauricio Rivera, organization and statistics secretary, of SIMEFISBM.
.The Committee notes that the Government confirms that the dismissals in question took place and states that: () on  December , the General Labour Inspection Directorate informed the Salvadoran Institute for Teachers' Welfare (ISBM) that, in the light of the trade union immunity which guarantees the doctors protection from dismissal and from dismissal for anti-union motives, the dismissed trade unionists should be reinstated in their posts; () on  January, the General Labour Inspection Directorate noted that the ISBM had not rectified the violation (the dismissal of the trade union leaders) and initiated sanctions proceedings; () the Minister of State attempted to restore the trade union rights of the dismissed trade union leaders through the General Labour Directorate and summoned the parties to a conciliatory hearing on  January with the aim of reconciling them and bringing about the reinstatement of the trade union leaders, but no agreement was reached; () in the light of the refusal by the ISBM to reinstate the trade union leaders, Dr Carlos Mauricio Rivera brought a legal action for unfair dismissal which is currently ongoing; and () the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare carried out and shall continue to carry out all the necessary institutional actions to achieve the reinstatement of the dismissed trade union leaders.
.In this regard, the Committee recalls that no person should be dismissed or prejudiced in employment by reason of trade union membership or legitimate trade union activities, and that it is important to forbid and penalize in practice all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of employment. It also recalls that in a case in which a trade union leader was dismissed and then reinstated a few days later, the Committee pointed out that the dismissal of trade union leaders by reason of union membership or activities is contrary to Article  of Convention No. , and could amount to intimidation aimed at preventing the free exercise of their trade union functions [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth edition, , paras  and ]. The Committee profoundly regrets the dismissals of the trade union leaders in question and, while recognizing the efforts made by the Government to obtain their reinstatement, requests the Government to continue to take all the measures at its disposals to ensure that Carlos Mauricio Rivera and Jos Alberto Calidonio Burgos are reinstated in their posts at the ISBM, and that they are paid the lost wages and other legal benefits and, if reinstatement is not possible for objective and compelling reasons, to ensure that they are paid adequate compensation which would constitute a sufficiently dissuasive sanction. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard. Furthermore, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the result of the sanctions proceedings initiated by the General Labour Inspection Directorate and of the fine imposed. The Committee expects that said fine will be sufficiently dissuasive in nature to ensure that such anti-union acts do not occur in future at the concerned enterprise.
.Finally, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the result of the legal procedure for unfair dismissal initiated by Carlos Mauricio Rivera, and to keep it informed regarding any legal proceedings initiated by Jos Alberto Calidonio Burgos.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to take all measures at its disposal to obtain the reinstatement of Jos Alberto Calidonio Burgos and Carlos Mauricio Rivera in their posts at the ISBM, as well as the payment of the lost wages and other legal benefits and to keep them informed in that regard. If reinstatement is not possible for objective and compelling reasons the Committee requests the Government to ensure that they are paid adequate compensation which would constitute a sufficiently dissuasive sanction. Furthermore, the Committee requests the Government to keep it",0,2010,El Salvador
118,"informed of the result of the sanctions proceedings initiated by the General Labour Inspection Directorate and of the fine imposed. The Committee expects that said fine will be sufficiently dissuasive in nature to ensure that such anti-union acts do not occur in future at the enterprise concerned.(b) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the result of the legal procedure for unfair dismissal initiated by Carlos Mauricio Rivera, and to keep it informed regarding any legal proceedings initiated by Jos Alberto Calidonio Burgos.",0,2010,El Salvador
119,".The Committee last examined this case, concerning the refusal to register the executive committee of the Union of Construction Workers (SUTC), at its June  meeting. The Committee took note of the following information provided by both the complainants and the Government: in a ruling handed down on  December , the Administrative Proceedings Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice of El Salvador declared the decision of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security to refuse to register the executive committee of the SUTC for the period '  to be unlawful; in accordance with this ruling, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security registered the executive committee of the SUTC and issued the appropriate credentials for its members; negotiations for a new collective contract resumed and are now at the direct contact stage.
.The Committee also noted that, in a communication dated  April , the National Confederation of Salvadoran Workers (CNTS) had provided additional information on the case. The Committee subsequently requested the Government to send its reply thereto without delay, which was received in a communication dated  October .
.In its communication of  April , the CNTS alleges that the Ministry of Labour and Social Security again violated the principles of freedom of association by refusing, for the second time, to register the executive committee of the SUTC, this time for the period ' . The CNTS states that, in accordance with the statutes of the trade union, the serving executive committee published, on  December , the announcement for the ordinary general assembly of the SUTC, where the executive committee of the trade union would be elected for the period  January  to  January . On  January , a member of the executive committee serving until  January, in possession of the documents required by the relevant labour legislation, went to the Ministry of Labour and Social Security to request the registration of the new executive committee, which had just been elected by the general assembly. On  January, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security declared the request to register the new executive committee inadmissible on the grounds that the executive committee of the SUTC had already been registered on  January . The Ministry of Labour and Social Security indicated that, in accordance with the ruling handed down by the Supreme Court of Justice on  December  regarding the registration of the previous executive committee of the SUTC, it had to limit itself to verifying the requirements for the registration of executive committees expressly set out in the Labour Act, and that the documents submitted on  January indeed met those requirements.
.The complainant alleges that the documentation submitted to the Ministry of Labour and Social Security on  January is fraudulent, particularly since it was submitted by persons who were not members of the executive committee at that time. In addition to failing to meet all the requirements set out in the Labour Act, the request for registration also violated the requirements set out in the statutes of the SUTC, which were not taken into consideration by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security. Furthermore, two members of the phony executive committee were no longer part of the trade union following their expulsion from the organization during the real general assembly organized by the legitimate executive committee of the SUTC.
.The complainant considers itself to be the victim of a systematic attack of a political nature that enjoys institutional support. The complainant states that two members of the legitimate executive committee elected were expelled from the trade union by the phony executive committee.
.In its communication of  October , the Government indicates that, on  January , the Ministry of Labour and Social Security received the first request for registration of the executive committee of the SUTC from Mr Vctor Manuel Ramrez, the general secretary elect. The documentation attached to this request contained the announcement for the ordinary general assembly, which was held on  January  and attended by  members. An up-to-date list of the members of the trade union was also provided on that occasion. When processing the registration of the executive committee, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security strictly adhered to the guidelines set by the Administrative Proceedings Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice in its ruling of  December . In its ruling, the Supreme Court of Justice indicates that the registration of the executive committee of each trade union is a declaratory act, that the public authorities should abstain from intervening in any way that could curtail the rights and guarantees that the Constitution and law confer upon trade unions, and that, therefore, the administration should limit its activities to verifying the requirements set out in the Labour Act regarding the registration of executive committees, as well as those listed by the Supreme Court of Justice in its ruling.
.On observing that the documentation submitted met the relevant requirements, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security proceeded to register the executive committee of the SUTC on  January. On  January, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security received a second request to register the executive committee of the same trade union from Mr Mario Letona Hernndez, accompanied by documentation accrediting an ordinary general assembly held on  January, which was attended by  members. The second request was declared inadmissible given that an executive committee had already been registered. The Government states that a judicial remedy was lodged with the Supreme Court of Justice against the decision of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security.
.The Committee observes that, after the Ministry of Labour and Social Security had registered the executive committee of the SUTC for the period '  in accordance with the ruling of the Supreme Court of Justice, it again refused to register the executive committee of the SUTC, this time for the period ' , because another executive committee had already been registered. The Committee notes the complainant s allegation that this was a fraudulent registration that violated the provisions of the Labour Act and the trade union s statutes, while the Government states that the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, strictly adhering to the guidelines set in the ruling of the Supreme Court of Justice, verified that the request for registration indeed met all the relevant legal requirements.
.The Committee also notes that the new allegations point to the existence of an internal dispute within the SUTC, characterized by the fact that two general assemblies were organized in parallel and by the existence of two elected executive committees. The Committee recalls that it is not competent to make recommendations on internal dissentions within a trade union organization, so long as the Government does not intervene in a manner which might affect the exercise of trade union rights and the normal functioning of an organization [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ]. In the case of internal dissention within one and the same trade union federation, by virtue of Article  of Convention No. , the only obligation of the Government is to refrain from any interference which would restrict the right of the workers' and employers' organizations to draw up their constitutions and rules, to elect their representatives in full freedom, to organize their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes, and to refrain from any interference which would impede the lawful exercise of that right. In cases of internal dissentions within a trade union organization, the Committee has pointed out that judicial intervention would permit a clarification of the situation from the legal point of view for the purpose of settling the question of the leadership and representation of the organization concerned [see Digest, op. cit., para. ].
.In the light of the principles mentioned above, the Committee hopes that the Government will soon be able to inform it of the ruling handed down by the Supreme Court of Justice on the judicial remedy lodged against the decision of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security of  January  to register the executive committee of the SUTC for the period ' .
.In its previous examination of the case at its November  session, the Committee made the following recommendations on questions still pending [see th Report, para. ]:(a) With regard to the refusal to register the executive committee of the SUTC, the Committee requests the Government to provide a copy of the ruling handed down and firmly expects that it will be handed down in the near future.(b) With regard to the obstacles to negotiating a new collective agreement, the Committee requests the Government to respect the principle of collective bargaining and to continue negotiations with the newly elected committee at least until the Administrative Court of the Supreme Court of Justice has handed down a decision regarding the validity of these trade union elections. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in",1,2010,El Salvador
120,"this respect.
.In its communication of  January , the Union of Construction Workers (SUTC) states that on  December  it was informed of the ruling handed down at  p.m. on  November  by the Administrative Proceedings Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice, which in its operative provisions stipulates that:(a) The resolution issued at . on  February  by the head of the National Department of Social Organizations of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, refusing the registration of the executive committee of the Union of Construction Workers (SUTC) for the period ' , is hereby ruled to be unlawful;(b) As a means of restoring the right that has been infringed, the party against which the complaint has been filed is required to register the aforementioned executive committee and issue the appropriate credentials ...
.In its communication of  February , the Government sends a copy of the ruling referred to by the SUTC and states that, in accordance with that ruling, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security has registered the SUTC executive committee and issued the appropriate credentials for its members. The Government further states that the executive committee has resumed collective bargaining which is currently at the direct negotiation stage.
.The Committee notes that in a communication dated  April , the National Confederation of Salvadoran Workers (CNTS) provided additional information concerning the pending issues. The Committee requests the Government to provide its observations thereon without delay.
.The complaint is contained in a communication dated  February , presented by the National Confederation of Workers of El Salvador (CNTS) and the Union of Construction Workers (SUTC). The complainant organizations provided additional information by means of a communication dated  April .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  May .
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communications dated  February and  April , the CNTS and the SUTC state that they are lodging a formal complaint against the Government of El Salvador for refusing to register the executive committee of the SUTC, infringing on the union s operating capacity and functioning and its right to collective bargaining because of interference by the State restricting the rights and guarantees covering trade unions.
.The complainant organizations explain that on  December  ' in accordance with the trade union s statutes ' the official summons was published announcing that on  January , an ordinary general assembly would be held at which the election of the general executive committee of the trade union for the period from  January  to  January  would take place.
.With a view to greater objectivity and transparency in the election procedure, delegates from the Ministry of Labour and Social Security were invited to attend as observers in the ordinary general assembly for the election of a general executive committee;  members were present.
.On  January , the Organization and Statistics Secretary in office requested, before the Office of the National Department of Social Organizations of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, the registration of the executive committee and the issuing of the respective credentials recognizing the elected persons as members of the executive committee. Attached to the request were the summons and the minutes of the general assembly, and a list of the workers who attended.
.As the Administration did not reply, on  January  the SUTC presented a letter addressed to the head of the National Department of Social Organizations invoking the right to a reply within a reasonable period of time, which, although the law does not set out a defined period, is linked to being granted the credentials before the end of the mandate of the outgoing executive committee in order to ensure its functioning.
.On  February , the trade union was notified of the decision of the head of the aforementioned department rejecting the application for registration of the general executive committee of the trade union, underlining that the delegates of the Ministry who attended the general assembly produced a report in which they stated the following: a group of around  people, duly identified as trade union members, had been prevented from attending the assembly because they owed trade union dues, without mentioning the trade union cards the so-called members should have had with them so as to be recognized as members of the trade union. The complainant organizations point out that the report of the delegates of the Ministry mentions that some people were considered as members because the day prior to the general assembly meeting they had paid the membership fee which was used to check the payment of trade union dues, which is impossible given that the payment of the trade union dues should follow the procedure established in section  of the Labour Code.
.The complainant organizations allege that among the people who were denied the right to participate in the assembly there was a group of people who did not belong to the trade union and whose intention was to destabilize and sabotage the event. The said persons, who were allegedly denied the right to participate in the assembly for owing their trade union dues ' the payment of which is a condition in order to be able to exercise their political rights as trade union members ' were sanctioned with the suspension of the enjoyment of their trade union rights for the period of  days pursuant to the trade union statute. However, the procedural mechanism for this sanction requires that the complaint made by the trade union members must first be reviewed by the executive committee before it can be imposed and enforced. The complainant organizations clarify that the executive committee is precluded by law from unofficially imposing the said sanction.
.The head of the National Department of Social Organizations, in the exercise of her mandate to monitor procedures and legal standards under section  of the Labour Code, considered that the assembly was held in violation of the trade union rights of a group of trade union members who were illegally prevented from attending the general assembly. In the complainant organizations' opinion, this stance, however, constitutes an act of interference by the State restricting the rights and guarantees covering trade unions.
.The complainant organizations also highlight that the members of the outgoing executive committee, whose mandate has ended, were in conflict about the revision and conclusion of a collective agreement with the Directorate General of Labour of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security. Not having an executive committee in office has had the direct result of slowing down the said negotiations on the collective agreement, affecting more than , workers in the construction sector. Clearly this made it impossible for the bargaining committee, made up of members of the executive committee, to continue negotiating given that at the moment nobody has been able to become an accredited member of the executive committee and therefore of the bargaining committee. The complainant organizations underline that the collective agreement was effective until  December .
.On  February , after lodging an appeal which did not lead to any administrative decision, the trade union lodged an administrative appeal before the Administrative Court of the Supreme Court of Justice claiming that the resolution refusing the registration of the executive committee issued by the head of the National Department of Social Organizations is unlawful.
.In its communication dated  May , the Government states that in relation to the refusal to register the newly elected executive committee and according to the report of the delegates of the Ministry who attended, a group of around  people, who were duly identified as trade union members, were not able to access the place where the assembly was being held under the instructions of the SUTC s executive committee. In addition, the trade union argued that the said members owed their trade union dues, which is why the executive committee did not give them the corresponding  solvency' document, which they needed in order to participate in the ordinary general assembly.
.The Government highlights that in this group of people there were members from different groups belonging to the SUTC ' COMTRASUTC, the SUTC s rescue committee, and the Restoration Movement of the SUTC ' who were intending to run in the election as candidates for the trade union s executive committee in order to challenge and replace the then general secretary of the SUTC, Mr Fredis Vsquez Jovel, who had led the trade union for  years. As a result, this group of trade union members could not exercise their right to freely elect their representatives, a right which is enshrined in Article  of Convention No. , or their right to be elected as members of the executive committee of the trade union.
.The Government declares that the SUTC s statutes provide for the suspension of rights of trade union members",1,2010,El Salvador
121,"for up to  days for failure to pay the trade union dues, whether regular or additional, without a valid reason, however, this sanction should be imposed after the general executive committee has verified the facts. In practice, the rights of the members were suspended de facto, without the executive committee verifying the facts for the application of the appropriate sanction, thus violating its own statutes and the provisions of section  of the Labour Code. In the disciplinary proceedings, no grounds were found for suspending the exercise of the trade union rights of the union members. The Government argues that the executive committee should give the members who allegedly owe their trade union dues the possibility to prove they did not owe any dues or justify the outstanding dues given that, in accordance with article  of the trade union s statutes, the suspension of the exercise of trade union rights is only applicable in the case of unjustified outstanding dues.
.The Government points out that, in the event of trade union members owing dues and in order for this to be considered a disciplinary offence, at least one element must be attributable to them, otherwise trade union members would be arbitrarily and clearly unjustly receiving disciplinary sanction for a situation for which they are not responsible. In addition, the trade union itself recognizes in its argument that suspending the exercise of the rights because of outstanding trade union dues constitutes a disciplinary sanction which must be applied by the executive committee following the process established in article  of the trade union statute, which according to the complainants was not applied because there was no complaint to justify starting proceedings; this power to sanction cannot be used officiously by the executive committee, which confirms a serious violation of the due process. This non-observance could possibly lead to abuses against trade union members with regard to the exercise of their trade union rights and the exclusion from internal decisions of trade union members who might promote a change in the trade union s leadership.
.To support its statements, the Government mentions the illegal and unlawful practices carried out by the previous executive committee of the SUTC, headed by Mr Fredis Vsquez Jovel. It is claimed that there are exclusion clauses that are, in fact, applied illegally in various companies in the construction sector. Often the workers are forced to leave the trade unions to which they belong in order to become SUTC members and thus be able to get work in this sector.
.Similarly, the Government notes that the previous executive committee, which is lodging the complaint, favoured the unlawful levying of trade union dues from salaries by the employers in order to pay the SUTC, despite workers not being members, thus appropriating the economic interests of workers of these companies, who saw their salaries reduced. In addition, trade union dues were levied from executive committee members of other trade unions in violation of the right of workers to pay their economic contributions to the trade union to which they belong, regardless of whether or not it is the most representative.
.With regard to the alleged interference of the State in the elections of the executive committee of the SUTC, the Government declares that the three delegates of the Ministry, who were appointed to attend the ordinary general assembly held on  January , observed the assembly s proceedings without interfering, respecting the principles of trade union autonomy, and scrupulously following the provisions in the law. The Government points out that the purpose of the labour administration s undertaking ' acting in accordance with section  which grants the power to check that electoral processes within trade unions are in line with legal requirements ' was to defend democratic principles, which should be applied in trade unions and defend the trade union rights of SUTC members, whose fundamental trade union rights were arbitrarily violated, thus violating the principles of freedom of association. The supervision by the labour administration in accordance with its lawful mandate cannot be considered as interference by the State restricting trade union guarantees.
.With regard to the allegations concerning the impact on the trade union in the negotiations for the collective labour agreement in force in various companies in the construction industry, the Government states that, in accordance with legislation, the fact that a trade union might find itself without an executive committee does not affect the validity of collective labour agreements to which it is party because these are automatically extended. Currently, negotiations are suspended pending the election and registration of the new executive committee, which will be able to negotiate as normal. The Government underlines that the statutes of the trade union set out the procedure to follow in order to guarantee its operating capacity and functioning in the event of there not being an executive committee but, due to the negligence of the previous executive committee, the necessary conditions to carry out the appropriate procedures were not present and the complainant organizations could not use the said procedure.
.The Government indicates that the only way of remedying the situation is to collect the signatures of  per cent of the trade union members with the aim of calling an extraordinary general assembly to elect a new executive committee, specifying that this procedure depends exclusively on the willingness of trade union members, which is why the Government cannot intervene.
.The Committee notes that in this case the complainant organizations allege the unjustified refusal ' by means of a resolution of the National Department of Social Organizations of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security ' to register the newly elected general executive committee of the SUTC and thus hindering the exercise of the right to collective bargaining.
.The Committee notes that according to the complainant organizations: () the delegates of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, who, at the request of the trade union, attended the general assembly, produced a report in which they stated the following: a group of around  people, duly identified as trade union members, were prevented from attending the assembly because they owed their trade union dues (however, they did not mention the trade union card which the so-called members should have had in their possession identifying them as trade union members); () the said report points out that some people were considered to be trade union members due to having made a bank transfer the day prior to the meeting of the general assembly through which the payment of the trade union dues were checked (which is, however, impossible given that the payment of the dues must follow the procedure described in section  of the Labour Code); and () among the group of people who were denied the right to participate in the said assembly, there was a group of people who did not belong to the trade union and whose intention it was to destabilize and sabotage the event.
.The Committee notes the statements of the Government, according to which: () the executive committee prevented  trade union worker members from participating in the assembly of the trade union, arguing that they were behind on the payment of their trade union dues as noted by the delegates from the Ministry of Labour and Social Security (who were present at the election in the trade union assembly at the voluntary invitation of the executive committee); () in this group of people, there were members of different groups affiliated to the SUTC who had the intention of running in the election as candidates for the executive committee of the trade union; () the aim of these candidates was to challenge and replace the then general secretary of the SUTC, who had led the trade union for  years, but by preventing them from participating in the assembly they were not able to exercise their right to freely elect their representatives as enshrined in Article  of Convention No.  or their right to be elected; () the previous executive committee had carried out illegal, unlawful and abusive practices, which according to the Government s observations violated certain trade union rights of workers in the construction sector in respect of access to employment and the levy of trade union dues to the trade union of their choice, among others; () the statutes of the SUTC provide for the suspension of rights of trade union members for up to  days for failure to pay trade union dues, both regular and additional, without a valid reason. However, this sanction must be imposed after verification of the facts by the executive committee in line with the provisions of the trade union statutes, which did not occur in this case, thereby violating the rules and regulations of the said statutes by not allowing the members concerned to participate in the elective assembly; () a number of trade union members paid their trade union dues the day before the assembly, thereby gaining access to the hall in order to vote; and",0,2010,El Salvador
122,"() the authorities' actions and the resolution through which registration of the executive committee is refused were therefore seeking to respect the democratic principles which should be applied in trade unions.
.In this regard, taking into account that the Government claims trade union statutes have been violated by the executive committee in order to prevent other candidates from running for election, that the Government s version and the complainants' version of the alleged facts are different (including the fact regarding the right to participate in the trade union elections of a large group of workers) and that the executive committee itself decided to bring an administrative appeal in February  before the Administrative Court of the Supreme Court of Justice against the resolution containing the refusal for registration of the elected executive committee, the Committee requests that the Government provide a copy of the ruling that is handed down and firmly expects that it will be handed down in the near future.
.With regard to the second allegation, the Committee notes that the complainant organizations indicate that the bargaining committee, made up of executive committee members, was unable to continue with the collective bargaining process under way because, as a result of the executive committee not being registered, nobody can currently become a member of the executive committee and, therefore, a member of the bargaining committee. The Committee notes that according to the Government the fact that a trade union could end up without an executive committee does not affect the validity of the collective labour agreements to which it is party because these are automatically extended in accordance with section  of the Labour Code. The Committee notes that according to the Government the negotiations are suspended pending the judicial decision on the validity or non-validity of the elected executive committee.
.The Committee recalls that in order to avoid the danger of serious limitation on the right of workers to elect their representatives in full freedom, complaints brought before labour courts by an administrative authority challenging the results of trade union elections should not ' pending the final outcome of the judicial proceedings ' have the effect of suspending the validity of such elections [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Committee on Freedom of Association, fifth edition, , para. ]. Under these circumstances, in order to avoid the negative consequences of the trade union not having an executive committee and excessive delays as a result of ongoing judicial proceedings and possible appeals which cause prolonged disruption to the functioning of the trade union, the Committee requests the Government to respect the principle of collective bargaining and to continue negotiations with the newly elected executive committee at least until the Higher Administrative Court of the Supreme Court of Justice has handed down a decision regarding the validity of these elections. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) With regard to the refusal to register the executive committee of the SUTC, the Committee requests the Government to provide a copy of the ruling handed down and firmly expects that it will be handed down in the near future.(b) With regard to the obstacles to negotiating a new collective agreement, the Committee requests the Government to respect the principle of collective bargaining and to continue negotiations with the newly elected committee at least until the Administrative Court of the Supreme Court of Justice has handed down a decision regarding the validity of these trade union elections. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.",0,2010,El Salvador
123,".When it last examined this case in November , the Committee requested the Government to keep it informed of the ruling handed down by the Administrative Disputes Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice in regard to the accreditation of the Trade Union Association of Workers of the Confitera Americana SA de CV Enterprise (ASTECASACV) for the collective agreement [see nd Report, para. ], whose accreditation had initially been challenged by the General Secretary of the Trade Union of Workers of the Confitera Americana SA de CV Enterprise (STECASACV), who is alleged to have subsequently dropped the challenge in question.
.In its communication of  February , the Government reports that the Administrative Disputes Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice has yet to hand down any ruling regarding the accreditation of ASTECASACV for the collective labour agreement. The Government states that it will keep the Committee informed in due course when it is notified that the ruling has been handed down.
.The Committee takes note of this information and is waiting to be informed of the ruling handed down in this case.
.In its previous examination of the case in November , the Committee requested the Government to send it a copy of the decision on the appeal against the administrative resolution imposing sanctions on the Confitera Americana SA de CV enterprise for bringing pressure to bear on its workers to cancel their union membership. The Committee also observed that the Government had not sent any information on its recommendation regarding the accreditation of the Trade Union Association of Workers of the Confitera Americana SA de CV Enterprise (ASTECASACV) for the collective agreement. The Committee hoped that the action brought by the Trade Union of Workers of the Confitera Americana SA de CV Enterprise (STECASACV) challenging the decision to grant accreditation, currently before the Administrative Disputes Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice, would be resolved without delay and that the court would have access to all elements of the case in reaching its decision. The Committee requested the Government to keep it informed in that regard [see th Report, paras ' ].
.In a communication of  May , the Government states that, as a consequence of the pressure brought to bear on workers to cancel their union membership by the Confitera Americana SA de CV enterprise, a sanction was imposed on the enterprise; as may be seen from inspection report No. - (UD---) of  July ), the labour inspector noted a violation of section , read in conjunction with section (), of the Labour Code, having found that the enterprise had committed acts aimed at the workers' withdrawal from the trade union of which they were members, in violation of the right to freedom of association, which is recognized in article  of the Constitution. Accordingly, the case was referred to the Ministry of Labour under the procedure for the imposition of sanctions, and the Confitera Americana SA de CV enterprise was granted the right to a hearing on  August ; in the exercise of this right, the enterprise, through its authorized representative for labour issues, attended a hearing in the Department of Inspection of Industry and Commerce of the Ministry of Labour, at which it requested an appointment for the examination of witnesses. In response to that request, the Department of Inspection set the date for the examination of witnesses for the employer side on  September . After examination of the documentary and testimonial evidence, a ruling against the employer was handed down on  September , and the enterprise was notified on  April  of the fine of US$, imposed on it, which it paid in May .
.As regards accreditation of the ASTECASACV for the collective agreement, the Government states that on  March , Ms Iris Corina Selaya Sigenza, as General Secretary of the STECASACV, filed a written application with the Administrative Disputes Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice to withdraw the challenge suspending the administrative procedure substituting the union s accreditation. On  March , the Chamber instructed Ms Selaya Sigenza to substantiate her legal status in due form, as her term of office as General Secretary of the STECASACV had expired, and to clarify the correct spelling of her first surname, as it differed from the name on the application and the identity document presented. This notification was sent to Ms Selaya Sigenza on  July . Ms Selaya Sigenza did not comply with the instruction; the court therefore again instructed her on  February  to clarify the correct spelling of her first surname, and again she did not do so. Faced with this situation, the Administrative Disputes Chamber asked the National Department for Social Organizations of the Directorate-General for Labour of the Ministry for the address of the STECASACV in order to request it to confirm the withdrawal requested by Ms Iris Corina Selaya Sigenza. The case is now pending a decision by the Administrative Disputes Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice, of which the Committee on Freedom of Association will be informed in due time, as the Ministry has not been informed of any decision in the case to date.
.The Committee takes note of this information. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the ruling handed down by the Administrative Disputes Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice in regard to accreditation of the ASTECASACV for the collective agreement.
.The Committee last examined this case at its March  meeting, when it made the following recommendations on the matters still outstanding [see th Report, para. ]:(a) The Committee requests the Government to state whether, as a consequence of the coercion of workers to resign their union membership, as identified by the labour inspectorate, the sanctions provided for in national legislation in the case of anti-union practices have been imposed on the enterprise.(b) With regard to granting accreditation for the purpose of the collective agreement to ASTECASACV, the Committee expects that the action brought by STECASACV to challenge the decision to grant accreditation, currently before the Chamber of Administrative Dispute of the Supreme Court of Justice, will be resolved without delay and that the court will have access to all elements of the case in reaching its decision. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.In a communication dated  March , the Government states that the administrative resolution imposing sanctions on the company has been challenged in the Supreme Court of Justice which, pursuant to the Administrative Dispute Jurisdiction Act, has provisionally suspended the resolution from taking effect.
.The Committee takes note of the information supplied and requests the Government to send it a copy of the decision on the appeal against the administrative resolution imposing sanctions on the company for bringing pressure to bear on its workers to cancel their union membership. The Committee observes that the Government has not sent any information on its recommendation regarding the accreditation of ASTECASACV for the collective agreement. The Committee therefore reiterates its previous recommendation and firmly hopes that the action brought by STECASACV challenging the decision to grant accreditation, currently before the Administrative Disputes Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice, will be resolved without delay and that the Court will have access to all elements of the case in reaching its decision. The Committee again requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.The Committee last examined this case at its meeting in March  [see rd Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session, paras ' ].
.The Government sent new observations in communications dated  May,  July and  October .
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.During its last examination of the case, the Committee made the following recommendations [see rd Report, para. ]:(a) The Committee highlights the seriousness of the allegations and regrets that the Government has not sent its observations on this case even though it has been invited to do so on several occasions and was issued with an urgent appeal.(b) The Committee urges the Government to send its observations on the allegations and all the administrative decisions without delay ' in particular those which relate to anti-union discrimination and interference ' and rulings on this case, including those relating to the application filed by the enterprise to dissolve the trade union and the issue of union accreditation for the collective agreement, and expects that, through the employers' organization concerned, it will also benefit from the comments of the enterprise.(c) Given the lack of observations on the part of the Government, the Committee underscores in general that Convention No.  prohibits all acts of anti-union discrimination and interference in union matters and, therefore, any practice that involves pressure to join or leave a trade union, the promotion of workers' organizations by the employer and measures aimed at dissolving a trade",0,2008,El Salvador
124,"union by an employer, which, according to the allegations, used pressure to bring about a reduction in union membership. The Committee requests the Government to guarantee that these principles are respected and to ensure an effective remedy for the workers and the trade union.
.In its communications of  May,  July and  October , the Government sent the following observations.
.On  April , the labour inspectorate carried out an inspection based on a complaint from the Trade Union of Workers of the Confitera Americana SA de CV Enterprise (STECASACV) about the lowering of standards set out in the economic clauses of the collective labour agreement signed between the parties. In the course of that inspection, and with the aim of harmonizing labour relations, the issue of adherence to the terms of the collective agreement was considered, despite the fact that section  of the Act on organization and functions in the labour and services sector stipulates that the scope of inspection does not include collective legal disputes arising from the application or interpretation of legal provisions, the resolution of which falls within the purview of labour judges. Attempts were also made to warn the legal representative not to pursue the actions brought by the union.
.The Government adds that subsequent inspections requested by the union identified the following violations of current labour legislation: acts that indirectly restrict the rights of workers conferred by the Labour Code and other sources of labour obligations; coercion of workers to resign from a representative organization of which they are member; violation of section  of the Labour Code through failure to draw up internal work regulations and submit them to the Director-General for Labour for approval; and violation of section  of the same legal instrument by making changes to working hours without submitting them to the Director-General for Labour for approval.
.The Government states that, with respect to the allegations concerning the process of resignation from their union to which workers at the enterprise were allegedly subjected under threat of dismissal, the National Department for Social Organizations has processed the resignations from  workers at their own request and in accordance with the procedure established in sections  and  of the Labour Code, without any indication by the workers concerned that they have been coerced or threatened by the enterprise to resign from their union. In this regard, the Government points out that a worker must personally submit a request to resign before the National Department for Social Organizations can begin the process of resignation.
.As regards the union accreditation for the collective agreement concluded between Confitera Americana SA de CV Enterprise and STECASACV requested by the Trade Union Association of Workers of the Confitera Americana SA de CV Enterprise (ASTECASACV), the Government states that the Secretary-General of ASTECASACV requested accreditation for the above collective agreement and submitted to that end the minutes of the extraordinary general assembly on first summons, which record the unanimous agreement reached by the assembly. In view of this, and in accordance with the provisions of section () of the Labour Code, a visit was made to the enterprise in order to obtain documentation to support the application by ASTECASACV, and it was found that, of the  workers providing services to the enterprise,  were ASTECASACV members. For this reason, on  February , the National Department for Social Organizations replaced the declining trade union and declared ASTECASACV accredited for the purpose of the collective agreement. This decision has been appealed before the Chamber of Administrative Dispute of the Supreme Court of Justice, whose ruling is still pending.
.The Committee recalls that, as can be seen from the previous examination of the case, the complainant alleges that it initiated sanctions proceedings against the Confitera Americana SA de CV Enterprise because of the enterprise s intention of lowering the standards set out in ten clauses of the collective agreement. As a result: () the enterprise coerced members of the union to resign from it and join an alternative organization, the ASTECASACV, which has been granted legal personality and union accreditation for the purpose of the collective agreement by the Ministry of Labour and Social Provision. The administrative decision granting this accreditation has been appealed before the courts, which have not yet ruled in the case brought by the complainant; () the coercion led to the resignation of  members (the complainant has emphasized that these resignations were submitted in the same format and had been completed by the same person); and () as a result of these resignations, the enterprise requested the courts to dissolve the complainant union and cancel its registration in October , on the grounds that it no longer had the minimum number of members required by legislation, the number having fallen from  to eight as a result of pressure from the enterprise; the court ruled against the dissolution of the union, as a year had not elapsed from the time when the trade union s membership had fallen below the minimum required by the Labour Code. The Committee takes note of the fact that the labour inspection report supplied by the complainant establishes that there has been coercion of workers belonging to STECASACV through (direct quotation)  indirect inducement, persuasion or coercion of workers to resign their membership of the Trade Union of Workers of the Confitera Americana SA de CV Enterprise ' ' 
.The Committee first of all regrets that the Government did not indicate whether it consulted the enterprise concerned in relation to these allegations, as it had requested during the previous examination of the case. The Committee takes note of all the Government s observations, in particular that: () during the inspections carried out by the labour inspectorate at the request of STECASACV on the basis of a complaint about the lowering of standards set out in the economic clauses of the collective agreement concluded between the parties, violations of current labour legislation were identified, including acts indirectly restricting the rights conferred on workers by the Labour Code and other sources of labour obligations, and coercion of workers to resign from the representative organization to which they belong; and () the National Department for Social Organizations has processed resignations from  workers, at their own request and in accordance with the procedure established in sections  and  of the Labour Code (according to the Government, those concerned gave no indication that they were being coerced or threatened by the enterprise to resign from the union).
.The Committee requests the Government to state whether, as a consequence of the coercion of workers to resign their union membership, as identified by the labour inspectorate, the sanctions provided for in national legislation, in the case of anti-union practices, have been imposed on the enterprise.
.The Committee further observes that, according to the allegations, the reduction in the number of members belonging to the complainant organization, STECASACV, enabled the other existing trade union, ASTECASACV (which, according to the allegations, is supported by the enterprise), to request and successfully obtain accreditation for the purpose of the collective agreement, which had previously been held by STECASACV (before the resignation of  of its members). The Committee notes that, according to the Government, since the Secretary-General of ASTECASACV requested accreditation for the collective agreement, a visit to the enterprise was made, which established that, of the  workers providing services to the enterprise,  were members of ASTECASACV. On  February , the National Department for Social Organizations therefore declared ASTECASACV accredited for the purpose of the collective agreement, replacing STECASACV; this decision has been appealed before the Chamber of Administrative Contention of the Supreme Court of Justice, whose ruling is still pending. The Committee expects that this case will be resolved without delay and that the court will have access to all elements of the case when reaching its decision. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.The Committee also observes that, on the grounds of the reduction in the number of members belonging to STECASACV, the enterprise requested the courts to dissolve the union in September . The Committee notes that, according to the court ruling supplied by the Government, it appears that the request was rejected because legal requirements had not been met.
.In general, the Committee observes that this case deals with serious allegations of interference by the enterprise in the complainant s activities in order to promote another union organization, which, according to the allegations, is close to the enterprise, and to grant it accreditation for the purpose of the collective agreement. In anticipation of a ruling on this matter, the Committee underlines the importance of effective compliance with Article  of Convention No. , which establishes the obligation to ensure adequate protection against acts of interference in workers' organizations.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to state whether, as a consequence of the coercion of",0,2008,El Salvador
125,"workers to resign their union membership, as identified by the labour inspectorate, the sanctions provided for in national legislation in the case of anti-union practices have been imposed on the enterprise.(b) With regard to granting accreditation for the purpose of the collective agreement to ASTECASACV, the Committee expects that the action brought by STECASACV to challenge the decision to grant accreditation, currently before the Chamber of Administrative Dispute of the Supreme Court of Justice, will be resolved without delay and that the court will have access to all elements of the case in reaching its decision. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.The complaint is contained in a communication by the Trade Union of Workers of the Confitera Americana SA de CV Enterprise (STECASACV) dated  March  and is supported by the Trade Union Confederation of Workers of El Salvador (CSTS) and the Trade Union Federation of Food, Beverage, Hotel, Restaurant and Agro-Industry Workers of El Salvador (FESTSSABHRA), which also signed the complaint. The STECASACV sent additional information in a communication dated  June .
.At its November  session, the Committee observed that, despite the time which had elapsed since the submission of the complaint, it had not received the observations that the Government had been requested to provide. The Committee issued an urgent appeal to the Government drawing its attention to the fact that, in accordance with the procedural rules set out in paragraph  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body, it might present a report on the substance of the case at its next meeting, if the requested observations had not been received in full and in due time. Accordingly, it urged the Government to send its observations as a matter of urgency [see st Report, para. ]. Since then, the Committee has not received any observations from the Government concerning this case.
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communications dated  March and  June , the STECASACV claims that it was established on  April  and that in May  it had  members ( per cent of the staff of the enterprise, of which  per cent were women). Its membership has now fallen to only eight.
.According to the complainant trade union, at the beginning of March , the enterprise Confitera Americana SA de CV submitted to the General Labour Directorate of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security a request to reduce the conditions contained in clauses , , , , , , , ,  and  of the collective labour agreement in force; since then, a series of measures have been taken by the employer s representatives, which include coercing members to leave the union and join an alternative organization, which was granted by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security legal status in record time and union accreditation for the collective labour agreement that the complainant trade union had signed with the enterprise. On  September , the enterprise requested the judicial authorities to dissolve the complainant trade union and cancel its registration, on the grounds that it did not have the minimum number of members required under the Labour Code.
.The complainant trade union explains the context of the abovementioned measures and indicates that, following the request by the enterprise to reduce the conditions contained in ten clauses of an economic nature of the collective labour agreement in force, the complainant trade union requested the intervention of the General Labour Inspector. The first inspection was conducted on  April , during which the union s complaint, highlighting the coercive measures applied by the employer against the workers, was brought to the attention of the employer s representatives. The intervention of the General Labour Inspectorate was requested again and a further inspection was conducted on  May , revealing an infraction of the Labour Code. A follow-up inspection was scheduled to ensure that the infraction had been remedied and was conducted on  June , when it was found that no remedial action had been taken; the necessary reports were then drawn up, leading to the imposition of a sanction provided for by law (a fine).
.The complainant trade union adds that, in an act of reprisal for the steps taken to impose sanctions, the enterprise intensified its coercive measures to the extent of threatening with dismissal those who did not leave the complainant trade union; the first withdrawal of membership took place on  June and a mass withdrawal was set in motion on  June . As an indication of the extent to which the workers were induced, the complainant organization attached as an annex the first notice of withdrawal and  others, dated  June . These demonstrate two things: first, the same format was used and submitted for each worker; and second, the forms were all filled in by the same person, as the same handwriting is used. Nevertheless, they were accepted by the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare, which did not even notice that the name of the complainant trade union (which was the subject of the withdrawal notices) had been misspelt, rendering the forms invalid. The union approached various bodies (the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare, the Office of the Human Rights Ombudsperson and the Labour Committee of the Legislative Assembly) without achieving any results.
.According to the complainant trade union, in order to achieve its objectives, the enterprise went on to establish with the workers (who in a systematic and subtle way managed to leave the complainant organization) a trade union association known as the Trade Union of Workers of the Confitera Americana SA de CV Enterprise (ASTECASACV). In record time, the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare granted legal status to this association by a decision of  February  and granted the newly established association union accreditation for the collective labour agreement that had been signed by the complainant trade union.
.In these circumstances, the complainant trade union, mindful of the aims of the enterprise to reduce the conditions contained in the clauses of an economic nature that were favourable to workers, appealed on  March  to the Administrative Disputes Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice, challenging the legality of the abovementioned decision. To date, this matter has not been settled (such cases take three to four years in El Salvador).
.In October , the enterprise filed a judicial application to the First Labour Court of the San Salvador legal district to dissolve and cancel the registration of the trade union. A court ruling was issued dismissing the application, as the judge hearing the case deemed that, on the date the application had been filed, less than one year had passed since the union s membership had been below the minimum required by the Labour Code in order to be able to exist legally. According to the complainant trade union, the employer s representatives will in the future be able to resubmit the application to dissolve and cancel the registration of the trade union. Finally, the complainants transmitted the inspection reports relevant to this case.
.The Committee regrets that, despite the time that has elapsed, the Government has not provided its observations as requested, even though it has been invited on several occasions, including by means of an urgent appeal, to present its observations on the case.
.In these circumstances, and in accordance with the applicable rules of procedure [see th Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session], the Committee is bound to present a report on the substance of the case without the benefit of the information which it had hoped to receive from the Government.
.The Committee reminds the Government that the purpose of the whole procedure established by the International Labour Organization for the examination of allegations of violations of freedom of association is to promote respect for this freedom, both in law and in practice. The Committee is confident that, if the procedure protects governments from unreasonable accusations, governments, on their side, will recognize the importance of formulating, for objective examination, detailed replies concerning allegations made against them.
.The Committee notes that, in the present case, the complainant trade union basically alleges that, in the light of its objection to the request by the Confitera Americana SA de CV enterprise to reduce the conditions contained in ten clauses of the collective agreement, the enterprise: () coerced the members of the union to leave the union and join an alternative organization, which was granted by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security legal status and union accreditation for the collective labour agreement; and () requested the judicial authorities to dissolve and cancel the registration of the complainant union organization, on the grounds that it no longer had the minimum number of members required by law, as its membership had decreased as a result of",0,2008,El Salvador
126,"pressure by the enterprise from  to eight.
.More specifically, the Committee notes that, according to the complainant trade union, on  June , in an act of reprisal for the steps by the labour inspectorate, at the trade union s request, to impose sanctions, the enterprise threatened to dismiss those who did not leave the complainant trade union, leading to  withdrawals of membership (the complainant trade union highlights that the withdrawal forms ' which are attached ' were all in the same format and were all filled out by the same person). The Committee notes that, indeed, the complainant trade union has provided a labour inspection report noting that the enterprise s workers were coerced to withdraw their union membership and that, on the basis of the inspection reports, the labour inspectorate imposed a fine on the enterprise. Likewise, the Committee observes that, according to the complainant trade union, the enterprise proceeded to establish a new trade union association (ASTECASACV) and that the Ministry of Labour granted it in record time its legal status and union accreditation for the collective agreement. The complainant organization challenged the administrative decision granting union accreditation before the judicial authorities, which have not yet issued a ruling on the matter. Lastly, the complainant organization alleges that the enterprise filed in October  a judicial application to cancel the registration of and dissolve the complainant organization. The court ruled against the dissolution of the union, as the trade union s membership had been below the minimum level required by the Labour Code for less than one year, which, in the opinion of the complainant organization, will enable the enterprise in due course to resubmit its application to dissolve the trade union.
.The Committee urges the Government to send its observations on the allegations and all the administrative decisions without delay ' in particular those which relate to anti-union discrimination and interference ' and rulings on this case (application to dissolve the trade union; application relating to union accreditation for the collective agreement) and expects that, through the employers' organization concerned, it will also benefit from the comments of the enterprise.
.Given the lack of observations on the part of the Government and the seriousness of the allegations, the Committee underscores in general that Convention No.  prohibits all acts of anti-union discrimination and interference in union matters and, therefore, any practice that involves pressure to join or leave a trade union, the promotion of workers' organizations by the employer and measures aimed at dissolving a trade union by an employer, which, according to the allegations, used pressure to bring about a reduction in union membership. The Committee requests the Government to guarantee that these principles are respected and to ensure an effective remedy for the workers and the trade union.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee requests the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee highlights the seriousness of the allegations and regrets that the Government has not sent its observations on this case even though it has been invited to do so on several occasions and was issued with an urgent appeal.(b) The Committee urges the Government to send its observations on the allegations and all the administrative decisions without delay ' in particular those which relate to anti-union discrimination and interference ' and rulings on this case, including those relating to the application filed by the enterprise to dissolve the trade union and the issue of union accreditation for the collective agreement, and expects that, through the employers' organization concerned, it will also benefit from the comments of the enterprise.(c) Given the lack of observations on the part of the Government, the Committee underscores in general that Convention No.  prohibits all acts of anti-union discrimination and interference in union matters and, therefore, any practice that involves pressure to join or leave a trade union, the promotion of workers' organizations by the employer and measures aimed at dissolving a trade union by an employer, which, according to the allegations, used pressure to bring about a reduction in union membership. The Committee requests the Government to guarantee that these principles are respected and to ensure an effective remedy for the workers and the trade union.",0,2008,El Salvador
127,".The Committee last examined this case, regarding allegations concerning the refusal to grant legal personality to the Union of Salvadorian Judiciary Employees (SINEJUS), at its March  meeting, and made the following recommendations on that occasion [see rd Report, paras ' ]:(a) Considering that the refusal to grant legal personality to the SINEJUS constitutes a violation of freedom of association, the Committee expects that the SINEJUS will obtain legal personality soon and that, in the meantime, it will be able to carry out its representation activities until the constitutional issues have been resolved.(b) The Committee expects that the current Legislative Assembly will soon ratify the reform to article  of the Constitution agreed by the previous Legislative Assembly, in order to ensure that all judiciary employees enjoy the right of freedom of association. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard and to take all the necessary steps to ensure that, in accordance with Convention No. , the constitutional reform may allow exclusions from the right to organize only in the case of the armed forces and police.
.In a communication of  October , the Government indicates that legal personality has been granted to SINEJUS, by a resolution of  September . The same also applies to unions of workers in the education sector, administrative employees and municipal employees.
.The Committee notes this information with satisfaction. The Committee notes specifically that the amended Constitution was published in the Official Journal in June , and article  of the Constitution as amended establishes that:  private employers and workers, regardless of nationality, gender, race, creed or political beliefs and regardless of the activities or the nature of the work they carry out, have the right to organize freely in defence of their respective interests, founding industrial associations or trade unions. The workers of official autonomous institutions, civil servants and public and municipal employees shall also enjoy the same right. The following shall enjoy the right set out in the previous section, ... members of the judiciary ...' ,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:
.The complaint is set out in a communication dated  March  presented by the trade union organizations affiliated to the Permanent Bureau for Labour Justice (MPJL), an umbrella organization for a number of different confederations, federations and trade unions in El Salvador which support the complaint. The World Federation of Trade Unions (Americas Region) supported the complaint in a communication dated  March . The MPJL organizations presented new allegations in a communication dated  June . The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  June .
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  March , the trade union organizations affiliated to the MPJL allege that on  November , the Ministry of Labour and Social Security (MINTRAB) in an official decision refused to grant legal personality to the SINEJUS. The decision in question states that  the application for legal personality made by the new union called the Union of Salvadorian Judiciary Employees (SINEJUS) is rejected'  which violates the right of judiciary employees to organize.
.According to the complainant organizations, on  September , three judiciary employees agreed to call a constituent meeting for the purpose of establishing the SINEJUS, inviting all judiciary employees wishing to do so to attend; this was after El Salvador had ratified Convention No. . The date for the meeting was set for  September , in room B- on the fourth floor of union premises in San Salvador, and at the general meeting the union was formally established, a provisional executive was elected and the union s statutes were adopted.
.On  September , one week after the constituent meeting, MINTRAB was asked to grant legal personality and thus formal legal recognition to the union as having been legally constituted, and the application was accompanied by the documents required by law, namely, the official announcement of the constituent meeting, the notarial act confirming the constitution of the union, the list of constituent members, and two copies of the approved statutes. MINTRAB received the application, which remained pending and subject to final approval.
.The complainant organizations add that as the request by the SINEJUS was being examined by MINTRAB, the Constitutional Affairs Chamber of the Supreme Court on  October  ruled that the expression  without distinction whatsoever' in Article  of Convention No.  (in connection with the right of workers to establish organizations) is unconstitutional, a ruling announced publicly on  October .
.Two days after the public announcement, MINTRAB decided not to grant legal personality to the SINEJUS on the grounds that public service employees do not have the right to organize, according to the ruling of four judges of the Constitutional Affairs Chamber. According to point III of the ministerial decision, based on section  of the Constitutional Procedures Act,  the definitive ruling shall not be subject to appeal and shall be in general terms binding on state bodies, officials and authorities, and all persons natural or legal' 
.The SINEJUS applied for legal personality  days before the ruling of unconstitutionality referred to previously. A ruling of unconstitutionality has effect ex nunc ( henceforth' , that is to say, concerns future acts only, in order to maintain the principle of legal certainty that applies in Salvadorian law.
.The denial of legal personality to the SINEJUS not only violates the right to unionize but also exposes the absence of good faith on the part of the State in its failure to meet its international obligations. This attitude defies the principle of international law that pacta sunt servanda, that is to say, all international agreements must be complied with and domestic law may not be invoked to justify non-compliance with a treaty; it is a breach of international law and an affront to the good faith on which relations between States must be based as regards the full and effective observance of the international instruments which they adopt.
.The complainant organizations recall that the ILO s Freedom of Association Committee has on a number of occasions recognized that the denial of the right of public employees to organize is a serious violation of freedom of association.
.El Salvador, according to the complainant organizations, has shown manifest bad faith in respect of compliance with its international obligations, despite being urged by the ILO for a number of years to make the necessary amendments to its legislation.
.It should be recalled that in , the Salvadorian Government gave an undertaking to the countries of the European Union (EU) to ratify this Convention in the context of negotiations to extend tariff preferences in trade between El Salvador and the EU. To that end, on  April , the President set up the National Commission for Labour Modernization (CONAMOL), whose mandate includes examining Conventions Nos  and  with a view to indicating ways of facilitating ratification.
.Subsequently, on  October , CONAMOL recommended reforming the Constitution of the Republic and announced that in April , it would present a number of proposals to the Legislative Assembly with a view to facilitating ratification of both Conventions.
.In April, , however, the Executive did not present any proposal for reforming the Constitution, nor indeed were any statements made on this by CONAMOL or other competent officials, with the exception of the Minister of Economic Affairs who, during the penultimate working day of the previous session of the legislature, attempted to shift responsibility for financial losses that might be incurred by some companies from the Executive to the legislative authority. In El Salvador, constitutional amendments require the agreement of both chambers of the legislature, one of which approves and the other formally ratifies any amendments. The assembly changes every three years.
.Under these circumstances, according to the complainant organizations, the Government deliberately delayed the constitutional reform process. On  August , the Conventions were ratified as a result of pressure mainly from foreign companies operating in the country. One year after this, however, came the Supreme Court ruling that the phrase  without distinction whatsoever' in Article  of Convention No.  is unconstitutional.
.In its communication of  June , the complainant organizations reiterate their complaint and communicate the text of the Supreme Court ruling in question.
.The complainant organizations also supply a copy of the report by the Office of the Human Rights Ombudsman severely critical of the Supreme Court s interpretation in the ruling in question. In their view, that interpretation was outdated, and they point out that one of the judges dissented.
.In its communication of  June , the Government states with regard to the allegation concerning the denial of legal personality to the SINEJUS that the General Labour Directorate, in a decision dated  November , rejected the application for legal personality on the following grounds:(a) The Constitutional Affairs Chamber of the Supreme Court ruled at . a.m. on  October  that",1,2008,El Salvador
128," it is hereby decided in general and binding terms that the expression  without distinction whatsoever' in Article  of the ILO s Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention is unconstitutional because it contravenes article () of the Constitution, inasmuch as the wording of the Convention in question extends the right of freedom of association to public employees who are not covered by the constitutional definition of those who enjoy that right' (b) Section  of the Constitutional Procedures Act stipulates that  the definitive ruling shall not be subject to appeal and shall be in general terms binding on state bodies, officials and authorities, and all persons natural or legal' 
.The Government adds that the MINTRAB is obliged to respect the Supreme Court ruling, which prevents it from granting legal personality to organizations of public employees. Article  of the Constitution states that  All civilian or military officials shall before taking up their duties swear an oath of loyalty to the Republic and undertake to abide by the Constitution, that text taking precedence over any laws, decrees, orders or official decisions that are inconsistent with its provisions; and shall undertake to discharge faithfully the duties of their office, assuming liability for any contravention in accordance with the laws'  this provision must be read in conjunction with section  of the Constitutional Procedure Act referred to above.
.Notwithstanding the above, the ruling of the Constitutional Affairs Chamber of the Supreme Court may be superseded in the event of ratification of the proposed amendment to article  of the Constitution recognizing freedom of association for public servants. It should be noted that the outgoing Legislative Assembly in  approved the amendment, and it is expected that the incoming Legislative Assembly in  will formally ratify it in accordance with the established legal procedure.
.At the same time, the Government states that according to the complainant trade unions, the application for legal personality was made  days before the ruling of unconstitutionality, and they are therefore exempted from the effects of that ruling, which can in no case be retroactive. In the Government s view, there is no legal basis here for claiming an  acquired right'  The MINTRAB has effectively done no more than apply the ruling of the Constitutional Affairs Chamber in accordance with article  of the Constitution and section  of the Constitutional Procedures Act.
.The Committee notes that in the present case, the trade union organizations allege refusal to grant legal personality to the SINEJUS by a decision of the Ministry of Labour, despite the fact that the legal requirements had been met.
.The Committee notes the Government s statements to the effect that the General Labour Directorate in a decision dated  November  rejected the application of the SINEJUS for legal personality on the grounds that: () the Constitutional Affairs Chamber of the Supreme Court on  October  ruled that under the terms of the Constitution, public servants are not covered by the definition of those who enjoy the right of freedom of association, and declared unconstitutional the expression  without distinction whatsoever' in Article  of ILO Convention No.  ( Workers and employers, without distinction whatsoever, shall have the right to establish and, subject only to the rules of the organisation concerned, to join organisations of their own choosing without previous authorization' ; () according to the Constitution and the Constitutional Procedures Act, the MINTRAB is bound to respect the Supreme Court ruling and is prevented from granting legal personality to an organization of public employees; and () the outgoing Legislative Assembly in  approved the reform of article  of the Constitution recognizing freedom of association for public employees; it is expected that the incoming Legislative Assembly of  will formally ratify it and implement the constitutional reform in question, in accordance with the established legal procedure.
.While taking note of the Government s arguments, the Committee recalls that the principles of freedom of association allow exclusion from the right to organize ' a fundamental right ' only in the case of the armed forces and police. Consequently, all other workers, including judiciary employees, must be allowed freely to establish representative organizations of their own choosing. Under these circumstances, the Committee considers that refusal to grant legal personality to the SINEJUS is a violation of freedom of association, particularly in view of the fact that El Salvador has ratified Convention No. .
.The Committee expects that the current Legislative Assembly will shortly ratify the reform to article  of the Constitution agreed by the previous Legislative Assembly, in order to allow the right to organize to all judiciary employees, and deeply regrets that the process has been delayed. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard, and to take all the necessary steps to ensure that, in accordance with Convention No. , the constitutional reform may allow exceptions to the right to organize only in the case of the armed forces and police. The Committee expects that the SINEJUS will soon obtain legal personality, and that in the meantime it will be able to carry out its representation activities until the constitutional issues have been resolved.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) Considering that the refusal to grant legal personality to the SINEJUS constitutes a violation of freedom of association, the Committee expects that the SINEJUS will obtain legal personality soon and that, in the meantime, it will be able to carry out its representation activities until the constitutional issues have been resolved.(b) The Committee expects that the current Legislative Assembly will soon ratify the reform to article  of the Constitution agreed by the previous Legislative Assembly, in order to ensure that all judiciary employees enjoy the right of freedom of association. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard and to take all the necessary steps to ensure that, in accordance with Convention No. , the constitutional reform may allow exclusions from the right to organize only in the case of the armed forces and police.",1,2008,El Salvador
129,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the Trade Union of Workers in the Tourism, Hotel and Allied Industries (STITHS) dated  October . That organization sent additional information in a communication dated  May .
.At its November  meeting, the Committee observed that, despite the time which had elapsed since the submission of the complaint, it had not received the observations of the Government. The Committee drew the attention of the Government to the fact that, in accordance with the procedural rules set out in paragraph  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body, it might present a report on the substance of the case at its next meeting, even if all the Government s observations had not been received in due time, and requested the Government to transmit its observations as a matter of urgency [see st Report, para. ]. To date, no observations have been received from the Government.
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee regrets that, despite the time that has elapsed, the Government has not provided the information requested, although it has on a number of occasions, including through an urgent appeal, been invited to present its comments and observations on the case.
.Under these circumstances, and in accordance with the applicable rules of procedure [see th Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session], the Committee is bound to present a report on this case without the benefit of the observations it had hoped to receive from the Government.
.The Committee recalls that the purpose of the whole procedure set up in the International Labour Organization for the examination of allegations of violations of freedom of association is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact. The Committee is convinced that, if the procedure protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side should recognize the importance of formulating detailed replies to the allegations brought against them, so as to allow the Committee to undertake an objective examination.
.The Committee observes that in this case the complainant trade union alleges violation of clause  of the collective agreement in force in the Salvadorian Tourism Institute (ISTU) concerning regrading or wage adjustment, despite the fact that the representatives of that Institute had promised, on  July , to carry out the wage adjustment within  days (a copy of the record was sent by the trade union). On the contrary, according to the trade union, on  September , the Director-General of the Institute wrote to the Ministry of Finance cancelling the request for a wage adjustment which he had submitted some days previously (a copy of the letter was sent by the trade union).
.The Committee notes the latest allegations of the complainant trade union concerning the dissolution of the ISTU and the establishment of the Family Recreation Institute (IRF) (announced by the enterprise on  August ), which means that the collective agreement in force, including the clause on employment stability, will no longer be applied in the new institution.
.The Committee observes that it is clear from the statement issued by the ISTU that the dissolution of that Institute and the establishment of the IRF is provided for in a draft decree, from which it concludes that the decision and the manner of its implementation were not discussed in consultation with the complainant trade union. In this regard, the Committee regrets this lack of consultation on a matter that is vital to the trade union and to the workers' interests. It also regrets the failure to observe the agreement reached between the trade union and the ISTU on the implementation of clause  of the collective agreement in force.
.The Committee emphasizes the principle that mutual respect for the commitment undertaken in collective agreements is an important element of the right to bargain collectively and should be upheld in order to establish labour relations on stable and firm ground, and that failure to implement a collective agreement, even on a temporary basis, violates the right to bargain collectively, as well as the principle of bargaining in good faith [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, , paras  and ]. The Committee also recalls that the closing of an enterprise should not in itself result in the extinction of the obligations resulting from the collective agreement, in particular as regards compensation in the case of dismissal [see Digest, op. cit., para. ].
.The Committee requests the Government to guarantee respect for these principles. The Committee requests the Government to ensure that all of the clauses of the collective agreement concluded with the ISTU relating to statutory benefits are applied in the case of the ISTU employees who lose their jobs.
.As regards the second allegation, that the collective agreement concluded between the ISTU and the trade union was submitted, pursuant to section  of the Labour Code, for approval by the Ministry of Tourism (to which the autonomous official institution ISTU belongs), after the Ministry of Finance gave its opinion, the Committee recalls the principle that:The requirement of previous approval by a government authority to make an agreement valid might discourage the use of voluntary collective bargaining between employers and workers for the settlement of conditions of employment. Even though a refusal by the authorities to give their approval may sometimes be the subject of an appeal to the courts, the system of previous administrative authorization in itself is contrary to the whole system of voluntary negotiation.
.The Committee has also considered that the exercise of financial powers by the public authorities in a manner that prevents or limits compliance with collective agreements already entered into by public bodies is not consistent with the principles of free collective bargaining [see Digest, op. cit., paras  and ]. However, there is nothing to prevent the budgetary authorities from issuing reports either before or during the bargaining process. In these circumstances, the Committee considers that section  of the Labour Code violates Article  of Convention No. , which lays down the principle of free and voluntary negotiation between the parties, and requests the Government to take steps to bring the legislation into conformity with Convention No. . The Committee recalls that in the case of salary negotiations in the public service, in so far as the income of public enterprises and bodies depends on state budgets, it would not be objectionable ' after wide discussion and consultation between the concerned employers' and employees' organizations in a system having the confidence of the parties ' for wage ceilings to be fixed in state budgetary laws, and neither would it be a matter for criticism that the Ministry of Finance prepare a report prior to the commencement of collective bargaining with a view to ensuring respect of such ceilings (see Digest, op.cit., para. ).
.The Committee also regrets the fact that in this case the new collective agreement concluded between the parties after long and intense negotiations could not enter into force as it was not approved by the Ministry of Tourism, which itself has to seek an opinion from the Ministry of Finance. The Committee observes, however, that the entire matter of this collective agreement has become moot with the decision to dissolve the ISTU.
.The Committee draws the legislative aspects of this case to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to guarantee respect of the principles referred to in the conclusions as regards observance of collective agreements and consultation with trade unions on matters affecting the workers' interests. The Committee requests the Government to ensure that all of the clauses of the collective agreement relating to statutory benefits are applied to the ISTU employees who lose their jobs as a result of the dissolution.(b) The Committee requests the Government to take steps to amend section  of the Labour Code so that collective agreements that have been concluded and signed by the parties in an autonomous official institution do not have to be submitted for approval by the Ministry of Tourism, which itself has to seek the opinion of the Ministry of Finance; in this regard, the Committee regrets the fact that the collective agreement negotiated by the complainant trade union and the ISTU could not be applied for that reason.(c) The Committee draws the legislative aspects of this case to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.",1,2007,El Salvador
130,".The Committee last examined this case, which concerns allegations of violations of the collective agreement in force in the Social Fund for Housing, at its March  meeting. On that occasion, the Committee noted that the complainant trade union and the Social Fund for Housing were endeavouring to resolve the problems relating to the implementation of the terms of the collective agreement in force, requested the Government to keep it informed in this respect, and encouraged the parties to resolve their differences in the very near future [see th Report, paras ' ].
.In communications dated  March and  and  July , the Government states that the situation regarding the present case has not significantly changed in the time that has elapsed since attempts were made to promote direct social dialogue between the parties concerning problems arising from the implementation of the collective agreement. The Government therefore considers that the parties are attempting to resolve those problems directly.
.The Committee takes note of this information. When it last examined this case, the Committee emphasized the principle that ' collective) agreements should be binding on the parties'  and that  mutual respect for the commitment undertaken is an important element of the right to bargain collectively and should be upheld in order to establish labour relations on stable and firm ground' [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth edition, , paras  and ]. Under these circumstances, taking into account the time that has elapsed since the submission of the complaint (in June ), the Committee firmly expects that the parties will reach an agreement relating to the implementation of the collective agreement in force in the near future, but also suggests that it may be necessary to resort to alternative legal mechanisms for settling disputes or submit this matter to the judicial authority.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the Workers' Trade Union of the Social Fund for Housing (SITRAFOSVI) dated  June . The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  August .
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  June , SITRAFOSVI alleges that the management of the Social Fund for Housing, an autonomous institution under the Ministry of Public Works, is violating the terms of the collective labour agreement in force relating to the rights of the trade union (negotiation of salary increases, consultation of the trade union on certain matters) and to internal advancement, job stability, holidays and a fund for the protection of workers to guarantee them a decent retirement and payments for services rendered in cases of resignation or dismissal.
.In its communication dated  August , the Government states that, according to the records of the General Labour Directorate of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare, SITRAFOSVI requested a conciliation meeting on  July  with the legal representative of the Social Fund for Housing in order to address the failure to comply with some of the terms of the collective agreement signed by both parties. The conciliation meeting took place on  August , at which the employer s administrative and legal representative claimed that the trade union s allegations could not be aired at that meeting because, as well as being untrue, they were characteristic of a collective dispute of a legal nature which, in accordance with article  of the Labour Code, should come under the jurisdiction of a labour judge.
.The Government adds that SITRAFOSVI representatives stated that they did not intend to go to court, and were rather requesting a hearing with the president of the Social Fund for Housing in order to maintain a direct dialogue with the employer, a request that did not receive any response from the employer s representative at that moment.
.The Government stresses that the trade union did not request the intervention of the labour inspectorate, which monitors compliance with labour legislation, nor did it assert its rights using the legal protection mechanism available through the courts.
.The Government also states that, on  June , the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare held a meeting with the trade union and, after listening to its concerns, exercised his good offices to convince the president of the Social Fund for Housing to receive the trade union members and give them an opportunity to directly address the labour issues in question. The president of the Social Fund for Housing therefore agreed to meet them the following day, with the aim of listening to and initiating a direct dialogue with the workers in order to seek solutions or mutually satisfactory agreements.
.The Government indicates that to date, the trade union has not repeated its request for the Ministry to intervene, and therefore it presumes that the issues raised in this communication are being addressed through direct negotiation.
.The Committee observes that in the present complaint the complainant trade union alleges the violation of various terms of the collective agreement in force at the Social Fund for Housing since it was concluded in .
.The Committee takes note of the statements of the Government, according to which: () on  August , a conciliation meeting took place, at which the employer claimed that the conflict in question came within the competence of the judicial authorities and the trade union requested a direct dialogue with the employer; and () the trade union did not request the intervention of the labour inspectorate, nor did it initiate legal proceedings. The Committee notes with interest that the Minister of Labour exercised, on  June , his good offices to encourage the parties to address their issues directly, to which the president of the Social Fund for Housing agreed.
.The Committee concludes that the parties are endeavouring to resolve the problems concerning the implementation of the terms of the collective agreement. However, since the allegations suggest that these violations are serious and given that the first conciliation meeting with the management was held in , the Committee encourages the parties to resolve their differences in the very near future and reach a mutually satisfactory agreement and it requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect. The Committee emphasizes the principle that (collective) agreements should be binding on the parties [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth edition, , para. ] and that mutual respect for the commitment undertaken is an important element of the right to bargain collectively and should be upheld in order to establish labour relations on stable and firm ground [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. The Committee hopes that the parties will take full account of these principles in the future.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee notes that the complainant trade union and the Social Fund for Housing are endeavouring to resolve the problems relating to implementation of the terms of the collective agreement in force, requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect, and encourages the parties to resolve their differences in the very near future.(b) The Committee hopes that the parties will take full account of the principles formulated in the conclusions regarding the importance of mutual respect for commitments undertaken in collective agreements.",1,2007,El Salvador
131,".The Committee last examined this complaint at its June  meeting [see th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (June ), paras ' ].
.The Government sent new observations in a communication dated  May . In a communication dated  August , the International Union of Food, Agricultural, Hotel, Restaurant, Catering, Tobacco and Allied Workers' Associations (IUF) supported the complaint of the complainant federation (FESTSSABHRA).
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee observes that the pending issues refer to allegations of anti-union dismissals at the Calvoconservas El Salvador SA de CV enterprise and the establishment of a trade union within the enterprise made up of staff in positions of trust and executive posts.
.With respect to the pending allegations of dismissals of union officials, the Committee notes that on  March , the trade union member and former union official, Mr Jos Joaqun Reyes, signed a severance document for the liquidation of benefits due, which served as a voluntary termination of the employment contract that bound him to the enterprise, freeing it of any claim. The Committee also notes, with interest, that according to the Government, in accordance with a judicial ruling (that the Government encloses), the enterprise reinstated the union official, Mr Jos Antonio Valladares Torres, in his post on the grounds that he could not be dismissed on account of his trade union immunity.
.With regard to the request made during the previous examination of the case to provide the text of the rulings relating to other trade union members, the Committee notes the Government s indication that the first instance and appeal rulings that it provides, concerning Ms Berta Aurelia Menjvar (founding member of the trade union branch) and Mr Roberto Carlos Hernndez (union official), absolved the enterprise of the payment of compensation for wrongful dismissal and other employment benefits. The Committee observes that it appears from the rulings handed down concerning Ms Berta Aurelia Menjvar (founding member of the trade union branch, according to the allegations) that this trade union member did not ask to be reinstated but rather requested the payment of compensation for wrongful dismissal, which was denied as she was unable to directly prove her dismissal (the only thing that was proven, on the basis of witness statements, was that she worked for more than two days, in a relationship of subordination, for the enterprise and that there was no evidence of a written contract); in any event, Ms Berta Aurelia Menjvar did not lodge her appeal within the legally stipulated period of  days following the alleged dismissal. As for the rulings relating to Mr Roberto Carlos Hernndez (union official, according to the allegations), it appears from the rulings that this union official did not ask to be reinstated, but instead requested the payment of wages that had not been paid for reasons attributable to the employer; the ruling upholds the fact that the parties were bound by an employment relationship and that Mr Roberto Carlos Hernndez had the status of trade union official, but does not uphold the dismissal (allegedly on  March ) and notes that the legal action was not lodged within the legally stipulated time frame. Taking account of these rulings and the fact that the alleged acts date back to , the Committee will not pursue its examination of these allegations.
.Concerning the alleged intimidation against trade unionists, in particular the stationing inside the plant of armed guards who called on workers not to join the SGTIPAC, the Committee had requested the Government to conduct an investigation without delay into these allegations and to keep it informed of the final outcome. The Committee notes that in compliance with this recommendation the Government ordered an inspection of the enterprise in December , which found that the SGTIPAC trade union officials and workers denied the presence of guards or of intimidation against workers or trade unionists. Given these circumstances, and unless the complainant organizations provide additional information on the subject, the Committee will not pursue its examination of these allegations.
.As to the inquiry requested by the Committee into the alleged recognition as a legal entity of a trade union (the Union of Workers of Calvoconservas El Salvador SA de CV) within the company, comprising company chiefs and trusted individuals, as well as the negotiation of a collective agreement between that union and the company, the Committee notes the Government s statements, following the corresponding investigation, to the effect that: () according to the allegations, five founding members of the STECCESSACV had the status of company chiefs and  founding members were supervisors, which is why, under prevailing legislative provisions, they were representatives of the employer; () the enterprise agreed that this trade union could provide membership forms for new staff, which constitutes an act of interference committed by the enterprise in violation of ILO Conventions Nos  and . This is the responsibility of the former Ministry, which granted legal personality to a union that had over  per cent of members with employer representation functions, which led to the union in question negotiating a collective agreement; () this complicates the situation, as under prevailing legislation there can only be one collective agreement that applies to all workers; () consequently, the collective agreement request submitted by the representatives of the other trade union (SGTIPAC), the complainant organization in the present case, was not declared admissible; () the next time the collective agreement is reviewed this situation can be rectified by establishing an allied agreement (between trade unions) in order to achieve a true collective agreement. Under these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to ensure that unions with a substantial membership with employer representation functions should not be able to engage in collective bargaining on behalf of the other workers.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to ensure that unions with a substantial membership with employer representation functions should not be able to engage in collective bargaining on behalf of the other workers.(b) Concerning alleged intimidation against trade unionists, including the stationing inside the plant of armed guards, the Committee will not pursue its examination of these allegations, unless the complainant organizations provide additional information on the subject.
.The Committee last examined this case at its March  meeting [see th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session, paras ' ].
.In the absence of any reply from the Government, the Committee has been obliged to postpone its examination of the case on two occasions. At its meeting in November  [see th Report, para. ], the Committee addressed an urgent appeal to the Government, drawing its attention to the fact that, in accordance with the procedural rules set out in paragraph  of its th Report (), approved by the Governing Body, it may present a report on the substance of the case at its next meeting even if the information or observations requested have not been received in due time. To date the Government has not sent any information.

.At its March  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendations [see th Report, para. ]:(a) As regards the allegations of anti-union dismissal of Ms Berta Aurelia Menjivar (founder member of the trade union branch), Mr Joaqun Reyes (member and former union official), Mr Jos Antonio Valladares Torres and Mr Roberto Carlos Hernndez (union officials), and non-payment of wages owed to them, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the final outcome of the legal proceedings against Mr Jos Antonio Valladares Torres and to send a copy of the court rulings already given regarding the other union officials concerned.(b) Concerning the alleged intimidation against trade unionists, in particular the stationing inside the plant of armed guards who called on workers not to join the SGTIPAC, the Committee requests the Government to conduct an investigation without delay into these allegations and to keep it informed of the final outcome.(c) As regards the alleged recognition as a legal entity of a trade union (the Union of Workers of Calvoconservas El Salvador SA de CV) within the company, comprising company heads and trusted individuals, as well as the negotiation of a collective agreement between that union and the company, the Committee once again requests the Government to conduct an investigation without delay into these allegations and to keep it informed of the final outcome.
.The Committee observes that in this case the complainant organizations allege anti-union dismissals, acts of intimidation against trade unionists and anti-union practices at a company (recognition of an employer-controlled trade union and negotiation of a collective agreement with that trade union).
.The Committee deeply regrets to",1,2007,El Salvador

.At its previous meeting the Committee made the following recommendations [see st Report, para. ]:(a) As regards the alleged anti-union dismissal of Ms Berta Aurelia Menjivar (founder member of the trade union branch), Mr Joaqun Reyes (union member and former official), Mr Jos Antonio Valladares Torres and Mr Roberto Carlos Hernndez (union officials) and the non-payment of the salaries to which they are entitled, the Committee requests the Government to inform it of the outcome of the procedure for the imposition of a fine initiated by the Labour Inspectorate against the company, and to continue to recommend to the company that it reinstate those dismissed.(b) With regard to the allegations of intimidation against trade unionists, the Committee requests the Government to reply specifically to the allegation concerning the stationing within the plant of armed guards who call on the workers not to join SGTIPAC.(c) The Committee notes with regret that the Government has not replied to the allegation concerning the management s refusal to receive foreign trade union officials, in particular from IUF and Comisiones Obreras de Espaa, despite having indicated or suggested that it would do so. The Committee requests the Government to ascertain the facts of the matter and, if it turns out that the company acted in the manner reported by the complainant organizations, to inform the company that such an attitude does not lead to harmonious labour relations based on mutual respect and dialogue.(d) As regards the alleged recognition as a legal entity of a union (Union of Workers of Calvoconservas El Salvador SA de CV) within the company, comprising company heads and trusted individuals, as well as the negotiation of a collective agreement between that union and the company, the Committee regrets that the Government has made no reference either to the alleged presence of company heads and trusted staff within the said union or to the negotiation of the collective agreement by that union. The Committee requests the Government to carry out an investigation into the alleged facts without delay and to keep it informed in that regard.
.In its communication of  May , the Government makes the following observations.
.As regards recommendation (a) regarding the alleged anti-union dismissal of Ms Berta Aurelia Menjivar (founder member of the trade union branch), Mr Joaqun Reyes (union member and former official), Mr Jos Antonio Valladares Torres and Mr Roberto Carlos Hernndez (union officials), and the non-payment of the salaries to which they are entitled, the Government indicates that in the case of Mr Roberto Carlos Hernndez, social relations and welfare secretary of the Sectional Executive Board for the Calvoconservas El Salvador SA de CV of the General Trade Union of Workers in the Fishing and Allied Industries (SGTIPAC), the special inspection undertaken has found that there had been contraventions of sections , () and  of the Labour Code for de facto dismissal, non-payment of salary arrears due to the employer s action, and non-payment of annual leave. As a result of this, the employer was fined US$., that is, $. for each contravention.
.As regards the dismissal of Ms Berta Aurelia Menjivar (founder member of the trade union branch) and of Mr Joaqun Reyes (member and former union official), Mr Jos Antonio Valladares Torres and Mr Roberto Carlos Hernndez (union officials), the Government states that on  May , the Ministry sent representatives to the company to interview the human resources director. As regards Ms Menjivar, the director in question states that, in the course of the legal action brought against the company, a definitive ruling in the company s favour was given on  July . An appeal was lodged against that ruling, which was upheld by the First Chamber of Labour Affairs of San Salvador.
.As regards Mr Roberto Carlos Hernndez, in the legal proceedings against the company for non-payment of salaries before the Fourth Labour Court of San Salvador, a ruling was given on  September  in the company s favour, and was upheld by the Second Labour Chamber.
.As regards Mr Joaqun Reyes, the Government states that, at the official s request, a special inspection was carried out on  March  by the Special Unit for Gender and Prevention of Discrimination. The inspection found that the union official in question voluntarily agreed to the termination of his employment contract on  March .
.With regard to Mr Jos Antonio Valladares, the Government states that in the proceedings initiated against him before the Civil Court of the Department of La Unin, a ruling is still pending. The Government adds that according to the record of monthly contributions to the national social security fund, the official continues to work for the company.
.As regards recommendation (c), concerning the management s refusal to receive foreign trade union officials, the Government states that according to the human resources director of the company, premises have always been provided for dialogue and, if on one occasion it was not possible to receive foreign trade union officials, it was because of other engagements which could not be postponed. The director adds that since that time he has held meetings with International Union of Food workers (IUF) officials.
.The Committee takes note of the Government s observations concerning the recommendations made in the previous examination of this case.
.As regards recommendation (a) concerning the alleged anti-union dismissal of Ms Berta Aurelia Menjivar (founder member of the trade union branch), Mr Joaqun Reyes (union member and former official), Mr Jos Antonio Valladares Torres and Mr Roberto Carlos Hernndez (union officials) and the non-payment of the salaries to which they are entitled, the Committee recalls that in its previous examination of the case, it requested the Government to inform it of the outcome of the procedure for the imposition of a fine initiated by the labour inspectorate against the company, and to continue to recommend to the company that it reinstate those dismissed. In this regard, the Committee notes that according to the Government: () in the case of Mr Roberto Carlos Hernndez, the special inspection revealed that there had been contraventions of sections , (), and  of the Labour Code for de facto dismissal of the worker in question, non-payment of salary arrears brought about by the employer, and failure to pay annual vacation benefits, and imposed a fine of $.; () as regards the dismissal of Ms Berta Aurelia Menjivar (founder member of the trade union branch), the human resources director reported that, in the legal proceedings against the company before the First Labour Court of San Salvador, a definitive ruling was given on  July  in the company s favour, and upheld by the First Labour Chamber of San Salvador; () as regards Mr Joaqun",0,2007,El Salvador
133,"Reyes, at his request a special inspection was carried out on  March  by the Special Unit for Gender and Prevention of Discrimination and found that he had voluntarily agreed to termination of his employment contract on  March ; () in the case of Mr Roberto Carlos Hernndez, in the legal proceedings against the company for non-payment of salary arrears before the Fourth Labour Court of San Salvador, a ruling was given on  September  in the company s favour and upheld by the Second Labour Affairs Chamber; and () lastly, in the case of Mr Jos Antonio Valladares Torres, in the proceedings against him before the Civil Court of the Department of La Unin, a ruling is still pending, and according to the record of monthly social security contributions to the national social security fund, he continues to work in the company.
.The Committee takes note of this information, and recalls the importance which it attaches to sanctions against acts of anti-union discrimination established by national legislation being sufficiently dissuasive in conformity with the principles of freedom of association. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the final outcome of the proceedings against Mr Jos Antonio Valladares Torres and send a copy of the court decisions already handed down in connection with the other union officials concerned in this case.
.As regards recommendation (b) concerning the allegations of intimidation against trade unionists, and in particular the allegation concerning the stationing within the plant of armed guards who called on workers not to join the SGTIPAC, the Committee regrets that the Government has not sent its observations in this regard. The Committee recalls that freedom of association can only be exercised in conditions free from pressure and threats against trade union officials and members, and requests the Government to conduct an investigation without delay into the allegations and to keep it informed of the final outcome.
.As regards recommendation (c) concerning the company s refusal to receive foreign trade union officials, in particular from the IUF and Comisiones Obreras de Espaa, the Committee notes that the Government, in its observations, refers to the company s reply which indicates its commitment to dialogue and states that, since the allegations were made, it has held meetings with the IUF. The Committee recalls the importance that it attaches to the principle that no obstacle should be placed in the way of the affiliation of workers' organizations, in full freedom, with any international organization of workers of their own choosing [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth edition, , para.].
.As regards recommendation (d), the Committee recalls that it had requested the Government to carry out an investigation without delay into the alleged recognition as a legal entity of a union (the Union of Workers of Calvoconservas El Salvador SA de CV) within the company, comprising company heads and trusted individuals, as well as the negotiation of a collective agreement between that union and the company. The Committee regrets that the Government has not sent its observations in this respect and once again requests the Government to conduct an investigation without delay into these allegations and to keep it informed of the final outcome.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) As regards the allegations of anti-union dismissal of Ms Berta Aurelia Menjivar (founder member of the trade union branch), Mr Joaqun Reyes (member and former union official), Mr Jos Antonio Valladares Torres and Mr Roberto Carlos Hernndez (union officials), and non-payment of wages owed to them, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the final outcome of the legal proceedings against Mr Jos Antonio Valladares Torres and to send a copy of the court rulings already given regarding the other union officials concerned.(b) Concerning the alleged intimidation against trade unionists, in particular the stationing inside the plant of armed guards who called on workers not to join the SGTIPAC, the Committee requests the Government to conduct an investigation without delay into these allegations and to keep it informed of the final outcome.(c) As regards the alleged recognition as a legal entity of a trade union (the Union of Workers of Calvoconservas El Salvador SA de CV) within the company, comprising company heads and trusted individuals, as well as the negotiation of a collective agreement between that union and the company, the Committee once again requests the Government to conduct an investigation without delay into these allegations and to keep it informed of the final outcome.
.The complaint is contained in a communication dated  June , presented by the Trade Union Confederation of El Salvador Workers (CSTS), the Trade Union Federation of Food, Beverage, Hotel, Restaurant and Agro-Industry Workers of El Salvador (FESTSSABHRA), and the General Trade Union of Workers in the Fishing and Allied Industries (SGTIPAC). FESTSSABHRA and SGTIPAC presented new allegations in communications dated  July  and  March . The Government sent its observations in communications dated  and  August .
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communication dated  June , the CSTS, the FESTSSABHRA (the El Salvador affiliate of the International Union of Food, Agricultural, Hotel, Restaurant, Catering, Tobacco and Allied Workers' Associations (IUF)) and the SGTIPAC made an official complaint against the Government of El Salvador on account of the violation of the freedom of association of the workers of the company Calvoconservas El Salvador SA de CV, a member of the consortium known as  Grupo CALVO El Salvador'  consisting in the dismissal of trade union officials and trade unionists and in general, the implementation of a campaign of anti-union intimidation against workers that has included the use of armed vigilantes, the National Civil Police and proposals to the workers in favour of the establishment of an employer-controlled trade union by the company s managers.
.The complainant organizations explain that, on Sunday,  February , the  Calvoconservas El Salvador SA de CV branch' of the SGTIPAC was formed in the port city of La Unin, El Salvador. The said union is an industry union, entitling it, under El Salvador s legislation, to set up branches in  companies concerned with the same industrial, commercial, services, social or other comparable activities'  The said union branch was officially recognized by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security on  March .
.The complainant organizations allege that Ms Berta Aurelia Menjivar, partner of Mariano Alexander Guerrero, Secretary-General of the Calvoconservas El Salvador SA de CV branch (both founders of the said union branch), was summoned on  February  by the head of human resources, who informed her that she was being dismissed on account of having had three letters of warning. The worker in question stated that that could not be possible since she had not been informed of those warnings and had received only one such letter. That being the case, she refused all attempts by the head of human resources to get her to sign any document.
.In response to a request to that effect, the Ministry of Labour conducted a special inspection on  February , in the course of which it was established that Ms Berta Aurelia Menjivar  was one of the best workers in the packaging area'  according to her own supervisor, who added that  at no time has there been any report or request to the effect that Ms Berta Aurelia Menjivar be dismissed'  These statements, which were placed on record, contradict the company s arguments to the effect that the worker in question was justifiably dismissed. Later on in the same record, it is established that Calvoconservas,  by dismissing the worker Ms Berta Aurelia Menjivar, a founder member of the Calvoconservas SA de CV branch' of SGTIPAC, infringed the provisions of article  of the Constitution of the Republic, section  of the Labour Code, which protects the founder members of trade unions against dismissal for a period of up to  days. Further to the said inspection, the company was ordered to pay the worker her unpaid wages, including those she had failed to receive on account of her dismissal, and it was recommended that she be reinstated in her post. On  March, the Ministry of Labour ascertained, in the course of a follow-up inspection, that the company had failed to remedy any of the aforementioned infringements. The worker subsequently brought her case before the courts, where it is currently at the submission of evidence stage.
.The complainants further allege that, on  September , Mr Joaqun Reyes joined the company Luis Calvo Sanz El Salvador SA de CV as a stevedore. As from October , he also held the post of relations secretary in the SGTIPAC, within the general (national) executive committee of that industrial union.
.He",0,2007,El Salvador
134,"worked in these conditions for Luis Calvo Sanz SA de CV until he was transferred to Calvo Consignataria Centroamericana SA de CV, where he worked continuously and without interruption until  March , when he was verbally dismissed by his supervisor, who said that he had problems with him on account of his trade union affiliation, that he could no longer enter the workplace, and that that order had come from the chief supervisor in the unloading area of Calvo Consignataria Centroamericana SA de CV.
.In addition, the complainant organizations state that Mr Roberto Carlos Hernndez, having taken up employment with Calvoconservas El Salvador SA de CV, was subsequently, on  March , elected to the post of relations and welfare secretary in the Calvoconservas El Salvador SA de CV branch of SGTIPAC.
.However, on turning up for work as usual on  March , he found himself confronted with a list of individuals who had been dismissed and who no longer had the right to enter the workplace but were instructed merely to make their way to the office of human resources. Having done so, he was informed by the resources manager that his dismissal was in response to a supervisor s report to the effect that he was a rebel, in reply to which he argued that his personal file contained no warning letters and that the real reason for the report was that he had recently been elected to serve as a union official. On  April , the trade unionist in question submitted a request for a special inspection to the Ministry of Labour and, subsequently, on  May , submitted a request concerning the same case to the labour courts of San Salvador. The case is currently before San Salvador s labour court No. . By way of an aggravating factor in this case, on  May , i.e. two months after the illegal dismissal of this union official, the lawyer working for Calvoconservas El Salvador presented the civil court of La Unin with a request for an individual labour judgement against the official Mr Roberto Carlos Hernndez, asking the judge to authorize the latter s dismissal without employer s liability.
.The complainants also allege that the lawyer for Calvoconservas El Salvador presented the civil court of La Unin, on  May , with a request for an individual labour judgement in order to terminate the contract, without employer s liability, of union official Mr Jos Antonio Valladares Torres, organizational and statistical secretary of the Calvoconservas El Salvador SA de CV branch of SGTIPAC, on the alleged grounds that he was absent from his work on four days during the month of November , one day in December , one day in February , one day in March  and two non-consecutive days in April . Despite the fact that the union official has documentation which proves a failure to apply the procedures of section  of the Labour Code, governing causes for dismissal without managerial responsibility, it is clear that the intention is to decapitate the executive committee of SGTIPAC in Calvoconservas El Salvador by a variety of means. It is worth noting that the lawyer for Calvoconservas El Salvador attempted to lodge the request for initiation of the said legal proceedings with a retroactive date of  April , but that the court declared his request admissible on the date of its submission, namely  May .
.The complainant organizations state that on  May , during the course of a visit to El Salvador by IUF s Latin American Regional Office, the IUF representative, Mr Carlos Amorn, accompanied by Mr Alfredo Osorio (the then Secretary-General of the FESTSSABHRA), Mr Atilio Jaimes (the then disputes secretary of the CSTS) and with the same post in FESTSSABHRA), Mr Alexander Reyes (secretary-general of the executive committee of SGTIPAC) and Mr Gilberto Garca (member of the Centre for Labour Studies and Support (CEAL)), presented himself at the Calvoconservas plant, located in the coastal city of La Unin, with the intention of holding talks with representatives of that transnational, as had previously been announced.
.Indeed, on  April , the union officials Mr Osorio and Mr Jaimes had informed the legal representative of the Calvo Group, Mr Miguel Angel Pealva, of the forthcoming visit to El Salvador, including La Unin, by IUF s Latin American Regional Office and had requested that a meeting be held between  April and  May for the purpose of discussing the recent dismissals of union officials at the Calvoconservas plant. Mr Pealva had replied that although it would not be possible for him to be there for the visit since he would be travelling, the management maintained an open-door policy and was always ready to meet with the union. Having been thus assured, the said delegation arrived at the gates of the plant on the morning of  May, from where they telephoned to request a meeting with the plant s director, Mr Antonio Huezo, who was not present on the company s premises. Mr Alfredo Osorio, who was handling arrangements, then made contact with Mr Ral Parada, the manager of Calvo Consignataria, who asked for a few minutes to consult with Mr Pealva, who, supposedly, was out of the country.
.Shortly thereafter, Mr Osorio received a call from Mr Parada informing him that he had been unable to find Mr Pealva and would therefore not receive the delegation. While this telephone conversation was taking place, a van belonging to the local police force arrived and parked beside the trade unionists. The police officers requested Mr Alexander Reyes ' whom they knew since he also lived in La Unin ' to approach the vehicle. All the members of the delegation then entered into a discussion with the officers, who said that they had been called by the Calvo company and informed that  a demonstration was taking place at the entrance to the plant' 
.Subsequently, on  May , fresh approaches were made to get the company to receive the secretary-general of Comisiones Obreras de Euskadi (Basque Workers' Commissions), Mr Josu Onaindi, who is also a member of the national executive of the Spanish confederation. An attempt was made to secure an interview with Mr Miguel Angel Pealva, the person in charge of the Calvo Group in El Salvador. Despite the fact that, following a written request and several telephone conversations with his assistant at the main headquarters of the Calvo Group in San Salvador, an assurance had been given to the branch that a member of Comisiones Obreras could be received on  May  at the plant, or even that Mr Pealva could receive the said member on  May at the company s headquarters in the capital, neither of those options materialized when the time came, and it was stated that Mr Pealva was travelling outside the country and had left no one in charge of receiving the delegation from Comisiones Obreras. According to his assistant, Mr Pealva left the curious message that he would be discussing the matter of the dismissals relating to the Calvoconservas branch of SGTIPAC with the Spanish trade unions.
.The complainants refer, moreover, to acts of anti-union intimidation within the Calvoconservas El Salvador plant as from the time at which the SGTIPAC branch was established therein. In the first instance, armed guards were stationed inside the plant with the aim of intimidating the workers in their very place of work. SGTIPAC has spoken out against this practice since, in addition to being intimidating, it is clearly a risky business to locate an armed individual within a working environment. Things have even reached the point at which the armed guards travel in the staff transfer buses, calling on workers not to join the union. All the managers of the abovementioned company use words such as  terrorists'   troublemakers' and  rebels' to refer to the SGTIPAC leaders. At the same time, they have been urging workers to establish a trade union that does not make problems for the company, in what amounts to a clear violation of freedom of association inasmuch as workers are being called upon to join an employer-controlled union.
.In its communication of  July , FESTSSABHRA reports the establishment, in that same month, of the Union of Workers of the Company Calvoconservas El Salvador, abbreviated STECCESSACV. The following employer s representatives took part in the setting up of that union: Mr Fernando Torres (chief of unloading), Ms Dora Lilian Escobar Cruz (chief of processes), Ms Cristela Vides (chief of processes), Mr Henry Aguilera (chief of packaging processes), Ms Roco Escobar (chief of human resources payments). Other managerial staff also took part, such as the chief of the maintenance store and chief of canning. The aforementioned chiefs have used their hierarchical position within the company to compel workers, especially on the day shift, to sign documents attesting to their willingness to support or join the said union, when in reality those signatures were obtained under coercion. The",0,2007,El Salvador
135,"fact is that the workers who signed the abovementioned documents did so without being allowed to have access to the entire content thereof or to have a copy. Most of them state, moreover, that they did so out of a fear of reprisals on the part of their supervisors in the event of their refusal. In the present case, the trusted employees and employer s representatives are the promoters and indeed officials of the STECCESSACV union, in violation of section  of the Labour Code. It is obvious that the said actions are aimed at establishing an employer-controlled union organization and that its promoters, sheltering behind the hierarchy principle, are coercing the workers to join it, with the latter facing a fair risk of reprisals from their own supervisors should they fail to do so. For these reasons, the Labour Inspectorate has been requested to conduct a special inspection. Nevertheless, the Ministry of Labour has recognized the said union as a legal entity.
.The complainant organizations add that the company is engaging in intimidation against unionized workers through a company that has been contracted to subject them to polygraph tests in connection with the alleged sabotage of a fork-lift truck and conveyor belt, during which they are asked questions about their union membership and about their opinions with regard to trade unionists and their activities. The complainants point out that the alleged sabotage occurred in areas that are different to those in which the members in question are employed. For all these reasons, the union has requested the Ministry of Labour to conduct a special inspection.
.In its communication of  March , SGTIPAC alleges that the aforementioned company-controlled union has negotiated the collective agreement, which was registered with the Ministry of Labour on  January . SGTIPAC has requested the Ministry to cancel the registration.
.In its communication of  August , the Government states that, as can be seen from the inspection record, the Secretariat of Labour and Social Insurance, through the General Labour Inspection Directorate, carried out the ordinary procedure for an unplanned inspection, to the effect that whenever the Conservas Calvo SA de CV workers have sought legal help, the Labour Inspectorate, through its Special Unit on Gender and the Prevention of Discrimination in Respect of Employment, has always responded to their requests in an efficient manner.
.In exercising their functions, the inspectors from the said unit have had no more in the way of powers or constraints than those laid down in the International Labour Organization s Labour Inspection Convention,  (No. ), or those contained in the Act on the Structure and Functions of the Labour and Social Welfare Sector.
.It is important to keep the foregoing very much in mind when analysing this case, since despite the fact that Calvoconservas SA de CV has justified the dismissals of the union officials Ms Berta Aurelia Menjivar, Mr Joaqun Reyes and Mr Roberto Carlos Hernndez on the grounds of disobedience vis--vis the orders of their supervisors and of being bad workers, the labour inspectors have described those dismissals as infringements of the labour legislation in force, under the terms of article  of the Constitution of the Republic and section  of the Labour Code.
.The Government adds that in the course of conducting the inspections, interviews were held with workers from the plant and workmates of those dismissed, all of whom denied the existence within the company of acts of harassment or individual pressure on the part of the employer s representatives, or of any intimidating or anti-union comments that could be considered discriminatory.
.When the respective follow-up inspections were carried out, it was noted that the infringements that the company had been found to have committed in regard to the unlawful dismissal of the union officials, as well as the arrears of unpaid salaries for reasons attributable to the employer, had not been remedied, at which point the inspection measures gave way to the procedure for imposition of the corresponding fine.
.In its communication of  August , the Government refers to the allegations relating to a new trade union within the company.
.With regard to the recognition of the Union of Workers of the Variable Capital Company Calvoconservas El Salvador (STECCESSACV) as a legal entity, the Government states that no procedure has been violated since the Secretariat of Labour and Social Insurance, through the Department of Social Organizations, has done nothing other than follow the procedure laid down in the Labour Code, no formal flaws or infringements of the laws having been observed therein or in the information submitted.
.With respect to the application of the polygraph test to Calvoconservas SA de CV workers, the Government indicates that on  July  a labour inspection was carried out during the course of which it was indeed noted that a group of  workers had been given the said test. The employer s representatives stated that in June  cases of sabotage within the company had been reported, consisting in damage to a fork-lift truck through the pouring of salt into its petrol tank and in the placing of metal parts on a conveyor belt leading to the mill. It was these acts of sabotage which made it necessary for the management to perform the polygraph test on those workers engaged in the packaging and maintenance departments and responsible for shelving, water purification and fish supplies.
.The Government adds that the workers interviewed () stated that the polygraph test had not been obligatory but, on the contrary, voluntary, and that they were unaware of acts of intimidation or discrimination for belonging to a trade union organization.
.Despite the workers having stated that they voluntarily undertook the polygraph test, the Labour Inspectorate noted in the record of the inspection in question that it warned the company against performing polygraph tests on its workers in the future and urged the company to enter into an open dialogue with the workers' representatives in the interests of settling any disagreement and creating a harmonious labour environment.
.The Committee notes that in this case the complainant organizations have presented the following allegations: () the anti-union dismissal of Ms Berta Aurelia Menjivar (founder member of the union branch ' within Calvoconservas El Salvador SA de CV ' of the SGTIPAC, Mr Joaqun Reyes (member of SGTIPAC and former official thereof), Mr Roberto Carlos Hernndez (official of the SGTIPAC branch) and Mr Jos Antonio Valladares Torres (official of the SGTIPAC branch); () the refusal by the company s management to receive officials from IUF and other organizations ( and  May ); () the intimidation of members and workers by armed guards within the company and by the company s management (including the carrying out, through another company, of polygraph tests on workers in relation to a reported sabotage and with questions in regard to the union membership of workers and their opinion concerning the activities of the union officials); () the establishment within the company of a trade union with the participation of trusted staff and various company heads, with coercion of the workers to get them to join or support the said union, as well as the granting by the Ministry of Labour of the status of legal entity to the union and registration of the collective agreement between it and the company.
.As regards the allegation relating to the anti-union dismissal of Ms Berta Aurelia Menjivar (founder member of the union branch), Mr Joaqun Reyes and Mr Roberto Carlos Hernndez (union officials) and the non-payment of the salaries to which they are entitled, the Committee notes that, according to the Government: () on the occasion of the visit of the Labour Inspectorate, the company cited disobedience vis--vis orders from the supervisors and that they were bad workers, but the Labour Inspectorate found that the company had infringed the labour legislation in regard to the protection of union founders and officials and by failing to pay salaries due following unlawful dismissal; () the company failed to remedy the infringements indicated by the Labour Inspectorate, at which point the latter s inspection measures gave way to the procedure for imposition of the fine foreseen under the corresponding legislation. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the outcome of the procedure for imposition of a fine initiated against the company, and to continue recommending to the company that it reinstate those dismissed (this recommendation stems from the Labour Inspectorate records transmitted by the complainant organizations).
.As regards the allegations of intimidation against trade unionists and acts of coercion (presence of armed guards within the plant; use by the company of words such as terrorist and troublemaker when referring to the union officials), the Committee takes note of the Government s statements to the effect that, during the inspections conducted within the company by the Labour Inspectorate, the workers unanimously denied the existence of acts of harassment or individual pressure on the part of the employer s representatives, or of any intimidating or anti-union comments. The Committee requests the Government to respond specifically to",0,2007,El Salvador
136,"the allegation concerning the stationing within the plant of armed guards who call on the workers not to join SGTIPAC.
.As regards the allegation relating to the subjection of workers to polygraph tests in connection with alleged sabotage, with questions being put to the workers regarding their union membership and their opinion regarding the union officials and their activities, the Committee takes note of the Government s statement that: () on  July , a labour inspection was carried out in the course of which it was noted that a group of  workers had indeed undergone the aforementioned test. The employer s representatives stated that in June  cases of sabotage within the company had been reported, consisting in damage to a fork-lift truck through the pouring of salt into its petrol tank and the placing of metal parts on a conveyor belt leading to the mill; () it was these acts of sabotage which made it necessary for the management to perform the polygraph test on those workers engaged in the packaging and maintenance departments and responsible for shelving, water purification and fish supplies; () the () workers interviewed by the Labour Inspectorate stated that the polygraph test had not been obligatory but, on the contrary, voluntary, and that (as is indicated in the previous paragraph) they were unaware of acts of intimidation or discrimination for belonging to a trade union organization; () despite the workers having stated that they voluntarily undertook the polygraph test, the Labour Inspectorate noted in the record of the inspection in question that it warned the company against performing polygraph tests on its workers in the future and urged the company to enter into an open dialogue with the workers' representatives in the interests of settling any disagreement and creating a harmonious labour environment. In view of these explanations, the Committee will not pursue its examination of the allegations relating to the polygraph tests.
.The Committee notes with regret, moreover, that the Government has not replied to the allegation relating to the refusal by the management to receive foreign union officials, particularly from IUF and Comisiones Obreras de Espaa, despite having indicated or suggested that it would do so. The Committee requests the Government to ascertain the facts of the matter and, if it turns out that the company acted in the manner reported by the complainant organizations, that it inform the company that such an attitude does not lead to harmonious labour relations based on mutual respect and dialogue.
.With regard to the alleged recognition as a legal entity of a union (Union of Workers of Calvoconservas El Salvador SA de CV) within the company, comprising company heads and trusted individuals, as well as coercion and intimidation in an attempt to get workers to join it and the negotiation of a collective agreement between that union and the company, the Committee takes note of the Government s statement that the granting by the Ministry of Labour of legal entity status was done in pursuance of the legal procedure laid down in the Labour Code, in the absence of any observed formal flaws or infringements of the relevant legislation. The Committee notes that the Labour Inspectorate, as the Government states, was informed by the workers that they were unaware of acts of intimidation on the part of the company.
.The Committee regrets that the Government has made no mention of the alleged presence of company heads and trusted staff in the establishment of the aforementioned union or of the negotiation by it of a collective agreement. The Committee requests the Government to carry out an investigation without delay and to keep it informed in that regard.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	As regards the alleged anti-union dismissal of Ms Berta Aurelia Menjivar (founder member of the trade union branch), Mr Joaqun Reyes (union member and former official), Mr Jos Antonio Valladares Torres and Mr Roberto Carlos Hernndez (union officials) and the non-payment of the salaries to which they are entitled, the Committee requests the Government to inform it of the outcome of the procedure for the imposition of a fine initiated by the Labour Inspectorate against the company, and to continue to recommend to the company that it reinstate those dismissed.(b)	With regard to the allegations of intimidation against trade unionists, the Committee requests the Government to reply specifically to the allegation concerning the stationing within the plant of armed guards who call on the workers not to join SGTIPAC.(c)	The Committee notes with regret that the Government has not replied to the allegation concerning the management s refusal to receive foreign trade union officials, in particular from IUF and Comisiones Obreras de Espaa, despite having indicated or suggested that it would do so. The Committee requests the Government to ascertain the facts of the matter and, if it turns out that the company acted in the manner reported by the complainant organizations, to inform the company that such an attitude does not lead to harmonious labour relations based on mutual respect and dialogue.(d)	As regards the alleged recognition as a legal entity of a union (Union of Workers of Calvoconservas El Salvador SA de CV) within the company, comprising company heads and trusted individuals, as well as the negotiation of a collective agreement between that union and the company, the Committee regrets that the Government has made no reference either to the alleged presence of company heads and trusted staff within the said union or to the negotiation of the collective agreement by that union. The Committee requests the Government to carry out an investigation into the alleged facts without delay and to keep it informed in that regard.",0,2007,El Salvador
137,".At its March  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendations on the questions still pending [see th Report, para. ]:(a)	As regards the dissolution of the Sweets and Pastries Industrial Trade Union (SIDPA), the Committee, noting that a criminal complaint has been lodged with the Third Magistrate s Court of San Salvador for falsification of documents and facts used to justify judicial dissolution of the union, expects that the court proceedings will be concluded without delay and will make it possible to identify and punish those responsible. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard and of any further decision or action taken by the Human Rights Ombudsman.(b)	As regards the allegations concerning acts of interference by the employer in a trade union s affairs by means of economic incentives and the anti-union dismissals, between  March and  May , of  trade unionists following the dissolution of the trade union, the Committee regrets that the Government has not sent its observations in that regard. The Committee recalls that no one should be subjected to prejudicial measures because of his or her legitimate trade union membership or activity. The Committee urges the Government to carry out an in-depth investigation of these matters without delay and, if the allegations are proven, to take the necessary measures to reinstate without delay the trade union members in their posts with back pay, as well as to take the measures and impose the sanctions provided for in law so as to remedy such acts. The Committee urgently requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in this regard.
.In its communications dated  October and  December , the Government refers firstly to the Committee s recommendation (a) (complaint lodged by Mr scar Antonio Roque, in his capacity as a rank-and-file member of the Sweets and Pastries Industrial Trade Union (SIDPA), and specifically its branch in the enterprise Productos Alimenticios DIANA, SA de CV, for falsification of documents and facts by Mr Carlos Hernn Mndez Prez, who was General Secretary of the abovementioned branch). The Government reports that, according to a communication from the Attorney-General s Office, the case has been closed and no judicial investigations are pending given that, on  February , the accused, Mr Carlos Hernn Mndez Prez and Mr Pablo Ernesto Snchez Prez, were publicly convicted of the offence of use or possession of false documents constituting a breach of public trust, and sentenced to a three-year prison term. Mr Pablo Ernesto Snchez Prez was also convicted of the offence of falsification of facts and sentenced to a three-year prison term. The court substituted community service days for the prison term. It was also acknowledged in the abovementioned decision that the document on the basis of which SIDPA was dissolved was a forgery and the corresponding court proceedings intended to annul the document should proceed.
.The Government adds that following the dissolution of the abovementioned trade union, no attempt has been made to set up a new trade union in the enterprise. Regarding the request by the Committee on Freedom of Association to be kept informed of any further decision or action taken by the Human Rights Ombudsman, the Government reports that the only final decision taken by the Ombudsman was the one transmitted to the Committee in previous replies.
.As regards the dismissal of  trade unionists between  March and  May , the Government states that it has conducted an investigation into these matters in the General Directorate for Labour Inspection, and that the Industrial and Commercial Inspection Department of the General Directorate for Labour Inspection has a file (reference No. --) on worker and SIDPA Disputes Secretary Mr Daniel Ernesto Morales Rivera. According to the inspection report in the file, this worker had that capacity and had been dismissed without regard for the legally required procedure. As a result, the employer party was advised to reinstate the worker, but the parties eventually agreed that sums equivalent to the wages that remained unpaid for reasons ascribable to the employer would be paid. As regards the cases of the other dismissed trade unionists, namely, Mr Jos lvaro Castillo Lpez, Mr Julio Csar Martnez Ramrez, Ms Josefa del Carmen Samayoa Lpez, Mr Santos Osmn Garca Martnez, Mr scar Alfredo Ramrez and Ms Judith Beatriz Evangelista Navarro, there are no records of requests for conciliation or legal complaints concerning their dismissal. As regards the seven dismissed trade union officials, namely, Mr Daniel Ernesto Morales Rivera, Ms Irma Antonia Linares Mendoza and Mr Juan Antonio Vargas, the administrative authority was asked to take conciliatory action but the application was abandoned when a settlement was agreed upon with the enterprise without the involvement of the Ministry.
.The Committee takes note of this information. The Committee notes with interest the criminal conviction related to the falsified document that was used as the basis for the legal dissolution of SIDPA. The Committee fears that the dissolution of SIDPA may have a dissuasive effect on the workers and their capacity to form unions and invites the Government to promote and encourage the principles of freedom of association and collective bargaining. The Committee further observes that, of the dismissed trade unionists, six did not seek an intervention by the Ministry of Labour, whereas four others did do so but abandoned their applications after agreeing on a settlement with the enterprise. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the situation of the six remaining dismissed trade unionists.
.The Committee last examined this case at its March  meeting [see rd Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session, paras ' ].
.The Government sent new observations in communications dated  March,  May,  July and  October .
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its previous examination of the case, the Committee made the following recommendations [see rd Report, para. ]:(a) The Committee emphasizes the seriousness of the allegations in this case, concerning the dissolution of a trade union and anti-union dismissals, and regrets the Government s failure to cooperate with the procedure by not sending the information requested, despite the urgent appeal sent in November ; the Committee expects that the Government will be more cooperative in future.(b) The Committee regrets that, even though the present case contains serious allegations of anti-union dismissals of a large number of trade union members (), as well as allegations of acts of interference in union affairs by the employer in the form of financial offers, the Government has not undertaken an in-depth investigation of these matters. The Committee urges the Government to carry out an investigation without delay, to keep it informed in this regard and ' if the allegations are proven ' to take the necessary measures to reinstate without delay the trade union members in their posts with back pay, as well as to take the measures and impose the sanctions provided for in law so as to remedy such acts.(c) In close connection with the dissolution of the SIDPA trade union, the Committee urges the Government to send the report of the Human Rights Ombudsperson on the present case as soon as the Ombudsperson reaches a decision, and also to send any decisions taken as a result of the criminal complaint filed at the Attorney-General s Office by a union member for alleged falsification of documents and facts by the former General Secretary who instigated the allegedly fraudulent dissolution of the union.(d) The Committee recalls in general that no one should be dismissed or be subjected to anti-union discrimination because of trade union membership or activities, and the authorities must ensure that adequate protection is provided against acts of interference by employers in trade union affairs. The Committee requests the Government to ensure that these principles are respected.(e) The Committee requests the Government to send the information requested, and expects that it will do so without delay, and that it will obtain information from the enterprise concerned by the questions under examination through the national employers' organization.
.In its communications of  March,  May,  July and  October , the Government sends the following observations.
.As regards the application to dissolve the Sweets and Pastries Industrial Trade Union (SIDPA), the Government states that on  December  Mr Daniel Morales Rivera, First Secretary for Disputes of SIDPA, applied to the National Department for Social Organizations of the General Labour Directorate to register a change to the union s executive board owing to alleged action to remove from office and expel the following members of the executive board: the General Secretary, the culture and education secretary and the records and agreements secretary. The application was rejected in a decision by the National Department for Social Organizations on  January  (owing to failure to comply with due procedure as established under article () of the Rules of the",0,2007,El Salvador
138,"professional association concerning sanctions of suspension, removal from office and/or expulsion of members). In the light of this, the members of the executive board remained in their posts and were authorized to seek from the Ministry the documentation they considered necessary.
.The Government supplies a copy of the report of the Human Rights Ombudsman of  August  calling for: (a) a report from the Director-General for Labour of the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection on the measures adopted in response to the allegations made and any other information it might wish to bring to the attention of the Attorney-General s Office for the purposes of any investigation; (b) a report from the Second Labour Judge of San Salvador on action taken to verify the claimant s legal status in order to ensure the legitimacy of the proceedings to dissolve the SIDPA, and any other information it may wish to bring to the attention of the institution; and (c) to seek a report from the headquarters of the Unit for Offences in connection with the Administration of Justice of the Attorney-General s Office, regarding the investigations carried out in connection with the complaint made in the case in question and the current status thereof.
.The Government reports that the Attorney-General s Office is in the process of submitting preliminary evidence to the courts concerning alleged falsification of documents and facts used as a basis for the judicial dissolution of SIDPA. On  September , the Subdirector responsible for the Defence of the Interests of Society of the AttorneyGeneral s Office petitioned the Third Justice of the Peace of San Salvador to open a formal investigation with interim detention, a decision adopted by the Court which called a preliminary hearing for the  December . The Government states that it will report on the outcome as soon as it is informed.
.The Committee recalls that according to its previous examination of the case, the allegations in the present complaint refer to: () the fact that three trade union officials of SIDPA, having accepted a financial offer from the president of the company Productos Alimenticios Diana SA de CV, instigated a fraudulent process of  voluntary' dissolution of the union unbeknown to the other officials and members of the union, ostensibly following a general meeting on  January  (with  signatures on one document, ten of which were forged), without adhering to the established deadlines; () on  February , the Second Labour Judge approved the dissolution (although labour proceedings normally take months or years); and () between  March and  May , the company dismissed  trade unionists.
.The Committee recalls that in its previous examination of the case, it noted the Government s statements to the effect that: () the judiciary requested the Ministry of Labour and Social Security to revoke the registration of the SIDPA trade union, and on  March  this request was granted by the Ministry, which declared the union dissolved, revoked the registration of the union and its executive committee and, in accordance with the law, appointed the Liquidation Board, whose proceedings were completed on  July  and approved by the Ministry of Labour; () the workers concerned did not initiate administrative or judicial proceedings against the decision concerning the dissolution of the union and the dismissals; () a union member filed a criminal complaint against one of the instigators of the dissolution of the union and the dismissals (its general secretary at the time) for alleged falsification of documents and facts; and () the General Secretary of Productos Alimenticios Diana SA de CV branch of SIDPA filed a complaint with the Human Rights Ombudsman on account of the dissolution of the union and the dismissals.
.In this respect, the Committee notes that in its most recent observations the Government indicates that: () on  December , the first secretary for disputes of SIDPA requested that a modification in the union s general executive board be registered, following the alleged removal from office and expulsion of the General Secretary, the culture and education secretary and the records and agreements secretary; the request was rejected by the National Department for Social Organizations on  January  for non-compliance with the procedure established for such sanctions, which meant that the executive board members in question continued in their union posts and were thus able to seek from the Ministry any documentation they deemed necessary; () on  August , the Human Rights Ombudsman issued a report which called for: (a) a report from the Director-General for Labour of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security on action taken in response to the allegations; (b) a report from the Second Labour Judge of San Salvador concerning the action taken to verify the legal status of the claimant as part of the procedure to verify the legitimacy of the procedure to dissolve the SIDPA; and (c) a report from the headquarters of the Unit for Offences relating to the Administration of Justice of the Attorney-General s Office regarding the investigations carried out in relation to the complaint in this case, and its current status; and () on  September , the Attorney-General s Office requested the Third Magistrate s Court of San Salvador to open a formal investigation with interim detention for the offence of falsifying documents and facts used to justify the judicial dissolution of SIDPA, a decision adopted by the Court which called a preliminary hearing for  December .
.In this regard, noting that legal proceedings have been initiated before the Third Magistrate s Court of San Salvador for falsifying documents and facts used to justify the judicial dissolution of the union, the Committee expects that these proceedings will be concluded without delay, with a view to determining responsibilities and punishing those responsible. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard and of any further decision or action taken by the Human Rights Ombudsman.
.As regards the allegations of interference by the employer in the union s affairs by offering economic incentives, and the anti-union dismissals between  March and  May  of  trade unionists following the dissolution of the trade union, the Committee regrets that the Government has not sent its observations in that regard. The Committee recalls that no one should be subjected to prejudicial measures because of legitimate trade union membership or activities. The Committee urges the Government to carry out an in-depth investigation of these matters without delay and, if the allegations are proven, to take the necessary measures to reinstate without delay the trade union members in their posts with back pay, as well as to take the measures and impose the sanctions provided for in law so as to remedy such acts. The Committee urgently requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in this regard.
.The Committee examined this case at its March  meeting and presented an interim report to the Governing Body [see th Report, paras ' , approved by the Governing Body at its st Session (March )].
.At its November  meeting, the Committee noted that despite the time that had elapsed since the presentation of the complaint and since the most recent examination of the case, the information requested from the Government had still not been received. The Committee drew the Government s attention to the fact that, in accordance with the procedural rules set out in paragraph  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body, it might present a report on the substance of the case if the requested observations or information had not been received in due time. The Committee accordingly requested the Government to transmit the information requested as a matter of urgency.
.To date no such information has been received from the Government.
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its March  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendations on questions still pending [see th Report, para. ]:(a) The Committee emphasizes the seriousness of the allegations made in the present case with regard to the dissolution of a trade union and anti-union dismissals.(b) The Committee regrets that, even though the present case contains serious allegations of anti-union dismissals of a large number of trade union members (), as well as allegations of acts of interference in union affairs by the employer in the form of financial offers, the Government has not undertaken an in-depth investigation of these matters. The Committee urges the Government to carry out an investigation without delay, to keep it informed in this regard and ' if the allegations are proven ' to take the necessary measures to reinstate the trade union members in their posts with back pay, as well as to take the measures and impose the sanctions provided for in the law so as to remedy such acts.(c) In close connection with the dissolution of the SIDPA",2,2007,El Salvador
139,"trade union, the Committee requests the Government to send the report of the Human Rights Ombudsperson on the present case as soon as the Ombudsperson reaches a decision, and also to send any decisions taken as a result of the criminal complaint filed at the Attorney-General s Office by a union member for alleged falsification of documents and facts by the former General Secretary who instigated the allegedly fraudulent dissolution of the union.
.The Committee regrets that, despite the time that has elapsed, the Government has not sent the information requested, despite being invited on a number of occasions, including by means of an urgent appeal, to present its comments and observations on the case.
.Under these circumstances and in accordance with the applicable procedural rules [see th Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session], the Committee feels obliged to present a report on the case without the information it had hoped to receive from the Government.
.The Committee recalls that the purpose of the whole procedure established by the International Labour Organization for the examination of allegations of violations of freedom of association is to promote respect for this freedom in law and in fact. The Committee remains confident that, if the procedure protects governments from unreasonable accusations, governments on their side will recognize the importance of formulating, for objective examination, detailed replies concerning allegations made against them.
.The Committee notes with regret the Government s failure to cooperate with the procedure, and, given the seriousness of the allegations, regrets that the Government has not responded to the urgent appeal made at its November meeting. Consequently, the Committee urges the Government to send without delay the information requested and to be more cooperative in the future.
.The Committee notes that in the present complaint, according to the allegations, three trade union leaders of the Sweets and Pastries Industrial Trade Union (SIDPA), following the acceptance by two of them of a financial offer by the President of the Productos Alimenticios Diana SA de CV enterprise, instigated a fraudulent  voluntary' procedure to dissolve the trade union behind the backs of the other union officers and members; the procedure was initiated, supposedly with the support of a general meeting held on  January , with  signatures on the relevant document, although ten of these signatures are forged and one of the signatories is resident in the United States. In other words, the condition stipulated by the trade union s own statutes, of having the agreement of two-thirds of the union s membership for the union to be dissolved, was not met (the complainants indicate that the union has  registered members at the Productos Alimenticios Diana SA enterprise alone); in contravention of the trade union s statutes, the general meeting was not announced eight days in advance in the press and was not agreed by the union s executive body. The Committee notes that according to the allegations, the Second Labour Judge on  February  approved the dissolution of the union (although labour proceedings generally take months or even years), and between  and  March , the company dismissed two union leaders and eight other union members and offered financial compensation in order to avert proceedings or complaints. Lastly, on  May , the company dismissed a trade union leader, two former officials and three other members.
.In the absence of the information requested from the Government at its March  meeting, the Committee wishes to recall the conclusions it formulated on that occasion [see th Report, paras ' ].' The Committee notes the Government s statements, particularly to the effect that: () the judiciary requested the Ministry of Labour and Social Security to revoke the registration of the SIDPA trade union, and on  March  this request was complied with by the Ministry, which deemed the union dissolved, revoked the registration of the union and its executive committee and, in accordance with the law, appointed the Liquidation Board, whose proceedings were completed on  July  and approved by the Ministry of Labour; () the court ruling ordering the dissolution of the union can be appealed against and dismissed workers can have recourse to the courts or ' something they did not actually do ' request the Directorate-General of Labour Inspection for legal protection of the breached labour rights; () a member of the trade union filed a criminal complaint against one of the instigators of the dissolution of the union (its general secretary at the time) for alleged falsification of documents and facts; and () as regards the complaint submitted to the Human Rights Ombudsperson by the General Secretary of the Productos Alimenticios Diana SA de CV branch of SIDPA on account of the dissolution of the union and the dismissals, the Ministry of Labour sent a document in which it essentially reiterates points () and () above, emphasizing that it (the Ministry of Labour) had merely complied with the court ruling.' The Committee observes that the Government has not replied to the complainant organizations' claims that on  December  two SIDPA officials (including the General Secretary of the union s enterprise branch) informed the Ministry of Labour in writing of the violations committed by two former leaders in dissolving the union in collusion with the enterprise and requested that no documentation on behalf of the union should be made available to those persons who had been replaced at the general meeting of  December  and were being expelled from the union. Nevertheless, the Ministry supplied various records and documents to those persons.' The Committee regrets that, even though the present case contains serious allegations of anti-union dismissals of a large number of trade union members (), as well as allegations of acts of interference in union affairs by the employer in the form of financial offers, the Government has not undertaken an in-depth investigation of these matters. The Committee urges the Government to carry out an investigation without delay, to keep it informed in this regard and ' if the allegations are proven ' to take the necessary measures to reinstate the trade union members without delay in their posts with back pay, as well as to take the measures and impose the sanctions provided for in the law so as to remedy such acts.' The Committee also requests the Government to send the report of the Human Rights Ombudsperson on the present case as soon as the Ombudsperson reaches a decision, and also to send any decisions taken as a result of the criminal complaint filed at the Attorney-General s Office by a union member for alleged falsification of documents and facts by the former General Secretary who instigated the allegedly fraudulent dissolution of the union.
.The Committee once again reiterates these conclusions, and expects that the Government will take steps to send the requested information. The Committee recalls in general terms that no one should be dismissed or subjected to anti-union discrimination because of legitimate trade union membership or activities, and that the authorities must ensure adequate protection against interference by employers in union affairs [see, for example, Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth edition, , paras  and ]. The Committee requests the Government to ensure that these principles are respected.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Government to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee emphasizes the seriousness of the allegations in this case, concerning the dissolution of a trade union and anti-union dismissals, and regrets the Government s failure to cooperate with the procedure by not sending the information requested, despite the urgent appeal sent in November ; the Committee expects that the Government will be more cooperative in future.(b) The Committee regrets that, even though the present case contains serious allegations of anti-union dismissals of a large number of trade union members (), as well as allegations of acts of interference in union affairs by the employer in the form of financial offers, the Government has not undertaken an in-depth investigation of these matters. The Committee urges the Government to carry out an investigation without delay, to keep it informed in this regard and ' if the allegations are proven ' to take the necessary measures to reinstate without delay the trade union members in their posts with back pay, as well as to take the measures and impose the sanctions provided for in law so as to remedy such acts.(c) In close connection with the dissolution of the SIDPA trade union, the Committee urges the Government to send the report of the Human Rights Ombudsperson on the present case as soon as the Ombudsperson reaches a decision, and also to send any decisions taken as a result of the criminal complaint filed at the Attorney-General s Office by a union member for alleged falsification of documents and facts by the former General Secretary who instigated the allegedly fraudulent dissolution of the union.(d) The Committee recalls in general",0,2007,El Salvador
140,"that no one should be dismissed or be subjected to anti-union discrimination because of trade union membership or activities, and the authorities must ensure that adequate protection is provided against acts of interference by employers in trade union affairs. The Committee requests the Government to ensure that these principles are respected.(e) The Committee requests the Government to send the information requested, and expects that it will do so without delay, and that it will obtain information from the enterprise concerned by the questions under examination through the national employers' organization.
.The complaint is contained in a joint communication from the Trade Union Confederation of El Salvador Workers (CSTS), the Trade Union Federation of Food, Beverage, Hotel, Restaurant and Agro-Industry Workers of El Salvador (FESTSSABHRA) and the Sweets and Pastries Industrial Trade Union (SIDPA), dated  January . SIDPA sent further information in a communication dated  May , as did FESTSSABHRA and SIDPA in a joint communication dated  September .
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  May and  October .
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communication dated  March , CSTS, FESTSSABHRA, (the Salvadoran affiliate of the International Union of Food, Agricultural, Hotel, Restaurant, Catering, Tobacco and Allied Workers' Associations (IUF)) and SIDPA allege that the freedom of association of the workers of the Productos Alimenticios Diana SA de CV enterprise has been violated by the irregular dissolution of SIDPA by the Second Labour Court, instigated by three former leaders of the trade union, in agreement with the general manager of the enterprise and the collaboration of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security.
.The complainants claim that this is a serious precedent for El Salvador, since SIDPA has existed for over  years and has faced constant anti-union activity and acts of interference by the enterprise in trade union matters since the s.
.Specifically, the complainant organizations indicate that on  March  various members of SIDPA at Productos Alimenticios Diana SA de CV were informed by the human resources manager that the trade union no longer existed and hence the enterprise was dismissing them. The dismissals continued over the following three days. This occurrence was merely an indication of a process instigated without the knowledge of the majority of workers but of which the leaders had informed the competent authority ' the Ministry of Labour and Social Security ' at the proper time.
.The complainant organizations recount the following sequence of events:(a) On  October , the former General Secretary of SIDPA, Mr Francisco Flores, received a verbal offer from the Chairman of Productos Alimenticios Diana SA de CV, Mr Hugo Barrera (former Minister for Public Safety and for the Environment, and current Director of the autonomous state enterprise CEPA), to dissolve the trade union in exchange for a financial settlement. On  October, at a general meeting of union members, Mr Flores conveyed the enterprise Chairman s proposal to his SIDPA colleagues. The majority decided not to accept it. However, Mr Carlos Hernn Mndez Prez, the SIDPA General Secretary, and Mr Pablo Ernesto Snchez, the SIDPA secretary responsible for records and agreements, accepted it and initiated a fraudulent process to dissolve the trade union behind the backs of the other union leaders and members, as is now known.(b) On  November , a first attempt at dissolving the union was rejected by the Fourth Labour Judge.(c) On  December , the General Secretary of the Productos Alimenticios Diana SA de CV branch of SIDPA and the Secretary in charge of dispute procedures on the SIDPA Executive Committee notified the Ministry of Labour s Department of Social Organizations in writing of the intentions of the two former leaders to dissolve the union in collusion with the enterprise. They also asked the Ministry of Labour not to supply any documentation on behalf of the union to the two abovementioned persons as the latter were involved in proceedings for expulsion by SIDPA on account of their actions. They corroborated this with documentation stating that the former leaders were being expelled for actions endangering the security and smooth operation of the organization and had even been replaced by the general meeting held on  December.(d) On  January , the National Department of Social Organizations of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security supplied various records and documents to the leaders being expelled from SIDPA despite the written request made on  December. The Department not only supplied the documentation ' vital to the fraudulent dissolution process ' but also omitted to notify the legitimate leaders of SIDPA of this fact.(e) On  February , the leaders who were being expelled initiated proceedings for  voluntary' dissolution in the Second Labour Court of San Salvador. The proceedings were supposedly endorsed by a general meeting held on  January , the record of which contains  signatures, ten of them forged, including that of a person resident in the United States since November .(f) According to section  of the SIDPA statutes, voluntary dissolution requires the votes of two-thirds of the union membership. Even if the ten forged signatures are added to the  genuine ones, the number of signatures does not constitute the stated majority required for dissolution, given that SIDPA has  members at Productos Alimenticios Diana SA de CV alone.(g) The proceedings reveal that the abovementioned general meeting was not convened with eight days' notice or advertised in the newspapers, as prescribed by the SIDPA statutes. Three days' notice are said to have been given by means of a simple note without even the minimum formalities required for due process, given that there was also no agreement from the executive committee to convene such a meeting, this being a further requirement of the statutes.(h) On  February , the acting Second Labour Judge decided on the voluntary dissolution, despite the process being totally flawed. What is extremely surprising is that an acting judge, aware of the temporary nature of his duties, reached a decision in only ten days, whereas labour cases generally take months or even years in El Salvador. On  February, the same judge contacted the Ministry of Labour requesting the registration of SIDPA to be revoked. The remaining legal representatives of SIDPA were never informed; only the two persons who had fraudulently instigated the proceedings and were in the process of being expelled from the union were notified.(i) On  March , the enterprise dismissed Mr Daniel Ernesto Morales, the SIDPA Disputes Secretary; on  March, it dismissed another eight members of SIDPA; and on  March, it dismissed one more, the General Secretary of the SIDPA branch at Productos Alimenticios Diana SA de CV, Mr Jos Antonio Guilln.(j) These dismissals and the supposed dissolution of the union were confirmed to the SIDPA leaders by the enterprise representative, after the human resources manager offered minimum financial compensation to avoid any legal proceedings or denunciation of the acts committed.(k) On  March , Mr Oscar Antonio Roque, a member of SIDPA, filed a criminal complaint at the Attorney-General s Office for falsification of documents by the former leaders, who allegedly submitted a fake record of the general meeting of  January  with ten forged signatures, including his own. This is one of the legal steps being taken to quash the dissolution of the union. The proceedings are currently before the Attorney-General as Case No. -UDAJ-.
.In its communication dated  May , the SIDPA trade union alleges that on  May  the enterprise dismissed six members of the union: Jos Alvaro Castillo Lpez, Julio Csar Martnez Ramrez (former union leader in his additional year of immunity), Josefa del Carmen Samayoa Lpez (affected by occupational disability, which makes dismissal prohibited by law), Santos Osmin Garca Martnez (former union leader in his additional year of immunity), Oscar Alfredo Ramrez (SIDPA branch press and public relations officer at Productos Alimenticios Diana SA de CV) and Judith Beatriz Evangelista Navarro. This demonstrates that those seeking the fraudulent dissolution of the union shared an interest with Productos Alimenticios Diana SA de CV to be rid of all SIDPA members at the enterprise.
.By a communication dated  September , FESTSSABHRA and SIDPA stated that on  August  the El Salvador Human Rights Prosecutor s Office issued a ruling to the effect that it had decided, as part of an investigation into the fraudulent dissolution of SIDPA, to request reports from the Director-General for Labour at the Ministry of Labour, the Second Labour Judge of San Salvador, and the head of the unit at the Attorney-General s Office dealing with offences relating to the administration of justice (the complainants attach the aforementioned ruling issued as a result of a complaint by the General Secretary of the SIDPA branch at the enterprise).
.In its communication dated  May , the Government states that on  February  the",1,2007,El Salvador
141,"Department of Social Organizations at the Ministry of Labour and Social Security received Notice No.  from the Second Labour Court of San Salvador requesting the revocation of the registration of SIDPA, on account of its dissolution pursuant to a ruling of this court dated  February .
.On account of the abovementioned request and in view of the court ruling, the Department of Social Organizations decided on  March  to: (a) deem SIDPA dissolved; (b) cancel by means of a note in the margin the registration entry in Volume  of the register of occupational associations maintained by the Department; and (c) cancel by means of a note in the margin the registration entry in Volume  of the register of general trade union executive committees maintained by the Department, in which the current executive committee of the aforementioned union is registered.
.The Government adds that the Director-General for Labour, in accordance with section  of the Labour Code, sent communications to both the Minister for Labour and Social Security and the Minister for Economic Affairs, and also to the latest executive committee of the union, so that each could appoint a delegate to the Liquidation Board.
.With regard to the alleged violation of the guaranteed immunity of the SIDPA leaders, and also of the members who, according to the complaint, were dismissed in May , the Government states that both the Directorate-General of Labour and the Directorate-General of Labour Inspection checked their registers and did not find any records of requests or complaints concerning dismissal from those concerned with a view to claiming legal protection in connection with breached labour rights.
.Moreover, the Government states that it is important that the Committee on Freedom of Association is aware of the legal action pursuant to sections  and  of the Penal Code initiated at the Attorney-General s Office on  March  by Mr Oscar Antonio Roque, in his capacity of rank-and-file member of the SIDPA branch at Productos Alimenticios Diana SA de CV, against Mr Carlos Hernn Mndez Prez, former General Secretary of SIDPA, for alleged falsification of documents and facts (the complainant organizations refer to Mr Mndez Prez as one of the persons responsible for the allegedly fraudulent process to dissolve the union). According to a communication from the Deputy Director of the Protection of Social Interests Division at the Attorney-General s Office, investigation of the case is at present fully under way, with the following steps pending: () interviews to be held with all persons whose signatures were allegedly forged; () official records to be provided (order for confiscation) in order to carry out the relevant examination; () a report to be requested from the Ministry of Labour and Social Security (Department of Social Organizations) regarding the registered status of the abovementioned union; and () interviews to be held with the members of the union who agreed that it should be dissolved.
.The Government considers that there is no violation of trade union rights in the present case, since the procedures for voluntary dissolution undertaken by the Second Labour Court of San Salvador at the request of Mr Carlos Hernn Mndez Prez, acting in his capacity of General Secretary of SIDPA at the time, were correctly observed on the basis of documentation submitted by Mr Mndez. For this reason Mr Oscar Antonio Roque initiated criminal proceedings, not against the ruling of the Second Labour Court but against the documentation used as the basis for the proceedings to dissolve the union submitted by Mr Carlos Hernn Mndez Prez, who faces prosecution if he is found to have committed irregularities.
.Despite the above, the Government will request information from the employers' organization concerned and will forward its reply, together with the results of the criminal proceedings which have been initiated.
.In its communication of  October , the Government refers to the decision issued by the Human Rights Prosecutor s Office, requesting the Director-General for Labour to indicate what steps were taken with regard to the matter in question (dissolution of SIDPA). In this regard, the Government provides a verbatim transcription of the report submitted by the Director-General of Labour to the Human Rights Ombudsperson in relation to the present case:' At . hours on  February , the National Department of Social Organizations of the Directorate-General of Labour was notified of Case No. , dated  February , whereby the Second Labour Judge of San Salvador, Mr Jos Guillermo Ramos Chorro, ordered the revocation of the registration of SIDPA, in compliance with the ruling issued at . hours on  February  by the said court, in which the aforementioned trade union was declared judicially dissolved and a communication was sent to the Chief of the National Department of Social Organizations.' In compliance with the aforementioned ruling, by means of a decision issued at . hours on  March , the National Department of Social Organizations decided: (a) to deem SIDPA dissolved; (b) to cancel by a note in the margin registration entry No.  (page  verso ' page  recto) in Volume  of the Register of Occupational Associations maintained by the Department, in which the aforementioned trade union was registered; and (c) to cancel by a note in the margin registration entry No.  (page , Volume  of the Register) relating to the executive committee of the aforementioned trade union.' The abovementioned registration entries were cancelled by a note in the margin on  March this year.' In accordance with section  of the Labour Code, the Directorate-General of Labour sent communications to the Minister for Labour and Social Security and the Minister for Economic Affairs, and also to the latest executive committee of the said occupational organization, so that they could appoint a delegate to the Liquidation Board.' By means of an order dated  July this year, the Directorate-General of Labour acknowledged receipt of the appointments of the Liquidation Board delegates from the Ministry of Labour and Social Security and the Ministry of Economic Affairs. This was not the case with the delegate from the latest SIDPA executive committee, which, having been sent a communication on two occasions, neither made an appointment nor adopted a position in this respect. Hence the terms of section  of the Labour Code were observed and proceedings were undertaken solely with the presence of the two ministerial delegates, swearing them in and assigning them their duties as members of the Liquidation Board on  July of this year. The respective procedures were undertaken and a deadline of  days was set for completion of the liquidation process, in accordance with sections  and  of the Labour Code.' The procedures for the liquidation of the abovementioned trade union were completed on  July of this year, according to the report submitted by the members of the Liquidation Board. On this date, the Liquidation Board handed the file to the Directorate-General of Labour, in accordance with section  of the Labour Code.' By means of a communication issued at . hours on  August this year, this Directorate-General decided: (a) that the procedures completed by the Liquidation Board for SIDPA should be approved; and (b) that the aforementioned should be communicated to the Minister for Labour and Social Security, in accordance with section  of the Labour Code.
.The Government explains that the dissolution of a trade union is subject to a legal procedure laid down in the Labour Code. Section (c) states that the dissolution of a trade union proceeds by virtue of a decision of its members in conformity with the corresponding statutory rules, and section () states that, under section , any interested party may initiate the corresponding legal procedure. Therefore the dissolution of a trade union is the subject of court proceedings.
.However, in view of the fact that the registration and establishment of legal status of a trade union are administrative acts under section () of the Labour Code, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, in compliance with a court ruling, revoked the registration of the aforementioned trade union, pursuant to section  of the Labour Code.
.Finally, the Government points out that trade unions have the possibility of appealing against a labour court ruling, and workers may also have recourse to the legal mechanisms established in the country, such as the courts. Moreover, they have been informed that they can also seek legal protection with regard to securing unpaid benefits for which the employer is responsible. The Ministry of Labour will continue to assist workers whenever they request it.
.The Committee observes that, in the present complaint, the complainant organizations allege that three leaders of SIDPA, after a financial offer from the Chairman of the Productos Alimenticios Diana SA de CV enterprise was accepted by two of them, initiated fraudulent proceedings for the  voluntary' dissolution of the trade union without the knowledge of the other union leaders and members. These proceedings, supposedly endorsed by a general meeting held on  January , culminated in an official record",1,2007,El Salvador
142,"containing  signatures, ten of which were forged and including that of a person resident in the United States. Hence the consent of two-thirds of the membership required by the union statutes to dissolve the union was not obtained (in this respect, the complainants point out that the union has  registered members at Productos Alimenticios Diana SA de CV alone). Moreover, contrary to the union statutes, the requisite eight-day notice period prior to the general meeting in question was not given, either by publication in the press or further to agreement by the union s executive committee. The Committee observes that, according to the allegations, on  February  the acting Second Labour Judge approved the dissolution (whereas labour proceedings generally take months or even years), and between  and  March  the enterprise dismissed two union leaders and eight union members, offering them financial compensation in order to avoid any legal proceedings or denunciation of the acts committed. Finally, on  May  the enterprise dismissed one union leader, two former leaders and three other members.
.The Committee notes the Government s statements, particularly to the effect that: () the judiciary requested the Ministry of Labour and Social Security to revoke the registration of the SIDPA trade union, and on  March  this request was complied with by the Ministry, which deemed the union dissolved, revoked the registration of the union and its executive committee and, in accordance with the law, appointed the Liquidation Board, whose proceedings were completed on  July  and approved by the Ministry of Labour; () the court ruling ordering the dissolution of the union can be appealed against and dismissed workers can have recourse to the courts or ' something they did not actually do ' request the Directorate-General of Labour Inspection for legal protection of the breached labour rights; () a member of the trade union filed a criminal complaint against one of the instigators of the dissolution of the union (its general secretary at the time) for alleged falsification of documents and facts; and () as regards the complaint submitted to the Human Rights Ombudsperson by the General Secretary of the Productos Alimenticios Diana SA de CV branch of SIDPA on account of the dissolution of the union and the dismissals, the Ministry of Labour sent a document in which it essentially reiterates points () and () above, emphasizing that it (the Ministry of Labour) had merely complied with the court ruling.
.The Committee observes that the Government has not replied to the complainant organizations' claims that on  December  two SIDPA officials (including the General Secretary of the union s enterprise branch) informed the Ministry of Labour in writing of the violations committed by two former leaders in dissolving the union in collusion with the enterprise and requested that no documentation on behalf of the union should be made available to those persons who had been replaced at the general meeting of  December  and were being expelled from the union. Nevertheless, the Ministry supplied various records and documents to those persons.
.The Committee regrets that, even though the present case contains serious allegations of anti-union dismissals of a large number of trade union members (), as well as allegations of acts of interference in union affairs by the employer in the form of financial offers, the Government has not undertaken an in-depth investigation of these matters. The Committee urges the Government to carry out an investigation without delay, to keep it informed in this regard and ' if the allegations are proven ' to take the necessary measures to reinstate the trade union members in their posts with back pay, as well as to take the measures and impose the sanctions provided for in the law so as to remedy such acts.
.The Committee also requests the Government to send the report of the Human Rights Ombudsperson on the present case as soon as the Ombudsperson reaches a decision, and also to send any decisions taken as a result of the criminal complaint filed at the Attorney-General s Office by a union member for alleged falsification of documents and facts by the former General Secretary who instigated the allegedly fraudulent dissolution of the union.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee emphasizes the seriousness of the allegations made in the present case with regard to the dissolution of a trade union and anti-union dismissals.(b) The Committee regrets that, even though the present case contains serious allegations of anti-union dismissals of a large number of trade union members (), as well as allegations of acts of interference in union affairs by the employer in the form of financial offers, the Government has not undertaken an in-depth investigation of these matters. The Committee urges the Government to carry out an investigation without delay, to keep it informed in this regard and ' if the allegations are proven ' to take the necessary measures to reinstate the trade union members in their posts with back pay, as well as to take the measures and impose the sanctions provided for in the law so as to remedy such acts.(c) In close connection with the dissolution of the SIDPA trade union, the Committee requests the Government to send the report of the Human Rights Ombudsperson on the present case as soon as the Ombudsperson reaches a decision, and also to send any decisions taken as a result of the criminal complaint filed at the Attorney-General s Office by a union member for alleged falsification of documents and facts by the former General Secretary who instigated the allegedly fraudulent dissolution of the union.",0,2007,El Salvador
143,".At its meeting in November , the Committee examined allegations that Ms Suyapa Martnez, an official of the National Association of Vendors, Small Traders and Similar Workers (ANTRAVEPECOS), had been detained and prosecuted for terrorist acts, when in fact this was due to her participation in a protest against the eviction, by court order, of informal economy vendors and traders by the municipal authorities of Apopa. The Committee requested the Government to transmit the decision handed down in respect of this trade union official and trusted that the judicial authority would issue a ruling in the very near future [see th Report, para. ].
.In its communication dated  December , the Government states that the legal proceedings against Ms Suyapa Martnez for offences of serious injury, damage and aggravated damage have been definitively dismissed by the judicial authority.
.The Committee notes this information.
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  May,  June and  August .
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee requests the Government to transmit the decision handed down in respect of the trade union leader, Ms Suyapa Martnez, and expects that the judicial authority will issue a ruling in the very near future.",1,2007,El Salvador
144,".At its June  meeting, after observing that the question of reinstating a large number of officials dismissed by Bateras de El Salvador, on account of the establishment of a trade union, no longer arose in this case (according to the Government, the entire workforce still employed by the enterprise agreed to terminate their contracts of employment subject to the payment of their statutory benefits and to be transferred to ten different enterprises), the Committee made the following recommendation [see the th Report, para. ]:Deploring the serious anti-union nature of the dismissals of trade unionists of the SITRAEBES, the Committee requests the Government to inform it of any administrative or judicial sanctions imposed on the Bateras de El Salvador enterprise for violating the trade union rights enshrined in the legislation, as noted by the labour inspectorate, to indicate whether the Attorney-General s Office has been notified of the facts, as requested by the complainants, to keep it informed in this respect, and to confirm that all the dismissed trade unionists have been paid their statutory dismissal compensation.
.In its communication dated  August , the Government states that three proceedings to impose a fine are currently before the Labour Inspectorate; consequently, if the employer does not prove the inaccuracy, falseness or impartiality of the facts listed in the inspection reports, in the exercise of its right of audience, it will be fined accordingly.
.With regard to whether the Attorney-General s Office has been notified of the facts, as requested by the complainants, the Government indicates that the Penal Code, more specifically section  on labour discrimination, states that:  Any person guilty of serious discrimination in respect of employment on the grounds of sex, pregnancy, origin, civil status, race, class, physical condition, religious or political ideas, membership or non-membership of trade unions and acceptance or otherwise of union agreements, and family ties with other workers at the enterprise, and who does not restore conditions of equality before the law, once requirements or administrative sanctions have been imposed, by paying the corresponding compensation, shall be punished with a prison sentence of six months to two years.' In this regard, and from a legal standpoint, the rules of procedure for dealing with an offence of labour discrimination and providing notification are applicable if administrative proceedings have not restored conditions of equality before the law, once requirements or administrative sanctions have been imposed, through the payment of the corresponding compensation. In this regard, in this case, the proceedings to impose a fine are still under way, and legal steps have not therefore been taken to notify the Attorney-General s Office.
.The Committee notes the statements made by the Government. The Committee deeply regrets that the three proceedings to impose a fine in relation to the dismissal of a large number of union officials from Bateras de El Salvador have not been concluded, despite the fact that this complaint was presented to the Committee in August , and hopes that the administrative procedures will be concluded without delay. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard. The Committee notes the Government s statement that only once proceedings to impose a fine have been concluded can notification be given to the Attorney-General s Office as to whether the situation requires the implementation of the penal sanctions provided for in section  referred to by the Government. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) Deploring the serious anti-union nature of the dismissals of trade unionists of the SITRAEBES, the Committee requests the Government to inform it of any administrative or judicial sanctions imposed on the Bateras de El Salvador enterprise for violating the trade union rights enshrined in the legislation, as noted by the labour inspectorate, to indicate whether the Attorney-General s Office has been notified of the facts, as requested by the complainants, to keep it informed in this respect, and to confirm that all the dismissed trade unionists have been paid their statutory dismissal compensation.(b) Noting once again that the present case shows that the exercise of trade union rights ' whether the right to establish trade union organizations or the right to adequate and effective protection against acts of anti-union discrimination ' is guaranteed neither in the legislation, whose fines do not appear to have any dissuasive effect, nor in practice, the Committee reiterates its earlier recommendations and reminds the Government once again that it may avail itself of ILO technical cooperation in the context of the preparation of future trade union legislation. The Committee considers that, among other things, the new legislation should guarantee the right to establish trade unions without restrictions, and that proceedings in the case of anti-union discrimination should be rapid and effective, providing for sufficiently dissuasive sanctions.(c) The Committee requests the Government to ensure in future that labour inspection reports are transmitted without delay to the enterprises and trade unions concerned.",0,2006,El Salvador
145,".The Committee last examined this case at its June  meeting, when it made the following conclusions and recommendations concerning alleged anti-union acts carried out by the company Servicios San Jos SA de CV against officials and members of the union (SETRASSAJO) [see th Report, paras  to ]:' The Committee further notes the Government s statement that the SETRASSAJO did not report the alleged persecution to the labour inspectorate and that the administrative authority s actions were therefore restricted to conciliation with respect to the dismissal of the trade union officials and the  members, namely, endeavouring to get them reinstated. The Committee also notes that the Government adds that the SETRASSAJO finally reported the events to the special unit on gender and the prevention of discrimination in respect of employment and that, as the company is refusing to reinstate the dismissed officials and members, the sanctioning process has begun to impose a fine on the company.' The Committee observes that these are serious allegations of anti-union acts committed against a trade union executive committee and  of its members for legitimately exercising their trade union activities; the acts include dismissals, threats, pressure and the alleged continual changing of the company s name to prevent the formation of trade unions. The Committee recalls, first, that, under Article  of Convention No. , recently ratified by El Salvador, workers, without distinction, shall have the right to establish or join trade union organizations of their own choosing, and that no person should be dismissed or prejudiced in employment by reason of trade union membership or legitimate trade union activities, and it is important to forbid and penalize in practice all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of employment [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth edition, , para. ]. Taking into account the Government s statement that it has started the sanctioning process against the company, with the intention of imposing a fine on it because of its refusal to reinstate the dismissed workers, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures so that the sanctions imposed in this process are sufficiently dissuasive to ensure that the company allows its workers to freely exercise their trade union rights by putting an end immediately to all anti-union acts against the officials and members of the SETRASSAJO and by reinstating them without delay, and paying the wages they are owed and appropriate compensation. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed on this matter.' The Committee urges the Government to ensure that an independent investigation is carried out without delay into the allegations of assaults on SETRASSAJO workers by the company s private security services and into the alleged death threats used to urge workers to resign from their trade union. The Committee requests the Government to take measures to punish those guilty of the assaults and to provide protection to the threatened workers.
.In its communication dated  August , the Government states that under the sanctioning process the company Servicios San Jos SA de CV was fined US$, namely US$ for each of the  violations of section  of the Labour Code, by having dismissed  workers who were union officials. With regard to the Committee s recommendation that the sanctions imposed should be sufficiently dissuasive, section  of the Labour Code clearly establishes that those guilty of Labour Code violations that do not have a specific penalty shall be fined up to US$. per violation, with the amount of the fine depending on the seriousness of the violation and the financial resources of the offender. The legally appropriate sanction was therefore imposed in this case. Furthermore, the unionized workers continue to receive the wages that had not been paid for reasons imputable to the employer, in the same amount and manner as when they were performing their duties.
.With regard to the Committee s recommendation that an independent investigation should be carried out without delay into the alleged assaults on SETRASSAJO workers by the company s private security services and into the alleged death threats used to urge workers to resign from their trade union, the Government recommends that the workers concerned lodge a complaint with the Attorney-General s Office without delay so that an investigation is launched to identify those responsible and criminal proceedings initiated, given that these allegations were made at the request of the plaintiff.
.The Committee notes that, according to the Government, the dismissed union officials continue to receive their wages and the company Servicios San Jos SA de CV was fined US$. The Committee reiterates its previous recommendation that these union officials be reinstated without delay and paid outstanding wages (until the date of their reinstatement) and appropriate compensation. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed on this matter and, in consultation with workers' and employers' organizations, to increase the legally recognized fines for violations of trade union rights. The Committee recalls that it has already pointed out that the exercise of trade union rights ' whether the right to establish trade union organizations or the right to adequate and effective protection against acts of anti-union discrimination ' is guaranteed neither by the legislation, whose fines do not appear to have any dissuasive effect, nor in practice. The Committee reminds the Government once again that it may avail itself of ILO technical cooperation for preparing future trade union legislation that has procedures for dealing with anti-union discrimination which are rapid and effective and provide for sufficiently dissuasive sanctions. On the other hand, with regard to the alleged assaults on SETRASSAJO workers by the company s private security services and the alleged death threats used to urge workers to resign from their trade union, the Committee requests the complainants to advise the workers concerned ' as suggested by the Government ' to lodge a complaint with the Attorney-General s Office without delay in order to punish those guilty of carrying out these assaults and threats and to protect the threatened workers.
.The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments on these issues.
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  November .
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the light its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government, in the framework of the sanctioning process initiated against the Servicios San Jos SA de CV enterprise, to ensure that the sanctions imposed are sufficiently dissuasive to ensure that the company allows its workers to freely exercise their trade union rights, by putting an end immediately to all anti-union acts against the officials and members of the SETRASSAJO, and by reinstating them without delay and paying the wages they are owed and appropriate compensation. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed on this matter.(b) The Committee urges the Government to ensure that an independent investigation is carried out without delay into the allegations of assaults on the SETRASSAJO workers by the company s private security services and into the alleged death threats used to urge workers to resign from their trade union.

146,".At its June  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendations on the matters that were pending [see th Report, para. ]:(a)	The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the final outcome of the proceeding, which should be expeditious, relating to the fine imposed on Industria de Hilos de El Salvador, SA de CV for the dismissal of trade union official Oscar Lpez Cruz and for the payment of the wages owed to him and appropriate compensation.(b)	The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the final outcome of the legal proceedings it mentioned concerning payment of compensation, wages and other benefits to the workers by the enterprise Hermosa Manufacturing SA de CV. Furthermore, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps to conduct an investigation without delay to determine whether, as claimed by the complainants, the work stoppages in the enterprise were carried out in order to avoid the list of demands submitted by the STITAS trade union, and to keep it informed of the outcome of the investigation.(c)	The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any legal action initiated by the officials of the STITAS trade union who were dismissed from CMT, SA de CV; the Committee also requests the Government to take the necessary steps to reinstate the officials in question without loss of salary if it is found that they were dismissed on anti-union grounds. Likewise ' noting that the Government has not denied this allegation ' the Committee requests the Government to take immediate action to stop the harassment and hounding at the homes of the STITAS trade union officials, where this is taking place, and punish those guilty of these acts and provide compensation to the victims.(d)	With regard to Diana, SA de CV, the Committee requests the Government: () to keep it informed of the employment situation of Daniel Ernesto Morales Rivera who, according to the Government, is being paid wages but has not been reinstated in his post; () to initiate an investigation without delay to determine the reasons for which Carlos Mauricio Flores Saldaa and Rafael Antonio Soriano, members of the SIDPA trade union, were dismissed and to keep it informed on that matter; and () to initiate an investigation without delay to determine the specific facts which led to the disciplinary sanctions resulting in the dismissal of Jos Alfredo Ramrez Merino, Yanira Isabel Chvez Rodrguez and Heidi Sofa Chvez Leiva.
.In its communications dated  June,  August and  December , the Government provides the following information.
.With regard to the allegations concerning the enterprise Industria de Hilos de El Salvador, SA de CV, the Government indicates that the procedure to impose a fine on the enterprise Industria de Hilos de El Salvador, SA de CV, for the dismissal of union official Oscar Lpez Cruz and to order payment of the wages due to him because of a fault on the part of the employer has gone to appeal as the enterprise did not accept the fines imposed. In this respect, once the appeal procedures have been completed, the Committee on Freedom of Association will be informed of the outcome without delay. The Committee notes this information and requests the Government to provide a copy of the ruling that is handed down.
.With reference to the allegations concerning the enterprise Hermosa Manufacturing, SA de CV, the Government states that it has requested information from the Office of the Prosecutor-General of the Republic on the situation and outcome of the court action initiated by certain workers (the sentences and their implementation, etc.) in relation to the payment of wages, benefits and other compensation. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.The Government recalls in its reply that the enterprise has been closed down definitively since May . The Committee concludes that its request for an investigation of the allegation that the work stoppages in the enterprise were carried out in order to avoid the list of demands submitted by the STITAS trade union, is no longer timely, and it will not therefore pursue its examination of this matter.
.In relation to the allegations concerning the enterprise CMT, SA de CV, the Government indicates that as soon as it is informed through any channel of the legal action taken by the dismissed union officials it will notify the Committee, but that up to now these union officers have not approached the institutions of the Secretariat of Labour and Social Security. The Committee once again requests the Government to keep it informed of any court action taken by these union officials and, if it is confirmed that they were dismissed for anti-union reasons, to take measures for their reinstatement without loss of wages. With reference to the allegation of harassment and the hounding of the STITAS union officers at their homes, the Government recommends that the persons concerned file complaints with the Office of the Prosecutor-General of the Republic so that it can conduct the necessary investigations and identify those responsible. The Committee invites the complainant organizations and the STITAS union officials who were, according to the allegations, victims of harassment and hounding at their homes to lodge complaints with the Office of the Prosecutor-General so that those responsible can be identified, prosecuted and, where found guilty, punished.
.With regard to the allegations concerning the enterprise Diana, SA de CV, the Government indicates with reference to Daniel Ernesto Morales Rivera that, despite not having been reinstated in his job, the enterprise continues to pay the wages that were due to this union member because of a fault on the part of the employer, as well as the other benefits payable under the collective labour agreement concluded between the enterprise and the union. In relation to the investigation requested by the Committee to determine the reasons for the dismissals of Carlos Mauricio Flores Saldaa and Rafael Antonio Soriano, members of the SIDPA trade union, and to determine the specific facts which led to the disciplinary sanctions resulting in the dismissal of Jos Alfredo Ramrez Merino, Yanira Isabel Chvez Rodrguez and Heidi Sofa Chvez Leiva, the Government reiterates that the General Directorate of Labour Inspection has not been notified of the dismissals of Carlos Mauricio Flores Saldaa and Rafael Antonio Soriano. With reference to the dismissals of Jos Alfredo Ramrez Merino, Yanira Isabel Chvez Rodrguez and Heidi Sofa Chvez Leiva, the Government once again indicates that they were dismissed for repeated disciplinary faults in the performance of their work and that they did not at the time have the status of union officials or members.
.The Government adds that, in the light of the foregoing, it is the responsibility of the workers who were dismissed to file the respective complaints with the labour courts so that they can determine whether or not they were lawful.
.The Committee regrets that the enterprise Diana, SA de CV, has not allowed Daniel Ernesto Morales Rivera to be reinstated in his job (even though his wages continue to be paid) and it requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in the situation of this SIDPA union member and of any action that may be taken by the authorities for his effective reinstatement. The Committee requests the Government to specify the precise acts that were considered to be disciplinary faults resulting in the dismissal of union members Jos Alfredo Ramrez Merino, Yanira Isabel Chvez Rodrguez and Heidi Sofa Chvez Leiva. The Committee invites the complainant organizations and the union members Carlos Mauricio Flores Saldaa and Rafael Antonio Soriano (members of the SIDPA) to contact the Ministry of Labour with a view to clarifying the circumstances of their dismissals and so that compensation procedures can be set in motion if their dismissals are found to be for anti-union reasons.

148,".When it last examined the case in March , the Committee made the following recommendations [see th Report, paras  and ]:' Recalling the importance of guaranteeing the right of freedom of association to workers in the security sector and who have been subject to the refusal to grant legal personality since they submitted their request in , the Committee expects that the Government will take the necessary measures for the expeditious recognition of SITRASSPES and SITISPRI and requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.' With regard to the procedures initiated by STIPES to impose penalties, the Government reports that fines of US$,. were imposed on the enterprise O&M Mantenimiento y Servicios SA de CV in relation to the dismissal of trade union officials and the payment of outstanding wages. In addition, fines of $,. were imposed on the enterprise Servicios Tcnicos del Pacfico SA de CV in relation to the dismissal of trade union officials and the payment of outstanding wages. The Committee takes note of this information and requests the Government, with regard to the dismissal of the  founders of the STIPES trade union, of Mr Alberto Escobar Orellana at the Jos Simen Caas Central American University, of the seven trade union leaders at the clothing company CMT SA de CV and of the trade unionists at the enterprise Hermosa Manufacturing, to continue to promote the reinstatement of the dismissed trade unionists and to keep it informed in this regard, as well as with regard to the outcome of the application for judicial administrative proceedings filed by Mr Jos Amlcar Maldonado (enterprise CMT SA de CV).
.In its communication dated  October , the Government states, with regard to the Committee s first recommendation (granting of legal personality to the Private Security Services Worker s Union (SITISPRI) and the Private Security Workers' Union of El Salvador (SITRASSPES)), that legal personality was not granted to the abovementioned trade unions under those names. However, starting in , the Ministry of Labour and Social Security amended the criteria forming the basis for resolving such matters and has recognized and granted legal personality to the following trade unions of workers in the private security sector, which many of the founders of the above trade unions have been able to set up or join: the Private Security Industry Worker s Union of El Salvador (SITRAISPES) and the Private Security Enterprises Worker s Union of El Salvador (SITESEPRI). Legal personality has also been granted to the SITRAISPES. The Committee takes note of this information with satisfaction.
.Regarding the dismissal of the  founders of the Trade Union of Port Workers' of El Salvador (STIPES) (recommendation (b)), the Government reiterates that it has imposed fines of US$,. on the enterprise O&M Mantenimiento y Servicios SA de CV, and $,. for the dismissal of trade union officials and for the failure to pay outstanding wages. Regarding the dismissal of Mr Alberto Escobar Orellana at the Jos Simen Caas Central American University, the Government states that the employee in question reached an out-of-court settlement with the university authorities.
.Regarding the dismissal of seven trade union officials at the clothing company CMT SA de CV and of the trade unionists at the enterprise Hermosa Manufacturing SA, the Government states that it has permanently shut down their operations in El Salvador, and in cases where complaints were filed with the courts and the rulings found in favour of the complainant workers, the corresponding labour benefits were paid after criminal proceedings for concealment of assets were initiated against the employer. With regard to the dismissals in the enterprise CMT SA de CV, the Government indicates that the administrative process of sanctioning the enterprise CMT SA de CV for carrying out de facto dismissals of the company s workers and trade union officials without following the legal procedure has been concluded. However, the enterprise has ceased operations but has not notified the authorities of the official or formal cessation of its operations. The Ministry of Labour and Social Security reiterates that its labour inspectorate took timely administrative action with a view to reinstating the trade union officials.
.The Committee takes note of this information and requests the Government to continue promoting the reinstatement of the  founders of STIPES and the payment of outstanding wages. Finally, the Committee requests the Government to ensure that the sanctions proceedings it has initiated against the enterprise CMT SA de CV for the dismissal of seven trade union officials are followed by the enforcement of the sanctions decided upon in the sanctions proceedings.
.The Committee last examined this case at its May June  meeting [see th Report, paras ' ]. On that occasion, the Committee made the following recommendations: (a) with regard to the refusal to grant legal personality to the private security unions, the Committee requested the Government to guarantee the right of private security workers to organize and to grant legal personality to SITRASSPES and SITISPRI and requested the complainant organizations to confirm that no further legal action had been taken to obtain legal personality for the union SITRASAIMM; (b) with regard to the dismissal of the  founders of the STIPES trade union, of Mr Alberto Escobar Orellana at the Jos Simen Caas Central American University, of the seven trade union officials at the clothing company CMT SA de CV and of the trade unionists at the enterprise Hermosa Manufacturing, the Committee requested the Government to continue to promote the reinstatement of the dismissed trade unionists and to keep it informed in that regard, as well as with regard to the outcome of the application for judicial administrative proceedings filed by Mr Jos Amlcar Maldonado (company CMT SA de CV) and the pending administrative procedures to impose penalties relating to the dismissal of STIPES members.
.In a communication of  October , the Government indicates that, with regard to granting legal personality to the unions SITRASSPES and SITISPRI, it has acted on the Committee s recommendation and the necessary measures will be taken to grant legal personality to the unions in question. The Government also indicates that it has no knowledge of any legal proceedings initiated by the workers of CMT SA de CV and that the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare has not been requested to intervene in any dispute arising subsequent to the reported events. In this regard, recalling the importance of guaranteeing the right of freedom of association to workers in the security sector and who have been subject to the refusal to grant legal personality since they submitted their request in , the Committee expects that the Government will take the necessary measures for the expeditious recognition of SITRASSPES and SITISPRI and requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.With regard to the procedures initiated by STIPES to impose penalties, the Government reports that fines of US$,. were imposed on the enterprise O&M Mantenimiento y Servicios SA de CV in relation to the dismissal of trade union officials and the payment of outstanding wages. In addition, fines of $,. were imposed on the enterprise Servicios Tcnicos del Pacfico SA de CV in relation to the dismissal of trade union officials and the payment of outstanding wages. The Committee takes note of this information and requests the Government, with regard to the dismissal of the  founders of the STIPES trade union, of Mr Alberto Escobar Orellana at the Jos Simen Caas Central American University, of the seven trade union leaders at the clothing company CMT SA de CV and of the trade unionists at the enterprise Hermosa Manufacturing, to continue to promote the reinstatement of the dismissed trade unionists and to keep it informed in this regard, as well as with regard to the outcome of the application for judicial administrative proceedings filed by Mr Jos Amlcar Maldonado (enterprise CMT SA de CV).
.At its March  session, the Committee made the following recommendations on the matters that were pending [see th Report, paras ,  and ]:' with respect to the refusals to grant legal personality to the private security trade unions SITRASSPES and SITISPRI, the Committee recalls that only members of the police and the armed forces can be excluded from the sphere of application of Convention No.  and requests the Government to take the necessary measures ' including the amendment of the Constitution of the Republic if necessary ' to grant legal personality to the trade union organizations SITRASSPES and SITISPRI;' the Committee requests the Government to inform it about the current status of the process for the registration of the trade union SITRASAIMM;' the Committee urges the Government to take the necessary measures for the reinstatement of the  founders of the STIPES trade union, of Mr Alberto Escobar Orellana at the Jos Simen Caas Central American University, and of the seven trade union leaders at the clothing company CMT SA de CV. The Committee also asks the Government to inform it of the result of the legal proceedings relating to the",0,2005,El Salvador
149,"dismissals of trade unionists at the enterprise Hermosa Manufacturing SA de CV. The Committee once again reminds the Government that ILO technical assistance is at its disposal so as to ensure adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination;' lastly, the Committee invites the complainant organizations to lodge a complaint with the Ministry of Labour concerning the dismissal of the founders of SITRASAIMM, Manuel de Jess Ramirez and Israel Ernesto Avila, after they had submitted a request for the union to be granted legal personality, so that the Ministry of Labour can carry out an investigation into the matter.
.In its communication dated  May , the Government states once again that SITRASSPES was denied legal personality for the second time on the grounds that article () of the Constitution of the Republic prohibits the existence of armed groups of a trade union nature and that private security workers hold positions of trust and under the Labour Code may not therefore participate as constituent members of a trade union organization (trusted employees may however join a trade union organization provided that the general assembly of that union accepts them as such). Legislation provides for other legal mechanisms of appeal against rulings that are considered to be against the claimants. Therefore, the refusal to grant legal personality to this union had a legal basis and is not a violation of freedom of association.
.The Government recalls that, on  October , the Supreme Court of Justice issued a ruling, the text of which literally states:  It is hereby decided in general and binding terms that the expression  without distinction whatsoever' in Article  of the ILO s Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention is unconstitutional because it contravenes article () of the Constitution, inasmuch as the wording of the Convention in question extends the right of freedom of association to public employees who are not covered by the constitutional definition of those who enjoy that right' 
.The Government states that it takes note of the Committee s conclusions and of its suggestion with regard to amending article () of the Constitution of the Republic, which prohibits the existence of armed groups and which was the legal basis for the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare s refusal to grant legal personality to the unions in question.
.In its communication dated  March , the Government states in relation to the union SITRASAIMM (which is in the process of being established) that, since  March  (when the ruling of  October , dismissing the appeal against the ruling to deny SITRASAIMM legal personality, was upheld), no applications have been filed with an administrative body to resume the process of granting legal personality to this union.
.With regard to the union STEES, concerning the dismissal and reinstatement of the worker Mr Alberto Escobar Orellana, the Labour Inspection Directorate sought his immediate reinstatement but as this was not achieved the violations of domestic labour legislation were specified and steps were taken to apply the appropriate penalties and a fine of US$. was imposed for violating article  (dismissing a union official) and article () (owing outstanding pay for reasons attributable to the employer) of the Labour Code. In view of the situation, the worker was recommended to seek recourse through legal channels as well, although this did not mean that he could not continue to use the inspection services to claim outstanding pay for reasons attributable to the employer.
.With regard to the procedures to impose penalties on the enterprise CMT SA de CV, the Government reports that the appropriate procedures have been carried out and that the following fines have been imposed: (a) a fine of US$. for violating articles  and () and () of the Labour Code relating to the de facto dismissal (despido de hecho) of union officials and outstanding pay and financial benefits equivalent to pay for reasons attributable to the employer; (b) a fine of US$. for violating articles  and () and () of the Labour Code relating to the de facto dismissal of union officials and outstanding pay for reasons attributable to the employer; and (c) a fine of US$ for violating article  of the Labour Code relating to the dismissal of trade union officials. These fines have already been paid. The Government reiterates that it has no knowledge of any legal proceedings initiated by the workers of the enterprise CMT SA de CV and that the authorities of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare have not been requested to intervene in any dispute arising subsequent to the reported events.
.Nevertheless, it is important to mention that, by making use of the legal mechanisms in place, Mr Jos Amlcar Maldonado Castillo, founding member of the union in question, initiated judicial administrative proceedings before the Supreme Court of Justice against the Ministry of Labour in relation to the abovementioned ruling. These proceedings are currently in the second round of pleadings, which is why a ruling has not yet been handed down, but as soon as the Government is notified in this regard, it will pass this information on to the Committee without delay.
.With regard to the procedures that are still pending to impose penalties on four enterprises in which the Trade Union of Port Workers of El Salvador (STIPES) operates, the Government indicates that a fine of US$,. has been imposed on the enterprise Operadora General SA de CV for violating articles ,  and () of the Constitution; Article (b) of ILO Convention No. ; and articles (), , () and () of the Labour Code.
.Furthermore, steps are being taken to impose penalties on two other enterprises where STIPES operates, in connection with violations of articles  and () of the Labour Code for dismissal of union officials and outstanding pay for reasons attributable to the employer; the Committee will be informed as soon as rulings are handed down.
.With regard to the dismissal of the SITRASSPES union member, Mr Juan Vidal Ponce Pea, the Government indicates that he was reinstated in his post after having reached an agreement with the enterprise (this information was provided by the Government during the previous examination of the case).
.The Committee takes note of the Government s statements concerning the grounds for the refusal to grant legal personality to the private security unions SITRASSPES and SITISPRI but observes that such grounds have already been examined by the Committee, which had indicated to the Government that only members of the police and the armed forces may be excluded from the guarantees provided under Convention No. . The Committee therefore requests the new Government to take the necessary measures ' including the amendment of the Constitution if necessary ' to guarantee the right of private security workers to organize and to grant legal personality to SITRASSPES and SITISPRI. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard and in this context to guarantee as well the right of public employees to organize, which according to the Government has been declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of Justice. Furthermore, the Committee requests the complainant organizations to confirm the Government s claim that no further legal action has been taken to obtain legal personality for the union SITRASAIMM.
.With regard to the dismissal of the  founders of the STIPES trade union, of Mr Alberto Escobar Orellana at the Jos Simen Caas Central American University, of the seven trade union leaders at the clothing company CMT SA de CV and, of the trade unionists at the enterprise Hermosa Manufacturing, the Committee takes note of the fines imposed by the Ministry of Labour after finding violations of the legal provisions relating to trade union officials but notes with regret that the amount of the fines imposed in the different cases does not appear to serve as a deterrent against acts of anti-union discrimination. The Committee notes the inefficiency of the system of redress for acts of anti-union discrimination, which moreover is too slow if account is taken of the date of the submission of the complaints, and requests the Government to review the system to make it faster and more effective so as to ensure adequate protection. The Committee also requests the Government to continue to promote the reinstatement of the dismissed trade unionists and to keep it informed in that regard, as well as with regard to the outcome of the application for judicial administrative proceedings filed by Mr Jos Maldonado Amlcar (enterprise CMT SA de CV) and the pending administrative procedures to impose penalties relating to the dismissal of STIPES members.
.Lastly, the Committee once again invites the complainant organizations to lodge a complaint with the Ministry of Labour concerning the dismissal of the founders of SITRASAIMM, Manuel de Jess Ramrez and Israel Ernesto Avila, after they had submitted a request for the union to be granted legal personality, so that the Ministry of Labour can carry out an investigation into the matter.
.The Committee last examined this case at its",0,2005,El Salvador
150,"meeting in March , when it made the following recommendations [see th Report, paras ' ]:(a) The Committee regrets that the Ministry of Labour, when it examined the appeal lodged by the private security sector union SITRASSPES, did not resolve to grant it legal personality, despite the Committee s recommendation that it do so. The Committee considers that this situation is incompatible with the requirements of Convention No. , and specifically Article  of the Convention which provides for the right of workers without distinction to establish organizations of their own choosing. The Committee therefore once again urges the Government to grant the said trade union legal personality.(b) The Committee draws attention to the very short time allowed by law for the parties concerned to produce the information requested by the Ministry of Labour in the appeals proceedings in respect of the granting of legal personality and regrets that the trade union SITRASAIMM was denied legal personality on such grounds. The Committee calls on the Government to take steps to review the legislation with respect to the time allowed and to reconsider SITRASAIMM s request to be registered as a trade union.(c) The Committee urges the Government to grant the SITISPRI trade union legal personality and to keep it informed in this respect.(d) The Committee requests the Government to pursue its efforts to have the  founders of the STIPES trade union and the founder of the SITRASSPES trade union, Juan Vidal Ponce, the official of the STEES trade union, Alberto Escobar Orellana, and seven union officials at the CMT, SA de CV, clothing company reinstated in their jobs, and to impose additional sufficiently dissuasive fines in accordance with national legislation if they are not reinstated, and also to ensure that the salaries and other labour benefits owed to them are paid.(e) The Committee invites the complainant organizations to lodge a complaint with the Ministry of Labour concerning the dismissal of the founders of SITRASAIMM, Manuel de Jess Ramrez and Israel Ernesto Avila, after they had submitted a request for the union to be granted legal personality, so that the Ministry of Labour can carry out an investigation into the matter.(f) The Committee is obliged to note once again that the present case shows that the exercise of trade union rights ' whether the right to establish trade union organizations or the right to adequate and effective protection against acts of anti-union discrimination ' is guaranteed neither in the legislation, whose fines do not appear to have any dissuasive effect, nor in practice. The Committee reiterates its earlier recommendations and reminds the Government once again that it may avail itself of ILO technical cooperation in the context of the preparation of future trade union legislation. The Committee considers that, among other things, the new legislation should guarantee the right to establish trade unions without restrictions, and that proceedings in the case of anti-union discrimination should be rapid and effective providing for sufficiently dissuasive sanctions. Moreover, the new legislation should avoid the Ministry of Labour informing the employer of the names of the founders of a trade union in order for the employer to indicate whether or not the founders are employees.(g) Finally, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the decisions handed down by the courts with respect to the trade unionists who were dismissed by Hermosa Manufacturing, SA de CV.
.In a communication dated  June , the Government sent the following information.Refusal by the Ministry of Labour to grant legal personality to the trade unions SITRASAIMM, SITRASSPES and SITISPRI (recommendations (a), (b) and (c))SITRASAIMM: The Government states that account should be taken of the fact that the only documents to be submitted by SITRASAIMM were copies of  individual work contracts, which were presumably readily available, and therefore the short deadline is reasonable. With respect to reviewing the legislation concerning the time allowed, it should be recalled that this legislation differs from labour legislation in that the residual law to process SITRASAIMM s application for reconsideration was the Civil Proceedings Act, and for this reason the Government will not commit itself to promoting legal reforms in this area of civil law, as it would be entering into an area outside the scope of labour issues and amending civil procedures pertaining to applications for reconsideration. Notwithstanding the above, it is important to mention that within the framework of the report entitled  The labour dimension in Central America and the Dominican Republic, building on progress: strengthening compliance and developing capacity'  known as the White Paper, the Ministry of Labour adopted a series of measures to facilitate the granting of legal personality to trade unions and to make legal deadlines more efficient, handing down rulings in less time than established in the Labour Code. An instrument has also been drawn up that contains all the information concerning the functions performed by the Department of Social Organizations of the Ministry of Labour, particularly those relating to the granting of legal personality to trade unions. In addition, the Government has committed itself to reviewing articles  and  of the Labour Code relating to the reduction in the number of members required to constitute a trade union and the reduction of the waiting period so that a trade union that has been refused legal personality does not have to wait six months before trying to form another trade union. It has also expressly committed itself to conducting national consultations with ILO technical assistance in order to evaluate fully the administrative procedures for the registering of trade unions, and the recommendations resulting from that process will be promptly implemented by the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare. The Committee notes this information and asks the Government to inform it about the current status of the process for the registration of the SITRASAIMM.SITRASSPES and SITISPRI: With respect to the refusals to grant legal personality to these private security trade unions, in its communication of December , the SITRASSPES indicates that in September  it submitted a new request for legal personality, which was once again refused by the authorities. The Government states that while it is true that Conventions Nos  and  have been ratified (they have not yet entered into force), the situation will not change as article () of the Constitution of the Republic, which expressly prohibits the existence of armed groups, has not been amended, and therefore the refusal of the administrative authorities will continue to have a legal basis. The Committee notes this information. It recalls that only members of the police and the armed forces can be excluded from the sphere of application of Convention No.  and requests the Government to take the necessary measures ' including the amendment of the Constitution of the Republic if necessary ' to grant legal personality to the trade union organizations SITRASSPES and SITISPRI.Dismissals and transfers of the founders of the trade union organizations STIPES and SITRASSPES, and dismissals of other trade unionistsSTIPES: With regard to the Trade Union of Port Workers of El Salvador (STIPES), the procedures to fine the enterprises where the dismissed founders of STIPES worked have been applied, resulting in a fine of US$,. being imposed on the enterprise Operadores Portuarios Salvadoreos, SA de CV. The other enterprises involved are also in the process of being fined, and the ILO will be informed once the respective fines have been imposed. To date, a review of the files does not reveal any request for conciliatory action having been registered by the founders of the trade union.SITRASSPES: With respect to the reinstatement of the worker Juan Vidal Ponce Pea, founder of the Private Security Workers' Union of El Salvador (SITRASSPES), on  September , on the request of Mr Ponce Pea, the Minister of Labour, through the General Directorate of the Labour Inspectorate, carried out a special inspection at the enterprise Sociedad de Servicios Administrativos de Seguridad de Empresas, SA de CV. It concluded that the enterprise in question had infringed article  of the Labour Code by dismissing Mr Ponce Pea and recommended that he be reinstated immediately in his usual position. It had also infringed article , obligation , of the same legal text, owing the worker outstanding pay for reasons attributable to the employer. On  September , a further inspection was carried out to check whether the infringements specified during the special inspection had been rectified: the infringement relative to reinstatement had not been rectified; the infringement relating to the pay due to Mr Ponce had been rectified, with the enterprise depositing the pay in question into escrow accounts with the Ministry, which were subsequently withdrawn by the worker in question. Despite the above, and making use of the various legal mechanisms available to apply for legal protection, Mr Ponce requested the Directorate General of Labour to convene the Sociedad de Servicios Administrativos de Seguridad de Empresas, SA de CV to discuss his reinstatement during a conciliatory hearing. Following up on the",-1,2005,El Salvador
151,"request, the Directorate convened the legal representative of the enterprise on  February ; the employer s attorney appeared as the employer representative and stated that his principal had not dismissed Mr Ponce and that furthermore both parties had reached an extra ministerial agreement. This statement was endorsed by Mr Ponce Pea, who was present at the conciliation hearing.STEES: With respect to the reinstatement of the worker Alberto Escobar Orellana, Second Disputes Secretary of the Education Workers' Union of El Salvador (STEES), who worked at the Jos Simen Caas Central American University (UCA), despite ongoing efforts by the labour inspectorate to make the University rectify the infringement committed, that is to say reinstate Mr Escobar Orellana in his position of work, such reinstatement did not occur, and as a result the corresponding fine was imposed. In spite of the efforts of the Ministry of Labour to ensure compliance with labour legislation through administrative channels (i.e. the labour inspectorate), the worker has been informed of his right to go through judicial channels and to use the available legal machinery; he has also been informed that he can apply for legal protection. The Government will go on assisting the worker if he so requests.CMT SA de CV: There has been no change in the actions taken by the Ministry of Labour since the Committee was last informed.Hermosa Manufacturing, SA de CV: A letter was sent to the Attorney-General of the Republic through the Directorate General of Labour requesting information about the cases brought before the courts concerning the complaints made by workers dismissed from the enterprise.
.The Committee notes this information. The Committee urges the Government to take the necessary measures for the reinstatement of the  founders of the STIPES trade union, of Mr Alberto Escobar Orellana at the Jos Simen Caas Central American University, and of the seven trade union leaders at the clothing company CMT SA de CV. The Committee also asks the Government to inform it of the result of the legal proceedings relating to the dismissals of trade unionists at the enterprise Hermosa Manufacturing, SA de CV. The Committee once again reminds the Government that ILO technical assistance is at its disposal so as to ensure adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination.
.Lastly, the Committee invites the complainant organizations to lodge a complaint with the Ministry of Labour concerning the dismissal of the founders of SITRASAIMM, Manuel de Jess Ramirez and Israel Ernesto Avila, after they had submitted a request for the union to be granted legal personality, so that the Ministry of Labour can carry out an investigation into the matter.
.The Government subsequently sent additional observations in communications dated  June and  October .
.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee regrets that the Ministry of Labour, when it examined the appeal lodged by the private security sector union SITRASSPES, did not resolve to grant it legal personality, despite the Committee s recommendation that it do so. The Committee considers that this situation is incompatible with the requirements of Convention No. , and specifically Article  of the Convention which provides for the right of workers without distinction to establish organizations of their own choosing. The Committee therefore once again urges the Government to grant the said trade union legal personality.(b) The Committee draws attention to the very short time allowed by law for the parties concerned to produce the information requested by the Ministry of Labour in the appeals proceedings in respect of the granting of legal personality and regrets that the trade union SINTRASAIMM was denied legal personality on such grounds. The Committee calls on the Government to take steps to review the legislation with respect to the time allowed and to reconsider SITRASAIMM s request to be registered as a trade union.(c) The Committee urges the Government to grant the SITISPRI trade union legal personality and to keep it informed in this respect.(d) The Committee requests the Government to pursue its efforts to have the  founders of the STIPES trade union and the founder of the SITRASSPES trade union, Juan Vidal Ponce, the official of the STEES trade union, Alberto Escobar Orellana, and seven union officials at the CMT, SA de CV, clothing company reinstated in their jobs, and to impose additional sufficiently dissuasive fines in accordance with national legislation if they are not reinstated, and also to ensure that the salaries and other labour benefits owed to them are paid.(e) The Committee invites the complainant organizations to lodge a complaint with the Ministry of Labour concerning the dismissal of the founders of SITRASAIMM, Manuel de Jess Ramrez and Israel Ernesto Avila, after they had submitted a request for the union to be granted legal personality, so that the Ministry of Labour can carry out an investigation into the matter.(f) The Committee is obliged to note once again that the present case shows that the exercise of trade union rights ' whether the right to establish trade union organizations or the right to adequate and effective protection against acts of anti-union discrimination ' is guaranteed neither in the legislation, whose fines do not appear to have any dissuasive effect, nor in practice. The Committee reiterates its earlier recommendations and reminds the Government once again that it may avail itself of ILO technical cooperation in the context of the preparation of future trade union legislation. The Committee considers that, among other things, the new legislation should guarantee the right to establish trade unions without restrictions, and that proceedings in the case of anti-union discrimination should be rapid and effective providing for sufficiently dissuasive sanctions. Moreover, the new legislation should avoid the Ministry of Labour informing the employer of the names of the founders of a trade union in order for the employer to indicate whether or not the founders are employees.(g) Finally, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the decisions handed down by the courts with respect to the trade unionists who were dismissed by Hermosa Manufacturing, SA de CV.
.El Salvador has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee urges the Government to grant legal personality to Dockworkers' Union of El Salvador (STIPES) and the Private Security Workers' Union of El Salvador (SITRASSPES) without delay and firmly trusts that the Ministry of Labour will allow the appeal against the decision of the Ministry of Labour refusing such legal personality. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.(b) Taking into account the Government s assertions that certain companies do not belong to the metal engineering industry, the Committee requests the complainants to provide their comments in this regard and to clarify the status of metal engineering worker of each of the founders of the Salvadorian Metal Engineering Workers' Union (SITRASAIMM) (except those of Sociedad Metalrgica Sarti, S.A. de C.V. whose metal engineering status is recognized by the Government). The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the result of the administrative appeal by SITRASAIMM against the refusal to grant legal personality.(c) The Committee urges the Government to continue, as it has been doing up to now, to seek the reinstatement of the  founders of STIPES, the founder of the Private Security Workers' Union of El Salvador (SITRASSPES), Mr. Juan Vidal Ponce and the trade union official of the Education Workers' Union of El Salvador (STEES), Mr. Alberto Escobar Orellana and to inform it of the result of the proceedings for the imposition of a fine undertaken by the Ministry of Labour. The Committee also requests the Government to continue to seek the transfer of Santiago Sin and Ral Delen Hernndez, founders of SITRASSPES, back to the posts which they previously occupied in their companies and suggests to the complainant organizations that they invite Mr. Carlos Antonio Cushco Cunza and Mr. Ricardo Hernndez Cruz, also founders of SITRASSPES, to lodge a complaint about their alleged transfer with the Ministry of Labour so that it can take action in their case. The Committee requests the complainant organizations to submit their comments on the Government s statement that nine of the founders of SITRASAIMM were dismissed in June  while the trade union s application for legal personality was submitted on  August , thus suggesting that those dismissals were not related to the formation of the trade union.(d) The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the alleged dismissal of the founders of SITRASAIMM, Mr. Manuel de Jess Ramrez and Mr. Israel Ernesto Avila on  September , i.e. after",0,2005,El Salvador
152,"the application for legal personality submitted by the founders of the trade union.(e) As regards the dismissal of  trade unionists in the Hermosa Manufacturing company (among them seven trade union officials designated by name), the Committee notes the Government s statements that the company has ceased operations indefinitely and that the Ministry of Labour is taking steps and carrying out inspections to investigate and try to reach agreement on the failure to implement their labour rights. The Committee requests the Government to ensure that those dismissed received all the legal compensation due and invites the complainant organizations, as requested by the Government in its reply, to communicate the names of the  trade unionists to which the complaint refers (the names of the seven officials are already given in the allegations).(f) As regards the alleged dismissal of seven trade union officials in the CMT clothing company branch of the General Union of Seamstresses (SGC), the Committee notes that the Labour Inspectorate has sought the reinstatement of the dismissed workers and payment of wages unpaid for reasons imputable to the employer. The Committee requests the Government to continue seeking the reinstatement of the seven trade union officials and payment of the wages due.(g) The Committee reminds the Government that it may avail itself of ILO technical cooperation for the preparation of future trade union legislation. The Committee considers that, among other things, the new legislation should guarantee the right to form trade unions without restrictions, that proceedings in the case of anti-trade union discrimination should be rapid and effective, and should avoid the Ministry of Labour informing the employer of the names of the founders of a trade union in order for the employer to indicate whether or not they are employees. This type of check should be carried out in another way, for example by requiring companies to provide the Ministry of Labour with the full list of workers on its payroll so that it can check whether or not the founders are employees.(h) The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the communication of FENASTRAS dated  April , with regard to the legal personality of the SITISPRI trade union.",0,2005,El Salvador
153,".The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  August .
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to communicate to it the text of the judgement handed down by the Constitutional Court of the Supreme Court of Justice concerning the expulsion order against the trade union adviser Mr. Banchn Rivera.(b) The Committee hopes that the judgement handed down will take into account all the considerations put forward in its conclusions.",1,2005,El Salvador
154,".The Committee last examined this case, which concerns the murder of trade union official Mr Jos Gilberto Soto, at its March  meeting. On that occasion, the Committee noted the Government s information that the Usulutn Court issued a judgement convicting Mr Herbert Joel Ramrez Gmez of the acts against Mr Jos Gilberto Soto that he had been charged with, which were deemed by the court to have constituted aggravated homicide, a crime punishable under sections  and () of the Penal Code. The Government also indicated that, as the judgement indicates, the killing of Mr Jos Gilberto Soto was unconnected with any trade union activity; that is, it was not motivated by labour-related issues. In this respect, the Committee requested the Government to send a copy of the judgement in question [see th Report, paras ' ].
.In a communication of  July , the Government sent the text of the judgement requested.
.The Committee notes the judgement and, in particular, that the perpetrator of the murder of trade union official Mr Jos Gilberto Soto has been sentenced to  years in prison. The Committee observes, however, that the judgement does not allow a clear determination to be made as to the motive of the murder (personal or trade union).
.At its November  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendation [see rd Report, para. ]:Deeply regretting the killing of the trade union leader Jos Gilberto Soto, the Committee emphasizes that it is essential to bring the guilty parties to justice and requests the Government, as a matter of urgency, to keep it informed of the criminal proceedings currently under way. It expects that the plaintiffs will be granted access to all the elements of the case file, that the investigation will be completed and the deficiencies reported by the ICFTU, if proven true, be rectified, without any attempts to obstruct the work of the Human Rights Ombudsman, and that the proceedings will be concluded in the near future.
.In its communication of  August , the Government indicates that it is sending the text of the judgement handed down by the Usulutn Court against Herbert Joel Ramrez Gmez, convicting him of the acts against Jos Gilberto Soto with which he had been charged and which were deemed by the court to have constituted aggravated homicide, a crime punishable under sections  and () of the Penal Code. The Government indicates that, as the judgement indicates, the killing of Jos Gilberto Soto was unconnected with any trade union activity, that is, was not motivated by labour-related issues, and for that reason, respectfully requests the Committee to close this case, since the alleged facts do not constitute a violation of trade union rights.
.The Committee takes note of these statements but emphasizes that it has not received a copy of the court judgement, despite the fact that the Office requested it in September . The Committee accordingly requests the Government to send a copy of the judgement in question.
.When it last examined this case at its meeting in November , the Committee made the following recommendation [see rd Report, para. ]:Deeply regretting the killing of the trade union leader Jos Gilberto Soto, the Committee emphasizes that it is essential to bring the guilty parties to justice and requests the Government, as a matter of urgency, to keep it informed of the criminal proceedings currently under way. It expects that the plaintiffs will be granted access to all the elements of the case file, that the investigation will be completed and the deficiencies reported by the ICFTU, if proven true, be rectified, without any attempts to obstruct the work of the Human Rights Ombudsman, and that the proceedings will be concluded in the near future.
.In its communication dated  January , the Government states, in relation to the case of Mr Jos Gilberto Soto, that it condemned the crime from the outset and that the relevant investigations have been launched to find the criminals responsible for this deplorable act. To that end, the Government has made available all the necessary resources to conduct a serious, in-depth and impartial investigation with a view to identifying those responsible for the murder of Mr Soto, as well as their motives, and to ensuring that they are tried and duly punished. The Government therefore categorically rejects the assertions of the Salvadorian Inter-Union Committee (CIEL), supported by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), in its communication dated  February  [see rd Report, paras  and ]. The Government states that it is sending the observations requested in order to repudiate these complaints.
.The complainant bases its complaints on seven conclusions taken from the report of the Human Rights Ombudsperson, Ms Beatrice Alamanni de Carrillo, on Mr Gilberto Soto s case.
.It must be clarified, in regard to this report, that the investigation carried out by the Office of the Human Rights Ombudsperson presented certain information as fact, due to a lack of communication with those responsible for the case, whereas scientific evidence disapproved it.
.With regard to the management of the crime scene which was open (i.e. people could access it easily as it was in a public area), when the national civil police arrived there were already many local residents and onlookers present. The bicycle and other material evidence were legally seized under article  of the Code of Penal Procedure and now fall under police jurisdiction.
.Regarding the alleged sexual abuse of the accused by the agents of the authorities, it should be noted that the defendant, Santos Snchez Ayala, underwent a physical examination which showed that he had not been subjected to any form of abuse. It was thereby procedurally determined that the defendant, Snchez Ayala, was lying when he said that he had been sexually abused. In similar circumstances, an examination was also carried out on the defendant, Herbert Ramrez, even though he did not request it at his initial hearing; the result was also negative, showing that he had not suffered the alleged sexual abuse.
.It should be noted that it is a fact that one of the witnesses withdrew during the identity parade of the suspects because the witness s relatives received threats from one of the direct perpetrators of the crime and from his relatives and members of the same gang (Mara Dieciocho). The intimidation suffered by the witness was revealed at the public hearing at which the witnesses spoke of these threats and the reason for his behaviour.
.With regard to the statement referring to the use of anonymous or confidential sources, it must be made clear that these are used to guide the investigation, through the formulation of hypotheses to be proven by other evidence so that a conclusion to the case can be drawn. We can therefore affirm that the information or circumstances provided by informants about a crime do not constitute proof, but supply information on verified evidence which make the preliminary investigation possible.
.The informer is simply a mediate witness offering information during the trial as an intermediary or infiltrator helping to obtain information. In this case, the movements of the accused were investigated. One of the informants said that Herbert Joel Ramrez Gmez s firearm (the murder weapon) had been seized. This information was corroborated by the ballistic expert s evidence, which was established as preliminary evidence by the First Criminal Court of Usulutn, and the statement of the informant was thereby confirmed, since the firearm seized from Ramrez Gmez fired the bullets which killed Mr Jos Gilberto Soto.
.Furthermore, the total secrecy that was imposed on the legal proceedings was because of the actions of the Office of the Human Rights Ombudsperson employees. The support officer of that institution offered to send the witnesses to Canada or Australia if they changed their statements, saying that he could obtain asylum for them and their families. This is proved by the opening of investigations for bribery against the support officer of the Office of the Human Rights Ombudsperson.
.During interviews with the victim s family members, no pressure was exerted. Furthermore, when Ms Mara Soto was interviewed, members of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters were present; they read the statement before it was signed, a fact which can be corroborated, since the statement is registered with the Court of Justice of Usulutn with their signatures affixed.
.It is important to mention that the investigation carried out by the Elite Division against Organized Crime (DECO) of the national civil police was able to establish that the motive for the murder of Mr Jos Gilberto Soto could be that his wife, Elva Maritza Ortz Zelaya, who is resident in the United States, wanted to take revenge for being subjected to domestic violence.
.Ms Arely Soto (the victim s sister) and her husband, Carlos Chacn (the victim s brother-in-law), confirm this hypothesis in their respective statements given to different police and legal authorities by hinting at the problems between Jos Gilberto Soto and Elva Maritza Ortz Zelaya (the victim s wife). Carlos Chacn states that he listened to a message",0,2004,El Salvador
155,"recorded on the answering machine of one of the victim s telephones in which the victim s wife was insulting the victim. He also stated that he overheard a telephone conversation between them in which they were arguing.
.On a judicial level the case is not concluded, however, the final ruling found Herbert Joel Ramrez guilty of the crime. With regard to the two suspects who were acquitted, the public prosecutors on the case expressed their disagreement with the ruling and gave notice of appeal to the high court: the case will now go before the criminal court of the Supreme Court of Justice.
.These observations concur with the reports drafted by the Attorney-General s Office and the Elite Division against Organized Crime (DECO). It is clear that the motive for the murder of Mr Jos Gilberto Soto is not connected with any trade union activity, i.e. the motive is not related to his labour activities. For this reason, with all due respect the Government asks the Committee on Freedom of Association to consider this case closed, since the alleged crimes do not constitute a violation of trade union rights.
.The Committee notes the Government s information and in particular that the (final) legal verdict finds Herbert Joel Ramrez guilty of the murder of the trade union leader, Jos Gilberto Soto, and that the public prosecutors have given notice of appeal to the high court against the acquittal of the other two suspects. The Committee notes that the Government s reply states that the police believe the motive for the murder of Mr Jos Gilberto Soto could be that his wife, Elva Maritza Ortz Zelaya (who is resident in the United States), wanted to take revenge for being subjected to domestic violence.
.The Committee regrets once again the murder of this trade union official and requests the Government to send it the judgement without delay, as well as any other decision or ruling relating to the high court appeal mentioned by the Government. The Committee invites the complainant organizations to present their comments on the Government s statements, if they so wish.
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  January and  August .
.El Salvador ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Workers' Representatives Convention,  (No. ), and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ) on  September .
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:Deeply regretting the killing of the trade union leader Jos Gilberto Soto, the Committee emphasizes that it is essential to bring the guilty parties to justice and requests the Government, as a matter of urgency, to keep it informed of the criminal proceedings currently under way.

156,".The Committee last examined this case at its meeting in March  [see th Report, paras ' ] and, on that occasion, made the following recommendations:(a) The Committee considers that, given the time that has elapsed since the alleged incidents (which according to the complainant union occurred in  and ), the fact that some of the dismissed workers or persons claiming to have been threatened with dismissal have not asked the Ministry of Labour to take action, that some of the legal actions initiated by the complainant organization or its members have been unsuccessful for reasons of form (statute of limitations, inadequate identification of the defendants) or are pending, and in view of the concerns raised by the serious nature of the allegations during the period in question (including dismissals of union officials and members, threats of dismissal against workers who refuse to leave their union, promotion by the employer of a parallel union and violation of the collective agreement), the Committee requests the Government to undertake mediation measures between the complainant trade union, on the one hand, and the Ro Lempa Hydroelectricity Board (CEL) and El Salvador Electricity Transmission Company, on the other, with a view to resolving the problems that remain pending in a manner satisfactory to both parties, in the light of the ILO s principles of freedom of association and collective bargaining.(b) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.(c) The Committee trusts that the Government will keep it informed of the ruling handed down concerning the dismissal of the trade union official Mr Roberto Efran Acosta as soon as it is handed down.
.In a communication of  June , the Government reports that the labour relations between the Trade Union of Workers of the Hydroelectricity Board (STSEL) and the CEL are currently being conducted in a climate of stability, to the extent that the parties are now at the stage of directly negotiating the revision of the collective labour agreement between them. In addition, it is reported that the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice definitively dismissed the case against the president of the CEL, as the trade union official Mr Roberto Efran Acosta Cisneros, who was dismissed, was unable to prove that the then president of the CEL was directly responsible for that action.
.Given that the Government s reply does not refer specifically to the outcome of the proceedings relating to the dismissal of the trade union official Mr Roberto Efran Acosta, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the final outcome of those proceedings. Lastly, the Committee notes with interest the new climate of stability in the labour relations and in the process of reviewing the collective agreement between the STSEL and the CEL and hopes that this negotiation will make it possible to address the issues relating to the enjoyment of trade union rights.

.El Salvador has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) With regard to the alleged dismissal of union leaders and members at the Ro Lempa Hydroelectricity Board (CEL), the Committee requests the Government to send a copy of the ruling concerning the dismissal of union official Mr. Germn Granados Figueroa and of any ruling issued in relation to the dismissal of Mr. Roberto Efran Acosta, and to provide information on the situation of the other two dismissed officials who allegedly did not accept the statutory severance pay (Mr. Ren Torres Aguirre and Roger Bill Aguilar), indicating whether they have taken legal action.(b) The Committee asks the Government to examine the issue of reinstatement of the dismissed trade unionists who did not accept severance pay, and to ensure that in future the dismissal of union leaders can only occur in accordance with the procedure laid down in article  of the Constitution.(c) With regard to the alleged anti-union dismissals of trade unionists at the El Salvador Electricity Transmission Company (ETESAL) (nine union officials ' including seven having trade union immunity ' and seven members), the Committee requests the Government to send the text of the ruling which declared the strike at ETESAL illegal so that it can examine these allegations in full knowledge of the facts.(d) As regards the allegation concerning the promotion of parallel unions at CEL and ETESAL with intent to dissolve or damage the branches of the complainant organization at both institutions, the Committee requests the Government to send the text of the ruling of  December  issued by the Administrative Disputes Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice concerning the appeal lodged by the general secretary of the complainant organization in relation to the new union established at ETESAL, as well as its observations on the alleged actions of the enterprise concerning the creation of a parallel union at CEL.(e) With regard to the alleged campaign to intimidate workers into resigning from the branches of the complainant union at CEL and ETESAL, the Committee notes that the Government declares that the allegation concerning ETESAL could not be proven and that the enterprise states that it had no knowledge of the resignations from the union until the workers presented copies of their respective resignation letters to stop the check-off of their union dues. The Committee also observes that the Government has not sent observations on the allegations concerning the campaign of intimidation to make workers resign from the CEL branch or on the allegations concerning violation of the collective agreement. The Committee requests the Government to carry out an in-depth investigation into the abovementioned matters and keep it informed in this respect.(f) Finally, the Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the allegation that the Ministry of Labour maintained a complicit silence with regard to the complaints submitted by the complainant union in relation to the matters raised in the present case.",1,2004,El Salvador

158,".At its March  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendations [see th Report, para. ].The Committee notes the Government s statement in its communication of  June  that, until the Constitution of the Republic is amended, it will not be possible in the short term to grant legal personality to SITRASEPRIES. The Committee observes that, since this communication was sent, El Salvador has ratified Conventions Nos  and  (on  September ) and, recalling that Convention No.  applies to private security agents, the Committee urges the Government to take the measures necessary to grant legal personality to SITRASEPRIES. With regard to the alleged death threats against five officials of STITAS (which, according to the Government, is not an offence for which charges are automatically brought), the Committee notes the information provided by the Government and invites those concerned to lodge complaints with the Office of the Attorney-General of the Republic or the competent courts.
.In its communication dated  June , the Government states that El Salvador has ratified Conventions Nos  and , which have not entered into force; consequently, it will not be possible in the short term to grant SITRASEPRIES legal personality until an amendment is made to the Constitution of the Republic, which, in article , paragraph , expressly prohibits the existence of armed groups. Therefore, the administrative decision not to grant SITRASEPRIES legal personality continues to have a legal basis.
.With regard to the refusal to grant SITRASEPRIES legal personality, the Committee recalls once again that, in accordance with the principles of freedom of association, only the armed forces and the police can be excluded from the constitutional right to establish trade unions, and that all other workers, including private security agents, should feely be able to establish trade union organizations of their own choosing. In these circumstances, as it did at its March  and June  meetings, the Committee reminds the Government of its obligations resulting from the ratification of Conventions Nos  and  and urges it to take the necessary measures so that SITRASEPRIES is granted legal personality without delay.
.With regard to the alleged death threats made against five STITAS officials, the Committee regrets that the complainants have not indicated if a complaint has been lodged with the relevant authorities.
.The Committee made the following recommendations at its meeting in March  [see th Report, para. ]:With regard to the denial of legal personality to the Private Security Services Industry Workers' Trade Union of El Salvador (SITRASEPRIES), the Committee recalls that it had already pointed out that, in accordance with the principles of freedom of association, only the armed forces and the police can be excluded from the right to establish trade unions and all other workers, including private security agents, should freely be able to establish trade union organizations of their own choosing. Consequently, as it did at its March  and June  meetings, the Committee urges the Government to take the measures necessary to ensure that legal personality is granted to SITRASEPRIES without delay. Finally, the Committee requests the Government again to transmit the observations of  May  regarding the alleged death threats against five officials of the Union of Textile and Related Industry Workers of El Salvador (STITAS), as these observations have not been received.
.In its communication of  June , with regard to the Committee s request that the Government take the measures necessary to ensure that legal personality is granted to SITRASEPRIES without delay, the Government states that, until the Constitution of the Republic is amended, it will not be possible in the short term to grant legal personality to SITRASEPRIES. Furthermore, with regard to the alleged death threats against five officials of STITAS, the Government states that, as this is not an offence for which charges are brought automatically, those concerned were invited to file charges with the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic or the competent courts.
.The Committee notes the Government s statement in its communication of  June  that, until the Constitution of the Republic is amended, it will not be possible in the short term to grant legal personality to SITRASEPRIES. The Committee observes that since this communication was sent, El Salvador has ratified Conventions Nos.  and  (on
.At its June  meeting, the Committee stressed the fact that the denial of legal personality to the Private Security Services Industry Workers' Trade Union of El Salvador (SITRASEPRIES) was a serious violation of freedom of association and it urged the Government to recognize this trade union without delay and to keep it informed in this regard. Likewise, the Committee requested the Government to keep it informed of any new legal ruling handed down relating to the accusation of alleged robbery against trade union official, Jos Alirio Prez Caenguez, and to ensure that the  trade union officials dismissed received compensation (these officials had agreed on a settlement regarding compensation). Finally, as regards the alleged death threats against five officials of the Union of Textiles and Related Industry Workers of El Salvador (STITAS) by one of the owners of the J.R.C. Manufacturing S.A. of C.V. company, the Committee requests the Government, as a matter of urgency, to take measures to ensure that the competent authorities carry out an inquiry into the matter and, if the allegations are shown to be true, to punish those responsible [see th Report, paras. -].
.In its communication of  August , the Government states that the accusation against Mr. Jos Alirio Prez Caenguez was provisionally put aside in the absence of sufficient evidence and this trade union official, along with the other officials, received compensation. As to the Committee s request regarding SITRASEPRIES, the Government states that, administrative avenues having been exhausted with the declaration of the inadmissibility of the appeal against the decision declaring the request for legal personality by the trade union to be groundless, the sole legal means by which the Ministry of Labour could grant legal personality to the trade union would be for the complainant to make use of the existing legal mechanisms contained in the legal system to effectively demonstrate that the decision of the Ministry contravened labour legislation. The Government states that it will keep the Committee informed of any legal ruling regarding this matter. As to the alleged threats, the Government refers to its observations of  May .
.The Committee notes this information. With regard to the denial of legal personality to SITRASEPRIES, the Committee recalls that it had already pointed out that, in accordance with the principles of freedom of association, only the armed forces and the police can be excluded from the right to establish trade unions and all other workers, including private security agents, should freely be able to establish trade union organizations of their own choosing. Consequently, as it did at its March  and June  meetings, the Committee urges the Government to take the measures necessary to ensure that legal personality is granted to SITRASEPRIES without delay. Finally, the Committee requests the Government again to transmit the observations of  May  regarding the alleged death threats against five officials of the STITAS trade union, as these observations have not been received.
.The Committee last examined this case at its March  meeting and, on that occasion, requested the Government to take steps urgently to ensure that the competent authorities carry out an investigation into the alleged death threats against five trade union officials from STITAS by one of the owners of the J.R.C. Manufacturing S.A. of C.V. company and, if the alleged facts were confirmed, to punish those responsible and to guarantee adequate protection to these officials. The Committee considered that the trade union official, Jos Alirio Prez Caenguez, should be reinstated in his post without loss of pay and be authorized to exercise his trade union activities, and requested the Government to keep it informed of any new legal ruling handed down relating to the accusation of robbery against this trade union officer which, to date, had been provisionally put aside in the absence of sufficient evidence. The Committee considered that the denial of legal personality for the Private Security Services Industry Workers' Trade Union of El Salvador (SITRASEPRIES) was a violation of freedom of association, and urged the Government to recognize this trade union and to keep it informed in this respect. Lastly, the Committee requested the Government to provide without delay information on the specific facts that led to the dismissal of  trade union officials from the J.R.C. Manufacturing S.A. of C.V. company in October  and to indicate whether these trade union members remained dismissed; the Committee also requested the Government to indicate the reasons for the dismissal of trade union official, Juana Ramrez, in February , and, if it were proven that any of these officials had been dismissed by reason of their trade union activities, to ensure that they were reinstated in their posts without loss of pay [see rd Report,",1,2003,El Salvador
159,"para. , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (March )].
.In its communication of  March , the complainant (FENASTRAS) sent a copy of the Ministry of Labour resolution of  October  according to which the appeal by SITRASEPRIES was not admissible.
.In its communications of  October  and  January , the Government states that the J.R.C. Manufacturing S.A. of C.V. company closed down its operations definitively in February . As regards the workers laid off, the parties agreed to a settlement regarding payment of compensation at the General Labour Directorate on  and  June .
.With regard to the case of SITRASEPRIES, the Government maintains that two fundamental principles are at stake: the principle of legality, and the principle that the law must be respected to the letter. Both of these principles have contributed to what is known as the  rule of law'  according to which any judicial authority, executive power and activities of individuals must be consistent with the law. It is therefore claimed, quite properly, that the essential characteristic of a state based on the rule of law is the fact that the law is above the government and the governed. The Government maintains that the Department of Labour and Social Security, in denying legal personality for SITRASEPRIES, was only adopting a constitutionally valid decision, given that article , paragraph , of the Constitution expressly  prohibits the existence of armed groups of a political, religious or professional nature'  it is clear that a trade union falls into the last of these categories, and the union in the present case is indeed a professional body formed by persons who use and possess firearms and thus come expressly within the terms of the constitutional prohibition. The Government adds that, in this context, it decided on  October to declare inadmissible the application by Juan Jos Huezo, General Secretary of the complainant organization, to rescind the resolution declaring null and void the application for legal personality made by SITRASEPRIES, for the legal reasons set out in a note dated  October . The Government adds that the Act concerning the organization and functions of the labour and social security sector and the Labour Code do not provide for any administrative mechanisms for challenging such resolutions and, given that an application to acquire legal personality for a trade union is a unilateral petition to the public administration and does not involve any dispute between the parties, section  of the Labour Code is not applicable. If no appeal is considered, the administrative channel is deemed to be exhausted once the resolution rejecting the petition is adopted. Consequently, it would be for the complainant to initiate the appropriate judicial proceedings to challenge the supposed violation. The final paragraph of article  of the Constitution stipulates that public officials have no powers other than those expressly accorded to them by law; consequently, admitting an appeal not provided for under the terms of the relevant legislation would constitute a violation of that legislation. The Government finally gives its assurance that freedom of association is protected in El Salvador by the laws in force.
.In its communication of  April , the Government again urges the complainant to use existing legal mechanisms for obtaining redress.
.The Committee takes note of the Government s observations to the effect that that the Department of Labour and Social Security, in denying legal personality for SITRASEPRIES, was only adopting a constitutionally valid decision, given that article , paragraph , of the Constitution expressly  prohibits the existence of armed groups of a political, religious or professional nature'  it is clear that a trade union falls into the last of these categories, and the union in the present case is indeed a professional body formed by persons who use and possess firearms. The Committee notes that, according to the Government, the administrative decision can be challenged before the judicial authority. In this regard, the Committee reiterates that, in accordance with the principles of freedom of association, only the armed forces and the police can be excluded from the right to establish trade unions ' which is a fundamental right. Consequently, all other workers, including private security agents should freely be able to establish trade union organizations of their own choosing. Under these circumstances, the Committee emphasizes once again that the denial of legal personality for the trade union SITRASEPRIES is a serious violation of freedom of association, and urges the Government to recognize that legal personality without delay and keep it informed of developments. The Committee also requests the Government to inform it of any future judicial ruling on this matter.
.The Committee notes that the Government has not sent any information on the dismissal of the trade union official, Jos Alirio Prez Caenguez, and once again requests the Government to keep it informed of any new decision handed down concerning the charge of robbery brought against him. As regards the allegations regarding the company J.R.C. Manufacturing S.A. of C.V. company, the Committee notes that the questions still pending relate above all to the dismissal of the trade union official, Juana Ramirez, in February , the dismissal of  union officials in October , the dismissal of the union official, Jos Alirio Prez Caenguez, and the accusation of robbery made against him. The Committee notes the Government s statement to the effect that the company closed down its operations definitively in February , and adds that the dismissed workers agreed on a settlement regarding compensation. The Committee notes that the Government s communication does not indicate which workers are referred to. It also notes that the Government does not give any response regarding the accusation of robbery made against the trade union official, Jos Alirio Prez Caenguez. In this regard, the Committee requests the Government to ensure that the dismissed trade union officials receive the statutory compensation, and to communicate any judicial ruling handed down concerning the criminal charge brought against Jos Alirio Prez Caenguez.
.As regards the alleged death threats against five officials of the union STITAS by one of the owners of the J.R.C. Manufacturing S.A. of C.V. company, the Committee notes that the Government has not sent any observations and again requests it, as a matter of urgency, to take measures to ensure that the competent authorities carry out an inquiry into the matter and, if the allegations are shown to be true, to punish those responsible.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the National Trade Union Federation of Salvadorian Workers (FENASTRAS) dated  September . FENASTRAS sent further information and new allegations in communications dated  October and  November . The Government sent its observations in communications dated  October and  November  and  and  January .
.El Salvador has not ratified either the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  September , the National Trade Union Federation of Salvadorian Workers (FENASTRAS) states that in  trade union officers Mara del Rosario Hernndez, Marlene Jeannete Arguello Alfaro, Rutilia Rivera de Miranda, Sonia Guadalupe Rivera Argueta and Rosa Snchez Osegueda were dismissed by the J.R.C. Manufacturing S.A. of C.V. company. FENASTRAS asked for these trade union officials to be reinstated, and this took place on  February .
.On  February , FENASTRAS handed written statements from five trade union officials threatened with death by one of the owners of the company because of their position as trade union officials to the Ministry of Labour. In February , Juana Ramrez, a trade union official, was dismissed.
.FENASTRAS states that, on  August , the National Civil Police of El Salvador arrested the finance secretary of the trade union local office executive committee of the J.R.C. Manufacturing S.A. of C.V. company, Jos Alirio Prez Caenguez, and driver Gilberto Antonio Meja Barrios, accusing them of robbery. This accusation turned out to be false as on  August  the Ilopango Court of the Peace released them (provisionally put aside in the absence of sufficient evidence), finding no cause for arrest and thereby indicating that the accusations of the owner of the company in question were false. This trade union official was dismissed.
.In its communication of  October , FENASTRAS states that the Private Security Services Industry Workers' Trade Union of El Salvador (SITRASEPRIES), established on  April , was denied legal personality, which it had requested on  May . In August , Carlos Baltazar Martnez Quiteo, trade union official, and Orlando Flores Paz, acting president of the trade union were dismissed; both worked for the Security Consultants S.A. of C.V. company. The trade union requested compensation for dismissal, which was paid.
.In its communication of  November , FENASTRAS states that on  October  the entire executive committee of the local office ( members) was dismissed by the J.R.C. Manufacturing S.A. of C.V. company. FENASTRAS states that in",0,2003,El Salvador
160,"a mediation hearing it was agreed with the company that the wages of these employees would be paid ' Jos Alirio Prez Caenguez was also included in the agreement ' but the company refuses to allow these employees entry to the facilities, preventing them from being able to protect the interests of the other workers.
.In its communications of  October and  November  and  and  January , the Government states that, on  February , at a mediation hearing organized by the General Labour Directorate at the request of the STITAS trade union of the J.R.C. Manufacturing S.A. of C.V. company, the reinstatement of trade union officials Mara del Rosario Hernndez Perez, Marlene Jeannete Arguello Alfaro, Rutilia Rivera de Miranda, Sonia Guadalupe Rivera Argueta and Rosa Snchez Osegueda was offered as a conciliatory measure, from  February , which was accepted by the trade union.
.With regard to the death threats against the five trade union officials, the Government states that the Ministry of Labour does not have the authority to hear criminal cases.
.With regard to the alleged arrest by the National Civil Police of Jos Alirio Prez Caenguez, finance secretary of the trade union local office executive committee of the J.R.C. Manufacturing S.A. of C.V. company, and Gilberto Meja Barrios in August , both accused of robbery by the legal representative of the company, the relevant competent courts have been handling this situation as the Ministry of Labour and Social Security is excluded from acting in this respect, given that this is a criminal situation rather than a labour one. The Government indicates that it will send the company s observations once it receives them.
.With regard to the alleged refusal of legal personality for the Private Security Services Industry Workers' Trade Union of El Salvador (SITRASEPRIES), which is being established, the Government puts forward the legal arguments set out in the decision of  June , which stated that the request for the recognition of legal personality for SITRASEPRIES was without cause for the following reasons:' Article  of the Constitution of the Republic, paragraph , expressly  prohibits the existence of political, religious or trade union armed groups'  A trade union falls into this category and, in the present case, a trade union formed of persons possessing and using firearms, falls squarely under the abovementioned constitutional prohibition.' The nature of the work carried out by a security agent, i.e. to provide security and surveillance in those areas indicated to him by his employer, means that these employees are trusted, and that this trust is a basic requirement in the existence and continuation of the employment relationship between the agent and his employer.' Despite the above, the law recognizes the possibility of a trusted employee joining a trade union organization so long as the general assembly of the trade union that he wishes to join accepts him as a member, article , section (a), of the Labour Code. This necessarily implies the prior existence of a trade union organization that is not made up of trusted employees and that has been granted legal personality.' From the above, it can be concluded that trusted employees, as in the present case, lack the legal right to participate as constituent members of a trade union organization as there is still no government body enabled by law to accept them as members. It is therefore not logical to think that trusted employees who try to establish a trade union will themselves be accepted as members.' Consequently, the fact that trusted employees are not able to participate as members of a trade union means that the security agents that have taken part in establishing the trade union in question are not legally empowered for this.
.The reasons that caused the Ministry of Labour and Social Security to decide that the request for legal personality for the trade union in the process of being established was without cause are founded in law. It is up to the complainant to initiate the legal and administrative actions that it considers relevant for the protection of those trade union rights that have allegedly been violated.
.Likewise, the request by the complainant for a decision to revoke the denial of legal personality for the trade union and that the latter be granted legal personality immediately is currently being examined, as the granting of legal personality to the trade union being established would contravene the Constitution of the Republic, which, as already shown in article , paragraph , expressly  prohibits the existence of political, religious or trade union armed groups' 
.With regard to the alleged dismissal of  officials from the trade union organization STITAS on  October , the Government states that at the request of the trade union, the General Labour Directorate held a mediation hearing with the result that the company informed the  trade union officials dismissed that it was instructed to pay out, in the offices of the General Labour Directorate, those wages that were not paid on the employer s instructions. The trade union representatives agreed that the wages that were not paid on the employer s instructions should be paid and that this should take place at the offices of the Ministry.
.The Committee notes that the complainant organization, in the present case, has alleged successive dismissals of trade union officials by the J.R.C. Manufacturing S.A. of C.V. company; death threats against five trade union officials; the arrest and prosecution of a trade union official and another worker for alleged robbery; and the denial of legal personality to a trade union made up of private security agents and the dismissal of two of its officials.
.With regard to the alleged dismissal of the five trade union officials in , the Committee notes the Government s statement that these officials were reinstated on  February . The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the reasons for the dismissal of trade union official Juana Ramrez in February .
.With regard to the death threats against five trade union officials at the J.R.C. Manufacturing S.A. of C.V. company by one of the owners, the Committee regrets that the Government has restricted itself to indicating that the Ministry of Labour is not competent to hear criminal cases. The Committee recalls that freedom of association can only be exercised as conditions in which fundamental human rights, and in particular those relating to human life and personal safety, are fully respected and guaranteed [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. ]. The Committee emphasizes that, as indicated in the complaint, the threats were supported by written statements and it requests the Government to take steps urgently to ensure that the competent authorities carry out an investigation and, if the allegations are confirmed, to punish the guilty parties so that adequate protection is guaranteed to these officials.
.With regard to the alleged arrest and prosecution of trade union official Jos Alirio Prez Caenguez for alleged robbery, the Committee notes the Government s statement that this issue has been put before the courts and that it has asked the company to provide observations in this respect. The Committee notes that in the attached information sent by the complainant organization there is a legal decision that infers that the official in question has not been held and that the legal authorities have declared dismissal without prejudice of the case pending new elements and/or evidence. In these circumstances, the Committee considers that these trade union officials should be reinstated in their posts without loss of pay and be authorized to exercise their trade union activities. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any new legal decision handed down on this matter.
.With regard to the alleged denial of legal personality for the private security agents' trade union SITRASEPRIES, the Committee notes that the Government confirms the refusal of legal personality and indicates that it is examining the request by the complainant that this decision upholding refusal be revoked. The Committee notes the arguments put forward by the Government that, in its opinion, the granting of this legal personality would be illegal (the Constitution of the Republic ' article  ' prohibits the existence of armed groups, these are trusted employees and they may only join a trade union that has been established with workers of another kind who will accept them as members). The Committee notes in this respect that this constitutional provision should not prevent workers from carrying arms when this is necessary because of the nature of their work.
.In this respect, the Committee recalls that, in accordance with the principles of freedom of association only the armed forces and the police can be excluded from the right to establish trade unions ' which is a fundamental right. Consequently, all other workers, including private security agents should freely be able to establish trade union organizations of their own choosing. In these circumstances, the Committee believes that the denial of legal personality",0,2003,El Salvador
161,"for the SITRASEPRIES trade union is a serious violation of freedom of association and it urges the Government to recognize this trade union and to keep it informed in this regard. The Committee observes that the Security Consultants S.A. of C.V. company has dismissed two SITRASEPRIES officials, although it notes that, according to the documents attached by the complainant, the employees concerned ended up accepting legal compensation.
.With regard to the dismissal of  trade union officials of STITAS by the J.R.C. Manufacturing S.A. of C.V. company, the Committee notes the Government s statement that, in a mediation hearing organized by the General Labour Directorate, the company accepted to pay the unpaid wages. The Committee regrets that the Government has provided no information on the specific facts that led to these dismissals; neither has it said whether these trade union officials ' who, according to the allegations, are prevented from entering the company ' remain dismissed and it requests that the Government send it this information without delay. The Committee recalls the principle according to which no person should be dismissed or prejudiced in his or her employment by reason of trade union membership or legitimate trade union activities, and it is important to forbid and penalize in practice all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of employment [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, , para. ]. The Committee requests the Government, if it is proven that any of these officials was dismissed by reason of his trade union activities, to ensure his reinstatement in the post without loss of pay.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to take steps urgently to ensure that the competent authorities carry out an investigation into the alleged death threats against five trade union officials from STITAS by one of the owners of the J.R.C. Manufacturing S.A. of C.V. company, and if the alleged facts are confirmed, to punish those responsible and to guarantee adequate protection to these officials.(b) The Committee considers that the trade union official, Jos Alirio Prez Caenguez, should be reinstated in his post without loss of pay and be authorized to exercise his trade union activities. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any new legal ruling handed down relating to the accusation of alleged robbery against this trade union officer, which, to date has been provisionally put aside in the absence of sufficient evidence.(c) The Committee believes that the denial of legal personality for the SITRASEPRIES trade union is a violation of freedom of association and urges the Government to recognize this trade union and to keep it informed in this respect.(d) The Committee requests the Government to provide without delay information on the specific facts that led to the dismissal of  trade union officials from the J.R.C. Manufacturing S.A. of C.V. company in October  and to indicate whether these trade union members remain dismissed. The Committee also requests the Government to indicate the reasons for the dismissal of trade union official Juana Ramrez in February , and if it is proven that any of these officials have been dismissed by reason of their trade union activities, to ensure that they are reinstated in their posts without loss of pay.",0,2003,El Salvador

The Committee also calls on the complainant organizations to provide the information requested by the Office of the Attorney-General of the Republic concerning the alleged eviction of the trade union from its premises.
.In its communication of  June , the Government states that it is awaiting the ruling by the Administrative Disputes Court on the question of the coalition of the STISSS and SIMETRISSS trade unions with regard to reviewing the arbitration award.
.The Committee takes note of this information, and reiterates its previous recommendations to the Government and the complainant organizations.
.At its session in March  the Committee was still awaiting: () the ruling of the judicial authority on the refusal by the Salvadoran Social Security Institute (ISSS) to accept the coalition of the STISSS and SIMETRISSS trade unions with regard to reviewing the arbitration award; and () the decision of the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic concerning the alleged eviction of the trade union from its premises [see th Report, para. ].
.In a communication dated  July , the Government states that the judicial authority has not yet handed down its ruling on the refusal of the ISSS to accept the coalition of the STISSS and SIMETRISSS trade unions with regard to reviewing the arbitration award. With regard to the decision of the Office of the Attorney General concerning the alleged eviction of the trade union from its premises, the Government states that the Office of the Attorney General has informed it that it has no record of any such complaint currently under investigation and therefore requests the complainant to supply the exact date, time and place of the incident and, if possible, the name of the authority or police unit responsible for the eviction, so that it can take a decision on the subject.
.The Committee continues to await the ruling on the refusal by the ISSS to accept the coalition of the STISS and SIMETRISSS trade unions with regard to reviewing the arbitration award, trusts that a ruling will be handed down in the near future and, bearing in mind that considerable time has elapsed since the proceedings were initiated, recalls that justice delayed is justice denied. The Committee also calls on the complainant organizations to provide the information requested by the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic concerning the alleged eviction of the trade union from its premises.
.At its March  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendations [see th Report, para. ]:The Committee requests the Government: (i) to keep it informed of any court decision regarding the refusal of the ISSS to recognize the coalition of the STISSS and SIMETRISSS for the purpose of reviewing the arbitration award; any decision by the Attorney-General s office concerning the alleged eviction of the union from its premises; and (ii) to carry out an independent investigation into the alleged conversion of permanent contracts to short-term contracts to the detriment of trade union members, and to keep it informed of developments in this respect.
.In its communication of  August , the Government states that the outcome of the administrative proceedings initiated by the coalition of the Trade Union of Workers of the Salvadoran Social Security Institute (STISSS) and the Union of Doctors and Workers of the Salvadoran Social Security Institute (SIMETRISSS) against the decision of the General Labour Director not to allow the review of the arbitration award is still pending, awaiting the decision of the Division of Administrative Law of the Supreme Court of Justice. The Committee will be informed of the outcome of the proceedings once the Division has handed down its ruling. With regard to the decision of the Office of the Attorney-General of the Republic regarding the allegation concerning the eviction of STISSS from its premises, the Government will request that the Office of the Attorney-General of the Republic provide it with a report which will be communicated to the Committee. As to the alleged change of permanent contracts to short-term temporary contracts to the detriment of the members of the trade union, the Government explains that, in the wake of the  strike which involved the STISSS and SIMETRISSS trade unions, the Salvadoran Social Security Institute authorities (ISSS) and the two abovementioned trade unions concluded an  agreement for the resolution of the health conflict and the beginning of the comprehensive reform process'  which set out, among other things, the ISSS' obligation to reinstate all those workers who had participated in the abovementioned strike in their posts under the same conditions. Once the agreement was signed, the ISSS was unable to fully comply with its obligations, given that the posts of the workers concerned had already been filled by other workers and doctors. This meant that the workers could only be reinstated through the conclusion of individual employment contracts for an indefinite period. Furthermore, in order to settle payment of the wages of workers and doctors not drawn during the strike, the agreement contained a reference to the existence of a parallel short-term contract (three months) for provision of services during periods additional to those covered by the contract for an indefinite period. This provision has now disappeared, along with Clause  of the arbitration award which served as a foundation for a collective agreement, registered with the General Labour Directorate on  May of this year, establishing that any person contracted by the ISSS is held to be a public employee, without guaranteed job security being adversely affected.
.The Committee notes this information. The Committee awaits: () the ruling of the judicial authority on the refusal by the ISSS to accept the coalition of the STISSS and SIMETRISSS trade unions with regard to reviewing the arbitration award; and () the decision of the Office of the Attorney-General of the Republic concerning the alleged eviction of the trade union from its premises.
.The Committee last examined this case at its meeting in June , and on that occasion presented an interim report [see th Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session in June ]. The Government sent new observations in a communication dated  October .
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.At its meeting in June , the Committee made the following recommendations on the allegations that remained pending [see th Report, para. ]:(a) With regard to the dismissal of the  people listed by name in the allegations, the Committee requests the Government to indicate whether the  workers to whom it referred have taken legal action and, if so, that it inform the Committee of the respective decisions. The Committee requests the Government to provide information on the dismissal of the other workers. The Committee repeats its request to the complainant organization that it indicate the extent to which these dismissals were related to the exercise of trade union rights and whether those dismissed were trade union members.(b) The Committee notes that neither the complainant organization nor the Government has sent the information requested by the Committee in its previous recommendations, which it reiterates here:' The Committee requests the Government to send information without delay on the alleged transfer or prevention from applying for a job that affected Dr. Teresa de Jess Sosa and Dr. Daro Snchez, both members of the SIMETRISSS, and regarding the alleged modification of permanent contracts to short-term contracts affecting members of the trade union.' With regard to the allegations relating to illegal deductions from wages affecting  persons (some of them trade union members), the Committee requests the Government and the complainant to indicate the name of the workers who were not present at the workplace (ISSS) on  September , as well as the legislation to which the Government refers.' With regard to the alleged search of people and vehicles belonging to trade union members of SIMETRISSS and the hiring of private armed guards, the Committee requests the Government and the complainant to provide further information on these allegations.(c) With regard to the alleged dismissal of  trade union members, the Committee expects that, if the criminal charges laid against these workers are rejected, the workers concerned will be reinstated in their posts without loss of wages.(d) With regard to the refusal to recognize the STISSS/SIMETRISSS coalition in the revision of the arbitration award, the Committee notes that the issue is currently before the Division of Administrative Law of the Supreme Court of",0,2002,El Salvador
163,"Justice and requests the Government to send it a copy of the decision when this is handed down. However, the Committee points out that legislation should not prevent two trade unions from negotiating jointly if they so wish, including in cases of revision of a collective agreement when one of them is less representative.(e) With regard to the allegation of eviction of the trade union from its premises, the Committee requests the Government to take all possible steps to ensure that the decision of the Attorney-General s office of the Republic is not delayed, and that it send the Committee a copy of all decisions taken in this respect.
.In its communication of  October , the Government states that none of the terminations of the contracts of  workers at the Salvadoran Social Security Institute (ISSS) has any connection with the exercise of trade union rights. The Government adds that the  persons in question presented formal applications to the courts, in most cases demanding the payment of compensation or arrears of wages. The results of these were as follows:' three workers were awarded compensation for wrongful dismissal, another was awarded payment of wage arrears, and a ruling was given in favour of two workers on the grounds that their constitutional rights had been violated;' an application (compensation for wrongful dismissal) is currently being considered by the courts, as well as another application regarding payment of wage arrears; in another case, the appeals court quashed the ruling that had been made in favour of the ISSS;' a ruling in favour of the ISSS was handed down in one case concerning an application for compensation for wrongful dismissal, and in eight cases concerning demands for arrears of wages.
.As regards the alleged transfer or attempts to prevent workers from applying for posts, which concerned Dr. Teresa de Jess Sosa and Dr. Daro Snchez (who, according to the complainant, were members of SIMETRISSS), the Government states that it is not clear that Dr. Sosa was a member of the union, and that in any event she had as far back as January  resigned from her post at the ISSS. The Government adds that the ISSS does not know which post Dr. Daro Snchez wished to apply for, but points out in any case that under the terms of the arbitration award, the selection process is in the hands of a board comprising representatives of the ISSS and the trade union, and all workers can apply for new or vacant positions.
.As regards the illegal wage deductions affecting  people (including trade unionists), the Government does not know the names of the people involved; it points out that, under the terms of the Labour Code and the arbitration award currently in force, a worker is required to justify absences and that if absences were not paid, it was because there was no good reason for them.
.As regards the searches of SIMETRISSS members and their vehicles and the hiring of armed guards supposedly to curtail trade union rights, the Government indicates that there have frequently been criminal acts in various ISSS centres, including the Medical Surgical Hospital and the Specialized Treatment Hospital, where there have in the past been cases of theft or removal of various drugs that are difficult for individuals to obtain from pharmacies without a prescription, as well as of medical equipment that is difficult and expensive for the ISSS to buy on the national market. For this reason, senior management decided from  onwards to order searches of all vehicles leaving ISSS premises, including vehicles driven by visitors and other authorized persons. This was a response to the need to ensure the safety of ISSS workers, as well as visitors and authorized persons, and to protect the Institute s property.
.As regards the recruitment of armed guards, the Government states that the ISSS, from  onwards, has hired the Compaa Salvadorea de Seguridad S.A. de C.V. (COSASE) and the Servicios Conjuntos de Seguridad S.A. de C.V. (SERCONSE), both of which have been legally constituted in El Salvador and provide security services to various public and private institutions. Hiring of private security services is permitted under the terms of section (h) of the Act respecting the Salvadoran Social Security Institute, and the selection process complied with the Act on procurement and hiring in the public service. At no time were these initiatives intended to curtail trade union freedoms.
.As regards the dismissal of  members of the STISSS, the Government states that these were due to criminal acts committed by the workers concerned against the Institute s property and staff. Despite this, in June , the new management of the ISSS initiated a process of dialogue and consultation to clarify and resolve any disputes. Evidence of this is the establishment of a STISSS-ISSS subcommittee to review all the recent dismissals independently of any pending court decisions. As a result of this initiative, following an exhaustive review process, an agreement was reached with the STISSS to reinstate a group of  workers who had been dismissed for different reasons from  onwards, including the  STISSS members named in this complaint. Currently, the  workers concerned are working for the Institute under the same conditions before their dismissals.
.As regards the refusal to recognize the coalition of STISSS and SIMETRISSS for the purpose of reviewing the arbitration award, the Government states that the Division of Administrative Law of the Supreme Court of Justice has not handed down a ruling on the matter.
.With regard to the allegation concerning eviction of the union from the premises it occupies, the Government states that the Attorney-General s office has not yet taken a decision on the matter.
.The Committee notes that the pending allegations in this case concern the following issues: dismissal of  workers and  trade union members employed by the Salvadoran Social Security Institute (ISSS); illegal wage deductions affecting  persons (including trade unionists); transfer of or measures to prevent two workers from applying for posts, in contravention of the arbitration award in force; searches of trade union members and their vehicles; arbitrary refusal to recognize the coalition of the trade union organizations STISSS and SIMETRISSS for the purpose of negotiating a review of the collective agreement; and violent and arbitrary eviction of the union from its premises by the Institute.
.As regards the allegations of dismissal, the Committee notes with satisfaction the Government s statement to the effect that the  members of the STISSS who had been dismissed have been reinstated in their posts, together with  other workers. The Government notes also that, with regard to the other  dismissed workers, the courts ruled in favour of six of the workers, and in favour of the ISSS in nine cases, that proceedings concerning two workers have not been concluded, and that the application in another case was rejected. The Committee notes the Government s statements to the effect that none of the  cases was connected with the exercise of trade union rights, and that in the judicial proceedings the workers sought only compensation or payment of wage arrears.
.The Committee also notes that, according to the Government, Dr. Teresa de Jess Sosa (who, according to the complainant, had been transferred) resigned from her post at the ISSS in January , and it is not clear that she was a trade union member. As to the Government s statements regarding the allegation that Dr. Daro Snchez, a member of the union, had been prevented from applying for a post, the Committee notes that the complainant has not indicated which post was involved, and that new or vacant posts in the ISSS are filled by a board comprising representatives of the ISSS and the trade union.
.As regards the alleged illegal wage deductions affecting  workers (including trade union members), the Committee regrets that the complainant has not provided any of the information requested, in particular the names of the workers concerned. It notes the Government s statements that it does not have the names of these individuals, and that according to the Labour Code and the arbitration award in force, workers are required to justify their absences, and that if a worker was not paid the wages due, it was because of insufficient reasons for the absence from work.
.The Committee also notes the Government s statements regarding the searches of vehicles and the hiring of private armed guards, in which it emphasizes that these measures are legal and intended to ensure security and prevent thefts of expensive medical equipment or other property belonging to the Institute. The Committee regrets that the complainants have not yet provided the information which it had requested on these matters, and indicates that it will not continue with the examination of these issues if the requested information has not been sent by its next meeting.
.Lastly, the Committee requests the Government:(i) to keep it informed of:' any court decision regarding the refusal of the ISSS to recognize the coalition of the STISSS and SIMETRISSS",0,2002,El Salvador
164,"for the purpose of reviewing the arbitration award;' any decision by the Attorney-General s office concerning the alleged eviction of the union from its premises; and(ii) to carry out an independent investigation into the alleged conversion of permanent contracts to short-term contracts to the detriment of trade union members, and to keep it informed of developments in this respect.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee requests the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government:(i) to keep it informed of:' any court decision regarding the refusal of the ISSS to recognize the coalition of the STISSS and SIMETRISSS for the purpose of reviewing the arbitration award;' any decision by the Attorney-General s office concerning the alleged eviction of the union from its premises; and(ii) to carry out an independent investigation into the alleged conversion of permanent contracts to short-term contracts to the detriment of trade union members, and to keep it informed of developments in this respect.(b) The Committee indicates to the complainant organizations that it will not continue with the examination of the issues relative to the alleged search of SIMETRISSS trade unionists and vehicles if the requested information has not been sent by its next meeting.
.The Committee last examined this complaint at its June  meeting and on that occasion it submitted an interim report [see st Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (June )]. The Trade Union of Workers of the Salvadoran Social Security Institute (STISSS) sent new allegations in a communication dated  November . The Government sent its observations in communications dated  and  January and  March .
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its previous examination of the case at its June  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendations [see st Report, para. ]:- The Committee requests the Government and the complainant to provide concrete details regarding the reasons for the dismissal of the  people listed by name in the allegations, and to indicate the extent to which these dismissals were related to the exercise of trade union rights and whether those dismissed were trade union members.- The Committee requests the Government to send information without delay on the alleged transfer or prevention from applying for a job that affected Dr. Teresa de Jess Sosa and Dr. Daro Snchez, both members of the Union of Doctors and Workers of the Salvadoran Social Security Institute (SIMETRISSS), and regarding the alleged modification of permanent contracts to short-term contracts affecting members of the trade union.- With regard to the allegations relating to illegal deductions from wages affecting  persons (some of them trade union members), the Committee requests the Government and the complainant to indicate the name of the workers who were not present at the workplace (ISSS) on  September , as well as the legislation to which the Government refers.- With regard to the alleged search of people and vehicles belonging to trade union members of SIMETRISSS and the hiring of private armed guards, the Committee requests the Government and the complainant to provide further information on these allegations.
.In its communication of  November , the Trade Union of Workers of the Salvadoran Social Security Institute (STISSS) alleges that the strike that was declared jointly with the Union of Doctors and Workers of the Salvadoran Social Security Institute (SIMETRISSS) on  September  and extended to  June , and carried out to oppose the privatization process of the health and support services, led to many reprisals on the part of the authorities of the Institute. Specifically, the STISSS alleges that dialogue was closed down,  workers (among them trade union members, representatives and officials) were dismissed, labour centres were militarized and consequently access was prohibited to trade union representatives and some trade union members; the wages, bonus payments, holidays and other benefits were selectively and in a discriminatory manner withheld from more than  workers who supported the strike outside working hours and from the current executive committee, and the arrest of workers belonging to trade unions; trade union representatives guaranteed not to be removed from their posts according to clauses  and  of the current arbitration award were dismissed; the Institute administration coerced workers to withdraw their membership from the trade union; trade union representatives and officials were prevented from carrying out their duties; the Ministry of Labour deliberately delayed the revision process of the collective agreement and arbitrarily refused to recognize the coalition of the complainant organization and SIMETRISSS to negotiate the revision of the collective agreement; the Institute authorities ordered the eviction of the trade union premises, even before the strike, violently and arbitrarily. With regard to the eviction, the complainant organization states that it has lodged a complaint with the Attorney-General s Office of the Republic, which has, at the time of sending this complaint, not yet handed down a decision in this respect.
.In particular, the complainant organization alleges the dismissal of trade union representatives and an official of the acting General Board of Directors by the Institute authorities from  September , i.e. two months and a half after the end of the strike, added to the  dismissals that took place during the strike.
.The Government makes the following reply with regard to the specific facts motivating the alleged dismissal of  people mentioned by name in the allegations in its communications of  and  January :(a) Dr. Juan Bautista Caballero: the due internal institutional process with the right to a hearing attended by the defendant having run its course, it was decided that the conduct of the doctor fell into the category laid down in articles () and () of the Labour Code, for having changed the timing of his annual vacation without authorization, from - September  to - August , and also for failing to come to work with no explanation on  July,  and  August , it was finally established that he failed to come to work with no explanation for the period from  July to  August .(b) Dr. Lilia Beatriz Crdova de Caballero: the due internal institutional process with the right to a hearing attended by the defendant having run its course, it was decided that the conduct of the doctor fell into the category laid down in articles () and () of the Labour Code, for having changed the timing of her annual vacation without authorization, from - September  to - August , and also for failing to come to work with no explanation on  and  August , it was finally established that she failed to come to work with no explanation for the period from  to  August .(c) Dr. Anbal Avelar Medrano: the due internal institutional process with the right to a hearing attended by the defendant having run its course, it was decided that the conduct of the doctor fell into the category laid down in article () and () of the Labour Code, relating to article () and () of the Labour Code and clause (a) and (b) of the arbitration award signed between the Institute and the STISSS, for having committed serious errors at the labour centre, consisting of verbally attacking the patient Jos Orlando Rivera Saavedra in the parking area of the Zacamil Medical Unit.(d) Bernardo Escobar Gmez: the due internal institutional process with the right to a hearing attended by the defendant having run its course, it was decided that he had committed the error of pushing private security agent Ren Renderos Caballero who, as a result, broke the glass in a door without sustaining any physical injury, thereby not complying in his behaviour with the obligations laid down in clause (a) and (b) of the arbitration award signed between the Institute and the STISSS and article () of the Labour Code, his behaviour falling into the category laid down in article (), () and () of the Labour Code.(e) Jos Alberto Elas Torres and Camila Leticia Vaquerano: the due internal institutional process with the right to a hearing attended by the defendants having run its course, it was established that the actions of these two people in the workplace were in violation of the obligations laid down in clauses , ,  and (a) and (c) of the arbitration award signed between the Institute and the STISSS and article (), (), (), () and () of the Labour Code, and falling into the category laid down in article (), (), (), (), () and () of the Labour Code for having acted aggressively and in an intimidating manner and for verbally attacking the medical director of the Maternity and Child Hospital on  May.

this act is expressly prohibited in article  of the Public Administration Procurement and Contracting Act (LACAP), for which reason, in accordance with the provisions of articles  and  of the abovementioned Act, it was established that Nora Edith Martnez de Colocho was guilty of the violation and her contract was terminated.(j) Jaime Francisco Murillo Reyes: violation of clauses ,  and  of the arbitration award in force, by prohibiting access to the Ilopango Medical Unit Pharmacy of the Institute and by illegally ordering the doors of this institution to be closed, refusing access to the Institute authorities, when the members of the STISSS carried out stop?work action in this health-care centre, which took place on - September , his behaviour invoking, the application of article (), () and () of the Labour Code.(k) Ricardo Marvin Rodriguez Claros: violation of clauses ,  and  of the arbitration award in force, by prohibiting access to the Ilopango Medical Unit Pharmacy of the Institute and by illegally ordering the doors of this institution to be closed, refusing access to the Institute authorities, when the members of the STISSS carried out stop?work action in this health-care centre, which took place on - September , his behaviour invoking the application of article (), () and () of the Labour Code.(l) Delvia Elizabeth Antonio Beltrn: violation of clauses ,  and  of the arbitration award in force, by prohibiting access to the Ilopango Medical Unit Pharmacy of the Institute and by illegally ordering the doors of this institution to be closed, refusing access to the Institute authorities, when the members of the STISSS carried out stop?work action in this health-care centre, which took place on - September , her behaviour invoking the application of article (), () and () of the Labour Code.(m) Richard Edgardo Castro Escalante: violation of clauses ,  and  of the arbitration award in force, by prohibiting access to the Ilopango Medical Unit Pharmacy of the Institute and by illegally ordering the doors of this institution to be closed, refusing access to the Institute authorities, when the members of the STISSS carried out stop?work action in this health-care centre, which took place on - September , his behaviour invoking the application of article (), () and () of the Labour Code.(n) Angel Gabriel Aguilar Guerrero: violation of clauses ,  and  of the arbitration award in force, by prohibiting access to the Ilopango Medical Unit Pharmacy of the Institute and by illegally ordering the doors of this institution to be closed, refusing access to the Institute authorities, when the members of the STISSS carried out stop?work action in this health-care centre, which occurred on - September , his behaviour invoking the application of article (), () and () of the Labour Code.(o) Silvia Canales de Alfaro: violation of clauses ,  and  of the arbitration award in force, by prohibiting access to the Ilopango Medical Unit Pharmacy of the Institute and by illegally ordering the doors to the institution to be closed, refusing access to the Institute authorities, when the members of the STISSS carried out stop?work action in the health-care centre, which occurred on - September , her behaviour involving the application of article (), () and () of the Labour Code.(p) Juan Francisco Figueroa: non-compliance with clauses  and (c) of the arbitration award in force and article () of the Labour Code, for lack of respect for the head of the Transport Section of the Institute and for disobeying instructions relating to his duties, which occurred on  July , his behaviour invoking the application of article (), () and () of the Labour Code.
.In conclusion, the Government confirms that the termination of these individual employment contracts was the result of violations by these employees in fulfilling their duties in accordance with labour legislation, which gives the employer the right to terminate their employment contracts with no liability.
.In its communication of  March , with regard to the alleged militarization of labour centres, the Government categorically denies that there has been any military intervention at the facilities of the Salvadoran Social Security Institute and indicates that the intervention of public security agents took place only as a result of the violent behaviour on the part of those on strike in order to provide protection to the health-care centres mentioned to protect the physical safety of the people and assets of the institutions. This took place because the workers on strike prevented employees and rightful owners of the various health-care centres of the Institute from having access and upset the ordering and provision of services, which, moreover, prompted the lodging of a series of complaints before the competent courts. The judges hearing the complaints handed down, in many cases, decisions condemning those workers who were the instigators, which, according to the Government, clearly refutes the complainant organization s statements that all the decisions were favourable to them. The behaviour of the trade union members distorted the fundamental aim of the strike, which was the revision of the collective labour agreement, the current arbitration award in force.
.With regard to the alleged withholding of wages, bonus payments, holidays and other benefits laid down in the collective labour agreement, the arbitration award currently in force, selectively and in a discriminatory manner, the Government denies that any such situation has occurred. It confirms, on the other hand, that, owing to the declaration by the judicial authorities of the illegal nature of the strike promoted by the complainant organization, the workers should have been carrying out their duties. As they did not do so, the Institute was not obliged to pay wages and benefits as the workers had not fulfilled their labour obligations. The failure of the striking workers to provide services was noted through the dates obtained by internal control mechanisms, such as the reports of the biometric marking system and reports provided by the directors of the various health-care centres that were affected. The workers participating in the strike, however, lodged a total of  complaints against the Institute for the wages owing, holidays, bonus payments and certification for personal merit assessment; these claims have largely been dropped by the workers and other claims have been declared unfavourable to the interests of the workers participating in the strike.
.With regard to the alleged dismissal of trade union members by the Institute authorities from  September , the Government states that on  June  an ""agreement for the resolution of the health conflict and the beginning of the comprehensive reform process"" was signed between the trade union and the Institute; subsection IV of this agreement laid down provisions relating to the reinstatement of administrative workers and the establishment of the Special Tripartite Commission made up of the Institute, the complainant organization and conflict mediators. This Commission was to view the files of all the workers who were the subject of charges before the Attorney-General s Office of the Republic, and at the end of these sessions, the Commission, in",0,2002,El Salvador
166,"Minute , declared itself unable to issue an opinion on the cases of  workers as these were pending criminal charges, a situation that included the secretary of the STISSS, Ricardo Monge Melndez. In accordance with the authority conferred by the agreement, the Institute proceeded in good faith to review the files of the  workers who had not been reinstated and decided to reinstate three of them in their posts; in the remaining cases the Institute authorities acted in accordance with the provisions laid down in the labour legislation in force, the arbitration award, and the agreement for the resolution of the health conflict and the beginning of the comprehensive reform process of the sector.
.With regard to the alleged deliberate delay by the Secretariat of Labour and Social Security in the revision of the collective labour agreement, the arbitration award, the Government emphasizes that at no time was there any delay and that the General Labour Directorate has carried out its work strictly within the law. With regard to this, the Government confirms that the request for revision was submitted jointly by the STISSS and the SIMETRISSS. The General Labour Directorate requested the general secretaries of both trade unions to prove their legal capacity to act for the institution that they were representing and that the SIMETRISSS prove its legal capacity to act with regard to the arbitration award. While the STISSS proved the legal capacity of the general secretary and its legal capacity to act with regard to the arbitration award, the SIMETRISSS did not prove its legal capacity to act with regard to the arbitration award. The General Labour Directorate, faced with this situation, on  April , decided to allow the revision of the arbitration award to proceed, accepting only the STISSS as a partner as it had demonstrated that it had legal capacity to act in this regard, in accordance with the registers to such effect held by the National Department of Social Organizations.
.The Government indicates that, with regard to the legal reasons for refusing to accept the STISSS/SIMETRISSS coalition in the revision of the arbitration award: (a) the arbitration award announced in the collective conflict between the STISSS and the Institute shows that the institution with legal capacity to act with regard to this award, and, consequently, the only institution able to request revision of it is the STISSS; (b) legislation (article () of the Code) envisages the possibility of the trade union coalition only in those cases where a single trade union does not have the percentage necessary to sign a collective agreement but not in the case of revision; (c) article  of the Code provides that the arbitration award is valid for three years; however, as it has the nature of a collective labour agreement, the same rules that govern collective agreements are applied. In this regard, article  provides that the effects of a collective agreement that is being revised are extended for the duration of the negotiations. Given that the end of the validity period is not one of the reasons to end the collective labour agreement, in accordance with articles  and  of the Code, it is impossible that the agreement be ended owing to the end of the validity period, and, as a result, it cannot be considered that the claim made by the STISSS/SIMETRISSS coalition refers to a new agreement; (d) the resolution that was announced declaring that the trade union coalition was refused has been disputed by the SIMETRISSS in the Division of Administrative Law of the Supreme Court of Justice.
.With regard to the alleged eviction of the trade union from its headquarters by the Institute authorities, the Government quotes clause  of the arbitration award in force entitled ""Premises for the trade union"", in which it is laid down that during the period of validity of the agreement in force, the Institute undertakes to build or to provide ... premises for the trade union in which the latter may carry out its normal administrative activities ... in as far as it does not comply with the provisions of this clause, the Institute undertakes to supply the trade union with premises or facilities so that it may carry out its activities. If not, the Institute undertakes to pay a reasonable amount to rent premises appropriate for carrying out such activities. According to the Government, the Institute s compliance with the previously quoted clause was confirmed by the relevant rental agreements in which the Institute rented a property to be used by the STISSS for carrying out its normal administrative activities. The Government confirms that it has been proven that the actions denounced as alleged violations of the right of association are without foundation, as the conduct of both the Institute and the Labour Secretariat have been in accordance with El Salvadoran Legislation.
.The Committee recalls that in the present case the complainant organization had alleged that the permanent contracts of members of SIMETRISSS were changed to temporary contracts of three months' duration, private armed guards were hired to discourage any protest attempts at the Salvadoran Social Security Institute (ISSS), illegal wage deductions were made for  people (some of them trade union members),  people were dismissed, two trade union members were transferred or prevented from applying for a job in violation of the arbitration award in force, and people and vehicles belonging to trade union members were searched at the Medical Surgical Hospital and the Specialized Treatment Hospital, including two trade union officials who are under surveillance and who have been deprived of freedom of movement. Moreover, the Committee notes that the new allegations presented by the Trade Union of Workers of the Salvadoran Social Security Institute (STISSS) refer to a number of reprisals because of a strike, including the closing down of dialogue, the dismissal of  workers (among them trade union members, representatives and officials), the militarization of labour centres and the prohibition of access to trade union representatives and some trade union members; the withholding of wages and other benefits from workers who supported the strike outside working hours, the arrest of trade union workers; the dismissal of trade union representatives who enjoy protection from being removed from their posts; coercion by the Institute administration of workers to withdraw their membership from the trade union; obstacles to trade union officials and representatives carrying out their duties; the deliberate delay by the Ministry of Labour in the revision process of the collective agreement and the arbitrary refusal to recognize the coalition of the STISSS and the SIMETRISSS to negotiate the revision of the collective agreement; eviction from the trade union premises by order of the Institute authorities violently and arbitrarily.
.With regard to the first recommendation made during the previous examination of the case relating to the provision of the concrete details regarding the reasons for the dismissal of the  people listed by name in the allegations, the Committee notes the Government s information provided on  workers affected and that the dismissals were as a result of violations in carrying out their work that, in accordance with labour legislation, give the employer the right to terminate the employment contract without liability. The Committee requests the Government to indicate whether those workers have taken legal action and, if so, that it inform the Committee of the respective decisions and provide information on the dismissal of the two other workers. The Committee repeats its request to the complainant organization that it indicate the extent to which these dismissals were related to the exercise of trade union rights and whether those dismissed were trade union members.
.The Committee also notes that neither the complainant organization nor the Government has sent the information requested in its recommendations during the previous examination of the case and it therefore repeats these:- The Committee requests the Government to send information without delay on the alleged transfer or prevention from applying for a job that affected Dr. Teresa de Jess Sosa and Dr. Daro Snchez, both members of the SIMETRISSS, and regarding the alleged modification of permanent contracts to short-term contracts affecting members of the trade union.- With regard to the allegations relating to the illegal deduction from wages affecting  persons (some of them trade union members), the Committee requests the Government and the complainant to indicate the name of the workers who were not present at the workplace (ISSS) on  September , as well as the legislation to which the Government refers.- With regard to the alleged search of people and vehicles belonging to trade union members of SIMETRISSS and the hiring of private armed guards, the Committee requests the Government and the complainant to provide further information on these allegations.
.With regard to the allegation relating to the militarization of labour centres, the Committee notes that the Government confirms that the intervention of public security agents was limited to the action necessary to protect the health-care centres in order to safeguard the physical integrity of people and",0,2002,El Salvador
167,"institutional assets in the face of the violent behaviour of the workers on strike, who prevented employees and rightful owners from accessing the various health-care centres. The Committee also notes the Government s statement that various events became the subject of judicial proceedings wherein, in many cases, the judicial authorities handed down decisions against the workers.
.With regard to the alleged withholding of wages, bonus payments, holidays and other benefits selectively and in a discriminatory manner, the Committee notes that the Government confirms that this took place in accordance with the law and because of the declaration by the judicial authorities that the strike was illegal. The Committee also notes the Government s statement that the workers who went on strike lodged a total of  complaints against the Institute, most of which have been dropped by the workers and others which have gone against the workers.
.With regard to the alleged dismissal of trade union members and an official of the General Board of Directors by the Institute authorities as of  September  (two-and-a-half months after the strike), added to the other  dismissals that took place during the strike, the Committee notes that the Government indicates that on  June  an ""agreement for the resolution of the health conflict and the beginning of the comprehensive reform process"" was signed between the STISSS and the Institute. Subsection IV lays down the provisions for the reinstatement of administrative workers and the formation of the Special Tripartite Commission made up of the Institute, the STISSS and conflict mediators. The Commission s proposal was to review the files of the workers who had been charged with criminal offences before the Attorney-General s Office of the Republic. At the end of the relevant sessions, the Commission declared that it was not competent to issue an opinion on the cases of  workers as these had criminal cases pending. In accordance with the authority conferred by the agreement previously mentioned, the Institute proceeded in good faith to review the files of the  workers who had not been reinstated and decided to reinstate in their posts three of them; in the other  cases, the Institute authorities acted in accordance with legislation and the agreement for the resolution of the health conflict and the beginning of the comprehensive reform process of the sector. The Committee expects that, if the criminal charges laid against the  workers are rejected, the workers concerned will be reinstated in their posts without loss of wages.
.With regard to the alleged deliberate delay by the Secretariat for Labour and Social Security in the revision process of the collective labour agreement, the arbitration award, the Committee notes that the Government confirms that the request for revision was presented jointly by the STISSS and the SIMETRISSS, but that the latter was unable to prove that it had legal capacity to act under the arbitration award. In the light of such a situation, the General Labour Directorate decided to admit the revision of the arbitration award taking as party to this only the STISSS, as it had legal capacity to negotiate.
.In this respect, with regard to the legal reasons that led to the refusal to recognize the STISSS/SIMETRISSS coalition in the revision of the arbitration award, the Committee notes the Government s statement that the legislation allows trade union coalition only for those cases where one trade union will not have the necessary percentage to sign a collective agreement and not for the case of revision. The Committee notes that the issue is currently before the Division of Administrative Law of the Supreme Court of Justice and requests the Government to send it a copy of the decision when this is handed down. However, the Committee points out that legislation should not prevent two trade unions from negotiating jointly if they so wish, including in cases of revision of a collective agreement when one of them is less representative.
.With regard to the allegation relating to the eviction of the trade union from its premises by the Institute authorities, the Committee notes that the complainant organization states that it has lodged a complaint with the Attorney-General s Office of the Republic, which had, at the time of sending this complaint, not handed down its decision. The Committee requests the Government to take all possible steps to ensure that the decision is not delayed, and that it send the Committee a copy of all decisions taken in this respect.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) With regard to the dismissal of the  people listed by name in the allegations, the Committee requests the Government to indicate whether the  workers to whom it referred have taken legal action and, if so, that it inform the Committee of the respective decisions. The Committee requests the Government to provide information on the dismissal of the other workers. The Committee repeats its request to the complainant organization that it indicate the extent to which these dismissals were related to the exercise of trade union rights and whether those dismissed were trade union members.(b) The Committee notes that neither the complainant organization nor the Government has sent the information requested by the Committee in its previous recommendations, which it reiterates here:- The Committee requests the Government to send information without delay on the alleged transfer or prevention from applying for a job that affected Dr. Teresa de Jess Sosa and Dr. Daro Snchez, both members of the SIMETRISSS, and regarding the alleged modification of permanent contracts to short-term contracts affecting members of the trade union.- With regard to the allegations relating to illegal deductions from wages affecting  persons (some of them trade union members), the Committee requests the Government and the complainant to indicate the name of the workers who were not present at the workplace (ISSS) on  September , as well as the legislation to which the Government refers.- With regard to the alleged search of people and vehicles belonging to trade union members of SIMETRISSS and the hiring of private armed guards, the Committee requests the Government and the complainant to provide further information on these allegations.(c) With regard to the alleged dismissal of  trade union members, the Committee expects that, if the criminal charges laid against these workers are rejected, the workers concerned will be reinstated in their posts without loss of wages.(d) With regard to the refusal to recognize the STISSS/SIMETRISSS coalition in the revision of the arbitration award, the Committee notes that the issue is currently before the Division of Administrative Law of the Supreme Court of Justice and requests the Government to send it a copy of the decision when this is handed down. However, the Committee points out that legislation should not prevent two trade unions from negotiating jointly if they so wish, including in cases of revision of a collective agreement when one of them is less representative.(e) With regard to the allegation of eviction of the trade union from its premises, the Committee requests the Government to take all possible steps to ensure that the decision of the Attorney-General s Office of the Republic is not delayed, and that it send the Committee a copy of all decisions taken in this respect.
.The complaint is presented in a communication dated  July  from the World Confederation of Labour (WCL). This organization sent further information in a communication dated  August . The Government submitted its reply in a communication dated  March .
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  July , the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) alleges that the negotiations undertaken between May  and November  by the Government of El Salvador with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, which included privatization of public health services, have, as a consequence, led to an increase in the repression of and discrimination against members of the Union of Doctors and Workers of the Salvadoran Social Security Institute (SIMETRISSS). The doctors have seen their permanent work contracts changed to short-term contracts (three months), and renewal of these depends entirely on the good will of the employers.
.The WCL states that in a document entitled  Proposed comprehensive health reform'  submitted to the President of the Republic of El Salvador, SIMETRISSS has proposed alternative policies in order definitively to resolve the problems of the health sector in this country but the Government has made no reply.
.The WCL indicates that instead of implementing a policy of negotiation with the staff, the Salvadoran Social Security Institute (ISSS) hired heavily armed private guards with the aim of, among other things, discouraging any attempt to protest against the policies implemented by the management. And, faced with the numerous attacks on members of SIMETRESSS (arbitrary wage deductions, the institution",0,2002,El Salvador
168,"of searches of staff and vehicles of trade union members by private armed employees contracted by the general management of ISSS), SIMETRESSS has submitted to the labour inspectorate requests for inspections to confirm the facts in the various establishments involved. Unfortunately, the results of these inspections are biased and do not bear any relation to the reality faced by workers.
.The WCL concludes by indicating that the facts in this complaint show the consequences of the policies recommended by the international financial institutions for the privatization of the public health services.
.In its communication of  August , the WCL lists  people (some of them trade union members) who had deductions made in their wages arbitrarily and illegally even when the presence of these workers in the ISSS was registered for the month in which the deductions were made. The WCL refers to the dismissal of  people, also listed (Juan Bautista Caballero, Beatriz Crdova de Caballero, Anbal Avelar, Jaime Francisco Murillo, Ricardo Marvin Rodrguez, Elvia Elizabeth Antonio Beltrn, Richard Edgardo Castro, Angel Gabriel Aguilar, Silvia Canales de Alfaro, Camila Baquerano, Jos Alberto Elas Torres, Bernardo Gmez Escobar, Rigoberto Guilln, Santos Carlos Vsquez, Nelson Rafael Olivo Mndez, Walter Cecilio Serrano Monge, Nora Edith Martnez de Colocho and Juan Francisco Figueroa). Doctor Daro Snchez (a member of the trade union) was transferred to a new workplace in violation of the criteria in clause  of the arbitration award and Doctor Teresa de Jess Sosa (a member of the trade union) was prevented from applying for the job of clinic director in the clinic in which she worked in violation of the provisions of clause  of the arbitration award. The trade union representative Noila Aminta Menjbar and the education secretary of the trade union, Carlos Avils, were deprived of freedom of movement by private surveillance and were subjected to searches without official authorization from the competent authority. Searches of people and vehicles took place in centres such as the Medical Surgical Hospital and the Specialized Treatment Hospital, both in El Salvador.
.In its communication of  March , the Government states that after a detailed investigation it declared that no illegal deductions were made to any of the members affiliated to the Union of Doctors and Workers of the Salvadoran Social Security Institute (SIMETRISSS) who did not work on  September  and that, on the contrary, these deductions were made legally and in accordance with article , paragraph , of the Labour Code, which states that  any worker who does not complete the working week, and has no justifiable grounds for this, will not be entitled to the wage established in the previous paragraph'  It stated that these people did not provide the work for which they had been contracted and had no justifiable grounds and, therefore, they did not complete their labour week, for which reason they did not have the right to the aforementioned payment.
.With regard to the searches of people currently taking place at the facilities of the Salvadoran Social Security Institute (ISSS), the Government states that these searches were instituted for all staff of the Institute, including the rightful owners and visitors and arose as a result of the constant outbursts of members of this trade union that had destroyed goods and assets belonging to the ISSS, giving rise to an atmosphere of obvious insecurity. To establish these searches was not only a right of the public administration, but also an obligation based on the technical standards of internal control of the Comptroller of the Republic and in articles , , ,  No.  and  of the Law of the Comptroller of the Republic. These provisions indicate that an important obligation of the authorities of the ISSS is to ensure that within its facilities the integrity and property of the rightful owners and staff are protected. The furnishings and equipment of the ISSS must also be safeguarded to prevent them from being stolen or destroyed. Therefore, such searches are justified and entirely legal in accordance with the above. The administration is directly responsible for fulfilling its legal obligations.
.The Government states that it is not true that the implementation of these searches infringes in any way the Constitution of the Republic, as in the current situation it is not investigating any type of crime or offence but that the measure of implementing searches is aimed at safeguarding the facilities of the ISSS and protecting the personal integrity and property of the rightful owners and staff.
.With regard to the so-called privatization of medical and hospital services, including those provided by the ISSS, the Government categorically states that it upholds its constitutional undertaking to provide health services to all those living in the Republic as, in accordance with article  of the Constitution of El Salvador, the health of the inhabitants of the country is a public asset and, consequently, the State and the people are obliged to ensure that this is maintained. From the previously mentioned information it can be assumed that the ISSS is upholding its legal undertaking to provide social security services to all its rightful owners, based on article  of the Constitution which states that social security is an obligatory public service. The law shall regulate its extent, reach and form. This service shall be provided by one or several institutions, which shall ensure amongst themselves the appropriate consideration to ensure a good social protection policy, in specialized form and with the best use of resources. Employers, workers and the State shall contribute to paying social security in the form and amount determined by law. The State and employers shall be excluded from the obligations imposed by law in favour of workers, in so far as these are covered by social security.
.With regard to the supposed dismissals of ISSS workers, the Government states that the decision to end working relations, without liability on the part of the Institute, was entirely justified by the various labour offences that were committed and duly documented in each one of the respective files, having complied with the due process accorded and laid down by the Labour Code. In all cases, proceedings were carried out in accordance with article  of the Labour Code, which contains the grounds for terminating a labour contract without liability on the part of the employer.
.Finally, with regard to the complaint lodged by the Secretary-General of the Executive Committee of SIMETRISSS relating to the fact that requests for inspections were submitted to confirm the supposed illegal processes that members of the trade union had been subjected to and that, according to them, the results of the inspections had been biased, the Government states that all requests lodged were treated with due promptness and speed, having determined legally that none of the violations alleged existed, as has been previously stated.
.The Committee notes that the complainant organization alleges in this complaint that permanent contracts of members of the Union of Doctors and Workers of the Salvadoran Social Security Institute (SIMETRISSS) were changed to temporary contracts of three months, private armed guards were hired to discourage any protest attempt at the Salvadoran Social Security Institute (ISSS), illegal wage deductions were made for  people (some of them trade union members),  people were dismissed, two trade union members were transferred or prevented from applying for a job in violation of the arbitration award in force, and people and vehicles belonging to trade union members were searched at the Medical Surgical Hospital and the Specialized Treatment Hospital, including two trade union officials who are under surveillance and who have been deprived of freedom of movement. The complainant organization also refers to the privatization process and its labour-related consequences, and to the alleged lack of collective bargaining, but these matters have already been examined in the framework of Case No.  [see th Report, paras. ?, examined by the Committee in March ].
.In reply to the alleged dismissal of  people, listed by name, the Committee notes the Government s statement that these dismissals were justified by the various labour offences duly documented that are listed among the reasons for termination of a labour contract without liability on the part of the employer. The Committee, although noting that the complainant organization has not indicated whether those dismissed were members of the trade union SIMETRISSS or not, requests the Government and the complainant to provide concrete details as to the reasons for the dismissal of these persons and to indicate the extent to which these dismissals were related to the exercise of trade union rights and whether those dismissed were trade union members.
.With regard to the alleged transfer or prevention from applying for a job affecting Doctor Teresa de Jess Sosa and Doctor Dario Snchez (members of SIMETRISSS), in violation of the arbitration award in force and the alleged modification of permanent contracts to short-term contracts to the detriment of trade union members, the Committee regrets that the Government has made no reply in this respect and requests",0,2002,El Salvador
169,"it to do so without delay.
.With regard to the alleged illegal deductions from wages affecting  people (some of them trade union members) even when, according to the complainant organization, the presence of these workers was registered with the ISSS during the period in question, the Committee notes that the Government states that: () the deductions were legally carried out for workers who did not work on  September ; and () these people had not carried out the work for which they had been contracted. The Committee requests the Government and the complainant to indicate the name of the workers who were not present at the workplace on  September  as well as the legislation to which the Government refers.
.With regard to the alleged illegal search of people and vehicles belonging to trade union members at the Medical Surgical Hospital and the Specialized Treatment Hospital (including trade union officials Zoila Aminta Menjbar and Carlos Avils) and the alleged hiring of private armed guards to discourage any protest attempt, the Committee notes the Government s statement according to which: () the searches were implemented for all staff of the ISSS and visitors; () these searches were justified by the destruction of goods and assets belonging to the Institute which had given rise to an atmosphere of obvious insecurity (these activities the Government attributes to members of SIMETRISSS); () the administration is legally obliged to ensure the safety of assets and is directly responsible for fulfilling these obligations; and () the labour inspectorate concluded that there had been no illegal action taken. The Committee requests the Govenment and the complainant to provide further information on these allegations.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee requests the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government and the complainant to provide concrete details regarding the reasons for the dismissal of the  people listed by name in the allegations, and to indicate the extent to which these dismissals were related to the exercise of trade union rights and whether those dismissed were trade union members.(b) The Committee requests the Government to send information without delay on the alleged transfer or prevention from applying for a job that affected Doctor Teresa de Jess Sosa and Doctor Dario Snchez, both members of the Union of Doctors and Workers of the Salvadoran Social Security Institute (SIMETRISSS), and regarding the alleged modification of permanent contracts to short-term contracts affecting members of the trade union.(c) With regard to the allegations relative to illegal deductions from wages affecting  persons (some of them trade union members), the Committee requests the Government and the complainant to indicate the name of the workers who were not present at the workplace (ISSS) on  September , as well as the legislation to which the Government refers.(d) With regard to the alleged search of people and vehicles belonging to trade union members of SIMETRISSS and the hiring of private armed guards, the Committee requests the Government and the complainant to provide further information on these allegations.",0,2002,El Salvador
170,".At its previous examination of the case, the Committee had requested the Government to inform it whether the Lido S.A. enterprise had reinstated four trade union officials who had remained dismissed [see th Report, para. ].
.In its communication of  July , the Government states that the parties met in the joint committee provided for under the terms of the collective agreement and agreed to reinstate the four officials who had remained dismissed, who were in fact reinstated in September and October .
.The Committee notes this information with satisfaction.
.At its June  meeting, the Committee expressed the hope that the four trade union officials of the trade union of the Lido S.A. enterprise who remained dismissed would be reinstated in the company in the near future and requested the Government to keep it informed of developments concerning the alleged refusal of the company to meet with the trade union or to reactivate the joint committee provided for under the terms of the collective agreement. The enterprise had stated, through the Government, that it had a positive attitude and displayed good will [see th Report, para. ].
.In its communication of  August , the Government states that on  July  the parties agreed to hold a meeting of the joint committee to deal with the issue of reinstating the four trade union officials.
.The Committee notes this information with interest and requests the Government to inform it whether the enterprise has reinstated the four trade union officials who remained dismissed.
.The Committee last examined this case at its March  meeting and on that occasion requested the Government to keep it informed of the rulings handed down on the dismissals of  union officers at Lido S.A. [see rd Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (March )].
.The trade union of the company Lido. S.A. (SELSA), in its communications of  November  and  February , states that the company continues to refuse the union s executive body access to its premises. The union adds that the company had reinstated a certain number of union officials, but still refused to reinstate five others. The company refuses to meet with the union on official premises or to reactivate the joint committee provided for under the terms of the collective agreement.
.The Government, in communications dated  October  and  January and  February , states that the company has complied with the conciliation agreement signed by the parties on  July , given that it deposits the wages of the  union officials once a fortnight with the Ministry of Labour, and those wages have been withdrawn by the officials without any problem. The Government adds that a number of meetings were arranged between the employer and workers to persuade the former to reinstate the officials. The Government states that, as no favourable reply was forthcoming from the employer at these meetings, the Ministry fined the company Lido S.A. the sum of US$, for infringing section  of the Labour Code by obstructing the freedom of association of the union officials and disrupting the union with the aim of ensuring that the union could not continue to exist legally for want of the legal minimum membership as required by the Labour Code. The Government also states that the company has allowed the reinstatement of five union officials and that the company and the union have agreed to discuss the reinstatement of the remaining five within a short period of time. The Government will take follow-up action with regard to the agreements in question. The Government invites the complainant to file its new allegations with the Ministry of Labour.
.In its communication dated  May , the Government adds that one more trade union official has been reintegrated (Mr. Ernesto Hernndez Castillo); with regard to the remaining four trade union officials, the company has indicated that it will look for the appropriate mechanism for their reintegration and the two parties have agreed to meet in order to find a satisfactory solution. The Government indicates that the company has indicated that it will verify the situation with regard to the alleged refusal to meet with the union and that the representative of the company refused knowledge of these facts; the company has a positive attitude towards resolving the problems. The company stated that there is good will to reactivate the joint committee through dialogue, and that its non-operation was due to external factors and changes in its membership on behalf of the company.
.The Committee takes due note of these observations, and in particular of the large fine imposed on the company Lido S.A. for obstructing the freedom and association and reinstatement of six union officials. The Committee hopes that the remaining four officials will be reinstated in the company in the near future and notes that the company will meet with the trade union with regard to this issue and will look for an appropriate mechanism for their reintegration. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments including any ruling handed down with regard to the four dismissed officials. With regard to the alleged refusal of the company to meet with the union on official premises or to reactivate the joint committee provided for under the terms of the collective agreement, the Committee takes note of the company s statements and requests the Government to keep it informed of developments on these issues.
.At its November  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendation on the outstanding issues [see nd Report, para. ]:The Committee is still awaiting the legal ruling on the dismissals of  union officers and  union members at Lido, S.A. The Committee also notes that the parties, with the participation of the Ministry of Labour, have held meetings and that it was anticipated that the reinstatement of trade union officials would begin in September . The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.In its communication of  January , the Government states that it will keep the Committee informed of the decisions made by the labour courts concerning the dismissals of the  union officers. The Government states that in keeping with the conciliatory agreement reached at the General Labour Directorate, the enterprise has paid these union officers a salary for each month. As regards the  dismissed union members, the Government states that they received full compensation.
.The Committee notes this information and requests the Government to keep it informed of the rulings handed down on the dismissals of  union officers at Lido, S.A.
.At its March  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendations on the issues that remained outstanding [see th Report, para. ]:(a) The Committee requests the Government to: () ask the judicial authority to give a ruling promptly in respect of the dismissals of  union officers and  union members at Lido, S.A., so that, if measures need to be taken to correct the situation, they can be genuinely effective; and () if the judicial authority considers that the dismissals were carried out for anti-union motives ' specifically for participation in an eight-hour work stoppage ' take urgent measures to reinstate the trade union officials and workers dismissed, with the payment of outstanding salaries in cases where this has not already been done; or if reinstatement is not possible to guarantee that adequate compensation is awarded to the dismissed workers. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in the situation with regard to both matters.(b) The Committee considers that, if strikes are prohibited whilst a collective agreement is in force, this restriction must be compensated for by the right to have recourse to impartial and rapid mechanisms, within which individual or collective complaints about the interpretation or application of collective agreements can be examined. The Committee requests the Government to indicate whether such mechanisms exist in the national legislation and to transmit a copy of the collective agreement in force at Lido, S.A.(c) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed about the fulfilment of the agreement relating to returning the relevant union dues to the Company Union of Lido, S.A.(d) With regard to the allegation that Lido, S.A. used coercion to pressure union members into resigning from the union (according to the complainant organization,  workers have resigned in this context), the Committee requests the Government to undertake an investigation and, should the allegations be substantiated, to take measures against those responsible for such actions so as to prevent them from reoccurring in the future.(e) With regard to the alleged denial of access to the company s premises of the union s executive board, the Committee recalls that governments should guarantee access of trade union representatives to workplaces, with due respect for the rights of property and management and requests the Government to take the necessary measures to guarantee that this principle is respected within the company in question.(f) The Committee requests the Government to ensure that Lido, S.A.",0,2002,El Salvador
171,"is consulted through the national employers' organizations in respect of the allegations made in this case.
.In its communication of  September , the Government states with regard to the dismissals of trade union members at Lido, S.A. that it has sent an announcement to the President of the Supreme Court of the Committee s recommendations, recalling at the same time that the judiciary is independent. The Government adds that the  workers dismissed have been paid compensation in accordance with the Labour Code and the collective agreement in October and November  and that this has been confirmed by the General Secretary of the trade union of the enterprise.
.With regard to recommendation (b) of the Committee, the Government indicates that the mechanisms provided for in the legislation for the peaceful resolution of labour disputes are the labour courts, conciliation and arbitration.
.With regard to recommendation (c) of the Committee, the Government states that the payment to the union of members' trade union dues has taken place normally since  May , when the trade union requested that the Ministry of Labour take steps with the enterprise with regard to this matter.
.With regard to recommendation (d) of the Committee, the Government states that since  July  (the date on which the trade union and the enterprise reached a conciliatory agreement at the General Labour Directorate) there have been no claims of coercion by the employer to pressure trade union members into resigning from the union. The allegations prior to this date are not backed by clear and convincing proof.
.With regard to the recommendation relating to access of trade union representatives to workplaces, the Government states that it is making significant efforts and holding conciliatory meetings so that the parties can reach an agreement that will allow the trade union officials to be reinstated. Although reinstatement has still not been carried out, it is anticipated that this will take place gradually during September, subject to the agreement of both parties with regard to the specific date and the way in which this will be carried out.
.The Committee notes with interest the information provided by the Government. The Committee is still awaiting the legal ruling on the dismissals of  union officers and  union members at Lido, S.A. The Committee also notes that the parties, with the participation of the Ministry of Labour, have held meetings and that it was anticipated that the reinstatement of trade union officials would begin in September . The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the Company Union of Lido, S.A. (SELSA) dated  June . SELSA sent additional information in a communication dated  July . The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) supported the complaint in a communication dated  July . The Government sent its observations in communications dated  July and  September .
.El Salvador has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  June , the Company Union of Lido, S.A. states that in February  it asked the company to revise the section of the collective agreement dealing with salaries (according to the complainant, clause  of the collective agreement requires the company to revise its salary table in the first fortnight of January each year in order for the increase to take effect in February of the same year), at this phase of direct negotiation requesting an increase of US$ for each worker. The complainant adds that, following the phase of direct negotiation, a phase of conciliation began, but that it was impossible to come to an agreement due to the unyielding position of the company, which proposed a  per cent decrease in workers' salaries.
.The complainant states that, in this context, the workers held an eight-hour work stoppage on  May , and that an inspection by the Ministry of Labour confirmed that the workers were at their workplaces but not working, by way of protest. The complainant adds that the company asked the Second Labour Court to classify the strike (as legal or illegal) but, after the inspection carried out at the workplace on  May , the judicial authority confirmed that the workers had not held a strike and that production activities were being carried out normally.
.The complainant alleges that, in reprisal, the company prevented  workers from entering the workplace on  and  May . Of these,  were union officers, who to date have still been kept away from the company. The complainant states that, on  May , it requested the Ministry of Labour to continue the conciliation process, but that at the conciliation hearing called on  May  by the Labour Inspectorate, the representative of the company declared that, if the workers involved considered that their rights had been violated in any way, they could pursue the matter through whatever avenue they considered appropriate. The complainant reports that the dismissed workers have brought individual actions before the judicial authority for constructive dismissal, demanding payment of outstanding salaries owing to the actions of the employer, in accordance with section  of the Labour Code, and that the members of the union s general executive board who had been dismissed have also brought an action before the judicial authority demanding payment of outstanding salaries, as laid down in section  of the Code.
.In its communication dated  July , the complainant alleges that:(i) the company has withheld union dues, which constitutes misappropriation, and reports that, in respect of this, an action has been lodged with the Office of the Attorney-General of the Republic;(ii) the company has denied the union s executive board access to the company s buildings and has used coercion to pressure workers into resigning from the union, which has lead to the resignation of  workers (the complainant reports that a complaint was submitted to the Ministry of Labour in this respect on  June );(iii) the Ministry of Labour has refused to notify the company of the strike agreement adopted at a workers' meeting held on  June  and communicated to the Ministry of Labour on  June . The Directorate General of Labour argues that the strike had no legal basis and, according to the complainant, the Ministry of Labour is taking over functions that belong to labour judges. The complainant alleges that there is a legislative ambiguity, since section  of the Labour Code lays down that strikes will be recognized providing they have any of the following aims: ' ) the drawing up or revision of a collective labour contract; () the drawing up or revision of a collective labour agreement; and () the defence of workers' common professional interests'  section  of the Labour Code lays down that strikes will not be recognised if their objective is the revision of an existing collective agreement where the term of duration thereof has not yet expired.
.In its communication dated  July , the Government states that the conflict at Lido, S.A. arose as a result of a request from the union to revise salaries under the collective agreement in force, as laid down in clause . However, having moved through the stages of being an economic dispute and an interest dispute, during which the employer declared it was not economically able to increase salaries in line with the union s request, the union (in order to put pressure on the company to negotiate) and workers held an eight-hour work stoppage on  May . An inspection by the Ministry of Labour confirmed that  workers were at their workplaces but not working, by way of protest. On  and  May ,  workers stated that the company Lido, S.A. prevented them from carrying out their duties. Among them were officers from the union s general executive board. Exercising their democratic rights, they claimed judicial protection in the offices of the Directorate General of Labour, which summoned the employer to a conciliation hearing. This was held on  July , after the parties had agreed to the settlement of salaries owed to the officers for the period  May to  June  (the remaining claims would be settled individually). The Government adds that, following the conciliation hearing called on  July  by the Directorate General of Labour, on  July   of the dismissed union officers received from the company the following amounts in outstanding salaries due to the actions of the employer: Roberto Antonio Escobar Ramos: $.; Daniel Ernesto Ayala Gutirrez: $.; Marta Arely Majano Gmez: $.; Daniel Ernesto Hernndez Castillo: $.; Guadalupe Atilio Jaimes Prez: $.; Julio Csar Garca Bonilla: $.; Jorge Alberto Maroqun Muoz: $.; Mara Elena del Rosario Pacas Torres: $.; Jos Alfredo Osorio Morataya: $.; Rosa Lila Umaa de Ros: $.; and Brigido Antonio Hurtado Gmez: $..
.The Government adds",0,2002,El Salvador
172,"that it has safeguarded the right to collective bargaining and that, in this case, the parties had exhausted the administrative avenues for the stages of collective economic disputes and interest disputes raised by the Company Union of Lido, S.A., i.e. the stages of direct negotiation and conciliation, the objective of which was the revision of clause  (Salaries) of the collective labour agreement, signed by both parties in mutual respect of the commitments undertaken in the related collective agreement. Furthermore, the Government states that, with regard to the legality or otherwise of the dismissals of the  workers who were not union officers, the Labour Tribunal would be the appropriate authority to resolve the matter. Lastly, the Government states that the collective economic labour dispute or collective labour interest dispute in question originated in the revision of the collective labour agreement, signed by both parties and currently in force, with the workers alleging a change in the company s economic conditions; these grounds do not give the workers the right to strike as described in section (ii) of the Labour Code which states literally:  Neither will [a strike] be recognised if its objective is the revision of an existing collective contract where the term of duration thereof has not yet expired.' The collective labour contract in force between the parties expires on  June .
.In its communication of  September , the Government states that at the conciliation hearing held on  July , the following results were obtained: (a) with regard to the union dues withheld, the parties reached an agreement; (b) with regard to alleged coercion by the company of union members with the aim of influencing their decision on union membership, the company refuted the assertion and the union, for its part, insisted that such measures had taken place without describing what the measures were; (c) with regard to penalization in the application of section  of the Labour Code to the dismissals of  union members, including  union officers, the delegate of the Directorate General of Labour informed them that the judicial authorities would determine the legality of the dismissals.
.With regard to the complainant s allegations that the Department of Labour and Social Security, through the Directorate General of Labour, refused to notify the company Lido, S.A. of the strike agreement adopted since it had no legal basis, the Government states the following concerning the position that served as a basis for refusing to notify the company: (a) section (ii) of the Labour Code lays down that neither will a strike be recognized if its objective is the revision of an existing collective agreement where the term of duration thereof has not yet expired; and (b) to understand this provision it must be borne in mind that the collective labour agreement drawn up between Lido, S.A. and the Company Union of Lido, S.A. entered into force on  June  and will expire on  June , and that, as appears in file No. / sent to the Directorate General of Labour of the Department of Labour and Social Security, the union requested in writing on  November  that direct negotiations begin in the collective economic dispute or interest dispute for the revision of the section of the collective labour agreement dealing with salaries, which, as has been shown, had not yet expired; on the basis of the above, it was resolved to declare the union s request groundless since it contravened section . According to the Government, there is no ambiguity between the provisions of sections  and  of the Labour Code.
.Lastly, the Government states that, with regard to the actions brought by the complainant before the Office of the Attorney-General of the Republic and the labour courts, it is of the view that two basic principles form part of the right to judicial security: the principle of legality and the principle of exact compliance with law, and both have given rise to the so-called state of law, in which all judicial power, all authorities and all individual actions must have a foundation precisely in law, confirming that the principal characteristic of the state of law is that the law is above all the governors and the governed, and that therefore it is the responsibility of the aforementioned authorities to settle the conflicts raised by the union.
.The Committee observes that the complainant alleges that in reprisal for an eight-hour work stoppage, in protest of the company s non-compliance with a clause of the collective labour agreement in force, which provides for the revision of the salary table and the payment of an annual salary increase, Lido, S.A. proceeded to dismiss, on  and  May ,  union officers and  union members. Furthermore, the Committee observes that the complainant alleges that the company: (i) illegally withheld union dues; (ii) denied the executive committee access to the company s premises, and (iii) employed coercion to pressure union members into resigning from the union (according to the complainant,  workers have resigned in this context), and that the Ministry of Labour refused to notify the company of the strike agreement adopted by the union, arguing that the strike had no legal basis.
.The Committee wishes to point out in the first place that the declaration of the illegality of a strike should not be the responsibility of the Minister of Labour. The Committee underlines that responsibility for declaring a strike illegal should not lie with the Government, but with an independent body which has the confidence of the parties involved [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, , th edition, para. ].
.With regard to the dismissals of  union officers and  union members in reprisal for an eight-hour work stoppage in protest of non-compliance with the collective agreement, the Committee takes note of the Government s statement that: () following the conciliation hearing requested by the complainant, which was held on  July , the company paid the  union leaders the outstanding salaries due to the actions of the employer and() the question of the legality or otherwise of the dismissals will be resolved by the competent judicial authority. In this respect, the Committee observes that the complainant reports that the company requested classification of the strike from the judicial authority (section  of the Labour Code provides for this possibility) and that the said authority confirmed that there had been no strike and that production activities were being carried out normally. In this context, the Committee cannot rule out the possibility that the dismissals were carried out in reprisal for the protest measure undertaken by the workers, which would be a serious violation of freedom of association. In these circumstances, whilst it observes that all those dismissed have lodged judicial appeals in this respect, the Committee requests the Government to: () ask the judicial authority to give a ruling promptly so that, if measures need to be taken to correct the situation they can be genuinely effective; and () if the judicial authority considers that the dismissals were carried out for anti-union motives ' specifically for participation in an eight-hour work stoppage ' take urgent measures to reinstate the  workers dismissed, with the payment of salaries outstanding in cases where this has not already been done; or if reinstatement is not possible, adequate compensation should be guaranteed to those dismissed. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in the situation with regard to both matters.
.Regarding the allegations of the Ministry of Labour s refusal to notify the company of the strike agreement adopted by the union, arguing that the said strike had no legal basis, the Committee takes note of the Government s statement that the collective labour agreement drawn up between the union and the company entered into force on  June  and will expire on  June  and that, bearing in mind the provisions of section  of the Labour Code (a strike will not be recognized if its objective is the revision of an existing collective agreement where the term of duration thereof has not yet expired), it was resolved to declare the union s request groundless. In this respect, the Committee considers that, if strikes are prohibited whilst a collective agreement is in force, this restriction must be compensated for by the right to have recourse to impartial and rapid mechanisms, within which individual or collective complaints about the interpretation or application of collective agreements can be examined; this type of mechanism not only allows the inevitable difficulties which may occur regarding the interpretation or application of collective agreements to be resolved whilst the agreements are in force, but also has the advantage of preparing the ground for future rounds of negotiations, given that it allows problems which have arisen during the period of validity of the collective agreement in question to be identified. The Committee requests the Government to indicate whether such mechanisms",0,2002,El Salvador
173,"exist in national legislation and to transmit a copy of the collective agreement in force at the company Lido, S.A.
.With regard to the allegation that the company illegally withheld union dues, the Committee observes that the Government reports that, during the conciliation hearing held on  July , the parties reached an agreement. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed about the fulfilment of the agreement in question.
.With regard to the allegation that the company used coercion to pressure union members into resigning from the union (according to the complainant,  workers have resigned in this context), the Government reports that, during the conciliation hearing held on  July , the company refuted the assertion and the union insisted that such measures had taken place without describing what the measures were. In this respect, the Committee regrets that the Government has not begun an investigation into the accusation made by the union to the Ministry of Labour in June . In this case, the Committee requests the Government to undertake an investigation and, should the allegations be substantiated, to take measures against those responsible for such actions so as to prevent them from reoccurring in the future.
.With regard to the alleged denial of access to the company s premises of the union s executive board, the Committee regrets that the Government has not sent its observations on the matter. In this respect, the Committee recalls that governments should guarantee access of trade union representatives to workplaces, with due respect for the rights of property and management [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, , th edition, para. ]. In this regard, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to guarantee to the members of the union s executive board respect of this principle at Lido, S.A.
.The Committee requests the Government to ensure that the company Lido, S.A., is consulted through the national employers' organizations in respect of the allegations made in this case.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to: () ask the judicial authority to give a ruling promptly in respect of the dismissals of  union officers and  union members at the company Lido, S.A., so that, if measures need to be taken to correct the situation they can be genuinely effective; and () if the judicial authority considers that the dismissals were carried out for anti-union motives ' specifically for participation in an eight-hour work stoppage ' take urgent measures to reinstate the  workers dismissed, with the payment of outstanding salaries in cases where this has not already been done; or if reinstatement is not possible to guarantee adequate compensation is awarded to the dismissed workers. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in the situation with regard to both matters.(b) The Committee considers that, if strikes are prohibited whilst a collective agreement is in force, this restriction must be compensated for by the right to have recourse to impartial and rapid mechanisms, within which individual or collective complaints about the interpretation or application of collective agreements can be examined. The Committee requests the Government to indicate whether such mechanisms exist in the national legislation and to transmit a copy of the collective agreement in force at the company Lido, S.A.(c) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed about the fulfilment of the agreement relating to returning the relevant union dues to the Company Union of Lido, S.A.(d) With regard to the allegation that Lido, S.A. used coercion to pressure union members into resigning from the union (according to the complainant,  workers have resigned in this context), the Committee requests the Government to undertake an investigation and, should the allegations be substantiated, to take measures against those responsible for such actions so as to prevent them from reoccurring in the future.(e) With regard to the alleged denial of access to the company s premises of the union s executive board, the Committee recalls that governments should guarantee access of trade union representatives to workplaces, with due respect for the rights of property and management and requests the Government to take the necessary measures to guarantee that this principle is respected within the company in question.(f) The Committee requests the Government to ensure that the company Lido, S.A., is consulted through the national employers' organizations in respect of the allegations made in this case.",0,2002,El Salvador
174,".At its November  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendations in Cases Nos.  and  [see th Report, para. ]:The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to amend the legislation on the following points in order to bring it into conformity with freedom of association principles: the reform of the Labour Code provisions setting out excessive formalities for recognition of trade unions and acquisition of legal personality contrary to the principle of free establishment of trade union organizations (requirement that trade unions of independent institutions should be works unions), that made it difficult to set up a trade union (minimum number of  workers to establish a works union) or that in any case made it temporarily impossible to establish a trade union (requirement to wait for six months before applying for recognition of a new trade union when a first request is rejected), and measures taken to amend the national legislation so that it would recognize the right of association of state workers, with the sole possible exception of the armed forces and police, in conformity with freedom of association principles. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.At its November  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendations in Case No.  [see th Report, para. ]:' The Committee strongly urges the Government as a matter of urgency to ensure that the national legislation of El Salvador is amended so that it recognizes the right of association of workers employed in the service of the State, with the sole possible exception of the armed forces and the police.' The Committee expects that the trade union ATRAMEC will be recognized as soon as possible, as it was established since  March .' The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to amend the legislation on the points mentioned in its conclusions, so as to bring it into conformity with the principles of freedom of association. It requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.' The Committee draws the Government s attention to the availability of the technical assistance of the Office in this respect should it so desire.
.In its communication of  January , the Government reiterates the contents of its previous communications in Cases Nos. ,  and , where it had mentioned that its legislation had been amended in  with the ILO s technical assistance and that it contained several improvements (which the Government elaborates upon) as regards trade union rights, which have been recognized by the Regional Office for Latin America and the Caribbean. The Constitution and the Labour Code (which, according to the Regional Office, contains numerous improvements) recognize freedom of association rights for workers and employers in the private sector and for the workers of autonomous official institutions, and give state workers the right to establish associations; these are the result of sovereign decisions, in conformity with society expectations. The governmental plan called  New Alliance' elaborates a strategy linking the legal framework to the requirements of the national and international labour markets. Finally, as the Constitution and the Labour Code give freedom of association rights only to private sector workers and employers and to workers of autonomous official institutions, it is not legally possible to grant legal personality to the self-proclaimed Trade Union of Workers of the Ministry of Education (ATRAMEC).
.The Committee notes this information and regrets that the Government s position did not change as regards both the necessity to amend the legislation to bring it into full conformity with freedom of association principles, and the legal recognition of ATRAMEC. The Committee emphasizes that the fact that the legislation amended in  contains improvements does not mean that there is no problem left to solve. Accordingly, the Committee reiterates its previous recommendations and requests the Government to re-examine its position as regards both the trade union legislation and ATRAMEC. The Committee recalls once again to the Government that it may avail itself of the ILO s technical assistance.
.The complaint is presented in a communication from the Ministry of Education Workers' Trade Union (ATRAMEC) dated  March . The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  April .
.El Salvador has not ratified either the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee notes that in the present complaint, the education workers' trade union alleges that the Government: () has refused to comply with the recommendations of the Committee in Case No.  to amend the legislation so that it recognizes the right of association of public service employees; () the complainant organization still does not have legal personality in spite of a new request on  July .
.The Committee notes the Government s reply, but regrets that this reply contains no new elements in relation to the replies dated  July  and  January  in the framework of Case No. . The Committee notes in particular that the workers of the Ministry of Education cannot legally form trade unions but only associations and the government plan,  Alliance for Labour'  envisages a strategic approach towards the adaptation of the legal framework to conform to the requirements of the national and international labour markets.
.In these circumstances, the Committee can only reiterate the conclusions it formulated on examining Case No.  [see rd Report, para. , th Report, para.  and th Report, para. ], which it repeats as follows:' With regard to the refusal to grant legal personality to the Ministry of Education Workers' Trade Union (ATRAMEC) in May , the Committee notes that, according to the Government, the Constitution of the Republic grants the right of association to workers in the private sector and to those employed in autonomous official institutions, but not to workers employed in the service of the State (public service and government employees), since the State provides essential services which must not be interrupted for any reason. The Committee is bound to emphasize that the denial of the right of public service employees to establish unions is an extremely serious violation of the most elementary principles of freedom of association. Consequently, the Committee urges the Government as a matter of urgency to ensure that the national legislation of El Salvador is amended in such a way that it recognizes the right of association of public service employees with the sole possible exception of the armed forces and the police.' The Committee hopes that the adaptation of the legal framework to which the Government refers will take place in the near future and will include all the reforms requested by the Committee. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect and points out that some of the points calling for reform, like for example, the need to guarantee the right of association for state employees, are in fact serious violations of that freedom.' With regard to the reform of the Labour Code concerning in particular, the recognition of the trade union rights of state employees, the Committee regrets that the Government merely reiterates its previous comments on this issue. In this respect,  in view of the importance of the right of employees of the state and local authorities to constitute and register trade unions, the prohibition of the right of association for workers in the service of the State is incompatible with the generally accepted principle that workers, without distinction whatsoever, should have the right to establish organizations of their own choosing without previous authorization' [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. ], the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to amend the legislation on the points mentioned above, so as to bring it into conformity with the principles of freedom of association. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.The Committee expects that the trade union ATRAMEC will be recognized as soon as possible, as it was established since  March .
.The Committee draws the Government s attention to the availability of the technical assistance of the Office in this respect should it so desire.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee strongly urges the Government as a matter of urgency to ensure that the national legislation of El Salvador is amended so that it recognizes the right of association of workers employed in the service of the State, with the sole possible exception of the armed forces and the police.(b) The Committee expects that the trade union ATRAMEC will be recognized as soon as possible, as it was established since  March .(c) The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to amend the legislation on the points mentioned in its conclusions, so as to bring it into conformity with the principles of freedom of",-1,2002,El Salvador

176,".At its March  meeting, the Committee requested the Government to examine jointly with the trade union organizations SITINPEP and FESTRASPES the situation of certain members of these organizations, (which carry out their activities in the National Institute for Public Employees' Pensions ' INPEP) who allege that they have been prejudiced for trade union reasons, with a view to their reinstatement in their jobs or the payment of compensation [see th Report, para. ]. The Government had indicated that the staff reductions were due to financial reasons.
.In its communication of  September , the Government states that the redundancies in INPEP were not motivated by trade union membership or trade union activities and that since this case ended there have been no claims relating to trade union members that may have been prejudiced.
.The Committee notes this information.
.At its June  meeting, the Committee formulated the following recommendations on the pending allegations of acts of anti-union discrimination at El Salvador International Airport as part of staff reduction measures [see th Report, para. ]:' the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures urgently to ensure that an investigation is carried out to determine the reasons why such a high proportion of unionists and workers' representatives were dismissed and, if it transpires that any of these dismissals were due to trade union membership or legitimate union activities, that it takes the necessary measures to ensure the reinstatement of those workers in their jobs, without loss of pay. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard as a matter of urgency;The Committee had observed that the Government had not denied that over half of the workers dismissed were members of SITINPEP, and that  of them were workers' representatives in various commissions and committees [see th Report, para. ].' as concerns the allegation of the militarization of El Salvador International Airport on  and  September , the Committee requests the Government to take measures to carry out an investigation to determine the reasons for this militarization and the extent to which it interfered with trade union activities and to keep it informed urgently of the outcome of this investigation.
.In its communication of  August , the Workers' Union of the National Institute for Public Employees' Pensions (SITINPEP) indicates that the dismissals from the INPEP had anti-union purposes and affected  union members (namely . per cent of the total number of members),  of whom were officials in trade union structures.
.In its communication of  September , the Federation of Public Service Workers' Trade Unions of El Salvador (FESTRASPES) states that as regards the partial agreement of  February  between the Autonomous Port Executive Commission (CEPA) and SITEAIES, the latter decided to halt its judicial and administrative proceedings in El Salvador since it considered that the country s institutions do not function properly, but said Federation has not withdrawn its complaint before the ILO given that these agreements must be overseen and improved until all of the airport workers obtain the employment benefits and conditions they enjoyed prior to militarization. The FESTRASPES alleges that more workers have renounced their trade union membership under pressure from the management following the  February  agreement. The FESTRASPES sent a report from the Prosecutor s Office for the Defence of Human Rights of El Salvador which indicates the following [it is not known whether the following is a statement by the Prosecutor s Office or the trade union official s version]:Following an inspection at the site, it has come to light that the El Salvador International Airport authorities prevented a General Assembly from taking place within the establishment at SITEAIES headquarters on  October . Military police reserves were positioned in the area surrounding the terminal to prevent this meeting from taking place. When questioned, they said they had been given orders by the airport s security chief to prevent suspended workers from entering the building and  to prevent the Assembly from taking place on these premises'  For this reason members of the Assembly met on rented premises in order to hold the aforementioned Assembly and elect new trade union officials.
.In its communications of ,  October and  December , the Government sent a copy of the agreement signed by the Port Executive Commission and  workers (whose contracts were suspended) terminating their individual employment contracts and establishing the specific amounts that they would receive. At the same time, the trade union SITEAIES decided to renounce any claims made before an institution, including the complaint made before the ILO (the same person who made the complaint to the ILO signed the agreement). The Government adds that no act of militarization occurred at the airport and that trade union rights were not obstructed. This case related to the suspension of individual employment contracts owing to force majeure as outlined in the Labour Code. The Government states that the administration had informed staff and the Union on many occasions of the financial situation of the INPEP which would lead to staff reductions. It also discussed the actual status of the institution s finances and the imminent staff reductions with the trade union s officials. Both unionized and non-unionized workers were amongst the staff whose posts were frozen. The jobs belonging to members of the executive board of the trade union and its former officials were respected; some officials with trade union immunity had their jobs frozen because they had failed to inform the institution of their trade union confederation membership, but had accepted their redundancy with the condition that their salaries be paid for the period during which they had been covered by trade union immunity; this condition was met. The redundancies were not motivated by trade union membership or trade union activities; affiliated and non?affiliated staff are currently working at the institution.
.The Committee observes that, unlike SITEAIES, the complainant organizations SITINPEP and FESTRASPES have not withdrawn their complaints. The Committee notes that  workers, SITEAIES and the institution CEPA reached an agreement. The Committee observes that the versions provided by the complainant organizations and the Government concerning the anti-union nature of the termination of contracts at the airport differ, as do their versions of the militarization of the airport in October  and the alleged obstruction of the exercise of trade union rights. The Committee recalls that, generally speaking, the right of organizations to hold meetings and demonstrations must be guaranteed and that the authorities should resort to the use of force only in situations where law and order is seriously threatened. Lastly, the Committee requests the Government, SITINPEP and FESTRASPES jointly to examine the situation of other members of these organizations (not the  members already mentioned) who allege that they have been prejudiced for trade union reasons, with a view to their reinstatement in their jobs or the payment of compensation.
.The complaints in this case are contained in communications from the Federation of Public Service Workers' Trade Unions of El Salvador (FESTRASPES), dated  October , and the Workers' Union of the National Institute for Public Employees' Pensions (SITINPEP), dated  and  January and  and  February . Public Services International (PSI), the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the International Transport Workers' Federation (ITF) expressed their support for the complaint presented by FESTRASPES, in communications dated  October and  December  and  January . The Government sent its observations in communications dated  February and  May .
.El Salvador has not ratified either the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  October , the Federation of Public Service Workers' Trade Unions of El Salvador (FESTRASPES) alleges that at  p.m. on  September , a contingent of Salvadoran armed forces, combined with military and riot police from the National Civil Police (PNC), burst without warning into El Salvador International Airport, in the municipality of San Luis Talpa, La Paz, and ordered workers to leave the terminal on the grounds that they had been dismissed. The complainant adds that on  September , the armed and police forces prevented workers of the cargo and maintenance departments, all of whom were members of the El Salvador International Airport Workers' Union (SITEAIES), which is affiliated to FESTRASPES, from entering the airport; on  September, the military personnel in charge informed the workers that only those from the maintenance department could enter the premises, and that the other  members of the cargo and security departments had been dismissed (according to FESTRASPES, all of the workers affected were members of SITEAIES and therefore their dismissal constituted a violation of the collective agreement with regard to the provisions on labour stability). There are approximately  workers at the international airport,  of whom, on  September, were members of SITEAIES.
.The complainant also contends that, at the same time, the airport",-1,2001,El Salvador
177,"administration began an intimidation campaign to attempt to force workers to withdraw from SITEAIES, and informed all those who had been suspended that their compensation cheques were available for collection or, in other words, that they had been dismissed, rather than suspended. The same applied to four trade union leaders and two members of the SITEAIES Honour and Justice Commission, who also enjoyed trade union immunity.
.The complainant asserts that, at the request of SITEAIES, an inspection was carried out by the Inspectorate of the Ministry of Labour, in which a series of violations of labour rights were found, including anti-union discrimination through the restriction of access to union premises and threats to trade union leaders. The complainants add that they requested a further inspection but that the Inspector-General of Labour refused to carry it out. They further allege that, at the same time, they lodged a complaint with the judicial authorities, with a view to achieving a ruling that the lockout was illegal. However, the civil court judge of Zacatecotuca, in an unlawful procedure, ruled that no lockout had occurred, and the Court of Appeal rejected the subsequent appeal to that decision.
.FESTRASPES also alleges that, on  October , a cordon of armed military and riot police attempted to prevent the regular general meeting of SITEAIES from taking place; the union, in accordance with the collective agreement in force, had informed the airport administration that the meeting would take place in the landscaped area, away from the central area of airport activity. Eventually, the union held its meeting on a private lot of land, at the side of the road.
.Lastly, the complainant states that meetings have been held between SITEAIES, FESTRASPES and the Autonomous Port Executive Commission (CEPA) in the Ministry of Labour, with a view to securing the mediation of the Ministry in the dispute, but that the parties have yet to reach an agreement. The complainant contends that during the dispute, threats have been made to trade union leaders and, at the time the complaint was presented,  members of SITEAIES had been dismissed, more than  workers had received compensation and more than  were refusing to give in, without having been paid throughout the whole period, thereby placing themselves and their families in a very vulnerable situation; furthermore,  members of SITEAIES, having held on to their jobs, have taken steps to resign from the union as a result of pressure from the administration.
.In its communications of  and  January and  and  February , the Workers' Union of the National Institute for Public Employees' Pensions (SITINPEP) alleges that on  December , a total of  workers,  of whom were members of the union, were dismissed from the National Institute for Public Employees' Pensions (INPEP). Of the  members of the union, three were federal leaders enjoying trade union immunity, and  were members of the Honour and Justice and Finance Commissions, the Family Sustenance Committee, the Labour Relations Committee, the Women s Affairs Committee or the Department Union Representatives Committee.
.SITINPEP describes how the dismissal notice reads as follows: ""You are hereby informed that, in accordance with administrative and financial measures, within the legal framework of INPEP s new role pursuant to the law concerning the pension savings system, having regard to government staff-reduction policies for this institution, your post of employment has been terminated, as from  December , as part of the administrative cost-reduction plan adopted by the board of governors in resolution No. / at the meeting of  December . You are therefore invited to collect your compensation cheque from the counter at the San Miguelito branch of Cuscatln bank, from  January ."" The complainant adds that, while the advice of the Human Rights Procurator was to attempt to engage in dialogue with government officials, this turned out to be impossible, owing to the failure to make contact with the officials responsible for the dismissals.
.Lastly, SITINPEP alleges that the authorities violated the collective labour agreement in force, particularly with regard to the following clauses: No. , concerning ""trade union representatives"", which guarantees the immunity of union representatives; No. , concerning the ""creation and abolition of posts"", which stipulates that no post of employment may be abolished without prior notice from the INPEP Labour Relations Committee, and a consensus being reached between the parties, rendering null and void any such measure that does not respect the agreed conditions; No. , concerning ""meetings with the administration of INPEP"", which provides for meetings to be held to address problems requiring urgent attention -- a measure that has not been taken in the present case; No. , concerning ""name, object, purpose and domicile"", which stipulates that the trade union must be informed of any changes to the institution, without prejudice to any of the rights and obligations of the parties to the agreement; No. , concerning ""special rights for trade union leaders"", which grants union leaders the right to enter INPEP premises outside working hours, on non-working days and public holidays; No. , concerning the ""right to a hearing regarding the motive for dismissal"", which stipulates that every worker has the right to be heard; and No. , concerning ""voluntary or involuntary retirement payments"", which stipulates that the Labour Relations Committee or the competent judge shall decide whether or not a dismissal is justified.
.In its communication dated  February , the Government refers to the complaint presented by the trade union SITINPEP, concerning the dismissal, through notification from the INPEP employers, of a group of workers on  December , including three trade union leaders who were currently enjoying a year of union immunity. The Government states that the public pension system was created in , with a view to providing civil servants with the means to retire comfortably from working life and to offer protection to their families, through the pension scheme administered by the National Institute for Public Employees. The law concerning the pension savings system for private, public and municipal workers entered into force in , which persuaded  per cent of contributors to switch to the new pension system. This caused a dramatic reduction in revenue for social security, which has led to a reliance on the ""technical reserve"" since . In view of this situation, as well as the possible issuance of a decree on the retirement of public servants, which would lead to an even greater reduction in social security revenue and an increase in the expense of pension payments, the board of governors decided to carry out a study with a view to establishing a new organizational structure, designed to make the Institute sustainable in the light of INPEP s new role, and in accordance with the law concerning the pension system for private, public and municipal workers.
.The Government further points out that the new organizational structure of INPEP, designed to adapt to its new role and financial situation, made it essential to abolish superfluous posts. Thus, on  December , a note was sent out to each one of the persons affected, informing them that, from  December, they would be made redundant and that they would be entitled to compensation according to the terms of the collective labour agreement between the National Institute for Public Employees' Pensions and the Workers' Union of the National Institute for Public Employees' Pensions, a measure which was taken in due course.
.According to the Government, three federal trade union leaders during their year of union immunity were part of the group of workers made redundant, but at no time did they make their status known in the course of labour relations with the Institute; nevertheless, the Institute subsequently paid them, in addition to their compensation entitlement, lost wages for the remainder of the period of their union immunity, on the basis of a written agreement dated  January , signed at the Ministry of Labour and Social Security by Mr. Roger Hernn Gutirrez and Mr. Elas Misael Cceres Lpez, on behalf of the Federation of Independent Trade Unions and Associations of El Salvador (FEASIES) and representing the workers and union leaders Mr. Jos Antonio Menjivar Crespn, Ms. Clelia Evelyn Velsquez de Corvera and Ms. Marta Guadalupe Zaldaa, and by Ms. Mercedes Guadalupe Payes Valdez, on behalf of INPEP. The amounts paid, corresponding to compensation and wages lost owing to the action of the employers, are as follows: () Jos Antonio Menjivar Crespn $,.; () Clelia Evelyn Velsquez de Corvera $,.; () Marta Guadalupe Zaldaa $,.. The Government adds that once the trade union leaders received these sums, their working relationship with INPEP was deemed terminated.
.Lastly, the Government maintains that at no time have trade union rights been violated in respect of officials of the Workers' Union of the National Institute for Public Employees' Pensions, since those concerned continue to work at the Institute as usual and maintain good labour relations with their employer.
.As regards the alleged dispute at the El Salvador International Airport, in a long communication",0,2001,El Salvador
178,"of  May , the Government states that: () following the work interruption in the airport s cargo and maintenance areas on ,  and  September , the contracts of  workers have been suspended; ()  of these workers have opted for the ""voluntary retirement"" provided for in the collective agreement, and the remaining  workers concluded an agreement with the General Directorate of Labour, which put an end to the labour dispute (the Government attaches a copy of the settlement); () the SITEAIES also undertook to withdraw all claims that would be outstanding with any official institution (according to the Government, this commitment is included in the complaint submitted to the Committee).
.The Committee observes that in this case the complainants' allegations concern () various acts of anti-union discrimination at El Salvador International Airport (the dismissal of  unionized workers, persecution and threats against leaders and members of the trade union SITEAIES, and the impossibility of gaining access to union premises as a result of the airport s militarization), and () the dismissal of  workers (of whom  were members of the trade union SITINPEP, three were covered by trade union immunity and  occupied posts in various union committees and commissions) from the National Institute for Public Employees' Pensions (INPEP), violating the terms of the collective agreement in force.
.With regard to the alleged dismissal of  workers (three of whom were union leaders and many of whom were unionists and members of SITINPEP) from the National Institute for Public Employees' Pensions (INPEP), violating the terms of the collective agreement in force, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, () the new organizational structure of INPEP, designed to adapt to its new role and financial situation, made it essential to abolish superfluous posts and thus, on  December , the persons concerned were informed of their dismissal and granted compensation in accordance with the terms of the collective agreement; () on the basis of an agreement dated  January , signed at the Ministry of Labour and Social Security between representatives of the Federation of Independent Trade Unions and Associations of El Salvador, the union leaders affected and INPEP, payments were made, corresponding to compensation and lost wages for the remainder of the period of union immunity, to the three dismissed federal trade union leaders; and () at no time were trade union rights violated in respect of SITINPEP officials, who continue to work at the Institute as usual and maintain good labour relations with their employer.
.Firstly, with regard to the financial situation at INPEP that created the need for staff reductions, the Committee has indicated on previous occasions that ""it can examine allegations concerning economic rationalization programmes and restructuring processes, whether or not they imply redundancies or the transfer of enterprises or services from the public to the private sector, only in so far as they might have given rise to acts of discrimination or interference against trade unions. In any case, the Committee can only regret that in the rationalization and staff-reduction process, the Government did not consult or try to reach an agreement with the trade union organizations"" [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. ]. Furthermore, ""in cases of staff reductions, the Committee has drawn attention to the principle contained in the Workers' Representatives Recommendation,  (No. ), which mentions amongst the measures to be taken to ensure effective protection to these workers, that recognition of a priority should be given to workers' representatives with regard to their retention in employment in case of reduction of the workforce (article ()(f))"" [see Digest, op. cit., para. ].
.The Committee observes that the Government has not denied that over half of the workers dismissed ( out of a total of ) were members of SITINPEP, and that  of them were workers' representatives in various commissions and committees. In this context, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures urgently to ensure that an investigation is carried out to determine the reasons why such a high proportion of unionists were dismissed and, if it transpires that any of these dismissals were due to the worker s trade union membership or legitimate union activities, that it takes the necessary measures urgently to ensure the reinstatement of those workers in their jobs without loss of pay. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard as a matter of urgency.
.The Committee further notes that the Government has not referred to the alleged violation of the collective contract in force at INPEP (specifically the clauses relating to the non-abolition of posts without prior notice from the INPEP Labour Relations Committee, the right to a hearing regarding the motive for dismissal, etc.). In this context, the Committee underlines ""that mutual respect for the commitment undertaken in the collective agreements is an important element of the right to bargain collectively and should be upheld in order to establish labour relations on stable and firm ground"" [see th Report, Case No. , Spain, para. ] and that ""agreements should be binding on the parties"" [see Digest, op. cit, para. ]. Under these circumstances, the Committee regrets that the terms of the collective agreement have not been respected and requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that, in future, INPEP fully respects the terms of the collective agreements in force and, if it considers staff reductions to be necessary, that it holds in-depth consultations on the matter with the corresponding trade union organization.
.Lastly, concerning the allegations of anti-union discrimination acts at El Salvador International Airport (the dismissal of  unionized workers, persecution and threats against leaders and members of the trade union SITEAIES and the impossibility of gaining access to union premises as a result of the airport s militarization), the Committee notes that, according to the Government: () following the work interruption in the airport s cargo and maintenance areas on ,  and  September , the contracts of  workers have been suspended; ()  of these workers have opted for the ""voluntary retirement"" provided for in the collective agreement, and the remaining  workers concluded an agreement with the General Directorate of Labour, which put an end to the labour dispute (the Government attaches a copy of the settlement); () the SITEAIES also undertook to withdraw all claims that would be outstanding with any official institution (according to the Government, this commitment is included in the complaint submitted to the Committee).
.Finally, as concerns the allegations of the militarization of the El Salvador International Airport, the Committee requests the Government to take measures to carry out an investigation to determine the reasons for the militarization and the extent to which it interfered with trade union activities. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed urgently of the outcome of this investigation.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that, in future, the National Institute for Public Employees' Pensions (INPEP) fully respects the terms of the collective agreements in force and, if it considers staff reductions to be necessary, that it holds in-depth consultations on the matter with the corresponding trade union organization.(b) The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures urgently to ensure that an investigation is carried out to determine the reasons why such a high proportion of unionists and workers' representatives were dismissed and, if it transpires that any of these dismissals were due to trade union membership or legitimate union activities, that it takes the necessary measures to ensure the reinstatement of those workers in their jobs, without loss of pay. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard as a matter of urgency.(c) As concerns the allegation of the militarization of the El Salvador International Airport on  and  September , the Committee requests the Government to take measures to carry out an investigation to determine the reasons for this militarization and the extent to which it interfered with trade union activities and to keep it informed urgently of the outcome of this investigation.",-1,2001,El Salvador
179,".At its November  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendations in Cases Nos.  and  [see th Report, para. ]:The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to amend the legislation on the following points in order to bring it into conformity with freedom of association principles: the reform of the Labour Code provisions setting out excessive formalities for recognition of trade unions and acquisition of legal personality contrary to the principle of free establishment of trade union organizations (requirement that trade unions of independent institutions should be works unions), that made it difficult to set up a trade union (minimum number of  workers to establish a works union) or that in any case made it temporarily impossible to establish a trade union (requirement to wait for six months before applying for recognition of a new trade union when a first request is rejected), and measures taken to amend the national legislation so that it would recognize the right of association of state workers, with the sole possible exception of the armed forces and police, in conformity with freedom of association principles. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.At its November  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendations in Case No.  [see th Report, para. ]:' The Committee strongly urges the Government as a matter of urgency to ensure that the national legislation of El Salvador is amended so that it recognizes the right of association of workers employed in the service of the State, with the sole possible exception of the armed forces and the police.' The Committee expects that the trade union ATRAMEC will be recognized as soon as possible, as it was established since  March .' The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to amend the legislation on the points mentioned in its conclusions, so as to bring it into conformity with the principles of freedom of association. It requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.' The Committee draws the Government s attention to the availability of the technical assistance of the Office in this respect should it so desire.
.In its communication of  January , the Government reiterates the contents of its previous communications in Cases Nos. ,  and , where it had mentioned that its legislation had been amended in  with the ILO s technical assistance and that it contained several improvements (which the Government elaborates upon) as regards trade union rights, which have been recognized by the Regional Office for Latin America and the Caribbean. The Constitution and the Labour Code (which, according to the Regional Office, contains numerous improvements) recognize freedom of association rights for workers and employers in the private sector and for the workers of autonomous official institutions, and give state workers the right to establish associations; these are the result of sovereign decisions, in conformity with society expectations. The governmental plan called  New Alliance' elaborates a strategy linking the legal framework to the requirements of the national and international labour markets. Finally, as the Constitution and the Labour Code give freedom of association rights only to private sector workers and employers and to workers of autonomous official institutions, it is not legally possible to grant legal personality to the self-proclaimed Trade Union of Workers of the Ministry of Education (ATRAMEC).
.The Committee notes this information and regrets that the Government s position did not change as regards both the necessity to amend the legislation to bring it into full conformity with freedom of association principles, and the legal recognition of ATRAMEC. The Committee emphasizes that the fact that the legislation amended in  contains improvements does not mean that there is no problem left to solve. Accordingly, the Committee reiterates its previous recommendations and requests the Government to re-examine its position as regards both the trade union legislation and ATRAMEC. The Committee recalls once again to the Government that it may avail itself of the ILO s technical assistance.
.At its May-June  meeting, the Committee requested the Government to keep it informed of the results of the request of registration presented by the Trade Union Federation of Salvadorian Workers of the Food, Beverage, Restaurants, Hotels and Food Sectors (FESTSSABHRA) and hoped that this federation would rapidly be granted legal personality. It also requested the Government to take the necessary measures to amend the legislation on various points [see th Report, paras. -].
.In a communication dated  June , the FESTSSABHRA states that after having given up its previous name, FESTSA, it once again requested registration of legal personality.
.In a communication dated  July , the Government states that on  May  the FESTSSABHRA submitted to the General Labour Directorate the documentation relating to its establishment in order to obtain legal personality. The following were involved in establishing this federation: the Trade Union of the Lido Enterprise Ltd., the Confectionary Workers' Industrial Trade Union, the Workers' Trade Union of the Foremost Dairy Products Enterprises Ltd., the Workers' Trade Union of Nestl Ltd., El Salvador, and the Workers' Trade Union of Salinitas Club Ltd. On  July , the Secretariat of Labour and Social Protection approved the constitution of the federation and ordered that it be published in the Official Bulletin along with the resolution granting legal personality.
.The Committee is pleased to note that the FESTSSABHRA has been granted legal personality. However, the Committee notes that the Government has sent no new information with regard to the changes to trade union legislation on the points mentioned in previous examinations of the case. The Committee therefore repeats its previous recommendations and requests the Government to take the necessary measures to amend the legislation on the following points in order to bring it into conformity with freedom of association principles: the reform of the Labour Code provisions setting out excessive formalities for recognition of trade unions and acquisition of legal personality contrary to the principle of free establishment of trade union organizations (requirement that trade unions of independent institutions should be works unions), that made it difficult to set up a trade union (minimum number of  workers to establish a works union) or that in any case made it temporarily impossible to establish a trade union (requirement to wait for six months before applying for recognition of a new trade union when a first request is rejected), and measures taken to amend the national legislation so that it would recognize the right of association of state workers, with the sole possible exception of the armed forces and police, in conformity with freedom of association principles. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.When it last examined this case, the Committee requested the Government to keep it informed on the following points: () the reform of the Labour Code provisions setting out excessive formalities for recognition of trade unions and acquisition of legal personality, contrary to the principle of free establishment of trade union organizations (requirement that trade unions of independent institutions should be works unions), that make it difficult to set up a trade union (minimum number of  workers to establish a works union) or that make it temporarily impossible to establish a trade union (requirement to wait for six months before applying for recognition of a new trade union when a first request is rejected); () any initiative taken by the complainant FESTSA to obtain legal personality and; () of measures taken to amend the national legislation, so that it would recognize the right of association of state workers, with the sole possible exception of the armed forces and police, in conformity with freedom of association principles [th Report, paras. ?].
.In a communication of  May , the Government states that, as already mentioned in its communication of  January  and reflected in the th Report of the Committee, the legal framework will be adapted, taking into account the requirements of national and international labour markets. As regards the request on initiatives taken by FESTSA to obtain legal personality, the Government points out that, since its legal personality was refused for the reasons already indicated, FESTSA has not to this day taken any steps in this respect with the Secretariat of Labour and Social Protection.
.In a communication of  May , the General Secretary of the Trade Union Federation of Salvadorian Workers of the Food, Beverage, Restaurants, Hotels and Food Sectors (FESTSABRHA), formerly FESTSA, requested its registration with the Ministry of Labour; this organization regroups five trade unions.
.The Committee takes note of this information. As regards the reform of the Labour Code provisions concerning the recognition of the trade union rights of state workers, the Committee regrets that the Government merely reiterates its previous comments on this issue. Taking into account the importance of the right to establish and register trade unions for these workers, such prohibition being incompatible with the generally accepted principle that all workers, without distinction, should have the right to",-1,2000,El Salvador
180,"establish trade unions of their own choosing [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. ], the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to amend the legislation on the points mentioned above, so as to bring it into conformity with freedom of association principles. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect. Finally, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the results of the request of registration presented by FESTSABRHA; it hopes that this federation will be rapidly granted legal personality.
.In its previous examination of Case No. , the Committee requested the Government to keep it informed with regard to the reform of the Labour Code (requested by the Committee in its th Report) with regard to the following points: the excessive formalities for the recognition of a trade union and the acquisition of legal personality that were contrary to the principle of the free establishment of trade union organization (the requirement that the trade unions of independent institutions should be works unions), that made it difficult to set up a trade union (minimum number of  workers to establish a works union) or that in any case made it temporarily impossible to establish a trade union (the requirement for six months to have passed before applying to establish another trade union even if the previous one did not obtain legal personality) [see th Report, paras.  and ].
.In its previous examination of Case No. , the Committee requested the Government to keep it informed of any initiative by FESTSA to obtain legal personality. It also, once again, requested the Government to ensure that national legislation was amended so that it recognized the right of association of workers employed in the service of the State, with the sole possible exception of the armed forces and the police [see th Report, para. ].
.In a communication dated  January , the Government states that the Constitution of the Republic recognizes freedom of association and lists the various rights laid down in the legislation. The Government adds that public employees can meet in associative groups that conform to the civil laws of the country and that do not correspond to the organizational forms and practices of workers' associations but that these groups must conform to the sovereign decisions and requirements of the country as laid down in the reforms to the Constitution of the Republic proclaimed by the Constituent Legislative Assembly in  and to the Labour Code in . These reforms were agreed upon on a tripartite basis at the national forum for consultation, resulting from the peace agreements, and with technical assistance support from the ILO. The Government indicates that the ILO itself refers to the reforms of the Labour Code of  in a document published by the ILO Regional Office for Latin America and the Caribbean, which states that regarding collective labour relations in El Salvador, the new law represented a very advanced text in relation to the other texts in force in Latin America in the past ten years. The Government plan, Alliance for Labour, envisages a strategic line towards the adaptation of the legal framework to conform to the requirements of the national and international labour market.
.The Committee hopes that the adaptation of the legal framework to which the Government refers will take place in the near future and will include all the reforms requested by the Committee. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect and points out that some of the points calling for reform, for example the need to guarantee the right of association for public employees, are in fact serious violations of that freedom. Finally, the Committee notes that the Government has not provided information on any steps that the trade union organization FESTSA may have taken to obtain legal personality and requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.The Committee examined this case at its November  meeting [see rd Report, paras. ?]. On that occasion the Committee requested the Government to keep it informed of any follow-up to the renewed application by FESTSA to obtain legal personality (as the request contained procedural errors). The Committee also urged the Government, as a matter of urgency, to ensure that national legislation was amended so that it recognized the right of association of workers employed in the service of the State, with the sole possible exception of the armed forces and the police [see rd Report, para. ].
.In a communication dated  September , the Government explains in detail and reiterates its statements that FESTSA did not comply with the legal requirements to obtain legal personality. The Government s observations imply that FESTSA has not made further attempts to obtain legal personality.
.The Committee takes note of this information. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any initiative by FESTSA to obtain legal personality. It also, once again, requests the Government to ensure that national legislation is amended so that it recognizes the right of association of workers employed in the service of the State, with the sole possible exception of the armed forces and the police.
.The complaints in this case are contained in communications dated  May  from the Trade Union Federation of Food Sector and Allied Workers (FESTSA), the Ministry of Education Workers' Union (ATRAMEC) and the Company Union of Workers of Doall Enterprises S.A. (SETDESA).
.El Salvador has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  May  the Trade Union Federation of Food Sector and Allied Workers (FESTSA) stated that on  March of the same year, it held its constituent meeting with the participation of representatives of the following unions: the Company Union of Workers of Nestl El Salvador S.A. (SETNESSA); the Company Union of Lido S.A. (SELSA); the Trade Union of Workers of the Dairy Companies Foremost S.A. (SITREFOSA); the Industrial Trade Union of Sweets and Food Pastes (SIDPA); and the Company Union of Workers of the Agency El Carmen S.A. (SETAELCA). On  March , the Federation initiated formal proceedings to acquire legal personality, and to that end supplied a copy of its founding instrument and two copies of its by-laws, as well as a number of other documents which the competent authorities had requested, although this was not legally necessary. Despite this, the registration authority of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security informed FESTSA that it would not approve the by-laws or grant legal personality because of procedural errors, although the authorities could have overlooked these.
.In a communication of  May , the Ministry of Education Workers' Union (ATRAMEC) alleges that since  it has been trying to acquire legal personality from the Ministry of Labour and that on  March  it established itself as a trade union in accordance with the procedure laid down in the Labour Code. On  April, it submitted the documents required by the Ministry for granting legal personality. Despite this, the Ministry informed the union officially on  May that the application was refused because, according to article  of the Constitution, only private workers and employers or those employed by autonomous institutions - i.e. not state employees, such as the persons listed as the constituent members of the trade union in this case - had the right to establish trade unions.
.In a communication of  May , the Company Union of Workers of Doall Enterprises S.A. (SETDESA) alleges the dismissal by Doall Enterprises S.A. of  of its employees, an action presumably intended to prevent these employees from establishing a trade union within the company. On  November , the constituent assembly of SETDESA took place and on  November the founding instrument was deposited with the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, together with two copies of the union's by-laws as approved at its constituent assembly. Despite this, on  and  November, the company began selective dismissals of SETDESA members, members of their families, their associates and sympathizers. In order to obtain their salaries and redundancy payments, they were required to sign blank sheets (which were subsequently used as resignation letters). The workers in question received their wages on the th of the month, not the rd when they were actually dismissed. On  December  the Ministry of Labour asked Doall Enterprises S.A. whether it employed the SETDESA members. The company responded by presenting the employees' letters of resignation.
.However, under the terms of article  of the Labour Code, ""members of trade union executive bodies that have or are in the process of acquiring legal personality may not be dismissed, except for valid reasons that have been confirmed by the competent authority"". Under article () of the Labour Code, ""from the date on which the founding instrument is deposited with the competent authority",-1,2000,El Salvador
181,"and until sixty days after the union in question is registered, the founder members, up to a maximum number of , shall enjoy the guarantees defined in section  of this Code"". In January , the Ministry of Labour decided in the light of the workers' resignations that they had no connection with the company and thus did not meet the minimum conditions needed to establish a company union; the workers appealed against this decision. In the meantime, the complainants had requested help from the Independent Monitoring Group of El Salvador (GMIES), the final instance of appeal, in establishing whether or not the founders of SETDESA had been the victims of arbitrary acts. On  January , the Group concluded that there had de facto been repeated violations of labour and trade union rights in that the company had illegally terminated the employment of  workers between  September and  December . Fifty-six of these individuals had ceased to work between  November and  December, one on  September and another on  November. Only one had been reinstated. Of the workers who had been dismissed,  were founders and officials of SETDESA. The GMIES also concluded that the company had coerced the workers into signing blank sheets (which subsequently turned out to be letters of resignation). On  December some of these workers received offers of reinstatement from Doall Enterprises S.A.
.In its reply of  July , the Government states with regard to the supposedly unjustified refusal to grant legal personality to FESTSA, that the procedure for granting legal personality to federations is the same as the one applied to trade unions and that the complainant did not meet all the criteria: under section  of the Labour Code, the participation of a federation's constituent trade unions must have been agreed by each union's general assembly; each union's representatives must be officially appointed; and those representatives must be present at the constituent meeting duly accredited and authorized. These requirements in their turn presuppose the existence of official convocations and official records, so that even if these documents are not expressly required, it is still necessary to examine them in order to establish the legality of the assemblies which authorize a union's participation in the establishment of federations. The Government adds that the authorizing notary did not comply with all the requirements of section  of the Legal Code, under the terms of which the competent official or notary responsible for drafting the official records of the constituent assembly must record the name, address and category of each organization, the number and date of the agreement conferring legal personality and the number and volume of the official bulletin in which the union's registration entry is published. The Government concludes from this that the Federation in question was not established in accordance with the relevant legal criteria and therefore refused to grant it legal personality.
.As regards the refusal to grant legal personality to ATRAMEC, the Government states that in accordance with article  of the Constitution of the Republic, private employers and workers and those in autonomous official institutions have the right to establish trade unions in accordance with section  of the Labour Code, which states that the following categories of persons, without distinction of nationality, sex, race, creed or political conviction, have the right to associate freely by forming professional associations or trade unions in defence of their common economic and social interests: (a) private employers and workers; and (b) workers employed by autonomous official institutions. Consequently, as stated clearly in the official decision of the Labour and Social Security Secretariat, the founders of the trade union in question are not entitled to establish such a union because they are public employees, a fact acknowledged by the founders themselves in the official records referred to above. The founders' application is thus not admissible, since public employees are prevented by law from establishing unions, and section  of the Labour Code clearly states that its provisions do not apply to public employees. The complaint presented by the trade union ATRAMEC, which operates only de facto, given that its by-laws have not been approved and it has no legal personality owing to the legal problems that have been described, is therefore based on arguments that are clearly refutable in legal terms (see following paragraphs).
.The Government states that under the terms of the Constitution of the Republic all private employers and workers, without distinction of nationality, sex, race or political conviction, and irrespective of the nature of their work or activities, have the right to associate freely in the defence of their respective interests by establishing professional associations or trade unions, in accordance with the principles of equality before the law (article ) and of non-discrimination (ILO Convention No. ). Employees of autonomous official institutions have the same right. If the Constitution itself states that the exercise of this right is reserved for private employers and workers, it means that workers employed in the service of the State may not exercise it. This state of affairs is justified by the fact that the State provides essential public services which must not be interrupted for any reason. Authorization to establish professional associations or trade unions of public service employees could lead to strikes, pre-empting possible examination of disputes by labour courts and tribunals (section  of the Labour Code). In other words, the existing public order could be jeopardized by trade unions which disregarded the Constitution and the Labour Code, the principle of lawful authority and the rule of law. The Labour Code does not authorize government employees to establish trade unions and the complaint should therefore not be based on this particular body of law. The Government states that, although the General Secretary elect of the Ministry of Education Workers' Union (ATRAMEC) refers to the official records of the constituent meeting, that document is not legally valid for the reasons already explained. It was therefore incorrect to lodge an appeal against a decision on the basis of the Constitution and the Labour Code, let alone to argue that the decision in question was arbitrary and illegal.
.As regards the allegations concerning Doall Enterprises S.A., the Government states that on  January , the Ministry of Labour and Social Security decided not to grant legal personality to the Company Union of Workers of Doall Enterprises S.A. because the union's founders resigned from the company at  a.m. on  November , which terminated the employment relationship and freed the company of any responsibility. The union's constituent assembly was held at  a.m. on the same day, that is, one hour after these workers had resigned from their posts. According to section () of the Labour Code, a ""company union"" is one established by workers who all work at the same enterprise; given the resignations referred to here, the union's founders, at the time when the union was established, no longer worked for the company and thus did not meet the basic condition for establishing the union; for this reason, legal personality was not granted. The decision was based on the fact that a key legal requirement for establishing a trade union had not been met; it was not an attempt to deny the right of workers to establish trade unions, since on  March  legal personality was granted to another trade union (the Company Union of Employees of Doall Enterprises) which had complied fully with all the legal requirements. On that date, the complainants and other workers at the company who were attempting to establish the union were reinstated and, if they continue to work there, will be free to establish another union, in which case, provided that the founding instrument and other documents filed comply with sections  and  of the Labour Code, the Ministry of Labour would have no objection to granting legal personality.
.As regards the refusal to grant legal personality to the Trade Union Federation of Food Sector and Allied Workers (FESTSA), which was established on  March  and comprised five trade unions, the Committee notes that according to the Government, the Federation did not comply with legal requirements (sections  and  of the Labour Code) when it was constituted; under the law, each union must have official convocations and records (for examination), and a notary or competent official must draft an official record of proceedings of the constituent assembly indicating the name, address and category of each organization involved, the number and date of the agreement granting legal personality, and the number and volume of the official bulletin in which the registration entry is published. The Committee deeply regrets that, given that the problem arose from procedural errors which could easily have been rectified, the authorities did not attempt to obtain the further documentation or information required by asking the founders of the Federation to rectify procedural anomalies found in the constituent document within a reasonable period. The Committee recalls that, although the founders",1,2000,El Salvador
182,"of a trade union should comply with the formalities prescribed by legislation, those formalities should not be of such a nature as to impair the free establishment of organizations (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. ), and requests the Government to keep it informed of any follow-up to a renewed application by FESTSA for legal personality.
.With regard to the refusal to grant legal personality to the Ministry of Education Workers' Union (ATRAMEC) in May , the Committee notes that according to the Government, the Constitution of the Republic grants the right of association to workers in the private sector and to those employed in autonomous official institutions, but not to workers employed in the service of the State (public service and government employees), since the State provides essential services which must not be interrupted for any reason. The Committee is bound to emphasize that the denial of the right of association of public service employees to establish unions is an extremely serious violation of the most elementary principles of freedom of association. Consequently, the Committee urges the Government as a matter of urgency to ensure that the national legislation of El Salvador is amended in such a way that it recognizes the right of association of public service employees, with the sole possible exception of the armed forces and the police.
.With regard to the complaint by the Company Union of Workers of Doall Enterprises S.A. (SETDESA), the Committee notes the Government's statements to the effect that: () the union of SETDESA was not granted legal personality because one hour before the foundation of the union the founders themselves had resigned in writing; () the workers who had attempted to establish the union were subsequently reinstated and may, if they so wish, establish another union; and () on  March , other workers established a different union which was granted legal personality. The Committee notes that the Government has not sent its observations on the allegations that the resignations of the SETDESA founders were the result of coercion by company representatives to sign blank sheets of paper. Under these circumstances, the Committee feels it has no choice but to conclude that the company attempted to block the establishment of SETDESA. Given that the founders were able subsequently to rejoin the company and that the Government states that they can establish another union if they so wish, the Committee will confine itself to expressing its profound regret at the anti-union acts of discrimination and interference on the part of the company and to drawing the attention of the founders of SETDESA to the fact that they may, if they so wish, make further attempts to obtain legal personality for this union.
.In the light of the foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) With regard to the refusal by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security to grant legal personality to the Trade Union Federation of Food Sector and Allied Workers (FESTSA), the Committee, while deeply regretting the fact that the authorities did not ask the founders to rectify any procedural errors within a reasonable period, requests the Government to keep it informed of any follow-up to the renewed application by FESTSA for legal personality.(b) The Committee urges the Government as a matter of urgency to ensure that national legislation is amended so that it recognizes the right of association of workers employed in the service of the State, with the sole possible exception of the armed forces and the police.",1,2000,El Salvador
183,".The complaints in this case are contained in communications from the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) dated  January,  April and  November , and in a communication from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) dated  March . The Government sent its observations in communications dated  May,  July and  September  and  January .
.El Salvador has not ratified either the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  January , the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) states that since  the Union of Workers of the Salvadoran Social Security Institute (STISSS) and the Union of Doctors and Workers of the Salvadoran Social Security Institute (SIMETRISS), of which all the doctors employed by the Salvadoran Social Security Institute (ISSS) are members, have been struggling to get the Government to improve the medical care dispensed by the social security system, with an initial dispute leading in May  to the conclusion of agreements between the Government and the doctors' union under which the latter would be given the possibility of actively participating in future policy-making for the health sector. Given the Government's passive stance and following repeated demands by employees which were ignored by the Ministry of Labour, on  November  a nationwide rotating strike was held in all of the social security health care centres with the strikers, demanding that the ISSS comply with the agreement concluded with its directorate in December , calling for a wage increase and an end to plans to privatize health services. The Third Labour Court Judge declared the strike illegal and the Director of the ISSS dismissed  employees, as well as  employees of the Supply Department, on the pretext that they had abandoned their posts (when in fact they had been shut out).
.The STISSS and SIMETRISSS members held a -day work stoppage because the Government is implementing its plan to privatize public health services by offering a concession on two hospitals in the social security system. The Government being determined to privatize the health services, the abovementioned workers were dismissed, the national police force was called into the workplace in order to intimidate employees, the Christmas bonus and the wages due for November and December  to over , workers were withheld, as well as trade union dues, and pay deductions were made for those months. Parallel to this, the complainants had recourse to collective bargaining and, as a last resort, to arbitration provided by the Ministry of Labour. The WFTU points out further that the ISSS directorate did not take account of the collective contract signed between the ISSS and SIMETRISS, which prohibits the dismissal, transfer or suspension of workers, with special protection for the members of the trade union executive, except on justified grounds, and provides that collective suspensions of workers cannot be carried out without meeting all the legal requirements for doing so.
.In its communication of  April  the WFTU stated that although the Third Labour Court had initially declared the strike illegal (pursuant to which the Director of the ISSS had carried out the abovementioned dismissals), it decided subsequently that the dismissals were lawful, although ultimately, following an appeal filed by the STISSS, the Labour Court found that this mass dismissal constituted a violation of fundamental rights and of the terms of the collective contract. Middle management coerced and intimidated the workers, threatening them with dismissal if they continued to support the strike. The Government has severely suppressed this workers' movement by applying coercive measures against the workers and the trade union members who supported them in defence of public health.
.Lastly, in its communication of  November , the WFTU states with regard to the workers dismissed arbitrarily after a legal battle waged by the STISSS, that the Civil Division of the Supreme Court of Justice ordered the ISSS to pay damages to the complainants and to comply with the labour provisions that had been violated. However, the Executive Council of the ISSS only partly executed this judgement, unilaterally agreeing that the workers could choose between reinstatement and compensation. The WFTU adds that the irresponsible attitude of the Government and ISSS authorities, who resort to delaying tactics and evasive behaviour to reach their ends, could spark off another labour dispute. For this reason, the Legislative Assembly has been requested to issue a decree to ensure that the authorities execute the court decision and pay the wages and benefits owed to the  workers affected.
.In its communication dated  March , the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) states that the doctors and workers employed by the Salvadoran Social Security Institute (ISSS) who had been on strike since the end of  were victims of government attacks. The latter declared a state of emergency in order to apply an ""alternative health plan"" under which army barracks would be used and military doctors would replace the striking workers. On  March , the deputy commissioner responsible for liaison of the National Civil Police (PNC) and representatives of the striking unions and the Office of the Human Rights Procurator held talks near the ISSS Surgical Medical Centre (San Salvador) with a view to finding a peaceful solution to the workers' public protest and avoiding unnecessary confrontations. In response to this conciliatory stand on the part of the Government, a group of the union strikers agreed to withdraw at noon on the same day from an extremely busy thoroughfare of the city of San Salvador. This did not prevent the Chief of the PNC from confirming an order for the riot squad (UMO) to clear the street, which it did at . with excessive use of force (including tear gas) affecting ISSS employees and passers-by, among others.
.Moreover, according to the complainant, the Minister of Internal Affairs announced that it envisaged revoking the legal personality of the SIMETRISSS and the STISSS, as well as that of the Medical Association. Lastly, the Director of the ISSS announced that she would not comply with the decision handed down by the First Labour Court to reinstate the dismissed workers, but that the Government would contest it before the Supreme Court of Justice, a process which could last over a year before a final decision was handed down.
.As regards the allegation of excessive use of force by the police, the Government stated in its communication dated  May  that the action of the riot squad (UMO) had been aimed at restoring public order on  March that year when the STISSS had entirely blocked an extremely busy thoroughfare in the city of San Salvador in blatant violation of citizens' right to freedom of movement. After requesting the trade union members in vain to clear the street, and exhausting the necessary means of persuasion to get them to withdraw of their own accord (including talks and warnings), the UMO had no choice but to intervene in the interest of public order, in accordance with the established procedure for dispersing demonstrators.
.In response to this police action, a complaint was filed with the courts against the Chief of the National Civil Police (PNC) for arbitrary acts against the public administration; proceedings were initiated on  March of the same year before the city's Eighth Magistrates' Court and the case was dismissed in favour of the defendant. According to the record of the proceedings attached by the Government with its reply, the prosecution maintained that at . on  March  the UMO had resorted to excessive use of force (tear gas, a water cannon and physical violence) against unarmed persons carrying out a peaceful demonstration, despite the verbal agreement reached between the trade unionists and the police to unblock the streets; at no time were the trade unionists found to be armed or to have acted violently. This repression therefore constituted a violation of the basic constitutional principles that inform the PNC's conduct as well as abuse of the security forces' discretionary powers, affecting ISSS employees and passers-by, among others. The defence asserted that the security forces had been provoked and that the accused official, who had not participated directly in the operations, had given the order to clear the streets not only after having exhausted the necessary means of persuasion, but also in the belief that he was acting correctly, given the extent of traffic disruption caused by the demonstration. Concluding that the accused had used every means of persuasion to get the demonstrators to clear the blocked thoroughfare and that he had used a reasonable amount of force, the defence requested the judge to dismiss the case in favour of the defendant. The judge did so, based on this argument, on  May .
.As regards the alleged risk that legal personality would be withdrawn from the STISSS and the SIMETRISSS unions, as well as from the city's Medical Association, the Government indicated in",1,2000,El Salvador
184,"a communication dated  July  that this allegation was unfounded. The Ministry of Internal Affairs is not the competent body to withdraw legal personality from these entities and, while it is true that at one point the Government was envisaging the possibility of applying this measure to the Medical Association, it is no less true that ultimately it discarded the idea despite the fact that it could have done so pursuant to the Act respecting associations and non-profit foundations, under which ""associations and foundations shall be dissolved by judicial decision when they are found to be engaged in illicit activities, aimed at direct profit, contrary to morality, safety and public order, or mismanagement of funds and property belonging to the entity, causing serious and irreparable damage to third parties or to the State"", and "" the Attorney-General, of his own motion or on the petition of any public authority, as well as the Ministry of Internal Affairs, shall have the capacity to institute proceedings for the dissolution of an association or foundation, should any of the grounds for their judicial dissolution occur"".
.As regards the allegation that the management of the ISSS had the intention not to comply with the court decision to reinstate the workers, the Government stated in its communication dated  September  and  January  that, after appealing the judgements handed down by the First Labour Court of San Salvador and the Civil Division of the Supreme Court of Justice, both of which ruled in favour of the STISSS, the Executive Council of the ISSS requested the STISSS to offer its employees who had been dismissed the choice between being reinstated, on the same terms under which they had been employed until  November , and not returning to their jobs in return for the compensation due under the law. The employer made this offer conditional upon their signing a suspension of the individual contract of employment by mutual agreement between the parties during the period between  November  and the date of reinstatement. The agreement was signed by the ISSS and the Human Resources and Legal Committee on behalf of the STISSS. Under these conditions,  workers opted for reinstatement and  for voluntary retirement with compensation under an out-of-court settlement with the defendant and after abandoning all of the actions brought against it. Finally, the Government indicates that: () the ISSS was not legally bound to pay the wages during the conflict since the workers had requested a special leave without pay from  November  to  August ; and () the conflict has now been resolved satisfactorily for both parties.
.As regards the mass dismissals at the ISSS at the end of  following a strike, the Committee notes that the Government indicates that: () the Executive Council of the ISSS offered the employees dismissed during this dispute the choice between reinstatement, under the same terms as those under which they were employed until  November , or not returning to work in exchange for statutory compensation, and made this offer conditional upon the dismissed employees signing a suspension of their individual contracts of employment by mutual agreement between the parties during the period between  November  and the date of reinstatement; () this agreement was signed by the ISSS and the Human Resources and Legal Committee on behalf of the STISSS; and ()  workers opted for reinstatement and  for voluntary retirement with compensation, under an out-of-court settlement with the defendant and after abandoning all the actions brought against it, which brought an end to the conflict in a satisfactory way for both parties. In these circumstances, the Committee will not continue its examination of this allegation.
.Concerning the allegation that the doctors and workers employed by the ISSS who had been on strike for several months had been the victims of government attacks and that a group of demonstrators were the victims of excessive use of force, the Committee notes that the Government indicates that:(i) the riot squad (UMO) sent to the trade union members a written request asking them to evacuate but they refused to cooperate. The UMO used every means of persuasion to get the demonstrators to leave voluntarily;(ii) the UMO thus had to intervene in order to evacuate the demonstrators, in conformity with the provisions on the maintenance of public order;(iii) following the incidents involving the National Civil Police (PNC), legal proceedings were brought against the Chief of the PNC. The case was later dismissed by the judicial authorities which concluded that he had used every means of persuasion to get the demonstrators to clear the blocked thoroughfare and that he had used a reasonable amount of force. In these conditions, the Committee will not continue its examination of this allegation.
.As regards the alleged intention of the Government to apply an alternative health plan aimed at replacing workers - doctors and workers employed by the ISSS - who had been on strike for several months by military personnel, the Committee observes that the Government did not send any comments on this allegation. Accordingly, it recalls that the employment of the armed forces or of another group of persons to perform duties which have been suspended as a result of a labour dispute can, if the strike is lawful, be justified only by the need to ensure the operation of services [  whose suspension would lead to an acute crisis. The utilization by the Government of labour drawn from outside the undertaking, with a view to replacing striking workers, entails the risk of derogation of the right to strike which may affect the free exercise of trade union rights [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, para. ]. Nonetheless, considering that the activities carried out by doctors and auxiliary medical personnel of the ISSS form part of services that are essential in the strict sense of the term, since medical care - whether that dispensed by a doctor or, for example, authorization issued by an institution to care for a patient - is a service the interruption of which could endanger the life, personal safety or health of the patients, and that the strike declared in this essential service lasted for several months, the Committee considers that the use of military personnel to perform the duties of doctors and auxiliary medical personnel of the ISSS does not violate the principles of freedom of association.
.Concerning the alleged risk that legal personality would be withdrawn from the SIMETRISSS and the STISSS unions, as well as the city's Medical Association, the Committee notes the Government's communication to the effect that this allegation is unfounded since the Ministry of Internal Affairs is not the competent body to withdraw legal personality from these entities, and while it is true that the Government envisaged the possibility of applying this measure to the Medical Association under the Act respecting associations and non-profit foundations, it ultimately discarded the idea.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.",0,2000,El Salvador
185,".At its November  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendations in Cases Nos.  and  [see th Report, para. ]:The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to amend the legislation on the following points in order to bring it into conformity with freedom of association principles: the reform of the Labour Code provisions setting out excessive formalities for recognition of trade unions and acquisition of legal personality contrary to the principle of free establishment of trade union organizations (requirement that trade unions of independent institutions should be works unions), that made it difficult to set up a trade union (minimum number of  workers to establish a works union) or that in any case made it temporarily impossible to establish a trade union (requirement to wait for six months before applying for recognition of a new trade union when a first request is rejected), and measures taken to amend the national legislation so that it would recognize the right of association of state workers, with the sole possible exception of the armed forces and police, in conformity with freedom of association principles. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.At its November  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendations in Case No.  [see th Report, para. ]:' The Committee strongly urges the Government as a matter of urgency to ensure that the national legislation of El Salvador is amended so that it recognizes the right of association of workers employed in the service of the State, with the sole possible exception of the armed forces and the police.' The Committee expects that the trade union ATRAMEC will be recognized as soon as possible, as it was established since  March .' The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to amend the legislation on the points mentioned in its conclusions, so as to bring it into conformity with the principles of freedom of association. It requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.' The Committee draws the Government s attention to the availability of the technical assistance of the Office in this respect should it so desire.
.In its communication of  January , the Government reiterates the contents of its previous communications in Cases Nos. ,  and , where it had mentioned that its legislation had been amended in  with the ILO s technical assistance and that it contained several improvements (which the Government elaborates upon) as regards trade union rights, which have been recognized by the Regional Office for Latin America and the Caribbean. The Constitution and the Labour Code (which, according to the Regional Office, contains numerous improvements) recognize freedom of association rights for workers and employers in the private sector and for the workers of autonomous official institutions, and give state workers the right to establish associations; these are the result of sovereign decisions, in conformity with society expectations. The governmental plan called  New Alliance' elaborates a strategy linking the legal framework to the requirements of the national and international labour markets. Finally, as the Constitution and the Labour Code give freedom of association rights only to private sector workers and employers and to workers of autonomous official institutions, it is not legally possible to grant legal personality to the self-proclaimed Trade Union of Workers of the Ministry of Education (ATRAMEC).
.The Committee notes this information and regrets that the Government s position did not change as regards both the necessity to amend the legislation to bring it into full conformity with freedom of association principles, and the legal recognition of ATRAMEC. The Committee emphasizes that the fact that the legislation amended in  contains improvements does not mean that there is no problem left to solve. Accordingly, the Committee reiterates its previous recommendations and requests the Government to re-examine its position as regards both the trade union legislation and ATRAMEC. The Committee recalls once again to the Government that it may avail itself of the ILO s technical assistance.
.At its May-June  meeting, the Committee requested the Government to keep it informed of the results of the request of registration presented by the Trade Union Federation of Salvadorian Workers of the Food, Beverage, Restaurants, Hotels and Food Sectors (FESTSSABHRA) and hoped that this federation would rapidly be granted legal personality. It also requested the Government to take the necessary measures to amend the legislation on various points [see th Report, paras. -].
.In a communication dated  June , the FESTSSABHRA states that after having given up its previous name, FESTSA, it once again requested registration of legal personality.
.In a communication dated  July , the Government states that on  May  the FESTSSABHRA submitted to the General Labour Directorate the documentation relating to its establishment in order to obtain legal personality. The following were involved in establishing this federation: the Trade Union of the Lido Enterprise Ltd., the Confectionary Workers' Industrial Trade Union, the Workers' Trade Union of the Foremost Dairy Products Enterprises Ltd., the Workers' Trade Union of Nestl Ltd., El Salvador, and the Workers' Trade Union of Salinitas Club Ltd. On  July , the Secretariat of Labour and Social Protection approved the constitution of the federation and ordered that it be published in the Official Bulletin along with the resolution granting legal personality.
.The Committee is pleased to note that the FESTSSABHRA has been granted legal personality. However, the Committee notes that the Government has sent no new information with regard to the changes to trade union legislation on the points mentioned in previous examinations of the case. The Committee therefore repeats its previous recommendations and requests the Government to take the necessary measures to amend the legislation on the following points in order to bring it into conformity with freedom of association principles: the reform of the Labour Code provisions setting out excessive formalities for recognition of trade unions and acquisition of legal personality contrary to the principle of free establishment of trade union organizations (requirement that trade unions of independent institutions should be works unions), that made it difficult to set up a trade union (minimum number of  workers to establish a works union) or that in any case made it temporarily impossible to establish a trade union (requirement to wait for six months before applying for recognition of a new trade union when a first request is rejected), and measures taken to amend the national legislation so that it would recognize the right of association of state workers, with the sole possible exception of the armed forces and police, in conformity with freedom of association principles. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.When it last examined this case, the Committee requested the Government to keep it informed on the following points: () the reform of the Labour Code provisions setting out excessive formalities for recognition of trade unions and acquisition of legal personality, contrary to the principle of free establishment of trade union organizations (requirement that trade unions of independent institutions should be works unions), that make it difficult to set up a trade union (minimum number of  workers to establish a works union) or that make it temporarily impossible to establish a trade union (requirement to wait for six months before applying for recognition of a new trade union when a first request is rejected); () any initiative taken by the complainant FESTSA to obtain legal personality and; () of measures taken to amend the national legislation, so that it would recognize the right of association of state workers, with the sole possible exception of the armed forces and police, in conformity with freedom of association principles [th Report, paras. ?].
.In a communication of  May , the Government states that, as already mentioned in its communication of  January  and reflected in the th Report of the Committee, the legal framework will be adapted, taking into account the requirements of national and international labour markets. As regards the request on initiatives taken by FESTSA to obtain legal personality, the Government points out that, since its legal personality was refused for the reasons already indicated, FESTSA has not to this day taken any steps in this respect with the Secretariat of Labour and Social Protection.
.In a communication of  May , the General Secretary of the Trade Union Federation of Salvadorian Workers of the Food, Beverage, Restaurants, Hotels and Food Sectors (FESTSABRHA), formerly FESTSA, requested its registration with the Ministry of Labour; this organization regroups five trade unions.
.The Committee takes note of this information. As regards the reform of the Labour Code provisions concerning the recognition of the trade union rights of state workers, the Committee regrets that the Government merely reiterates its previous comments on this issue. Taking into account the importance of the right to establish and register trade unions for these workers, such prohibition being incompatible with the generally accepted principle that all workers, without distinction, should have the right to",-1,1998,El Salvador
186,"establish trade unions of their own choosing [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. ], the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to amend the legislation on the points mentioned above, so as to bring it into conformity with freedom of association principles. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect. Finally, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the results of the request of registration presented by FESTSABRHA; it hopes that this federation will be rapidly granted legal personality.
.In its previous examination of Case No. , the Committee requested the Government to keep it informed with regard to the reform of the Labour Code (requested by the Committee in its th Report) with regard to the following points: the excessive formalities for the recognition of a trade union and the acquisition of legal personality that were contrary to the principle of the free establishment of trade union organization (the requirement that the trade unions of independent institutions should be works unions), that made it difficult to set up a trade union (minimum number of  workers to establish a works union) or that in any case made it temporarily impossible to establish a trade union (the requirement for six months to have passed before applying to establish another trade union even if the previous one did not obtain legal personality) [see th Report, paras.  and ].
.In its previous examination of Case No. , the Committee requested the Government to keep it informed of any initiative by FESTSA to obtain legal personality. It also, once again, requested the Government to ensure that national legislation was amended so that it recognized the right of association of workers employed in the service of the State, with the sole possible exception of the armed forces and the police [see th Report, para. ].
.In a communication dated  January , the Government states that the Constitution of the Republic recognizes freedom of association and lists the various rights laid down in the legislation. The Government adds that public employees can meet in associative groups that conform to the civil laws of the country and that do not correspond to the organizational forms and practices of workers' associations but that these groups must conform to the sovereign decisions and requirements of the country as laid down in the reforms to the Constitution of the Republic proclaimed by the Constituent Legislative Assembly in  and to the Labour Code in . These reforms were agreed upon on a tripartite basis at the national forum for consultation, resulting from the peace agreements, and with technical assistance support from the ILO. The Government indicates that the ILO itself refers to the reforms of the Labour Code of  in a document published by the ILO Regional Office for Latin America and the Caribbean, which states that regarding collective labour relations in El Salvador, the new law represented a very advanced text in relation to the other texts in force in Latin America in the past ten years. The Government plan, Alliance for Labour, envisages a strategic line towards the adaptation of the legal framework to conform to the requirements of the national and international labour market.
.The Committee hopes that the adaptation of the legal framework to which the Government refers will take place in the near future and will include all the reforms requested by the Committee. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect and points out that some of the points calling for reform, for example the need to guarantee the right of association for public employees, are in fact serious violations of that freedom. Finally, the Committee notes that the Government has not provided information on any steps that the trade union organization FESTSA may have taken to obtain legal personality and requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.The Committee last examined this case at its June  meeting [see th Report, paras. ?] and requested the Government once again to keep it informed with regard to the reform of the Labour Code in the light of the recommendations it had made in previous examinations of the case.
.The Committee then recalled that, at its March  meeting [see th Report, para. ], it had observed that the legislation imposed a series of excessive formalities for the recognition of a trade union and the acquisition of legal personality that were contrary to the principle of the free establishment of trade union organizations (the requirement that the trade unions of independent institutions should be works unions), that made it difficult to set up a trade union (minimum number of  workers to establish a works union) or that in any case made it temporarily impossible to establish a trade union (the requirement for six months to have passed before applying to establish another trade union even if the previous one did not obtain legal personality).
.In its communication of  September , the Government refers to issues already dealt with in this case that are no longer in question and have been resolved, but it does not reply specifically to the issue of legislation.
.The Committee notes the communication and once again requests the Government to keep it informed with regard to the reform of the Labour Code (requested by the Committee in its th Report) in the light of the recommendations it has made in previous examinations of the case.
.The Committee last examined this case, relating to the refusal to recognize and to grant legal personality to various trade unions, at its November  meeting [see rd Report, paras. -]. On that occasion the Committee requested the Government to keep it informed with regard to the process of reform of the Labour Code and expressed the hope that full account would be taken of its recommendations in that process.
.In a communication of  February , the Government informs the Committee that on  October  the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare of El Salvador, in accordance with a decision handed down by the administrative litigation division of the Honourable Supreme Court of Justice, decided to grant legal personality to the Trade Union of the El Salvador Telecommunications Company (SUTTEL), whose credentials were issued on  November  as the trade union elected its General Executive Committee on  October , which will exercise its functions until  May .
.The Government stresses that if the Ministry of Labour has not encouraged negotiations between the employer and the trade union it is because the Labour Code establishes that in order for an employer to be obliged to recognize a trade union as representative of workers' interests for the purposes of negotiation and collective bargaining, that trade union must represent the majority of the enterprise s workers, which is not the case. The Government adds that in the company in question, there is already a trade union organization with legal personality granted by the Secretary of State, called the Trade Union of the El Salvador Telecommunications Enterprise (SUTTEL). The complainant organization later informed the ILO that the company formally committed itself, under an agreement, to bargain with the SUTTEL.
.The Committee notes this information, and once again requests the Government to keep it informed with regard to the reform of the Labour Code in the light of the recommendations it has made in previous examinations of the case.
.At its March  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendations:(a) Observing that legislation imposes a series of excessive formalities for the recognition of a trade union and the acquisition of legal personality that are contrary to the principle of the free establishment of trade union organizations (the requirement that the trade unions of independent institutions should be works unions), that make it difficult to set up a trade union (minimum number of  workers to establish a works union) or that in any case make it temporarily impossible to establish a trade union (the requirement for six months to have passed before applying to establish another trade union even if the previous one did not obtain legal personality), the Committee:-- concludes that the legislation seriously infringes the principles of freedom of association;-- regrets that in applying this legislation the authorities have refused legal personality to a number of trade unions in the process of being set up in the ANTEL enterprise and in the Telecommunications Company of El Salvador SA de C.V.; and-- regrets that the application for recognition and registration made by SITTEL in August  has not been dealt with and is still pending. The Committee requests the Government to accelerate the procedure and register the union;-- urges the Government to take measures with a view to amending the legislation so that the current excessive formalities that apply to the establishment of trade union organizations are removed and so that workers do not have to constitute enterprise-based works unions if they do not consider",-1,1998,El Salvador
187,"this to be appropriate.(b) The Committee requests the Government to take steps with a view to reinstating the trade unions leaders Mr. Luis Wilfredo Berrios and Mrs. Gloria Mercedes Gonzlez in their posts and to guarantee that in future proprietorial changes that occur in the framework of privatization do not directly or indirectly threaten unionized workers and their organizations.(See th Report, para. .).In its communication dated  October , Communications International (CI) pointed out that the Government has not taken any steps to reinstate the trade union leaders Luis Wilfredo Berrios and Gloria Mercedes Gonzlez in their posts, nor to guarantee recognition of the unions, nor to amend the legislation along the lines of the Committee's recommendations.
.In its communication dated  October , Communications International (CI) pointed out that the Government has not taken any steps to reinstate the trade union leaders Luis Wilfredo Berrios and Gloria Mercedes Gonzlez in their posts, nor to guarantee recognition of the unions, nor to amend the legislation along the lines of the Committee's recommendations.
.In its communications dated ,  and  October , the Government stated, in respect of the provisions which the Committee had recommended amending, that the constitutional requirements and those concerning the acquisition of legal personality of a trade union were set forth by the National Coordinating Forum, a tripartite body, which had been assisted by an ILO technical mission. The previous legislation has been improved and, according to the information provided in a document published by the International Labour Office which covers El Salvador, the text is in an advanced stage. There is therefore no basis for considering that the legislation seriously violates the principles of freedom of association.
.The Government adds that legal personality was granted to the Works Union of Telecommunications Employees of El Salvador (SITTEL) on  October .
.As concerns the reinstatement of Luis Wilfredo Berrios and Gloria Mercedes Gonzlez, the Government states that it cannot interfere with the decisions of the Telecommunications Company of El Salvador SA, which is a private enterprise regulated by its own social rules (the Government appended a letter from the enterprise indicating that the dismissed persons had not fulfilled international standards of productivity, nor did they meet the minimum requirements concerning efficient service and quality).
.The Committee notes the information provided by the Government, in particular concerning the granting of legal personality to the SITTEL union. As concerns the Government's statement that it is unfounded to say that the legislation seriously violates the principles of freedom of association, the Committee emphasizes that its conclusions had referred only to three aspects of the legislation. Moreover, the fact that the legislation is currently being elaborated within a tripartite forum and that ILO technical assistance has been provided does not necessarily signify that every single provision adopted is in conformity with the principles of freedom of association. The Committee therefore reiterates its previous recommendations concerning the need to amend the legislation. As concerns the Committee's recommendation to the Government to take steps with a view to the reinstatement in their posts of the abovementioned trade union leaders, the Committee notes the Government's statement that it cannot interfere with the decisions of a private enterprise. In this respect, the Committee draws the Government's attention to the principle according to which, where cases of alleged anti-union discrimination are involved, the competent authorities dealing with labour issues should begin an inquiry immediately and take suitable measures to remedy any effects of anti-union discrimination brought to their attention (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. ). The Committee thus once again requests the Government to take steps with a view to reinstating the trade union leaders Luis Wilfredo Berrios and Gloria Mercedes Gonzlez in their posts.
.This complaint is contained in a communication from Communications International dated  August .
.The Government sent its comments in communications dated  November and  December .
.El Salvador has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  August , Communications International (CI) states that the Salvadoran Association of Workers of the National Telecommunications Administration, ANTEL (ASTA) is one of its affiliated organizations and has requested it to present a complaint against the Government of El Salvador for the violation of trade union rights.
.The CI explains that on  August , the ASTA-ASTTEL trade unions requested the authorities of the Ministry of Labour to recognize the legal existence of the National Union of Telecommunications and Related Unions (ATANTEL) and that on  September of the same year the Ministry of Labour refused to recognize ATANTEL contending that the National Telecommunications Administration (ANTEL) was an independent public institution and that it was illegal to recognize trade unions that were not enterprise-based. The members of ATANTEL lodged an application for reconsideration before the same ministry, which was in turn rejected. In September/October  amendments were made to the bill for the privatization of ANTEL. This delayed decisions on ATANTEL's new requests for legal recognition. During this period, Communications International and its affiliates in the region sent various messages of solidarity to the authorities of El Salvador in support of the telecommunications' workers and their right to organize.
.According to the CI, on  December  the winding up of ANTEL began and all its workers were paid and dismissed, then later contracted by the new enterprise, Telecommunications Company of El Salvador (CTE S.A. de C.V.). However, on  January ,  workers were dismissed, all of whom were leaders or former leaders of the ASTA-ASTTEL, ATTES and SINTEL trade unions. The enterprise stated that these workers were opposed to the privatization process. It justified the dismissals by claiming that the workers in question were not working efficiently, given that they spent their time on other activities which were incompatible with the enterprise's new functions (i.e. trade union activities). The complainant organization adds that a group of workers from the ASTA-ASTTEL unions convened a meeting to establish a trade union within the enterprise. The National Telecommunications Administration (ANTEL) was dissolved and wound up in accordance with Decree No. , as amended. All its assets and liabilities were transferred to the Telecommunications Company of El Salvador, a limited liability company (CTE S.A. de C.V.) and to Telecommunications International, also a limited liability company (INTEL S.A. de C.V.). On  February , the Ministry of Labour rejected the request for legal recognition made by the ASTA-ASTTEL workers. Consequently, on  February ,  workers held a meeting and approved the establishment of a trade union called ASTTEL. The new request for recognition was also rejected by the Ministry of Labour, which claimed that the abbreviation ASTTEL had nothing to do with the official name of the union (Works Union of Telecommunications Workers). On  May ,  workers met and approved the establishment of the Trade Union for the Unity of Workers of the Telecommunications Company of El Salvador S.A. de C.V. (SUTTEL), but on  June  the Ministry of Labour rejected the legal existence of that union, arguing that national legislation does not allow the organization of trade unions until six months have passed since a prior request for recognition.
.The CI stresses that although the workers have used all possible means provided by law, the authorities have found a variety of arguments to reject the legal existence of the trade union and states that the workers have submitted a legal claim to the Supreme Court of Justice of El Salvador.
.In the view of the CI, the behaviour of the Ministry of Labour of El Salvador in this case -- and possibly also the relevant legal provisions -- are incompatible with the right of workers to establish organizations of their own choosing, without prior authorization, and the dismissal of workers from the enterprise constitutes an act of anti-union discrimination.
.In its communication dated  November , the Government states that on  August  the Chairman of the provisional executive committee of the Union of Workers in Telecommunications and Related Industries (ANANTEL), requested in writing that it be granted legal personality. According to its certificate of establishment it was set up on  July  by  workers from the National Telecommunications Administration, four workers from the El Salvador Information Service Agency and two workers from the Jos Simen Caas Central American University radio station. On  September  the request to grant legal personality to this union was denied because the workers of independent public institutions -- such as the National Telecommunications Administration (ANTEL) -- can only form works unions, in accordance with clause , section  of the Labour Code, which provides that ""a works union consists of workers employed in the same enterprise, commercial establishment or independent public institution"". The application by the provisional executive committee for reconsideration of that decision was dismissed because the workers of the National Telecommunications Administration (ANTEL) were not",-1,1998,El Salvador
188,"being refused the right to set up a trade union but were simply being told that the Labour Code stipulates that they should establish themselves as a works union. In a decision dated  April  the office of the procurator for the defence of humans rights exonerated the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare from any responsibility in this matter.
.The Government indicates that section  of the Privatization Act of the National Telecommunications Administration provides as follows: ""The division of ANTEL will be carried out by transferring its assets, rights and liabilities to the following limited liability companies: Telecommunications Company of El Salvador, a limited liability company, which could use the trade name of ANTEL, and which in future will be abbreviated to CTE S.A. de C.V.; and Telecommunications International, a limited liability company, which in future will be abbreviated to INTEL S.A. de C.V. Both enterprises will provide public telecommunications services. These companies will be considered for all legal purposes to be private companies regulated by the provisions of the above Act, the Commercial Code and other applicable national legislation. The wording of the Privatization Act uses the expression ""the companies"" for these enterprises.
.Section  of the above Act provides as follows: ""Once the procedure indicated in the two previous sections has been verified, the company CTE S.A. de C.V. will conclude employment contracts with the former workers of ANTEL, except those working at the ANTEL hospital, who will retain at least the same salaries with their new employer. If after these contracts have been concluded, any of the workers thus contracted are dismissed on any of the grounds for termination of contract with liability for the employer established in the Labour Code, the employer will pay special compensation equivalent to what the worker would otherwise have earned over  months of service. The workers providing services at the ANTEL hospital and who have not been retained by the ISSS will receive a bonus of an additional  per cent to that established in section  of this Act"".
.The Government adds that on  January  the Chairman of the provisional executive committee of the Works Union of Telecommunications Workers of El Salvador (ASTTEL) requested that legal personality be granted to this union which, according to its certificate of establishment, was founded on  January  by  workers from CTE S.A. de C.V. An inspection was carried out at CTE S.A. de C.V. to ascertain whether the founders of the union were working at  a.m. on  January . The inspection report established that: (a) the Works Union of Telecommunications Workers of El Salvador (ASTTEL) was established on the basis of a notarial certificate on the premises of the Salvadoran Association of Telecommunications Workers, with Dr. Lilian Guadrn acting as the attesting notary; (b) on the day the notarial certificate was executed ( January ), which was when CTE S.A. de C.V. began its operations, ten of the union's founders did not provide any services to CTE S.A. de C.V. and consequently the employment relationship did not come into being as they did not even turn up for work that day, therefore labour legislation is not applicable to them and they do not constitute workers; (c) a further  founders of the trade union were not present at  a.m. on  January  at the place where, according to the notarial certificate, the constituent meeting of the trade union was held. These persons categorically stated that they had signed the certificate of establishment on a different date and in a different place, not during the constituent meeting of the union, which explains why their signatures are on the certificate although they did not attend. The report also reveals other anomalies and irregularities in the certificate which clearly indicate intentional falsification; (d) five founders received the special compensation referred to in section  of the Privatization Act of the Telecommunications Administration following their dismissal on  January , as evidenced by the corresponding liquidation documents issued in accordance with the provisions of section  () of the Labour Code, and were therefore no longer employees of CTE S.A. de C.V. at the time when the certification and other documents were submitted.
.Furthermore, the notarial certificate infringed legislation in the following ways, inter alia: (a) the occupation or trade of the alleged executing parties was not recorded, in violation of section , No.  of the Notary Act; (b) instead of recording their occupation or trade, in the preamble to the certificate, under general information relating to the executing parties, the notary states that they are workers of CTE S.A. de C.V., thus infringing section , No. , which provides that ""the notary shall not put anything attributed to the appearing parties with which they have not expressly agreed"" and at no time, as seen in the document itself, did the executing parties make such a statement to the notary; (c) section , No.  was also violated, which provides that ""involuntary deletions, amendments, insertions, crossings out and any other corrections shall be noted and certified in full at the end of the instrument, in the presence of the appearing parties and above the signatures"" and in the notarial certificate in question the involuntary deletions -- of the names of both the notary and the trade union -- were not certified, which automatically renders the document invalid under the provisions of section  of the Code of Civil Procedure, which section  of the Labour Code expressly stipulates to be applicable to industrial procedures; and (d) section , No.  was also violated, which stipulates that ""the notary shall explain to the executing parties the legal effects of the certificate or contract and note that this has been done in the instrument"", yet there is no indication in the certificate that the legal effects of the instrument were explained to the executing parties and nothing was recorded to this effect; (e) the provisions of section  of the Notary Act were not fulfilled as the notary did not sign any of the sheets that comprise the notarial certificate and the stamp that should be at the top of sheet No.  is missing.
.On the basis of all the above considerations and the legal provisions cited, and given the lack of the legal quorum necessary to establish an occupational association as stipulated in section  of the Labour Code, the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare decided to ""deny the request for legal personality made by the Works Union of Telecommunications Workers of El Salvador"".
.The Government states that on  February , the Chairman of the provisional executive committee of the Works Union of Telecommunications Workers of El Salvador (ASTTEL) -- a trade union which had been established before a notary at  a.m. on  February  -- requested that the trade union be granted legal personality. On  March  a decision was handed down which stated that, according to the records, on  January  an application had been made to establish the Works Union of Telecommunications Workers of El Salvador; the granting of legal personality to that trade union was denied on the grounds listed in the decision handed down by the Ministry of Labour on  February ; on  February  an application was made to establish another trade union with the same name and address as the previous one; its request to be granted legal personality was submitted to the Ministry of Labour on  February  by a different person acting as chairman of the provisional executive committee, in violation of the provisions of section  of the Labour Code which stipulates ""a subsequent application to establish a trade union may only be made six months after the previous one"".
.In addition, this trade union was founded by  persons,  of whom had been involved in establishing the previous one; a further four were employees in positions of responsibility and one was the employers' representative of the Telecommunications Company of El Salvador S.A. de C.V. Both these circumstances, either together or individually, reduce the number of founding members to less than  persons, infringing the provisions of section  of the Labour Code which provides that ""any workers' union requires a minimum of  members to be set up and operate"".
.Therefore, for the reasons given and the legal provisions cited, the Ministry of Labour denied the request for the granting of legal personality to the Works Union of Telecommunications Workers of El Salvador.
.On  May , the Government continues, three members of the provisional executive committee of the Trade Union for the Unity of Workers of the Telecommunications Company of El Salvador (SUTTEL) requested that their trade union be granted legal personality. On  June  an administrative decision was handed down which states that under the relevant legal provisions it was not permitted to make a further application to establish the union as six months had not passed since the",1,1998,El Salvador
189,"application had been made to establish the Works Union of Telecommunications Workers of El Salvador, and neither was any reference made to the purpose of the union. For the reasons given and the legal provisions cited, the Ministry denied the granting of legal personality to SUTTEL.
.On  June  an administrative decision declared inadmissible the request made by three members of the provisional executive committee of this trade union to reconsider its request for legal personality as, according to the Code of Civil Procedure, that request should have been made on the day of or the day following the contested decision.
.Lastly, the Government states that on  September  the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the provisional executive committee of the Works Union of Telecommunications Employees of El Salvador (SITTEL), founded at  a.m. on  August , requested that the trade union be granted legal personality. This request is still pending.
.As regards the allegations concerning the dismissal of  workers on  January , all of whom were leaders or former leaders of the trade unions ASTA, ASTTEL, ATTES and SINTEL, the Government refers in its communication dated  December  to a communication from the Telecommunications Company of El Salvador, the contents of which is summarized below.
.According to the Privatization Act of the National Telecommunications Administration, the employment relationships of all the ANTEL staff ended on  December  when the assets, rights and liabilities of ANTEL were transferred to CTE S.A. de C.V. and all workers were paid the corresponding types and amounts of compensation, annual bonuses and holiday pay established in ANTEL's privatization provisions. These payments were recorded in documents where each of the compensated workers confirmed the termination of his or her employment relationship, stating that ANTEL had fully met the obligations arising from the Privatization Act of the National Telecommunications Administration, declaring it to be free from any responsibility of an industrial nature and releasing it from further obligations. Consequently, on  December  all ANTEL workers stopped work, were legally compensated and ANTEL ended its operations. The payments in question were officially investigated by the Court of Audit of the Republic, as no payment could be made that was not stipulated by law. ANTEL fully concluded its activities.
.The compensation payments made to the  persons referred to by the complainant organization amounted to a total of ,, colons and  centavos. Section  of the above-mentioned Privatization Act stipulates that ""once the procedure outlined in the previous two sections has been carried out, the company CTE S.A. de C.V. will conclude employment contracts with the former workers of ANTEL. If after concluding these contracts any of the workers thus contracted are dismissed on the grounds for termination of contract with liability for the employer set out in the Labour Code, the employer shall pay special compensation equivalent to what the worker would otherwise have earned over  months of service"". It was in keeping with this legal provision that CTE S.A. de C.V. contracted all the former workers of ANTEL in new employment relationships, entirely independent of and with no connection whatsoever to the previous one. The contracted workers included the workers mentioned by the complainant organization. Following their dismissal each of them was paid special compensation equivalent to the sum of  months' salary, except for two who did not collect their compensation, but it remains available for them. CTE S.A. de C.V. paid the  workers a total amount of ,, colons and  centavos. Each of the workers signed the corresponding confirmation of receipt on the form that the general directorate of the labour inspectorate provides for this purpose, in accordance with section  () of the Labour Code, confirming the termination of their individual contracts of employment, stating that CTE S.A. de C.V. had fully complied with the provisions of section  of the Act, each of them declaring said company to be free of any responsibility of an industrial nature. Dismissal as grounds for the termination of individual employment contracts is regulated by sections  et seq. of the Labour Code and originates from section , No.  of the Constitution of the Republic, according to which the Labour Code ""shall in particular include the following rights (...) . An employer who dismisses a worker without valid grounds is required to compensate him in accordance with the law"".
.The conclusion to be drawn from all the above is that there has been no violation of trade union rights.
.The Committee observes that in the framework of the privatization process of the National Telecommunications Administration (ANTEL) the complainant organization has alleged: () the refusal to recognize the trade union ATANTEL in September ; () the refusal to recognize another trade union set up by a group of workers from ASTA-ASTTEL on  February ; () the refusal to recognize a further trade union called ASTTEL set up on  February ; () the refusal to recognize a trade union called SUTTEL on  June  and () the dismissal of  workers, all of whom were leaders or former leaders of the trade unions ASTA-ASTTEL, ATTES and SINTEL, on  January  (the privatization process of ANTEL was completed at the end of December ) by the enterprise Telecommunications Company of El Salvador S.A. de C.V., to which the assets, rights and liabilities of the privatized enterprise (ANTEL) were transferred.
.The Committee notes that according to the Government: () the trade union ATANTEL was not recognized by the authorities because the workers of the former ANTEL did not set themselves up as a works union, which was a requirement as ANTEL was an independent public institution; of the  founders six were working in bodies other than ANTEL; () the trade union ASTTEL was not recognized because on the day it was established ten founders did not fulfil their work obligations,  did not attend the constituent meeting, five had received the special compensation provided in ANTEL's Privatization Act and had thus lost the status of employees. Furthermore, the notarial certificate contained various legislative infringements (the occupation or trade of the founders was not stated, the involuntary deletions of the names of the notary and the union were not noted down, the notary had not signed the individual sheets of the notarial certificate and the stamp was missing on one sheet); there was not the necessary quorum of workers/founders; () the trade union ASTTEL was again refused legal personality at a later date owing to the lack of the legal quorum that section  of the Code establishes, which is a minimum of  members (of the  founders,  had participated in setting up the previous trade union, four others were employees in positions of responsibility and one was an employers' representative) and furthermore because section  of the Labour Code provides that ""a subsequent application to establish a trade union may only be made six months after the previous one""; () the application to establish the trade union SUTTEL was considered to be inadmissible and the granting of its legal personality was denied because six months had not passed since the application had been made to establish the trade union ASTTEL (whose legal personality had been denied); subsequently the request by three founders of SUTTEL to reconsider this administrative decision was dismissed as inadmissible as it did not comply with the time limit. The Committee also notes that the request for legal personality submitted by the trade union SITTEL on  September  is still pending but it observes that this matter was not raised by the complainant organization.
.The Committee notes that between September  and June  the authorities refused to grant legal personality to several trade unions which tried to set themselves up within ANTEL and in one of the two companies which acquired ANTEL's rights and liabilities following its privatization (Telecommunications Company of El Salvador S.A. de C.V.). One of these trade unions was twice refused legal personality. The Committee observes that the grounds given for refusing legal personality include: trying to establish a union which did not constitute a works union (but instead included workers from various institutions) in an independent public institution where only works unions are authorized; the lack of the minimum number of members stipulated by law -- i.e. ; the legal impossibility of establishing a new trade union until six months have passed since an application was made to establish a previous one (even if it did not obtain legal personality); and non-compliance with requirements of form in the notarial certificate documenting the constituent meeting of the trade union. In the Committee's opinion, these grounds represent serious obstacles to trade union registration. In this respect, the Committee draws to the Government's attention that such requirements must not be such as to be equivalent in practice to previous authorization, or as to constitute such an obstacle to the establishment of an organization that they amount in practice to outright prohibition (see Digest of decisions",1,1998,El Salvador
190,"and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. ).
.In this respect, the Committee has considered that ""although the founders of a trade union should comply with the formalities prescribed by legislation, these formalities should not be of such a nature as to impair the free establishment of organizations"" (see Digest, op. cit., para. ). In the Committee's view, it appears in the present case that legislation imposes a series of excessive formalities for the recognition of a trade union and the acquisition of legal personality that are contrary to the principle of the free establishment of trade union organizations (the requirement that the trade unions of independent institutions should be works unions), that make it difficult to set up a trade union (minimum number of  workers to establish a works union) or that in any case make it temporarily impossible to establish a trade union (the requirement for six months to have passed before applying to establish another trade union even if the previous one did not obtain legal personality).
.In view of the above, the Committee concludes that the legislation violates the principles of freedom of association and regrets that in applying this legislation the authorities have refused legal personality to a number of trade unions in process of being set up in the ANTEL enterprise and in the Telecommunications Company of El Salvador S.A. de C.V. The Committee therefore urges the Government to take measures with a view to amending legislation so that the current excessive formalities that apply to the establishment of trade union organizations are removed and so that workers do not have to constitute enterprise-based works unions if they do not consider this to be appropriate. Lastly, as regards the trade union SITTEL, the establishment of which is still pending (according to the Government), the Committee regrets that the application for recognition and registration made by SITTEL in August  has not been dealt with and is still pending. The Committee requests the Government to accelerate the procedure and register the union.
.With respect to the allegation concerning the dismissal of  workers (all of whom were leaders of ASTA-ASTTEL, ATTES and SINTEL) on  January  (the privatization process of ANTEL was completed at the end of December ) by the Telecommunications Company of El Salvador S.A. de C.V., to which the assets, rights and liabilities of the privatized enterprise (ANTEL) were transferred, the Committee notes the Government's statements that: those concerned were paid the corresponding compensation and benefits, these persons accepted them and confirmed in writing the termination of their employment relationship on  December ; subsequently, in accordance with the Privatization Act they were contracted by the new enterprise and dismissed on  January  on the grounds for termination of contract with liability for the employer established in the Labour Code, as provided in the Privatization Act, which stipulated further compensation for such an eventuality (in the case in point this was accepted by  of the  workers, who declared the enterprise to be free of any responsibility); the workers who did not accept the compensation were Mr. Luis Wilfredo Berrios and Mrs. Gloria Mercedes Gonzlez. In this connection, the Committee observes that the Government has not denied the status of trade union leaders or former leaders of the  dismissed workers or that the dismissal was based on the grounds for termination of contract with liability for the employer, which does not call for the grounds for the dismissal to be cited.
.In view of the above, the Committee deeply regrets these dismissals and calls the attention of the Government to the fact that proprietorial changes should not directly or indirectly threaten unionized workers and their organizations. (Digest, op. cit., para. ). The Committee also points out that in cases of staff reductions, the Committee has drawn attention to the principle contained in the Workers' Representatives Recommendation,  (No. ), which mentions amongst the measures to be taken to ensure effective protection to these workers, that recognition of a priority should be given to workers' representatives with regard to their retention in employment in case of reduction of the workforce (Article ()(f)) (see Digest, op. cit., para. ). Likewise, in a previous case in which the Government considered the dismissal of nine trade union leaders to be part of restructuring plans, the Committee emphasized the advisability of giving priority to workers' representatives with regard to their retention in employment in case of reduction of the workforce, to ensure their effective protection (see Digest, op. cit., para. ).
.This being the case, given that  of the  dismissed trade union leaders or former leaders accepted the legal compensation, the examination of the case will only proceed with respect to the two who did not accept it. The Committee requests the Government to take steps with a view to reinstating these trade union leaders (Mr. Luis Wilfredo Berrios and Mrs. Gloria Mercedes Gonzlez) in their posts and to guarantee that in future proprietorial changes that occur in the framework of privatization do not directly or indirectly threaten unionized workers and their organizations.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) Observing that legislation imposes a series of excessive formalities for the recognition of a trade union and the acquisition of legal personality that are contrary to the principle of the free establishment of trade union organizations (the requirement that the trade unions of independent institutions should be works unions), that make it difficult to set up a trade union (minimum number of  workers to establish a works union) or that in any case make it temporarily impossible to establish a trade union (the requirement for six months to have passed before applying to establish another trade union even if the previous one did not obtain legal personality), the Committee:-- concludes that the legislation seriously infringes the principles of freedom of association;-- regrets that in applying this legislation the authorities have refused legal personality to a number of trade unions in the process of being set up in the ANTEL enterprise and in the Telecommunications Company of El Salvador S.A. de C.V.; and-- regrets that the application for recognition and registration made by SITTEL in August  has not been dealt with and is still pending. The Committee requests the Government to accelerate the procedure and register the union;-- urges the Government to take measures with a view to amending the legislation so that the current excessive formalities that apply to the establishment of trade union organizations are removed and so that workers do not have to constitute enterprise-based works unions if they do not consider this to be appropriate.(b) The Committee requests the Government to take steps with a view to reinstating the trade unions leaders Mr. Luis Wilfredo Berrios and Mrs. Gloria Mercedes Gonzlez in their posts and to guarantee that in future proprietorial changes that occur in the framework of privatization do not directly or indirectly threaten unionized workers and their organizations.",-1,1998,El Salvador
191,".The Committee last examined this case at its meeting in June  [see th Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (June )], when it urged the Government: () to take the necessary steps so that the legislation guarantees the right to establish trade union organizations in the public sector; () to recognize the transformation of the Nursing Personnel Craft Union of El Salvador into an industrial trade union; and () to make reparation for the acts of anti-union discrimination committed in the Rosales Hospital (reinstate the trade union officials who were transferred and ensure that no worker is threatened with dismissal if he or she does not resign from the General Industrial Trade Union of Health Workers (SIGESAL)).
.In a communication dated  May , the General Industrial Trade Union of Health Workers (SIGESAL) states that the Government has not carried out the Committee's recommendations.
.In a communication dated  August , the Government: () refers to article  of the Constitution of the Republic, which guarantees the right of private employees and those in autonomous official institutions the right to associate freely. The Government states further that sections  ff. of the Labour Code clearly set out which workers have the right to associate freely to defend their economic, social and professional interests by forming trade unions or professional associations of workers; these do not include the workers of the Rosales National Hospital, since they are directly employed by the central Government and are governed by the Salaries and General Budget Act, and they are therefore not protected by the Labour Code, pursuant to the distinction drawn in section  of the Code; the Government would appreciate it if the Committee would offer it ILO technical assistance; () points out that the Nursing Personnel Craft Union of El Salvador, as its name indicates, is a craft union; it was established as a union of only nursing personnel, i.e. those caring for patients, and these were accordingly granted legal personality as such; the most recent lists of members of this union included watchmen, metalworkers, plumbers, messengers, secretaries and a few nurses and other persons in different occupations, which led to a degeneration of the union's founding principle and nature and prevented it from complying with section  of the Labour Code, which is required in order for it to function in accordance with the law and its own by-laws; this is why its executive board was not authorized to take up office; an appeal was lodged but was rejected on grounds that it was unfounded; and () states that it is important to reiterate that the administration of Rosales National Hospital has not taken reprisals against its workers for joining the abovementioned union, but that the transfers were carried out as a result of a study which identified different areas that needed appropriate human resources to carry out their activities in the best possible manner in order to offer a better service to users; moreover it should be explained that the transfers took place in accordance with the second paragraph of section  of the Civil Service Act which states as follows: ""Officials or employees may be transferred to a similar post even without their consent at the convenience of the public or municipal administration, provided that the transfer is within the same locality.""
.The Committee regrets that despite the time which has elapsed no steps have been taken to comply with the recommendations it formulated in this case at its meeting in June . It reiterates once again that ""all public service employees (with the sole possible exception of the armed forces and the police, as indicated in Article  of Convention No. ), should, like workers in the private sector, be able to establish organizations of their own choosing to further and defend the interests of their members"" and ""protection against acts of anti-union discrimination should cover not only hiring and dismissal, but also any discriminatory measures during employment, in particular transfers, downgrading and other acts that are prejudicial to the worker"" [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , paras.  and ]. In these circumstances, the Committee finds itself obliged to repeat its recommendations formulated during its last examination of the case and requests the Government to keep it informed of any steps taken to comply with them.
.The Committee examined this case at its November  meeting (see th Report, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November )) when it presented the following recommendations on the matters still outstanding (see th Report, para. ):- The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps to amend the legislation so that public officials, including hospital staff, might enjoy the rights of establishing organizations and freely belonging to these organizations. The Committee urges the Government to take the necessary measures to bring the legislation into conformity with the principles of freedom of association and to keep it informed on any measures it adopts in this respect and reminds it that the ILO's technical assistance is at its disposal.- The Committee urges the Government to take steps to recognize the transformation of the Nursing Personnel Craft Union of El Salvador into an industrial trade union and to register immediately once again the board of management that was elected. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.- Stressing that one of the fundamental principles of freedom of association is that workers should enjoy adequate protection against all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment and that no person should be dismissed or prejudiced in his or her employment by reason of trade union membership or legitimate trade union activities, the Committee urges the Government to take steps to reinstate in their original posts the trade union officials who were transferred from the Rosales Hospital and ensure that no worker is threatened with dismissal if he or she does not resign from the General Industrial Trade Union of Health Workers (SIGESAL). The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.In its communications dated  April and  May  the Government states that the workers at the Rosales Hospital are directly employed by the central Government and are governed by the Salaries and General Budget Act. Consequently, they are not protected by the Labour Code. The Government adds that the members of the Nursing Personnel Craft Union of El Salvador are supposed to be workers who look after sick people but that the latest membership lists consisted of other workers (watchmen, metalworkers, plumbers, etc.) and only a few nurses. Since this is a violation of section  of the Labour Code, the executive board was not authorized to take up office. The appeal against this decision was denied on  August . The executive board may be elected once a meeting is held of people who meet the requirements of the law and of the union's statutes. As regards the transfer of union officials, the Government repeats its position that this is not a reprisal for joining the aforementioned union but in keeping with the requirements of the service and that the transfers were ordered pursuant to section  of the Civil Service Act which states that officials or employees may be transferred to a similar post even without their consent at the convenience of the public or municipal administration, provided that the transfer is within the same locality.
.The Committee notes the Government's observations which by and large reiterate its earlier statements. The Committee deeply regrets that the Government has not complied with its recommendations, stresses that the allegations relate to highly important issues such as the right to establish trade union organizations in the public sector and the right not to be subjected to anti-union discrimination, and finds itself obliged to repeat its previous recommendations. The Committee therefore urges the Government: () to take the necessary steps so that the legislation guarantees the right to establish trade union organizations in the public sector; () to recognize the transformation of the Nursing Personnel Craft Union of El Salvador into an industrial trade union; () to make reparation for the acts of anti-union discrimination committed in the Rosales Hospital.
.The complaint in this case is contained in a communication from the General Industrial Trade Union of Health Workers (SIGESAL), dated  February . Subsequently, the SIGESAL presented additional information in a communication dated  May .
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated ,  and  May .
.El Salvador has not ratified either the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  February , the General Industrial Trade Union of Health Workers (SIGESAL) states that it has been legally established for  years with a legal personality and that until May , it was",1,1996,El Salvador
192,"known as the Nursing Personnel Craft Union of El Salvador; however, in agreement with the association's general assembly, it opted to transform from a ""craft"" union (sindicato de gremio) into an ""industrial"" union (sindicato de industria) after submitting, in May , the reforms of its by-laws. However, since that date the Ministry of Labour has not at all responded to these reforms. The complainant organization points out that the trade union has  members, most of whom are public officials, that it is one of the most representative in the public health sector and that since the general assembly approved the change of the trade union's legal nature and in accordance with the reforms of its by-laws, it has been operating in this capacity.
.The complainant organization adds that, on  April , the ordinary general assembly elected the board of management for the - period and that it duly submitted the new list of officials to the Ministry of Labour; furthermore, on  May of the same year, it legally registered this board with the corresponding credentials. Notwithstanding these facts, on  January , the Minister of Public Health and Social Security requested the National Department of Social Organizations of the Ministry of Labour to annul the resolution under which instructions were given to register the union's board of management, whose members are employees at the Rosales Hospital, on the grounds that public officials are not entitled to belong to a trade union and therefore to be elected as officials. Subsequently, the National Department of Social Organizations of the Ministry of Labour, without paying any heed to the trade union's opinion, decided on  January  to annul the resolution acknowledging the board of management and ordered that: the registration of this board should be cancelled; the officials should return the credentials entrusted in them to the Ministry of Labour; and the workers in the Rosales Hospital belonging to the union should resign because they were not entitled to belong to it. Finally, the complainant organization states that it submitted a request to the respective Minister to repeal this resolution; to date, however, it has not received a reply and this appeal is pending. The hospital administrator also ordered the elected officials to hand over the trade union premises and the trade union assets on the grounds that they were not entitled to use these because they do not legally represent the workers' organization. Furthermore, the hospital administration is planning to close the trade union premises with the backing of the national civil police.
.In its communication of  May , the complainant organization states that the management of the Rosales Hospital ordered that all the workers should be informed of the Ministry of Labour's resolution to annul the registration of the union's board of management and to require workers to resign from the union; it proceeded to return trade union contributions. Furthermore, in November , workers started to be threatened with dismissal if they did not resign from the trade union. The complainant organization adds that the Secretary-General, the First Disputes Secretary and four other trade union officials were transferred without being previously consulted; it encloses copies of the transfer orders. Finally, the complainant organization alleges that the management of the Rosales Hospital, accompanied by vigilantes and the national police, made a violent search of the SIGESAL offices.
.In its communication of  May , the Government states that the Nursing Personnel Craft Union of El Salvador was set up on  April , that its by-laws were approved on  December  and that all the signatories to the act of constitution of the union stated that they were members of the nursing profession; furthermore, in article , paragraph , of the above-mentioned by-laws, it is stipulated that ""only workers employed in nursing the sick shall be accepted as members of the trade union"". In accordance with sections  and  of the Labour Code, private employers and wage earners, as well as workers in independent social institutions, are entitled to associate freely by forming occupational associations. Section  of the Labour Code states that it applies to employment relationships concluded by the State, local authorities and independent public institutions and their workers; however, it does not apply to relationships of this kind under public law and those that have been created by an Administrative Act - as well as the appointment to a post under the Salaries Act financed by the general funds and special funds of these institutions.
.The Government adds that on  April  documentation was submitted to the National Department of Social Organizations concerning the election of the general board of management of the Nursing Personnel Craft Union of El Salvador, and that this department issued a resolution on  May registering this board. On  January , the Minister of Public Health and Social Welfare requested this department to annul the said resolution because the board of management was entirely made up of employees of the Rosales Hospital who, because they worked for a public institution dependent upon the Minister in question and were not members of the nursing profession, could not belong to it. The Government states that section  of the Labour Code provides in its first paragraph that a craft union consists of workers engaged in the same occupation, craft, trade or speciality. Consequently, the National Department of Social Organizations issued its resolution on the following grounds: the Labour Code does not apply to employees or workers who are specifically appointed under the Salaries Act, which is the case of workers at the Rosales National Hospital because it is a dependency of the Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare. In accordance with the definition of a craft union given in the Labour Code, a union of this type should be made up of workers in a particular branch of activity - in this specific case in the nursing profession, as stated by the founding members of the trade union on  April  who set up a union for nursing personnel. The members of the board of management, however, carry out duties in this hospital which differ from those qualifying for membership of the craft trade union, i.e. technicians, workers, boiler-workers, vigilantes, storeroom assistants, telephone operators and cooks - and none are actually involved in the nursing profession; and therefore all workers employed in the Rosales Hospital in another capacity should resign on these grounds.
.The Government states that although the wording used in the by-laws that members must be part of the nursing profession is sufficiently wide in scope, when taken in conjunction with the Labour Code, it is evident that workers, telephone operators and cooks are not looking after the sick but carrying out completely different functions. The case is different for other types of trade unions, such as works or industrial trade unions, to which all workers in an enterprise might belong irrespective of the actual work they do; it suffices that they work in the same enterprise. According to the Government, the complainant organization may not - and should not - have members who do not work as nurses, given that the Labour Code does not apply to workers employed by the Rosales National Hospital because their appointment is specifically governed by the Salaries Act. The Government adds that the union in question may continue to operate as long as all its members are engaged in the nursing profession.
.In its communications of  and  May , the Government states that workers in El Salvador enjoy full freedom of association and right of organization. The only restrictions placed on these rights by law is that there should be no undermining of the physical integrity or private life of individuals - and this is precisely what the Nursing Personnel Craft Union of El Salvador (SIGESAL) is trying to do by claiming that it wants to transform from a craft union to an industrial union; however, it is not enough merely to transform the by-laws of a craft union, given that Salvadorian legislation provides that both these categories of union must fulfil certain vital requirements. For example, a craft union consists of workers engaged in the same occupation, craft, trade or speciality; and an industrial trade union consists of employers or workers belonging to enterprises engaged in the same branch of industry, commerce or services (section  of the Labour Code). Finally, the Government points out that the Rosales Hospital is dependent on the Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare and that consequently its workers are public officials; in this capacity they are amongst those specified by the Labour Code as not being entitled to set up freely occupational or trade union associations (section  of the Labour Code).
.The Committee notes that the allegations in this case refer to the refusal of the administrative authorities to recognize the transformation of a craft union into an industrial union and the annulment of the registration of its board of management, as",1,1996,El Salvador
193,"well as to the transfer of trade union officials, threats of dismissal against trade union members and the search of trade union premises.
.Concerning the alleged refusal of the administrative authorities to recognize the change in status of the Nursing Personnel Craft Union of El Salvador to become an industrial union (General Industrial Trade Union of Health Workers) and the annulment of the registration of the board of managers - which had initially been registered - the Committee notes the Government's reply to the effect that: () when the craft union in question was set up () all the founding members stated that they were engaged in the nursing profession; () in May  the National Department of Social Organizations registered the board of management of the Nursing Personnel Craft Union of El Salvador; () in January  the Minister of Public Health and Social Welfare requested the administrative authorities to annul the registration of the board of management on the grounds that it consisted totally of employees of the Rosales Hospital who, because they worked for a public institution and did not exercise the profession of nurse (such as workers, technicians, telephone operators, vigilantes, etc.) could not, in accordance with the by-laws of the craft union, be members of the board of management; () the administrative authorities annulled the registration of the board of management taking into account the arguments put forward by the Ministry of Public Health; () transforming a craft union into an industrial union requires more than merely reforming the by-laws as it must comply with the requirements laid down in the Labour Code; and () given that the Rosales Hospital is dependent upon the Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare its employees are public officials, who are not included amongst those who have freedom of association under the Labour Code.
.In this respect, the Committee notes that the Government refers in its reply to two different issues. On the one hand, it states that the workers in the Rosales Hospital are public officials and, as such, are not covered by the scope of the Labour Code and consequently do not enjoy the right of organization; on the other hand, it points out that the registration of the board of management of the union was annulled because its members were not carrying out the profession of nurse as stipulated in the former by-laws of the ""craft"" trade union (union of workers in the same occupation).
.As regards the first issue, the Committee reminds the Government that workers and employers, without distinction whatsoever, including public officials, should have the right to establish organizations of their choosing and to join these organizations, with the only condition that they should respect the by-laws of these organizations. In these circumstances, the Committee urges the Government to take the necessary steps to amend the legislation so that public officials, including hospital staff, may enjoy the right to establish and join organizations of their choosing. The Committee urges the Government to take measures to bring its legislation into conformity with the principles of freedom of association and to keep it informed on any measures that it might adopt in this respect and reminds it that the ILO's technical assistance is at its disposal.
.As concerns the second issue, the Committee notes that the complainant organization submitted changes to its by-laws to the administrative authorities, stating that it had decided to transform the craft union into an industrial union in May  and that although the administrative authorities did not reply to the trade union on this matter, the Government registered the board of management in the same month; however, this registration was subsequently annulled at the request of the Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare. Furthermore, the Committee notes that the Government did not indicate the way in which the trade union failed to comply with the provisions under the Labour Code to transform itself into an industrial union (in this respect, the Government clearly notes that the members of the board of management had different occupations and functions - as in the case of industrial unions - although within the health sector). In this context, the Committee reminds the Government that ""workers should be free to decide whether they prefer to establish, at the primary level, a works union or another form of basic organization, such as an industrial or craft union"" (see Digest of Decisions and Principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. ) and that ""freedom of association implies the right of workers and employers to elect their representatives in full freedom"" (see Digest, op. cit., para. ).
.In these circumstances, the Committee urges the Government to take steps to recognize the transformation of the Nursing Personnel Craft Union of El Salvador into an industrial union and to register immediately once again the board of management which was duly elected. The Committee requests the Government to respect the principles mentioned in the paragraph above and to keep it informed in this respect.
.As regards the allegations concerning the transfer of the Secretary-General, the First Disputes Secretary and other trade union officials from their posts - the complainant organization submitted copies of the transfer orders - and the threats to workers that they would be dismissed if they did not resign from the union, the Committee regrets to note that the Government did not submit its observations. In this respect, the Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that ""one of the fundamental principles of freedom of association is that workers should enjoy adequate protection against all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment, such as dismissal, demotion, transfer or other prejudicial measures. This protection is particularly desirable in the case of trade union officials because, in order to be able to perform their trade union duties in full independence, they should have a guarantee that they will not be prejudiced on account of the mandate which they hold from their trade unions"" and that ""no person should be dismissed or prejudiced in his or her employment by reason of trade union membership or legitimate trade union activities, and it is important to forbid and penalize in practice all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of employment"" (see Digest, op. cit., paras.  and ). Given the Government's failure to reply to these allegations and in spite of repeated requests, the Committee urges the Government to take measures to reinstate in their original posts the trade union officials who were transferred and ensure that no worker is threatened with being dismissed if he or she does not resign from the trade union in question. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.Finally, concerning the allegation that vigilantes and the national police made a violent search of the trade union premises, the Committee also regrets to note that the Government failed to submit any observations on this matter. The Committee stresses that ""the entry by police or military forces into trade union premises without a judicial warrant constitutes a serious and unjustifiable interference in trade union activities"" (see Digest, op. cit., para. ). The Committee therefore requests the Government to take steps to ensure that in future no searches of trade union premises are carried out without a judicial warrant.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps to amend the legislation so that public officials, including hospital staff, might enjoy the rights of establishing organizations and freely belonging to these organizations. The Committee urges the Government to take the necessary measures to bring the legislation into conformity with the principles of freedom of association and to keep it informed on any measures it adopts in this respect and reminds it that the ILO's technical assistance is at its disposal.(b) The Committee urges the Government to take steps to recognize the transformation of the Nursing Personnel Craft Union of El Salvador into an industrial trade union and to register immediately once again the board of management that was elected. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.(c) Stressing that one of the fundamental principles of freedom of association is that workers should enjoy adequate protection against all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment and that no person should be dismissed or prejudiced in his or her employment by reason of trade union membership or legitimate trade union activities, the Committee urges the Government to take steps to reinstate in their original posts the trade union officials who were transferred from the Rosales Hospital and ensure that no worker is threatened with dismissal if he or she does not resign from the General Industrial Trade Union of Health Workers (SIGESAL). The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.(d) Recalling that the entry by police or military forces into trade union premises without a judicial warrant",1,1996,El Salvador
194,"constitutes a serious and unjustifiable interference in trade union activities, the Committee requests the Government to take steps to ensure that in future no searches of trade union premises are carried out without a judicial warrant.",-1,1996,El Salvador
195,".The complaint in this case is contained in a communication from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) dated  October . Subsequently, the ICFTU sent additional information in a communication dated  October .
.The Government sent partial observations in communications dated  February and  April .
.El Salvador has not ratified either the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  October , the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) alleges the dismissal of more than  workers from the Mandarn International S.A. de C.V. enterprise, located in the free zone of San Marcos, following the establishment of a trade union as well as various acts of violence against the members of this organization. (The Committee already examined these allegations within the framework of Case No.  at its meeting in March ; see nd Report, paras.  to .)
.In its communication of  October , the ICFTU states that on  March  the SETBAES trade union was set up in the Ssangbangwool Apparel de El Salvador S.A. de C.V. enterprise, located in the free zone of El Pedregal, Zacatecoluca, in the department of La Paz. The complainant organization alleges that after its establishment, a group of workers, founder members of the trade union and its entire executive committee were arbitrarily dismissed and that despite all the attempts made, the enterprise refused to reinstate the members of the executive committee and the other members of the trade union. The complainant allegation alleges that the trade union was finally dissolved (the complainant organization appends to its complaint the names of  workers and founder members of the trade union who had been dismissed).
.Finally, the trade union organization states that on  July  the Trade Union of Workers of the Rayders Textiles enterprise (SETRAT) was set up in the Rayders Textiles S.A. de C.V. enterprise, located in the free zone of San Marcos, El Salvador, with a group of  workers and that the Ministry of Labour and Social Insurance refused to grant legal personality to this trade union. The complainant organization adds that it lodged an appeal which was rejected. The complainant organization adds that the employer has systematically refused any dialogue with the trade union and that it has dismissed  workers affiliated to the workers' organization and members of the executive committee, without any kind of economic compensation and without granting any of their social benefits.
.In its communication of  February , the Government states in connection with the allegation concerning the Ssangbangwool Apparel de El Salvador S.A. de C.V. enterprise that according to the inquiries carried out and the statement made by the president of the enterprise, it was established that on  March , due to considerable reductions in production, the workforce at the plant was cut by  per cent, i.e.  persons, each of whom was granted compensation for services rendered, as established by the Labour Code. The following week a workers' representative came to the factory, accompanied by eight persons, and demanded the return to work of all the workers, alleging that they were members of the recently established enterprise trade union; the enterprise had no knowledge of such an organization, and during his visit the workers' representative provided no documentation of any kind to back up his demand. After the latter was rejected, the representative and his colleagues entered the plant and brought pressure to bear on the workers to prevent them from carrying out their work and to instigate a work stoppage. The work stoppage was not supported by the rest of the workers, who remained at their workplaces. Subsequently, the workers' representative and his colleagues surrounded the main entrance to the installations of the El Pedregal free zone, harassed the workers from other factories who were finishing their work and threatened to prevent any Korean from leaving. The following day, the representative of the workers along with a group of picketers and photographers once again surrounded the main gate to the free zone from early morning and attempted to prevent workers from another six factories who had nothing to do with the dispute from entering.
.The Government states that although valid resignations had been received from each of the workers, the enterprise and the workers' representative initiated a round of discussions at the Ministry of Labour and Social Insurance with the participation of an interministerial committee, which resulted in a direct request from the workers' representative for a definitive solution of the labour dispute through a compromise settlement whereby the enterprise would pay the workers concerned an amount of money in exchange for the withdrawal of the individual proceedings initiated by each of them. The Government states that all the cheques were delivered to the workers' representative and that the respective proceedings were subsequently withdrawn, thus putting an end to the complaint (the Government appends to its reply a copy of the withdrawal of the legal proceedings which had been initiated). Finally, according to the Government, the enterprise stated that three trade union women workers, Morena Margarita Chvez Alfaro, Mirna del Carmen Lpez Gattan and Glenda Rosmery Ramos Prez, remained at their workplaces before, during and after the above-mentioned dispute, thus confirming that the staff reduction was based on production criteria and did not affect freedom of association.
.In its communication dated  April , the Government states in connection with the allegations concerning the refusal to grant legal personality to the Trade Union of Workers of the Rayders Textiles S.A. de C.V. enterprise by the Ministry of Labour and Social Insurance that on  July  a meeting was held for the establishment of the above-mentioned trade union with the presence of  persons who worked for and under the instructions of the Rayders Textiles S.A. de C.V. enterprise, and that the meeting was held without the presence of a notary or one or more delegates of the Ministry of Labour and Social Insurance and that the act of constitution was drawn up in the form of a private document by the secretary of the provisional executive committee. The Government adds that in accordance with the procedure established in section (), as amended, of the Labour Code, an official request was made to the Rayders Textiles S.A. de C.V. enterprise requesting certification, within five working days following receipt of the request, that the founder members of the above-mentioned trade union were employed in the enterprise. The latter replied that  workers of the  members of the trade union were active members of another trade union which violates section  of the Labour Code which prohibits being a member of more than one union, and that two other women workers had never been employed in the enterprise. The Government adds that the persons involved in the establishment of the trade union presented  documents containing the incorrectly formulated resignation of the same number of workers from the Rayders Textiles S.A. de C.V. of STITAS.
.The Government states that the act of constitution of the trade union does not mention that several of its founder members were affiliated to another trade union and that some of them were even active trade union officials. The Government adds that the procedure followed by the persons in question concerning the  resignations related to the establishment of the Trade Union of Workers of the Rayders Textiles S.A. de C.V. enterprise was not that established by the Labour Code, since section  of this legal instrument stipulates: ""that resignations of membership in a trade union shall be presented in writing to the corresponding committee and the member of the latter receiving the notification shall provide the person concerned with a document certifying the date and time of its presentation"". Finally, the Government states that the Trade Union of Workers of the Rayders Textiles S.A. de C.V. enterprise was not set up with the minimum number of members required by the law, such as section () of the Labour Code, and thus its application for legal personality was refused.
.The Committee notes that the allegations made in this case refer to anti-union dismissals following the establishment of workers' organizations in two enterprises and the refusal to grant legal personality to one trade union.
.As regards the allegation concerning the dismissal of more than  workers following the establishment of a workers' trade union in the Ssangbangwool Apparel de El Salvador S.A. de C.V. enterprise on  March  and the subsequent dissolution of the union as a result of these dismissals, the Committee notes the Government's statement that:
.In this respect, although it notes that the enterprise states that it had no knowledge of the existence of the trade union (although the Government states that three women workers mentioned by the complainant were not dismissed and that they are trade unionists), the Committee notes that the reduction of staff  hours after the establishment of a",1,1995,El Salvador
196,"trade union in the enterprise affecting exclusively, according to the complainant organization, the founder members of the trade union. The Committee therefore cannot exclude that the reduction of staff made in Ssangbangwool Apparel de El Salvador S.A. de C.V. enterprise might have prejudiced the founder members of the trade union, having had an anti-union purpose and violated freedom of association. The Committee reminds the Government that even when legislation provides legal protection against acts of anti-union discrimination, in practice ""acts of anti-trade union discrimination should not be authorized under the pretext of dismissals based on economic activity"" and draws attention to the fact that ""acts of anti-union discrimination, in particular dismissals, may lead to the actual disappearance of trade unions composed only of workers in an undertaking"" (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , paras.  and ).
.In these circumstances, and emphasizing that no person should be dismissed or prejudiced in his or her employment by reason of trade union membership or legitimate trade union activities, and the importance of forbidding and penalizing in practice all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of employment (see Digest, op. cit., para. ), the Committee requests the Government to take measures for an investigation to be carried out in this regard and, if the allegations are proven, to apply the appropriate sanctions in this case in conformity with the legislation in force and to take measures to enable the dismissed workers to be reinstated in their jobs. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.As regards the allegations that the Ministry of Labour and Social Insurance refused to grant legal personality to the Trade Union of Workers of the Rayders Textiles S.A. de C.V. enterprise (SETRAT) and that the enterprise dismissed  workers who were members of the trade union organization, the Committee notes the Government's statement that:
.In this respect, although the Government has emphasized that there were irregularities which prevented the granting of trade union personality to the trade union in question, the Committee notes that the Government has not denied the alleged massive dismissal of workers who were members of the trade union organization and merely emphasizes the fact that the new trade union did not have the legal minimum membership of  workers. In these circumstances, since it cannot be sure that the alleged dismissals were made as a result of the trade union membership of workers, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures for an investigation to be carried out in this regard and, in the event that the allegations are proven, to take the necessary measures to enable the dismissed persons to be reinstated in their jobs and for the respective legal sanctions to be applied. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) As regards the allegation concerning the dismissal of the founder members of the trade union in the Ssangbangwool Apparel de El Salvador S.A. de C.V. enterprise, located in the free zone of El Pedregal, Zacatecoluca, in the department of La Paz, not being able to exclude that the staff reduction made in this enterprise,  hours after the establishment of a trade union, might have had an anti-union purpose, the Committee requests the Government to take measures for an investigation to be undertaken in this regard and, if the allegations are proven, to apply the appropriate sanctions in this case, in accordance with the national legislation in force, and to take measures to enable the dismissed workers to be reinstated in their posts.(b) As regards the allegations concerning the massive dismissal of members of the Trade Union of Workers of the Rayders Textiles S.A. de C.V. enterprise (SETRAT), the Committee, not being in a position to be sure that the alleged dismissals were made as a result of trade union membership, requests the Government to take the necessary measures for an investigation to be undertaken in this regard and, in the event that the allegations are proven, to take measures to enable the dismissed persons to be reinstated in their jobs and for the respective legal sanctions to be applied. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.",0,1995,El Salvador
197,".The complaint was presented in a communication from the National Sugar Industry Trade Union (San Francisco de Cusclatn Sugar Mill local union) (SINA) dated  May . The Government replied in communications dated  November  and  February .
.El Salvador has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The National Sugar Industry Trade Union (San Francisco de Cusclatn Sugar Mill local union) (SINA) alleges in its communication of  May  that since May  the San Francisco Sugar Mill has adopted a systematic anti-union policy, obliging workers to renounce their union membership and dismissing  union members in September  and  in October . Between November  and May ,  members left the union as a result of pressure from the enterprise, acting mainly through five pro-management workers - one of whom went so far as to pay workers to leave the union.
.The complainant adds that in March  it called for a review of the collective agreement. The enterprise replied that it was prepared to start negotiations from  May , but when the workers went to work on  April  they found the enterprise closed. According to the complainant, proper legal procedures were not observed and the closure violated the collective agreement and was designed to break up the trade union organization.
.In its communication of  November , the Government states that on  October  the head of the International Relations Office of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare visited Industrias Agrcolas San Francisco S.A de C.V. to investigate the SINA's complaint. He was accompanied by the enterprise's attorney who, when informed of the purpose of the visit, stated:- that as representative of Industrias Agrcolas San Francisco S.A de C.V. he considered the allegations to be malicious, in that the closure of the workplace was not directed against any workers' association, namely the SINA local union, but was due to the crisis in the national sugar industry (a number of press cuttings alluding to the seriousness of the problem were attached);- the closure of Industrias Agrcolas San Francisco complied with all the requirements of the law, as evidenced by the settlement signed between the SINA and the enterprise (a copy of which was attached) stating that the SINA has no claim against the enterprise. The agreement between the parties, which was officially recorded in the administrative offices of Industrias Agrcolas San Francisco S.A de C.V., reads:... Industrias Agrcolas San Francisco S.A de C.V. owes no worker any money in respect of regular or exceptional wages or any other services; consequently we declare the enterprise free of any responsibility deriving from the collective agreement it entered into with the trade union and hereby conclude this final settlement with the company, which extends to all natural or legal persons that been involved in the contractual relationship that existed between the parties here present.- the four union leaders who signed the complaint submitted to the Committee were also compensated in the manner and to the extent laid down in the Labour Code; furthermore, they submitted an irrevocable resignation from their duties in the sugar mill (a copy of these documents was attached);- the enterprise considers that it has complied with the law throughout and that there is therefore no violation of freedom of association.
.The Committee observes that the complainant organization alleges: () acts of anti-trade union discrimination and interference in union affairs by Industrias Agrcolas San Francisco S.A de C.V., namely the dismissal of numerous trade unionists and the coercion of its workers to renounce their membership of the trade union; and () the illegal closure of the San Francisco Sugar Mill in order to break up the trade union organization.
.Regarding the alleged illegal and anti-union nature of the closure of the San Francisco Sugar Mill, the Committee observes that, according to the enterprise (whose point of view the Government reflects in its reply), the closure was due to the crisis in the national sugar industry, that it complied with legal requirements and that it was not directed against the trade union organization. Since the allegations and the point of view of the enterprise are contradictory, and noting that the parties reached an agreement after the closure of the sugar mill in which the trade union specifically declared the enterprise free of any responsibility under the collective agreement and that it owed no money in respect of wages or other services, the Committee concludes that the allegation regarding the closure of the San Francisco Sugar Mill does not call for further examination.
.Regarding the alleged anti-union dismissals and coercion of workers of the San Francisco Sugar Mill to renounce their membership of the union, the Committee regrets that the Government has not commented on this matter. Since the sugar mill has now been closed, the question of the reinstatement of the dismissed workers is no longer relevant, especially since - as indicated in the previous paragraph - the complainant organization has signed an agreement declaring that the enterprise owes nothing in respect of wages or other services. However, in so far as the Government has not denied the alleged anti-union dismissals which, according to the complainant, occurred months before the sugar mill was closed down, the Committee requests the Government to take steps to ensure that in future all denunciations of acts of anti-union discrimination and interference are investigated rapidly and, if the denunciations prove to be founded, that such acts are rapidly remedied.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee calls on the Government to take steps to ensure that in future all denunciations of acts of anti-union discrimination and interference are investigated rapidly and, if the denunciations prove to be founded, that such acts are rapidly remedied.",1,1995,El Salvador
198,".When it examined this case at its November  session (see th Report, paras. -), the Committee noted that the Government had not provided the information requested concerning the following recommendations:-- The Committee requested the Government to take the necessary steps to carry out an independent inquiry to look into the allegations concerning the death of the trade unionist, Ms. Julia Esperanza Quintanilla (according to the complainant, the management of the enterprise refused the trade unionist the possibility of seeking medical assistance), and in the event that these facts are confirmed, to bring appropriate action before the courts in order to determine responsibilities and punish the guilty. The Committee requested the Government to keep it informed in this respect.-- With respect to the alleged arrests (by the security staff in the enterprise) of a member of the trade union executive, of two workers of the Sanobang Wool Apparel El Salvador S.A. enterprise and of Mr. Elisio Castro Prez, secretary-general of the trade union of the textile factory, Mandarn International, as well as the physical attacks on the trade union official of the same trade union, Ms. Marta Rivas, both events allegedly occurred on  May , the Committee requested the Government to take steps to carry out an inquiry into the allegations and, if it is ascertained that the trade unionists in question were unlawfully deprived of their freedom -- even for a short period of time -- and that Ms. Rivas was physically attacked by the security guards of Mandarn International, to bring appropriate action before the courts so that the guilty should be duly punished. The Committee requested the Government to keep it informed in this respect.-- The Committee requested the Government to carry out as a matter of priority an inquiry concerning the threats made against trade unionists in two enterprises noted in the allegations in the free trade zones and to ensure that effective protection is provided for the workers in theses enterprises. The Committee requested the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.Furthermore, the Committee requested the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the judicial proceedings against Mr. Huezo concerning false testimony, sequestration, extortion, death threats, illegal detention, defamation and damages and interest.
.In communications of  December  and  April , the Government states as follows: () Ms. Julia Esperanza Quintanilla died at . on  March  in the ""El Carmen"" quarter of the city following a serious attack of gastroenteritis, despite having received medical aid, as confirmed by the death certificate. At the time of her death, this worker was covered by the Salvadorian Institute of Social Security, and the enterprise gave to the mother of the deceased an amount equivalent to  days of base salary for the funeral, pursuant to article  of the Labour Code; () concerning the judicial proceedings instituted against Mr. Huezo, on  March  the Second Criminal Judge of San Salvador la Nouvelle accepted a motion of dismissal in favour of Juan Jos Huezo for the offences of false testimony, sequestration, extortion, threats, illegal detention, defamation and action in damages against Mr. Roberto Orellana Molina, and for defamation and action in damages against Jos Hctor Bonilla and Romeo Alfonso Caldern Rodrguez respectively, and ordered that Mr. Huezo could remain at liberty. As a result, there are no outstanding charges against Mr. Huezo; () according to the representative of the Sanobang Wool Apparel El Salvador S.A. of CV, with respect to the events of  May  against the trade unionists, which are attributed to the security personnel of the enterprise, the executive and administrative personnel of the enterprise did not enter until after the events; therefore, no one is in a position to adduce evidence of what actually happened before then. Similarly, the business records contain no details of the relevant facts. The security staff had been provided to the enterprise by the Sontay S.A. of CV company, which since October  has ceased to provide such services; () with respect to the threats made against trade unionists in two enterprises in the free trade zones, the Government refers to the case of Mr. Huezo (examined separately) and of Ms. Vilma Sarah Molina, first secretary of disputes of the Union of Workers in the Cotton Textile Industry, Synthetics, Manufactured Products and Related Branches. In relation to Ms. Sarah Molina, the Government adds that the Jatex S.A. of CV enterprise stated that it was impossible to conduct an inquiry four or five years after the events. In addition, the Government annexes to its response a communication of the National Federation of Unions of Salvadorian Workers (FENASTRAS), stating as follows: ""Concerning threats with firearms against Ms. Sarah Molina by members of the Salvadorian national civil police, we have learned from non-official sources that the Deputy Commissioner, Darwin Ernesto Arevalo Magaa, and the Deputy Inspector, Jorge Gonzlez, have been dismissed from their functions on the ground of abuse of authority in this matter.""
.The Committee notes the observations forwarded by the Government on all the allegations. It requests the Government to confirm the information provided by FENASTRAS in relation to the threats against trade unionist Ms. Sarah Molina, in particular concerning the measures taken against the members of the national civil police responsible for the threats.
.The Committee examined this case at its meeting of November  (see th Report, paras. -) when it noted that the Government had not provided the information requested concerning the following recommendations:-- The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps to carry out an independent inquiry to look into the allegations concerning the death of the trade unionist, Mrs. Julia Esperanza Quintanilla (according to the complainant organization the management of the enterprise refused the trade unionist the possibility of seeking medical assistance), and in the event that these facts are confirmed, to bring appropriate action before the courts in order to determine responsibilities and punish the guilty. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.-- As regards the alleged arrests (by the security staff in the enterprise) of a member of the trade union executive, two workers of the Sanobang Wool Apparel El Salvador S.A. enterprise and Mr. Elisio Castro Prez, secretary-general of the trade union of the textile factory, Mandarn International, as well as the physical attacks on the trade union official of the same trade union, Mrs. Marta Rivas (both events allegedly occurred on  May ), the Committee requests the Government to take steps to carry out an inquiry into these allegations and, if it is ascertained that the trade unionists in question were unlawfully deprived of their freedom -- even for a short period of time -- and that Mrs. Rivas was physically attacked by the security guards of Mandarn International, to bring appropriate action before the courts so that the guilty should be duly punished. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.-- The Committee requests the Government to carry out as a matter of priority an inquiry concerning the threats made against trade unionists in two enterprises noted in the allegations in the free zones and to ensure that effective protection is provided for the workers in these enterprises. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.The Committee, in November , took note of the large volume of documentation sent by the Government on the different stages of the legal proceedings on the illegal occupation of the workplace, resistance to public authorities and abusive use of the right to strike and to work against the trade union official Mr. Huezo.
.In communications of  May and  July , the Government informed the Committee that Mr. Huezo had been acquitted of the charges of abusive use of the right to strike and to work and resistance.
.The Committee takes due note of this information. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the other charges against Mr. Huezo concerning false testimony, sequestration, murder threats, illegal detention, defamation and damages and interest. Finally, the Government urges the Committee to provide the information requested regarding the other allegations.
.The Committee examined this case at its meeting of November  (see th Report, paras. -) when it noted that the Government had not provided the information requested in March  concerning the following recommendations:- The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps to carry out an independent inquiry to look into the allegations concerning the death of the trade unionist, Mrs. Julia Esperanza Quintanilla (according to the complaint organization the management of the enterprise refused the trade unionist the possibility of seeking medical assistance), and in the event that these facts are confirmed, to bring appropriate action before the courts in order to determine responsibilities and punish the guilty.

Enterprise, an executive member of the trade union and two workers of the Sanobang Wool Apparel El Salvador S.A. enterprise, and  trade union members in the Mandarn International Enterprise, the Committee requests the Government to take steps immediately to carry out an inquiry in the enterprises in question and, in the event of noting that alleged dismissals were based on the fact that those concerned were trade union officials or trade unionists or that they had carried out lawful trade union activities, to take steps to ensure that the dismissed workers might be immediately reinstated in their jobs.- The Committee requests the Government to carry out as a matter of priority an inquiry concerning the threats made against trade unionists in two enterprises noted in the allegations in the free zones and to ensure that effective protection is provided for the workers in these enterprises. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.The Committee also noted that in November  the Government stated that the trade union official, Mr. Huezo, was detained on charges of aggression against a national police officer as well as for the illegal occupation of the workplace, resistance to public authorities and abusive use of the right to strike and to work. In addition, there was a further charge against this trade unionist for false testimony, sequestration, murder threats, illegal detention, defamation and damages and interest, based on allegations filed in November . The Committee requested the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the legal proceedings under way against Mr. Huezo.
.In a communication of June , the Government sent a large volume of documentation on the different stages of the legal proceedings on the illegal occupation of the workplace, resistance to public authorities and abusive use of the right to strike and to work against the trade union official Mr. Huezo.
.The Committee notes this information and requests the Government to keep it informed as to the final outcome of the proceedings as well as on the other charge against this official concerning false testimony, sequestration, murder threats, illegal detention, defamation and damages and interest. Finally, the Government urges the Committee to provide the information requested regarding the other allegations.
.The Committee examined this case at its March  meeting (see nd Report, paras.  to ). At this occasion, the Committee presented the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps to carry out an independent inquiry to look into the allegations concerning the death of the trade unionist, Mrs. Julia Esperanza Quintanilla (according to the complainant organization the management of the enterprise refused to the trade unionist the possibility of seeking medical assistance), and in the event that these facts are confirmed, to bring appropriate action before the courts in order to determine responsibilities and punish the guilty. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.(b) The Committee requests the Government to inform it whether Mr. Juan Jos Huezo is still in prison and, in the affirmative, to explain what charges have been brought against him. Similarly, the Committee requests the Government to release him immediately if his detention is connected with his trade union activities. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.(c) As regards the alleged arrests (by the security staff in the enterprise) of a member of the trade union executive and two workers of the Sanobang Wool Apparel El Salvador SA enterprise and Elisio Castro Prez, Secretary-General of the trade union of the textile factory, Mandarin International, as well as the physical attacks on the trade union official of the same trade union, Mrs. Marta Rivas (both events allegedly occurred on  May ), the Committee requests the Government to take steps to carry out an inquiry into these allegations and, if it is ascertained that the trade unionists in question were unlawfully deprived of their freedom - even for a short period of time - and that Mrs. Rivas was physically attacked by the security guards of Mandarin International, to bring appropriate action before the courts so that the guilty should be duly punished. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.(d) Concerning the allegations relating to the anti-union dismissals of  workers in the Gabo SA enterprise and  trade union members in the Mandarin International enterprise, the Committee requests the Government to take steps immediately to carry out an inquiry in the enterprises in question and, in the event of noting that the alleged dismissals were based on the fact that those concerned were trade union officials or trade unionists or that they had carried out lawful trade union activities, to take steps to ensure that the dismissed workers might be immediately reinstated in their jobs if they so desire. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any development in this regard.(e) The Committee requests the Government to carry out as a matter of priority an inquiry concerning the threats made against trade unionists in two enterprises noted in the allegations in the free zones and to take strong measures to provide effective protection for the workers in these enterprises. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.In a communication dated  July , the Government states that Mr. Huezo was detained on charge of aggression against a national police officer as well as for illegal occupation of the workplace, resistance to public authorities and abusive use of the right to strike and to work. In addition, the Government indicates that Mr. Huezo was released on  April  since the penalties in case he is found guilty of such offences is less than three years of prison. There would still be an additional charge against this trade unionist based on allegations of, inter alia, false testimony, sequestration, murder threats, illegal detention, defamation and damages and interests, filed in November .
.The Committee notes this information and requests the Government to keep it informed of the legal proceedings against Mr. Huezo. The Committee notes that the Government, on the other hand, has not provided any information with regard to the other allegations examined, and hopes that the Government will do so in the near future.
.The complaints in this case are contained in communications from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the International Textile, Garment and Leather Workers' Federation, dated  March and  April  respectively. Subsequently, the International Textile, Garment and Leather Workers' Federation sent additional information in a communication dated  May .
.The Government sent partial observations in a communication dated  February .
.El Salvador has not ratified either the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communications of  March and  April , the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the International Textile, Garment and Leather Workers' Federation allege that on  March , Juan Jos Huezo, Secretary-General of the National Trade Union Federation of Salvadorean Workers (FENESTRAS) and Secretary-General of the Trade Union of Workers in the Textiles, Similar and Affiliated Industries (STITAS) and Mrs. Sarahi Molina, Secretary of National and International Relations of FENESTRAS and official of STITAS, went to the JATEX enterprise to discuss issues concerning the staff with the owner of this enterprise. The complainant organizations state that whilst the discussions were taking place, the police entered and arrested Mr. Huezo and obliged Mrs. Sarahi Molina to sign, at gunpoint and in front of the police, an agreement accepting the conditions proposed by the enterprise. The complainant organizations add that during his transfer to the police station Mr. Huezo was beaten up by the police and initially informed that a considerable number of serious charges would be brought against him.
.Furthermore, the International Textile, Garment and Leather Workers' Federation states that on  March , Mrs. Julia Esperanza Quintanilla, who took an active part in the setting up of a trade union",0,1995,El Salvador
200,"in the Gabo S.A. enterprise, had strong stomach pains and asked her employer to allow her to seek medical assistance; however in direct retaliation for her trade union activities the authorities refused her request. The complainant organization points out that the trade unionist waited until the lunch break to ask for assistance at the local social security hospital which refused any medical treatment on the grounds that her employer had not paid social security contributions or submitted any documentation on her job and that finally she died that same night. The complainant organization states that a number of workers asked the enterprise to be allowed to take time off work to go to her funeral and that in spite of their request being refused  workers did go to the funeral and were consequently dismissed.
.The complaint organization adds that on  March , the owners of the Sanobang Wool Apparel El Salvador S.A. enterprise, in the El Pedregal free zone, detained three workers - one of whom was a member of the executive of the trade union set up in the enterprise - and refused to let them go if they did not sign their resignations. The complainant organization points out that subsequently the owners of the enterprise called in the police and that these three workers were arrested and dismissed - and that the enterprise refused to reinstate them.
.In its communication of  May , the International Textile, Garment and Leather Workers' Federation alleges that a campaign is being carried out by the owners of the textiles factory, Mandarn International, operating in the free zone of San Marcos, to put an end to the enterprise trade union. The complainant organization points out that from the time that the Mandarn International Trade Union of Workers was legally recognized on  February , the enterprise has been carrying out a systematic campaign to destroy the trade union and intimidate the  workers. The enterprise has carried out two lock-outs and dismissed  workers belonging to the trade union; furthermore, it has recruited  private security guards who have threatened and insulted the workers and detained trade union officials. The complainant organization states that the administrator of the free zone of San Marcos informed the workers that ""blood would flow"" if, in one way or another, the trade union did not leave the Mandarn International enterprise. Finally, the complainant organization adds that on  May , the trade union in the Mandarn International enterprise decided to call a strike to protest against the illegal dismissals and that during the strike the security guards attacked the trade union officials. During this attack, the trade union official, Mrs. Marta Rivas, had one of her legs fractured and the Secretary-General of the trade union was detained for several hours and beaten up by the company guards.
.In its communication dated  February , the Government stated that Mandarn International S.A. of C.V. categorically refuted the allegations made as being unfounded, tendentious and far from the truth. Mandarn International presented the resignations, dated  December , of all of the trade union officials to the Ministry of Labour and Social Security and in which it can be noted that all of the irrevocable resignations from the officers' positions they previously held were undertaken voluntarily and without coercion and that they refused the reinstatement offered to them by the company to work in the same posts which they held previously and with the same working conditions. Moreover, the Government indicates that the company has stated that the resignation forms of the workers concerned were made on forms issued by the Inspection Department of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security which may only be transmitted in personal form to the persons concerned.
.Concretely, the Government states that the Mandarn International representative presented minutes established on  December  which indicate that Eliseo Castro Prez, General Secretary, Marlene Abrego, minutes and agreements secretary, Ren Flores Monge, cultural and propaganda secretary, Ana Ruth Barrientos, secretary of adolescent matters, Marta Aracely Rivas Ayala, secretary of national relations, Ana Silvia Urrutia Barcia, financial secretary and Marta Leonor Mejia, disputes secretary were offered reinstatement in their jobs, but decided not to accept them for personal reasons, being compensated for  per cent of their regular and supplementary benefits, including trade union immunity (fuero sindical). The Government adds that the same minutes show the vast and inclusive settlement which was granted to the trade union officials of Mandarn International referred to in this case, thus ending the economic collective dispute which was placed before the Ministry of Labour and Social Security. Moreover, the company representative clarified that the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, the Assistant Defence Attorney for the Rights of Women and the Assistant Defence Attorney for Human Rights were guarantors for the agreement made between the company and the union.
.First of all, the Committee regrets that the Government has only communicated partial observations on the serious allegations submitted, in spite of the time which has elapsed since the complaint was presented.
.The Committee notes that the allegations refer to the death of a trade unionist, as well as to arrests, physical attacks on and threats against trade union officials and trade unionists, and to anti-union dismissals - within various enterprises, including in free zones.
.The Committee would like to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that ""the rights of workers' and employers' organizations can only be exercised in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind against these organizations' leaders and members, and that it is for governments to ensure that this principle is respected"" (see st Report, Case No.  (Nicaragua), para.  and th Report, Case No.  (Colombia), para. ).
.With respect to the allegation concerning the death of a trade unionist belonging to the trade union in the Gabo S.A. enterprise, Mrs. Julia Esperanza Quintanilla, on  March , the Committee deeply regrets this death and requests the Government to take the necessary steps to carry out an independent inquiry to look into the allegations (according to the complainant organization the management at the enterprise refused the trade unionist the possibility of seeking medical assistance) and, if these are confirmed, to bring appropriate action before the law courts to establish responsibilities and punish those who are guilty. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.As regards the alleged arrest of the trade union official, Juan Jos Huezo, on  March  by the police, the Committee requests the Government to inform it whether he is still in prison and, in the affirmative, to explain the grounds for his arrest. Similarly, the Committee requests the Government to release him immediately if his arrest was connected with his trade union activities - if this has not already been done. The Committee points out to the Government that ""the detention of trade unionists for trade union activities or membership is contrary to the principles of freedom of association"" (see rd Report, Cases Nos. , , , , , , , ,  and  (El Salvador), para. ). The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed on the situation of Mr. Huezo.
.As regards the alleged detentions of a member of the trade union executive and two workers from the Sanobang Wool Apparel El Salvador S.A. enterprise by the authorities of the enterprise on  March , as well as the detention of Elisio Castro Prez, Secretary-General of the trade union of the textiles factory Mandarn International, by company guards and physical attacks against the trade union official of the same trade union, Mrs. Marta Rivas (both of which occurred on  May ), the Committee notes that according to the complainant organization those detained were deprived of their freedom for a number of hours. The Committee requests the Government to take steps to carry out an inquiry on these allegations of physical attacks and arrests carried out by members of the enterprise's security staff and ensure that if it is ascertained that the trade unionists in question were unlawfully deprived of their freedom - even if this was only for a short lapse of time - and that Mrs. Rivas was physically assaulted by the guards of the Mandarn International, appropriate action is brought before the courts to ensure that those guilty are duly punished. The Committee reiterates the principle mentioned in the previous paragraph and requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.As regards the allegations concerning the anti-union dismissals, the Committee notes that these concern  workers from the Gabo S.A. enterprise who attended the funeral of the trade unionist, Mrs. Julia Esperanza Quintanilla, during working hours; a member of the trade union executive and two workers from the Sanobang Wool Apparel El Salvador S.A. enterprise who refused to sign their resignations; and  members of the trade union of the Mandarn International enterprise. The Committee notes that the Government has not indicated the reasons for the",0,1995,El Salvador
201,"initial dismissal of seven trade union officials at the Mandarn International union and restricts itself to stating that they had resigned from their trade union positions, had refused an offer from the company to be reinstated in their posts and had accepted the corresponding indemnities. Moreover, the Committee notes that the Government did not provide observations on the allegations concerning the anti-trade union dismissals in the Gabo S.A. enterprise and that no information was provided on the allegations concerning the dismissal of  trade union members at Mandarn International. The Committee wishes to draw the Government's attention to the fact that ""no person should be dismissed or prejudiced in his employment by reason of his trade union membership or legitimate trade union activities ... and the importance of forbidding and penalizing in practice all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of employment"" (see th Report, Case No.  (Uruguay), para. , nd Report, Case No.  (El Salvador), para. , and th Report, Case No.  (Nicaragua), para. ). Furthermore, with respect to the dismissal of the  workers from the Gabo S.A. enterprise, the Committee is of the opinion that attending the funeral of a trade unionist who - according to the allegations - died as a result of her employers' refusal to allow her to seek the immediate medical assistance she needed, was a justified trade union act. The Committee considers that the means of dismissal in the above-mentioned circumstances is an excessive measure and that the workers in question should be reinstated in their jobs if they so desire. The Committee will examine the question of the alleged dismissals at Sanobang Wool Apparel El Salvador S.A. enterprise under Case No. , in which the complainant furnished greater and more detailed information on the circumstances surrounding the dismissals.
.In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to take steps immediately to carry out an inquiry in the enterprises mentioned in the previous paragraph (Gabo S.A. enterprise and Mandarn International) and if it is confirmed that the alleged dismissals were based on the fact that those concerned were trade union officials or trade unionists or that they had carried out lawful trade union activities, it should take steps to ensure that the dismissed workers are immediately reinstated in their jobs if they so desire. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the developments in this regard.
.Finally, as concerns the allegations submitted by the complainant organizations concerning two enterprises in free zones of El Salvador (according to the International Textile, Garment and Leather Workers' Federation, Mrs. Sarahi Molina, Secretary of National and International Relations of FENESTRAS and trade union official of STITAS, had been obliged by the JATEX enterprise to sign ""at gunpoint and in front of the police"" an agreement accepting the enterprise's conditions; and the administrator of the San Marcos free zone had on repeated occasions informed the workers that ""blood would flow"" if, in one way or another, the trade union did not leave the Mandarn International enterprise), the Committee requests the Government to carry out a full inquiry as a matter of priority in the above-mentioned enterprises and to take strong measures to provide effective protection for workers in these enterprises. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) Recalling that the rights of workers' and employers' organizations can only be exercised in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind against these organizations' leaders and members, and that it is for governments to ensure that this principle is respected, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps to carry out an independent inquiry to look into the allegations concerning the death of the trade unionist, Mrs. Julia Esperanza Quintanilla (according to the complainant organization the management of the enterprise refused the trade unionist the possibility of seeking medical assistance), and in the event that these facts are confirmed, to bring appropriate action before the courts in order to determine responsibilities and punish the guilty. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.(b) Reminding the Government that the detention of trade unionists on account of their trade union membership or activities is contrary to the principles of freedom of association, the Committee requests the Government to inform it whether Juan Jos Huezo is still in prison and, in the affirmative, to explain what charges have been brought against him. Similarly, the Committee requests the Government to release him immediately if his detention is connected with his trade union activities. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.(c) As regards the alleged arrests (by the security staff in the enterprises) of a member of the trade union executive and two workers of the Sanobang Wool Apparel El Salvador S.A. enterprise and Elisio Castro Prez, Secretary-General of the trade union of the textiles factory, Mandarn International, as well as the physical attacks on the trade union official of the same trade union, Mrs. Marta Rivas (both events allegedly occurred on  May ), the Committee requests the Government to take steps to carry out an inquiry into these allegations and, if it is ascertained that the trade unionists in question were unlawfully deprived of their freedom - even for a short period of time - and that Mrs. Rivas was physically attacked by the security guards of Mandarn International, to bring appropriate action before the courts so that the guilty should be duly punished. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.(d) Concerning the allegations relating to the anti-union dismissals of  workers in the Gabo S.A. enterprise and  trade union members in the Mandarn International enterprise, the Committee requests the Government to take steps immediately to carry out an inquiry in the enterprises in question and, in the event of noting that the alleged dismissals were based on the fact that those concerned were trade union officials or trade unionists or that they had carried out lawful trade union activities, to take steps to ensure that the dismissed workers might be immediately reinstated in their jobs if they so desire.

202,".The complaint under Case No. , presented by the International Federation of Building and Wood Workers (IFBWW), was examined by the Committee at its November  meeting, at which it reached interim conclusions (see st Report, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November )). No observations have been received since then from the Government.
.The complaint under Case No.  and additional information in support of it were presented by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) in communications dated  January,  May and  June . The complaint under Case No.  was presented by the National Sugar Industry Trade Union (SINA) in a communication dated  January .
.At its November  meeting, the Committee observed that, although the complaints had been presented or examined some time ago, it had not received the information that it had requested from the Government. The Committee drew the Government's attention to the fact that, in accordance with the procedural rules set out in paragraph  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body, it could present a report on the substance of these cases, even if the observations or information requested had not been received in due time. The Committee accordingly requested the Government to transmit its observations or information as a matter of urgency (see th Report of the Committee, para. ). Since then it has not received any reply from the Government.
.El Salvador has not ratified the Freedom of Association and protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.After the Committee's previous examination of the case (November ), the allegations concerning the dismissal of  workers from ARCO Engineering S.A. de C.V. for being members of the Trade Union of Building, Labourers and Similar Workers of El Salvador (SOICSES) and the arrest of eight striking workers as a result of a march were still pending. With regard to the latter allegation, the Government stated that the eight workers had been charged with assaulting the police, that the matter was before the courts and that the accused had been released pending their trial.
.The Committee made the following recommendations (see st Report, para. ): ""The Committee regrets that the Government has not replied to the allegation concerning the dismissal of  workers from the ARCO Engineering S.A. de C.V. enterprise, and asks it to do so before its next meeting""; ""The Committee asks the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the judicial proceedings against the workers - who have now been released - who were arrested on  August  as a result of a march of striking workers in the ARCO enterprise"".
.In its communications of  January,  May and  June , the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) alleges that on  March  Heriberto Galicia Snchez, an official of the National Sugar Industry Trade Union (SINA), and Pedro Constanza, a member of the Union, were assassinated. The same day, four SINA members of the Jiboa Central Sugar Refinery were seriously injured when unknown persons armed with machine guns shot at the vehicle in which they were travelling from the refinery.
.The complainant further alleges the following violations of trade union rights:- in November ,  workers of the La Central Distillery S.A. de C.V. were dismissed for organizing a trade union;- on  December , Mandarn Internacional S.A. de C.V. of the San Marcos free zone dismissed  members of the subsection of the Trade Union of Workers in the Cotton, Synthetics, Similar and Allied Industry, including the entire executive committee;- the dismissal from the Crdito Immobiliario S.A. banking enterprise of  members of the Trade Union of the General Industry of Bank Employees - including nine union officials - in order to bring about the union's ""legal"" dissolution since it would no longer have the minimum number of members.
.The National Sugar Industry Trade Union (SINA) alleges in its communication of  January  that two officials of the General Confederation of Trade Unions and of the Federation of Trade Unions of Food, Beverage and Similar Workers, with senior posts in the social service, have encouraged the setting up of a parallel trade union with the authorities with the intention of undermining the SINA. This is part of a strategic plan of the Government's that involves the two officials who support its policy.
.The SINA adds that there were irregularities in the constitution of the parallel trade union, which the Ministry of Labour supports, since the provisions of the Labour Code were not respected. Initially the parallel union was set up at the level of the industry, and it subsequently became an enterprise-level union without a new general assembly being held. The Ministry of Labour is currently backing the two officials who initiated the setting up of the parallel union so that the SINA loses its status as the official representative of the workers in INAZUCAR and CORSAIN.
.The Committee observes with serious concern that the allegations in the present cases refer to the assassination of, and injuries inflicted upon, union officials and members, to detentions, to numerous anti-trade union dismissals and to interference in the functioning of trade union organizations.
.The Committee regrets that, despite the direct contacts mission which took place in El Salvador in , serious violations of trade union rights have subsequently occurred and with respect to which the Government has not sent any comments.
.To begin with, the Committee cannot but deplore the fact that the Government has not responded to the allegations despite repeated invitations to it to send its observations, including an urgent appeal by the Committee at its November  meeting (see th Report, para. ). This being so, and in accordance with the relevant procedure (see para.  of the th Report of the Committee, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session), the Committee finds itself obliged to submit a report on the substance of the matter since it does not possess the information that it hoped to receive from the Government. In this connection, the Committee reminds the Government that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and the Committee is confident that, if it protects the government against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side will recognize the importance for their credibility of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to such detailed factual charges as may be put forward (see First Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body in March ).
.With respect to the alleged assassinations (Heriberto Galicia Snchez, an official of the SINA, and Pedro Constanza, a member of the same trade union) and attempts to cause bodily harm (four members of the SINA), the Committee condemns these crimes and calls on the Government to take the necessary steps as quickly as possible to initiate procedures to clarify the facts, determine responsibilities and punish the guilty parties, and to keep it informed of the outcome of those procedures. Furthermore, the Committee reiterates its previous conclusions concerning the detention of eight workers at ARCO Engineering S.A. de C.V. who were later freed. The Committee therefore requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the judicial proceeding against these workers who are currently free and who were detained on  August  as a result of a march of strikers at the ARCO enterprise.
.With regard to the allegations of anti-union discrimination, the Committee observes that the complainants have referred to the following cases: dismissal of  workers from the La Central Distillery S.A. de C.V. for having set up a trade union; dismissal by Mandarn Internacional S.A. de C.V. of  members of the Trade Union of Workers in the Cotton, Synthetics, Similar and Allied Industry (including the entire executive committee); and dismissal from Crdito Immobiliario S.A. of  members of the Trade Union of the General Industry of Bank Employees (including nine union officials), with the intention of bringing the union's membership below the legal minimum.
.In this connection, the Committee draws the Government's attention to the principle that no worker should be dismissed for union membership or activities, stresses its concern at the high number of alleged anti-union dismissals and requests the Government to conduct an investigation, as rapidly as possible, into whether the dismissals in the said enterprises were on account of the workers' union membership or activities and, if so, to take the necessary measures to enable them to secure reinstatement in their jobs and to ensure the application against the said enterprises of the corresponding legal sanctions. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of this investigation and any reinstatement of the workers.
.With regard to the alleged anti-union interference against the SINA with a view to the creation of a parallel trade union in the INAZUCAR and CORSAIN enterprises, the Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that",0,1994,El Salvador
203,"the public authorities and employers should refrain from promoting the creation of trade union organizations dominated by them. Consequently, the Committee requests the Government to conduct an immediate investigation into the allegations and, should they prove founded, to take legal action against those responsible for the interference. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed on the subject.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) With regard to the alleged assassinations (Heriberto Galicia Snchez, an official of the SINA, and Pedro Constanza, a member of the same trade union) and attempts to cause bodily harm (four members of the SINA), the Committee condemns these crimes and calls on the Government to take the necessary steps to initiate procedures as rapidly as possible to clarify the facts, determine responsibilities and punish the guilty parties, and to keep it informed of the outcome of those procedures.(b) The Committee once again requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the judicial proceeding against the workers who are currently free but were detained on  August  as a result of a march of striking workers at the ARCO enterprise.(c) With regard to the numerous allegations of anti-union dismissals in ARCO Ingenieros S.A. de C.V., the La Central Distillery S.A. de C.V., Mandarn Internacional S.A. de C.V. and Crdito Immobiliario S.A., the Committee draws the Government's attention to the principle that no worker should be dismissed for union membership or activities, and requests the Government to conduct an investigation, as rapidly as possible, into whether the dismissals in the said enterprises were on account of the workers' union membership or activities and, if so, to take the necessary measures to enable these workers to secure reinstatement in their posts and to ensure the application of legal sanctions against the above-mentioned enterprises.

This being so, and in accordance with the relevant procedure (see para.  of the th Report of the Committee, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session), the Committee finds itself obliged to submit a report on the substance of the matter since it does not possess the information that it hoped to receive from the Government. In this connection, the Committee reminds the Government that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and the Committee is confident that, if it protects the government against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side will recognize the importance for their credibility of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to such detailed factual charges as may be put forward (see First Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body in March ).
.With respect to the alleged assassinations (Heriberto Galicia Snchez, an official of the SINA, and Pedro Constanza, a member of the same trade union) and attempts to cause bodily harm (four members of the SINA), the Committee condemns these crimes and calls on the Government to take the necessary steps as quickly as possible to initiate procedures to clarify the facts, determine responsibilities and punish the guilty parties, and to keep it informed of the outcome of those procedures. Furthermore, the Committee reiterates its previous conclusions concerning the detention of eight workers at ARCO Engineering S.A. de C.V. who were later freed. The Committee therefore requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the judicial proceeding against these workers who are currently free and who were detained on  August  as a result of a march of strikers at the ARCO enterprise.
.With regard to the allegations of anti-union discrimination, the Committee observes that the complainants have referred to the following cases: dismissal of  workers from the La Central Distillery S.A. de C.V. for having set up a trade union; dismissal by Mandarn Internacional S.A. de C.V. of  members of the Trade Union of Workers in the Cotton, Synthetics, Similar and Allied Industry (including the entire executive committee); and dismissal from Crdito Immobiliario S.A. of  members of the Trade Union of the General Industry of Bank Employees (including nine union officials), with the intention of bringing the union's membership below the legal minimum.
.In this connection, the Committee draws the Government's attention to the principle that no worker should be dismissed for union membership or activities, stresses its concern at the high number of alleged anti-union dismissals and requests the Government to conduct an investigation, as rapidly as possible, into whether the dismissals in the said enterprises were on account of the workers' union membership or activities and, if so, to take the necessary measures to enable them to secure reinstatement in their jobs and to ensure the application against the said enterprises of the corresponding legal sanctions. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of this investigation and any reinstatement of the workers.
.With regard to the alleged anti-union interference against the SINA with a view to the creation of a parallel trade union in the INAZUCAR and CORSAIN enterprises, the Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that",-1,1994,El Salvador
205,"the public authorities and employers should refrain from promoting the creation of trade union organizations dominated by them. Consequently, the Committee requests the Government to conduct an immediate investigation into the allegations and, should they prove founded, to take legal action against those responsible for the interference. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed on the subject.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) With regard to the alleged assassinations (Heriberto Galicia Snchez, an official of the SINA, and Pedro Constanza, a member of the same trade union) and attempts to cause bodily harm (four members of the SINA), the Committee condemns these crimes and calls on the Government to take the necessary steps to initiate procedures as rapidly as possible to clarify the facts, determine responsibilities and punish the guilty parties, and to keep it informed of the outcome of those procedures.(b) The Committee once again requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the judicial proceeding against the workers who are currently free but were detained on  August  as a result of a march of striking workers at the ARCO enterprise.(c) With regard to the numerous allegations of anti-union dismissals in ARCO Ingenieros S.A. de C.V., the La Central Distillery S.A. de C.V., Mandarn Internacional S.A. de C.V. and Crdito Immobiliario S.A., the Committee draws the Government's attention to the principle that no worker should be dismissed for union membership or activities, and requests the Government to conduct an investigation, as rapidly as possible, into whether the dismissals in the said enterprises were on account of the workers' union membership or activities and, if so, to take the necessary measures to enable these workers to secure reinstatement in their posts and to ensure the application of legal sanctions against the above-mentioned enterprises.

206,".The complaint under Case No. , presented by the International Federation of Building and Wood Workers (IFBWW), was examined by the Committee at its November  meeting, at which it reached interim conclusions (see st Report, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November )). No observations have been received since then from the Government.
.The complaint under Case No.  and additional information in support of it were presented by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) in communications dated  January,  May and  June . The complaint under Case No.  was presented by the National Sugar Industry Trade Union (SINA) in a communication dated  January .
.At its November  meeting, the Committee observed that, although the complaints had been presented or examined some time ago, it had not received the information that it had requested from the Government. The Committee drew the Government's attention to the fact that, in accordance with the procedural rules set out in paragraph  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body, it could present a report on the substance of these cases, even if the observations or information requested had not been received in due time. The Committee accordingly requested the Government to transmit its observations or information as a matter of urgency (see th Report of the Committee, para. ). Since then it has not received any reply from the Government.
.El Salvador has not ratified the Freedom of Association and protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.After the Committee's previous examination of the case (November ), the allegations concerning the dismissal of  workers from ARCO Engineering S.A. de C.V. for being members of the Trade Union of Building, Labourers and Similar Workers of El Salvador (SOICSES) and the arrest of eight striking workers as a result of a march were still pending. With regard to the latter allegation, the Government stated that the eight workers had been charged with assaulting the police, that the matter was before the courts and that the accused had been released pending their trial.
.The Committee made the following recommendations (see st Report, para. ): ""The Committee regrets that the Government has not replied to the allegation concerning the dismissal of  workers from the ARCO Engineering S.A. de C.V. enterprise, and asks it to do so before its next meeting""; ""The Committee asks the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the judicial proceedings against the workers - who have now been released - who were arrested on  August  as a result of a march of striking workers in the ARCO enterprise"".
.In its communications of  January,  May and  June , the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) alleges that on  March  Heriberto Galicia Snchez, an official of the National Sugar Industry Trade Union (SINA), and Pedro Constanza, a member of the Union, were assassinated. The same day, four SINA members of the Jiboa Central Sugar Refinery were seriously injured when unknown persons armed with machine guns shot at the vehicle in which they were travelling from the refinery.
.The complainant further alleges the following violations of trade union rights:- in November ,  workers of the La Central Distillery S.A. de C.V. were dismissed for organizing a trade union;- on  December , Mandarn Internacional S.A. de C.V. of the San Marcos free zone dismissed  members of the subsection of the Trade Union of Workers in the Cotton, Synthetics, Similar and Allied Industry, including the entire executive committee;- the dismissal from the Crdito Immobiliario S.A. banking enterprise of  members of the Trade Union of the General Industry of Bank Employees - including nine union officials - in order to bring about the union's ""legal"" dissolution since it would no longer have the minimum number of members.
.The National Sugar Industry Trade Union (SINA) alleges in its communication of  January  that two officials of the General Confederation of Trade Unions and of the Federation of Trade Unions of Food, Beverage and Similar Workers, with senior posts in the social service, have encouraged the setting up of a parallel trade union with the authorities with the intention of undermining the SINA. This is part of a strategic plan of the Government's that involves the two officials who support its policy.
.The SINA adds that there were irregularities in the constitution of the parallel trade union, which the Ministry of Labour supports, since the provisions of the Labour Code were not respected. Initially the parallel union was set up at the level of the industry, and it subsequently became an enterprise-level union without a new general assembly being held. The Ministry of Labour is currently backing the two officials who initiated the setting up of the parallel union so that the SINA loses its status as the official representative of the workers in INAZUCAR and CORSAIN.
.The Committee observes with serious concern that the allegations in the present cases refer to the assassination of, and injuries inflicted upon, union officials and members, to detentions, to numerous anti-trade union dismissals and to interference in the functioning of trade union organizations.
.The Committee regrets that, despite the direct contacts mission which took place in El Salvador in , serious violations of trade union rights have subsequently occurred and with respect to which the Government has not sent any comments.

.The complaint in this case is contained in a communication from the International Federation of Building and Wood Workers (IFBWW), dated  January . The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) endorsed the complaint in a communication dated  February . The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  May .
.El Salvador has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The International Federation of Building and Wood Workers (IFBWW) states in its communication dated  January  that in July  the Trade Union of Building Labourers and Similar Workers of El Salvador (SOICSES) launched a strike at the Mercado Tinety building site of the ARCO Engineering SA de CV enterprise, to press for the reinstatement of  workers dismissed because of their trade union membership, and presented a number of claims concerning the poor treatment being given to workers, the failure to implement wage agreements and the infringement of different provisions of the Labour Code. It points out that after conciliation meetings organized by the Ministry of Labour, several of these claims were met, although the dismissed workers were not reinstated. In July , following an appeal filed in the courts by the ARCO enterprise, the strike was declared illegal on the ground that the project in question ought to have been defined as a public service and therefore subject to the provisions of section  of the Labour Code, which states that strikes are illegal in the public services and in essential services.
.The complainant points out that only a small group of workers returned to work after the judicial notice, and that during the following days there was an increase in the number of armed police assigned to protect the workers, which was seen as a direct intimidation against the strikers. An agreement was reached on  August  whereby the enterprise accepted the gradual reinstatement of the dismissed workers, although it did not fulfil the agreement and on  August began to recruit new workers. The complainant states that the striking workers ended their strike and decided to return to work but that, on  August, the enterprise refused to grant them access, and following the organization of a peaceful march towards the offices of the enterprise, which was violently intercepted by the national police, eight workers were arrested.
.In its communication of  May , the Government states that following a collective labour dispute between the Trade Union of Building Labourers and Similar Workers of El Salvador (SOICSES) and the ARCO Engineering SA de CV enterprise (the workers in the enterprise had gone on strike in support of different claims, such as the reinstatement of dismissed workers; the payment of a period of increased pay; the mistreatment of workers in the enterprise; the granting of social benefits; the full payment of wages during the period of the dispute), the Directorate-General of Labour convened the parties to a conciliation hearing in July . As a result of this meeting, some of the workers' claims were met, and following a second meeting both parties agreed to set up a joint committee to work out an agreement on the dispute. When no agreement was reached, the Directorate-General of Labour convened the parties to a further hearing and proposed a settlement of which both parties rejected. The Secretariat of State points out that efforts have and are still being made to normalize relations between the workers and the employer.
.Finally, the Government states that the courts declared the strike illegal and the strikers were notified that they must return to their workplaces. On  August the workers held a march towards the offices of the enterprise, which resulted in acts of public disorder and the arrest of eight workers on charges of assaulting the police. The matter was placed before the courts and the preliminary inquiries are now under way. The accused have been released pending their trial.
.The Committee notes that this case refers to disputes between the Trade Union of Building Labourers and Similar Workers of El Salvador (SOICSES) and the ARCO Engineering SA de CV enterprise. Specifically, the complainants allege the dismissal of  workers because of their trade union membership, and that as a result of these dismissals the workers of the enterprise launched a strike which led to the dismissal of a large number of the striking workers. In the same way, a march by striking workers allegedly resulted in violent intervention and the arrest of eight workers by the police.
.The Committee regrets that the Government has not replied to the allegation concerning the dismissal of  workers because of their trade union membership, and requests it to do so before its next meeting. The Committee also regrets that the Government has not referred specifically to the dismissal of other workers as a result of a strike at one of the worksites of the ARCO Engineering SA de CV enterprise, and has simply stated that the Directorate-General of Labour attempted, in different meetings and conciliation hearings, to establish agreement between the parties; although the enterprise accepted some of the workers' claims, the strike was declared illegal by the judicial authorities.
.The Committee notes in this respect that the Government did not deny the complainant's allegation that the declaration of the illegality of the strike at the Mercado Tinety building site was based on section  of the Labour Code, which states that strikes in the public or essential services are illegal. On this subject, the Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that in accordance with its constant principles, strikes should not be prohibited in the building industry, since prohibitions or major restrictions should be allowed only in essential services in the strict sense of the term (that is, those services whose interruption would endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population). Therefore, the Committee urges the Government to take the necessary measures so that the workers who were dismissed as a result of the strike are reinstated in their jobs and to amend the Labour Code to ensure full respect of the above-mentioned principle.
.Finally, as regards the workers arrested on  August , following a march organized by the striking workers, the Committee notes that the Government states that this march resulted in acts of public disorder which led",0,1993,El Salvador
208,"to the arrest of eight workers on charges of assaulting the police; the respective proceedings are under way and these workers have now been released pending their trial. In the circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the judicial proceedings against these workers.
.In the light of the foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee regrets that the Government has not replied to the allegation concerning the dismissal of  workers from the ARCO Engineering SA de CV enterprise, and asks it to do so before its next meeting.(b) The Committee urges the Government to take the necessary measures so that the workers dismissed after a strike in the above-mentioned enterprise are reinstated in their jobs, and to amend section  of the Labour Code so that strikes may be prohibited only in essential services in the strict sense of the term.(c) The Committee asks the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the judicial proceedings against the workers - who have now been released - who were arrested on  August  as a result of a march of striking workers in the ARCO enterprise.",0,1993,El Salvador
209,".The Port Workers' Union of El Salvador (SIPES) lodged a complaint against the Government of El Salvador in a communication dated  July . The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  May .
.El Salvador has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ) or the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  July , the Port Workers' Union of El Salvador (SIPES) alleges that on  February  it set up a departmental section for the workers in the International Airport of El Salvador and that its registration was refused by a resolution issued by the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare on  May .
.The complainant organization considers that this ministerial resolution infringes the exercise of freedom of association and states that the trade union's request was turned down on the following grounds:-workers employed in the airport may not be considered as port workers;-most of the members of the section are workers employed by the Independent Port Executive Board (CEPA), a decentralized state body in charge of administering Acajutla harbour, the International Airport of El Salvador and the railways; furthermore, they are bound to the State because of their appointment to posts regulated by the Wages Act, which excludes them from the scope of the Labour Code;-as the association is an industrial union, it may only create a section in a department of the Republic which includes workers from a number of enterprises, and not just one; and-an industrial union cannot exist within a state enterprise.
.In its communication of  May , the Government gives the grounds put forward by the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare in its resolution of  May , for refusing the registration of the departmental section of the complainant organization in the International Airport of El Salvador; the Government states specifically that:The Secretary-General of the Port Workers' Union of El Salvador (SIPES) submitted to the State Secretariat of Labour documents concerning the departmental section of La Paz, made up exclusively of workers from the International Airport of El Salvador, so that it might examine them with a view to registering this section. Many members of SIPES work for the Independent Port Executive Board (CEPA), an independent public body which employs staff at the airport under the Wages Act, and is administered and regulated by special legislation; the branch of CEPA in question, does not carry out activities related to ports but operations specific to an airport.
.The Government points out that under the special Act concerning the establishment, administration and running of the International Airport of El Salvador, the CEPA has been made responsible for planning, administering and implementing the project for the building of a new international airport, and that once the airport has been built, it will be entrusted with the management, administration, maintenance and extension of all the airport installations. Section () of the Labour Code defines an industrial union as one made up of employers or workers from enterprises in the same industrial, commercial or service activities or similar areas. Section  of the Labour Code establishes that the provisions of the previous paragraph apply to those wishing to establish a trade union, but that the payrolls must also indicate the economic activity carried out by the enterprise in which the workers are employed. These provisions also apply to the establishment of a section or subsection of this type of trade union; if an industrial union operates within an enterprise, a section or a subsection may not be established since this would mean the existence of several executive bodies of a trade union within the same enterprise. Article  of the SIPES internal rules stipulates that only workers in enterprises engaged in the same industrial, commercial or service activities specific to port duties may join the Port Workers' Union of El Salvador, which is in line with the provisions of section () of the Labour Code; the trade union may not, therefore, have members or establish a section in a body dependent upon CEPA, which carries out activities specific to an airport which are different from those carried out in a port. Section  of the Labour Code establishes that industrial and craft unions may be organized into sections and subsections and that the sections cover administrative departments of the Republic and the subsections cover enterprises or establishments in which the trade union has members. Section () of the Labour Code stipulates that sections be made up of workers belonging to a trade union in different enterprises in a department of the Republic, either in the same or a different town, so that a section may not consist of workers from only one enterprise, if there is a general executive board. On the basis of section () of the Labour Code, CEPA was requested to provide the payroll of the International Airport of El Salvador, which showed that of the  members of the trade union section, two of them worked under an individual employment contract and the remainder were appointed under the Wages Act. This was carried out for the purposes indicated in section () of the Labour Code, which stipulates that ""The employment relationships concluded by the State, the local authorities and independent or semi-independent public institutions under public law, established under administrative Act, shall not be governed by the Code. This also applies to the appointment of a post classified under the Wages Act and financed by the general fund and special funds of these institutions or municipal budgets; and to a contract issued for the provision of professional or technical services. The Government points out that, in the light of the above-mentioned legal provisions, the Secretariat of Labour and Social Welfare decided to refuse the registration of the La Paz departmental section of the Port Workers' Union of El Salvador. The Government emphatically rejects the complainant's accusations and points out that the present administration is striving to ensure the overall well-being of the population and thus must comply with the legal system in force.
.The Committee notes that in this case the complainant alleged the refusal of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare to register a departmental trade union section of the Port Workers' Union of El Salvador, made up of workers from the International Airport of El Salvador. The Committee notes that the Ministry of Labour justified the refusal of the registration of this section on the following grounds:-the majority of workers in the section are not regulated by the Labour Code but by a special law, since their employment relationship is of a public nature and they do not carry out harbour activities but those specific to an airport (building, maintenance, administration, etc.). Section  of the Labour Code defines an industrial union as one made up of employers or workers from enterprises carrying out the same activity; it also applies to trade union sections;-section  of the Labour Code also requires that any section of a trade union in a department of the Republic should be made up of workers from more than one enterprise.
.In this respect, the Committee would like to recall the principle that workers, without distinction whatsoever, should have the right to establish organizations of their own choosing without previous authorization. Consequently, a trade union of port workers should not be prevented from setting up a trade union section in an airport if they so wish. This principle of workers' free choice of the type and structure of their trade union organization also implies that the fact that they are governed by the Labour Code or a special Act regulating labour relations in the public sector should not mean that they are unable to establish a trade union section containing both categories of workers. Finally, requiring industrial trade unions at national level to include workers from more than one enterprise in sections they establish in new departments of the Republic, places an unjustified restriction on their activities - especially in view of the fact that, depending upon the department in question, there may be only one airport.
.In these circumstances, the Committee considers that the Port Workers' Union of El Salvador should be able to set up a section for workers from the International Airport of El Salvador. It requests the Government to register legally the section set up on  February  as well as to take steps to have the legislation amended so that the registration of a trade union or a section thereof does not depend on the Government and so as to guarantee fully the right of workers freely to establish and join organizations of their own choosing.
.In light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)The Committee considers that the Port Workers' Union of El Salvador should be able to set up a section for workers from the International Airport of El Salvador and requests the Government to register legally",1,1992,El Salvador
210,the section set up on  February .(b)The Committee also requests the Government to take the necessary steps to have the legislation amended so that the registration of a trade union or a section of a trade union does not depend on the Government and so as to guarantee fully the right of workers freely to establish and join organizations of their own choosing.,-1,1992,El Salvador
211,".The Committee has examined Cases Nos. , ,  and  on several occasions, most recently at its meeting of May , when it submitted an interim report (see the Committee's th Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (May )), which drew attention to the Government's persistent negative attitude, shown since February  by its refusal to accept a direct contacts mission to the country and by its failure, in spite of the extreme seriousness of the allegations, to send the information requested by the Committee.
.Consequently, at said meeting the Committee once again urged the Government to send the information requested and to accept the mission in question; it also requested the Director-General of the ILO to contact the representatives of the Government of El Salvador at the next session of the International Labour Conference (June ), and to urge the Government to respect fully the Committee's recommendations. (See the Committee's th Report, paras.  and (f) and (g).)
.Following contacts at the Conference, the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare agreed to the direct contacts mission.
.In addition, the IFCTU submitted new allegations in the context of Case No.  in a communication of  June  (see the attached summary in the direct contacts mission report, para. ).
.The Director-General of the ILO appointed Professor Jos Vida Soria, Professor of Labour Law at the University of Grenada, and President of the Committee of Experts of the European Social Charter, to carry out the direct contacts mission, assisted by a member of the Freedom of Association Branch of the ILO. The mission took place from  September to  October .
.The Committee notes that the mission met with Dr. Juan Sifontes, Minister of Labour and Social Welfare, Dr. Carlos Mauricio Molina, Attorney-General for Human Rights, Dr. Estela Avila, Chief of the International Relations Office of the Ministry of Labour, as well as with representatives of Interoccupational Coordination (UNTS, UNOC, AGEPYM, CGT, FESINCONSTRAM, CTS, etc.) and of the National Association of Private Enterprise (NAPE). It also met with Dr. Augusto Ramirez Ocampo, Chief of the United Nations Observer Mission (ONUSAL) and with several senior officials from ONUSAL. The Committee also notes that the government authorities and the representatives of workers' and employers' organizations collaborated closely with the mission, and that government authorities gave every assistance.
.The Committee has also noted Professor Jos Vida Soria's mission report (see Annex I), as well as the Government's observations addressed to the Committee and to the mission concerning outstanding allegations.
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In as much as the direct contacts mission report contained in the Annex summarizes not only the substance of outstanding allegations, but also the Committee's previous conclusions and recommendations, as well as the Government's observations and the new allegations, the Committee proceeds directly to its conclusions and recommendations.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee notes with interest the improvement in various important aspects of the trade union situation and, especially, the decline in violence to a point, where - according to the mission report - in the last  months there have only been isolated acts of violence against trade unionists although threats have been made in certain cases.(b) Notwithstanding the current improvements in the situation, the Committee deplores once again the numerous and serious acts of violence to which the trade union movement and their leaders have been subjected in recent years and which have often resulted in loss of life or the violation of the most fundamental human and trade union rights. The Committee calls on the Government to ensure that such events are never repeated. The Committee calls on the Government to keep it informed of developments in the judicial investigations into the various cases of trade unionists being murdered or assaulted, or who disappeared in recent years. In the Committee's opinion, the absence of judgements against the guilty parties creates, in practice, a situation of impunity, which reinforces the climate of violence and insecurity, and which is extremely damaging to the exercise of trade union rights.(c) Regarding the arrest of trade unionists and threats made against them in recent years, and while it notes with interest that there are no trade unionists at present under arrest for trade union activities, the Committee deplores the large number of trade unionists who have been arrested in recent years, the threats that have been made and the climate of intimidation in which trade union activity has often taken place; it hopes that such occurrences, which prevent the normal exercise of trade union rights, will not be repeated in the future.(d) Bearing in mind the allegations of anti-union discrimination in the cases under examination and that the mission report mentions that trade union organizations have denounced many such instances, the Committee urges the Government, in its forthcoming revision of the Labour Code and in the future Act respecting industrial relations in the public administration (for which the Government has requested ILO technical assistance), to guarantee adequate protection against dismissal and other acts of discrimination for carrying out legitimate trade union activities, such as the establishment of a trade union.(e) The Committee expresses its strong reprobation and its serious concern with respect to the kidnapping of the six-month-old son of trade unionist Lucas Bernal Mrmol. The Committee insists that the Government make vigorous efforts to find the child and to punish the kidnappers and requests it to keep it informed in this regard.(f) The Committee reminds the Government that the ILO may provide its help in order to provide information on the contents of the Conventions on freedom of association with a view to possible ratifications.
.The Committee on Freedom of Association, set up by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ), met at the International Labour Office, Geneva, on ,  and  May  under the chairmanship of Mr. Jean-Jacques Oechslin, former Chairman of the Governing Body.
.The Committee had before it various complaints of violations of freedom of association in El Salvador, presented by a number of international and national trade union organizations (Cases Nos. , / and ).
.On several occasions the Governing Body asked the Government to give its consent that a representative of the Director-General visit El Salvador to carry out a study of the facts relating to the complaints, within the context of the direct contacts procedure.
.At the March  Session, the Government had not yet given a positive response to the direct contacts mission nor to the allegations concerning these cases. In these circumstances, the Committee recommended that if no reply was received from the Government prior to its next meeting, wider publicity should be given to the Committee's report.
.Since then, no reply has been received from the Government. The Committee submits for the approval of the Governing Body a further report on this matter and recommends that it examine this report at its th Session.
.In examining Cases Nos. , ,  and  at its February  meeting (see th Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (March )), the Committee deplored and emphasized the seriousness of the outstanding allegations and the new allegations which referred to the murder and disappearance of a large number of trade union leaders, as well as to death threats, physical attacks, arrest and detention of workers and trade unionists, the searching of trade unionists' homes, the searching and ransacking of trade union premises and acts of anti-union discrimination (see th Report, para. ).
.The Committee noted, once again, the Government's manifest lack of cooperation in observing the Committee's procedure and, specifically, the inexplicable failure to send almost any of the information repeatedly requested by the Committee so as to enable it to determine the veracity of the outstanding allegations. The Committee pointed out that it had made use of urgent appeals that had been ignored, and found itself obliged, in view of the time that had elapsed since the allegations had been presented, to examine those cases once again without having the Government's observations in respect of the large majority of the allegations presented by the complainants (see th Report, para. ).
.In addition, the Committee recalled that it had requested the Government, in February, May and November  and in February and May , to accept a direct contacts mission (see th Report, para. , th Report, para. , th Report, para. , st Report, paras.  and , and rd Report, para. ), there having been no response to those requests by the Government (see th Report, para. ).
.The Committee drew attention to the Government's persistent negative attitude, shown since February  by its refusal to accept a direct contacts mission to the country. The Committee, bearing in mind that the Government has shown for many years, despite the extreme seriousness",2,1990,El Salvador
212,"of the allegations, an almost total lack of cooperation with the Committee's procedure, pointed out that it intended to examine the present cases once again in May . If the Government again failed to send the required information in a full and detailed manner and if it did not accept the direct contacts mission, the Committee would recommend to the Governing Body to give the widest publicity to the report in question (see th Report, para. ).
.Since that time, the Government has still not transmitted the information requested by the Committee and has failed to respond to the Committee's request that it accept a direct contacts mission. In these circumstances, the Committee has decided to submit a new report on these cases to the Governing Body.
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee notes, once again, the Government's manifest lack of cooperation in observing the Committee's procedure and, specifically, the inexplicable failure to send almost any of the information repeatedly requested by the Committee so as to enable it to determine the veracity of the outstanding allegations. The Committee has made use of urgent appeals that have been ignored, and finds itself obliged, in view of the time that has elapsed since the allegations were presented, to examine these cases once again without having the Government's observations in respect of the large majority of the allegations presented by the complainants.
.The Committee once again reminds the Government that the aim of the whole procedure is to ensure respect for trade union rights, both in law and in practice. The Committee is convinced that whilst this procedure protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side should formulate, so as to allow objective examination, factual replies to the allegations brought against them (First Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body in March ).
.The Committee deplores and emphasizes the seriousness of the outstanding allegations and the new allegations which refer to the murder and disappearance of a large number of trade union leaders, as well as to death threats, physical attacks, arrest and detention of workers and trade unionists, the searching of trade unionists' homes, the searching and sacking of trade union premises and acts of anti-union discrimination.
.The Committee takes note of the Government's observations to the effect that it has been decided to shelve the case relating to the investigation into the criminal act of setting off explosives in the headquarters of FENASTRAS in October  which left nine persons dead and many injured, a decision which was taken in view of the impossibility of identifying the authors of this criminal act and since no group had claimed responsibility for it. The Committee considers it unacceptable in such circumstances that the investigation has been shelved because of the fact that the inquiries undertaken by a special (non-judicial) ad hoc commission failed to produce positive results. The Committee stresses the obligation on the Government to undertake the necessary measures so as to identify and punish those responsible for this condemnable attack so that the application of rapid and efficient justice serves in the re-establishment of peace.
.As regards the new allegations presented by the ICFTU, the Committee takes note of the Government's remarks to the effect that the judicial inquiries are currently under way into the murder of Porfirio Vsquez and Miguel Angel Martnez. The Committee deplores these murders and expresses the hope that the judicial procedures that are under way will serve to clarify the facts and lead to the punishment of the guilty parties. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the result of the judicial inquiries undertaken.
.The Committee likewise takes note of the information sent by the Government in which it states that  members of the National Association of Agricultural Workers (ANTA) were evicted from the San Francisco de Ass Hacienda in the cantn of Ro Fro, Achaupan jurisdiction, and arrested on a charge of usurpation; however, after the competent court considered the case, they were released. The Committee also notes that Carlos Aguilar Garca, Norma Elizabeth Flores Portillo, Carlos Enrique Escobar Figueroa, Evelyn Jeannette Alvarado Crisstomo and Mara Cristina Alvarenga were arrested by the Hacienda police upon being caught painting anti-government slogans, but that they were released following the intervention of the competent magistrates' court in the absence of sufficient grounds for their further detention. The Committee considers that the detention of the mentioned trade unionists and of the  workers belonging to ANTA is an act that should not be repeated, and draws the Government's attention to the fact that the arrest of trade unionists who are involved in acts of public protest that are not offences, or their arrest without the intervention of the corresponding judicial authority with the clear intention of teaching them a lesson as is the case when subsequently no grounds for laying charges are found which would justify their having been denied their freedom, are acts amounting to serious violations of their trade union rights. Governments should take steps to ensure that the authorities concerned receive instructions appropriate to eliminate the danger which arrest for trade union activities implies (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, rd edition, , para. ).
.The Committee draws attention to the fact that the Government has not replied to the remaining outstanding allegations, nor to the large majority of the new allegations presented by the ICFTU in Cases Nos.  and .
.As regards the large number of violent deaths (), disappearances (), physical assaults and death threats against trade union leaders and trade unionists (see Annexes  and ), the Committee once again deplores these acts, which directly undermine the most basic human rights and the development of a free and independent trade union movement. The Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that a situation which gives rise to a climate of violence such as that which encourages the murder, kidnapping or disappearance of trade union leaders and persons is totally incompatible with the principles of freedom of association. In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government urgently to order a judicial inquiry aimed at shedding light on the murder and disappearance of, and the physical assaults and death threats against trade union leaders and trade unionists, to punish the guilty parties and to avoid a recurrence of such acts. In the Committee's opinion, the absence of judgements against the guilty parties creates, in practice, a situation of impunity, which reinforces the climate of violence and insecurity, and which is extremely damaging to the exercise of trade union activities. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of all investigations undertaken.
.As regards the numerous arrests and detentions of trade union leaders and trade unionists ( in all), the Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that the arrest and detention of trade unionists on the grounds of trade union activities constitute a serious infringement of freedom of association and a serious obstacle to the exercise of trade union rights. The Committee once again requests the Government to release all those who might have been detained on the grounds of trade union activities and to provide information on the situation of all trade union members and leaders referred to in these cases, indicating whether they are currently detained, on trial or free.
.As regards the  instances of searches, carried out with violence, of trade union premises and homes of trade unionists, as alleged by the complainants (see Annex ), the Committee considers these acts to be inexcusable and points out that any search of trade union premises or unionists' homes, without a court order, constitutes an extremely serious infringement of freedom of association. It emphasizes that the resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties adopted by the International Labour Conference at its th Session (), provides that the right to adequate protection of trade union property constitutes one of the essential civil liberties for the normal exercise of trade union rights. The Committee urges the Government to undertake judicial inquiries into the violent searches carried out against trade union premises and the homes of trade unionists, with the aim of identifying and punishing the guilty parties in an exemplary manner so as to avoid a recurrence of such acts. The Committee requests the Government to supply it as soon as possible with all the relevant information it has at its disposal.
.As regards the new allegations concerning acts of anti-union discrimination at the ADOC works (the dismissal of ten trade union leaders and  workers for attempting to establish a trade union) and at ARCO S.A. (police repression of striking workers), the Committee notes that the Government has neither supplied its observations on these allegations nor put forward reasons to justify this omission, and again requests the Government to send its comments in the shortest possible time.
.The Committee draws",2,1990,El Salvador
213,"attention to the Government's persistent negative attitude, shown since February  by its refusal to accept a direct contacts mission to the country and by its failure, despite the extreme seriousness of the allegations, to send the information required by the Committee. The Committee deplores the Government's unacceptable attitude. It urges it once again to send the information and accept the mission in question, and recommends to the Governing Body to give the widest publicity to the present report, particularly in El Salvador.
.The Committee has examined these cases on various occasions. Case No.  was last examined at its February  meeting, when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body (see st Report of the Committee, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session (March )). Cases Nos.  and  were last examined at its November  meeting, when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body (see th Report of the Committee, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its st Session (November )). Case No.  was last examined at its February  meeting, when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body (see st Report of the Committee, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session (March )).
.The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) submitted new allegations in communications dated  December  and  August .
.The Government sent partial information in communications dated  and  May .
.In addition, the Committee requested the Government, in February, May and November  and in February and May , to accept a direct contacts mission (see th Report, para. , th Report, para. , th Report, para. , st Report, paras.  and , and rd Report, para. ).
.Owing to the lack of detailed information from the Government concerning the allegations, the Committee has had to adjourn these four cases on several occasions, finally making an urgent appeal to the Government at its November  meeting (see th Report, para. ). In that appeal the Committee, noting that the Government had not sent a favourable reply concerning the direct contacts mission which it had been requested to accept, drew the Government's attention to the fact that, in accordance with the procedural rules set out in paragraph  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body, it would present a report on the substance of the cases at its subsequent meeting, even if the information or observations requested had not been received in due time.
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).

.As regards the  instances of searches, carried out with violence, of trade union premises and homes of trade unionists alleged by the complainants (see Annex ), the Committee considers these acts to be inexcusable and points out that any search of trade union premises, or of unionists' homes, without a court order constitutes an extremely serious infringement of freedom of association.

.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee notes once again the Government's manifest lack of cooperation in observing the Committee's procedure and, specifically, the inexplicable failure to send almost all the information repeatedly requested by the Committee so as to enable it to determine the veracity of the outstanding allegations.(b) As regards the violent death and disappearance of, physical assaults on and death threats against trade union leaders and trade unionists (see Annexes  and ), the Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that a situation which gives rise to a climate of violence such as that which encourages the murder, kidnapping or disappearance of trade union leaders and persons is totally incompatible with the principles of freedom of association. The Committee urges the Government to instigate as a matter of urgency a judicial inquiry in order to shed light on the facts, to punish the guilty parties and to avoid any recurrence of such acts. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any inquiry it undertakes and to communicate to the Committee the results of the judicial inquiry undertaken into the murder of Porfirio Vasquez and Miguel Angel Martinez.(c) As regards the numerous arrests and detentions of trade union leaders and trade unionists, the Committee once again requests the Government to release all those who might have been detained on the grounds of trade union activities and asks it to furnish the Committee with information on the situation of all trade union members and leaders referred to in these cases, indicating whether they are currently detained, on trial or free.(d) The Committee urges the Government to undertake judicial inquiries into the cases of searches of trade union premises and of the homes of trade unionists carried out with violence and without court orders (see Annex ), with a view to identifying and punishing the guilty parties and avoiding a repetition of such acts.

The Committee likewise requests the Government to take further measures to identify and punish those responsible for the condemnable attack against the headquarters of FENESTRAS in October .(e) The Committee points out that the Government has not provided its observations on the new allegations concerning acts of anti-union discrimination at the ADOC works and at ARCO S.A. nor puts forward any reasons to justify this omission and again requests it to send its comments in the shortest possible time.(f) The Committee draws attention to the Government's persistent negative attitude, shown since February  by its refusal to accept a direct contacts mission to the country.

The Committee again requests the Government to accept a direct contacts mission without delay.
.The complaint was examined by the Committee at its meeting in February  without the Government's observations. At subsequent meetings, when the Government's observations had still not been received, the Committee twice had to postpone its examination of this case, making an urgent appeal at its meeting in November  and pointing out that in accordance with the procedure established in paragraph  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body, it would submit a report on the substance of the matter at its subsequent meeting even if the observations or information from the Government had still not been received. No communication has been received from the Government since then.
.El Salvador has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.At the Committee's meeting in February  the allegations made by FENASTRAS, in its communication of  March , remained outstanding. According to these allegations, between  February  and  January  there had been  murders and disappearances of trade union leaders (although the complainant organisation named only ),  arrests and detentions of trade unionists and workers, and  violations of trade union premises (the complainant mentions  incidents).
.At its meeting in February , in view of the total dearth of government observations, despite the Committee's request that these be furnished urgently, the Committee formulated the following recommendations (see th Report, para. ):As regards the violent deaths and disappearances, the arrests and detentions without full compliance with legal prescriptions, and the threats and harassment against many trade unionists, the Committee deeply deplores these incidents which directly undermine the development of a free and independent trade union movement which might otherwise fully and effectively defend the rights and interests of workers, and play a dynamic and productive role in the country's social, economic and political development. The Committee urges the Government to supply information on the situation of trade union leaders and activists who have been detained, murdered or who have disappeared, and whose names were listed by the complainant, including information on any sentences handed down in respect of them or investigations under way; likewise it urges the Government to give the necessary instructions to the competent authorities to ensure that no detainee is subjected to ill-treatment, and to impose sanctions in cases in which ill-treatment has taken place;as regards the violent search of trade union premises without a court order, the interruption of trade union meetings, the sacking of trade union premises and the destruction of trade union property, the Committee requests the Government to institute judicial inquiries into these allegations for the purpose of punishing the guilty parties and preventing the recurrence of such acts, and as soon as possible to furnish information in this regard;in view of the seriousness of this case, the Committee requests the Government to accept the visit of a direct contacts mission to the country as soon as possible.""
.For the second time the Committee deeply deplores the Government's total lack of cooperation in the Committee's procedure and, specifically, the fact that it has sent none of the information that has repeatedly been requested on the outstanding allegations, despite the urgent appeals made. In view of the time that has elapsed since the allegations were presented ( March ), the Committee is obliged to examine this case once again",-1,1990,El Salvador
215,"without being able to take into account the Government's observations thereon.
.The Committee once again reminds the Government that the aim of the whole procedure is to ensure respect for trade union rights, both in law and in practice. The Committee is convinced that if this procedure protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side should recognise the importance of presenting, so as to allow objective examination, detailed and precise replies on the substance of the alleged facts (see First Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body in March ).
.The Committee emphasises the seriousness of the allegations which refer to the murder and disappearance of a large number of trade union leaders, to the arrest and detention of workers and trade unionists, and the seaching and sacking of trade union premises.
.As regards the large number of violent deaths (; see Annex ) and the disappearance of trade union leaders ( persons; see Annex ), the Committee once again deeply deplores these facts and emphasises that they directly undermine the development of a free and independent trade union movement. The Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that a climate of violence, such as that surrounding the murder or disappearance of trade union leaders, constitutes a serious obstacle to the exercise of trade union rights and that such acts require severe measures to be taken by the authorities (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, rd edition, , para. ). In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government urgently to carry out a judicial inquiry in order to shed light on the murder and disappearance of trade unionists, determine responsibilities, punish the guilty parties and avoid a recurrence of such acts. The Committee also requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of this investigation.
.As regards the numerous arrests and detentions of trade unionists (the complainant organisation gives  names), the Committee once again reminds the Government that the arrest and detention of trade unionists on the grounds of trade union activities constitutes a serious obstacle to the exercise of trade union rights and an infringement of freedom of association. For the second time, the Committee requests the Government to furnish information on the situation of the trade union militants and leaders who have been arrested, and whose names were given by the complainants, together with information on such rulings as may have been handed down and on the investigations under way. Similarly, the Committee once again urges the Government to issue the necessary instructions to the competent authorities to ensure that no detainee is subjected to ill-treatment and to impose effective sanctions in cases in which ill-treatment has taken place.
.As regards the violent searching of trade union premises without a court order ( incidents; see Annex ), the interruption of trade union meetings and the destruction and sacking of property belonging to the organisations in question, the Committee has always considered that the searching and occupying of trade union premises without a court order constitutes serious interference by the authorities in trade union activities, and once again stresses the importance of the resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties adopted by the International Labour Conference at its th Session (), which provides that the right to adequate protection of trade union property constitutes one of the essential civil liberties for the normal exercise of trade union rights. Consequently, the Committee once again requests the Government to undertake judicial inquiries into the allegations concerning attacks on trade union premises in order to punish the guilty parties and avoid a recurrence of such acts, and to inform it rapidly of the outcome of these inquiries.
.The Committee urges the Government to send detailed replies to allegations in future without any delay and points out that henceforth it reserves the possibility of giving the widest publicity to its reports in the manner provided for in its procedure (see Digest of decisions and principles, rd edition, , para. ).
.In view of the seriousness of this case and the new political situation in the country, the Committee considers that it would now be appropriate for a direct contacts mission to visit the country. It therefore urges the Government to accept such a mission.
.The complaint of the National Trade Union Federation of Salvadorian Workers (FENASTRAS) is contained in a communication of  March .
.As it had not received the Government's observations, the Committee twice adjourned its examination of this case, most recently at its November  meeting, when it noted that in spite of the time which had elapsed and the seriousness of the allegations, it had not received the information requested of the Government. The Committee again urged the Government to send its observations as soon as possible and informed it that, in accordance with the procedure established in paragraph  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ), it would submit a report on the substance of the matter at its next meeting, even if the information or observations requested from the Government had still not been received. (See th Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ).)
.El Salvador has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In a communication of  March , the National Trade Union Federation of Salvadorian Workers (FENASTRAS) submits a complaint alleging the violation of trade union rights and freedoms in El Salvador. The complainant alleges that between  February  and  January , there have been  murders and disappearances of trade union leaders,  arrests and detentions of trade unionists and workers,  instances of harassment of trade unionists and  violations of trade union premises.
.The complainant states that government agents are responsible for murders, disappearances, torture, threats and the constant harassment of the Salvadorian trade union movement, and notes that, so far, the courts have failed to sanction any of the parties responsible for these violations. They point out that the ineffectiveness of the Salvadorian judicial system has been acknowledged by the United Nations Human Rights Commission in its final report on the situation of human rights in El Salvador. (See Economic and Social Council, Human Rights Commission, document E/CN.//, p. .)Threats against trade union organisations and leaders
.The complainant states that threats to the lives of trade unionists constitute a common practice in El Salvador; these threats have affected all trade unions, representing a broad range of political opinions. They cite as an example a television broadcast of  October , which depicted the FENASTRAS acronym crossed out with an ""X"", together with a photograph of trade union leader Mrs. Febe Velsquez, also marked with a red ""X"" (she had been accused by the armed forces of misappropriating trade union funds); five days later this trade unionist died as a result of an attack on FENASTRAS headquarters, which left nine dead and nearly  injured. The complainant states that these threats, publicised by electronic means of mass communication with the Government's apparent approval, have paralysed the Salvadorian trade union movement. According to the complainant, the Government took no measure to protect either the life of Mrs. Velsquez or the FENASTRAS premises, and it is highly unlikely that those responsible for the attack will be indicted or punished, since the lack of internal means of legal redress is compounded by the Government's disregard for its international obligations to guarantee the personal safety of trade unionists.Arrest and detention of trade unionists
.The complainant federation also states that the number of arrests and detentions of trade unionists is alarming, averaging one per day; it is the Government's preferred method for repressing the trade union movement. Most of these arrests lead to a -hour detention, during which the detainee is interrogated and, usually, physically and psychologically mistreated. After  hours some of those who have been arrested are turned over to the courts and imprisoned for several months without being duly tried, while others disappear after their capture by security forces. The -hour limit is generally overlooked by security forces and access to detainees during this period is virtually impossible. The complainant states that many trade unionists and activists are arrested on the pretext of belonging to the guerrilla movement, although such charges are usually unsupported by evidence. Apparently, the overriding policy in El Salvador is that participation in a workers' organisation is sufficient grounds for a person's arrest and detention. Thus, trade union membership has become tantamount to being a crime, punishable by arrest, detention and, in many cases, torture. The complainant states that none of the more than  trade unionists arrested between  February and  October  were tried and found guilty following their arrest; in general, these arrests are timed to coincide with trade union meetings or international travel. Detained trade unionists are mistreated, their arrests are politically motivated,",-1,1990,El Salvador
216,"and in many cases they are illegal owing to the absence of adequate judicial guarantees.The search of trade union premises
.In addition, the complainant alleges that the following trade union premises were searched in : SITRALONB, SETIVU ( May); UNTS ( March); FENASTRAS, FUSS, UNTS ( March); SIGEBAN ( April); FUSS, FESTIAVSCES, CODYDES, UNTS, AGEPIN ( April); ASID ( May); FENASTRAS, FUSS, UNTS, COACES ( May); UNTS ( May); SOICSCES ( June); EL SOTO Co-operative ( July); ANTA ( July); LA VIRTUD Co-operative ( and  July); ANTMAG ( and  September). The searches of these trade union premises were accompanied by arrests and the obstruction of trade union activities (for example, the reception of international visitors), damage to property and theft of trade union property. None of these actions resulted in any criminal proceedings and sentencing, since there were no criminal activities or motives to justify the authorisation of the searches, nor any legal basis to warrant such action. Even when the search of trade union premises was carried out in accordance with a court order, the authorities responsible for implementing the court order failed to respect trade union property.The violent break up of trade union demonstrations
.The FENASTRAS communication states that security forces sought violently to break up trade union demonstrations on ,  and  March,  April,  May and  September , and injured and arrested several members of the trade unions which had organised these demonstrations (ANTA, UNTS, FENASTRAS, CCTO, CSTICODYDES). The Government overreacted to the destruction of two buses during a FENASTRAS demonstration on  September , using this incident as a pretext to intimidate the whole trade union movement.The violent breaking of strikes
.The complainant states that during the period from  February to  October  a number of strikes were broken by the use of force. They cite two examples: on  July  members of the army broke up a legal strike called by the General Trade Union of Workers in the Acajutia Fishing Industry (SGTIPAC). In El Salvador, given the nature of the Labour Code, it is virtually impossible for a strike to be declared legal. The other case took place in late September , when members of the Textile Industry Workers' Trade Union (STIT) called a strike at the INSICA plant. The plant was militarised and the striking workers were totally isolated; deliveries of food were prohibited and communications were cut, and ultimately  striking workers were evicted by the military forces and subsequently dismissed by the enterprise.Restrictions on the organisation of trade unions and anti-union discrimination
.The complainant alleges in its communication that the mayor of San Salvador has taken measures to dismantle trade unions operating in his municipality, which is the largest in El Salvador. On several occasions he has banned the meetings of municipal employees and interferred in their organisation.
.In addition, trade unions face the problems resulting from the constant dismissals for political reasons or on the grounds of trade union membership or organisation; trade union leaders are also barred from the workplace and employment is conditional on non-membership of trade unions; alternatively, workers who belong to trade unions are dismissed. The complainants furnish a long and detailed list of practices of this type.
.Lastly, in the light of the seriousness of the allegations and the Government's failure to guarantee the development of the trade union movement, FENASTRAS concludes its communication by requesting the Governing Body to request the Government to consent to submitting this complaint to a fact-finding and conciliation commission with a view to seeking solutions to the crisis which is affecting the Salvadorian trade union movement.
.The Committee recalls that at its last meeting in November  it drew the Government's attention to the fact that, in accordance with its procedural rules, it would submit a report on the substance of this case at its next meeting, even if the Government's information or observations had not been received in due time. The Committee still has not received such observations.
.In these circumstances, and before examining the substance of the case, the Committee considers it necessary again to draw the Government's attention to the considerations expressed in the Committee's First Report (para. , approved by the Governing Body in March ) and which it has repeated on several occasions, namely, that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact and the Committee is confident that, as it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side should recognise the importance of formulating, so as to allow for objective examination, detailed factual replies to such detailed allegations brought against them.
.The Committee deplores the fact that the Government has not sent any reply to this complaint, and that, owing to the time elapsed and the seriousness of the allegations, it finds itself obliged to examine the case without the benefit of the Government's observations.
.The Committee notes that the complainant has submitted its allegations with much detailed information contained in several appendices which document each case citing, names, organisations, places and dates of the alleged violations of trade union rights and human rights in general. Given the large amount of information received, it would be physically difficult to include all of it in this document. This documentation and the appendices have been transmitted in their entirety to the Government, and the Committee is still awaiting specific replies to the same.
.Although the Committee is aware of the difficulties facing the Government, it cannot but deeply deplore, once again, the Government's failure to co-operate with the Committee in the large number of serious allegations presented in this case.
.The Committee observes with great concern the seriousness of the allegations in this case concerning the murder and disappearance of a large number of trade union leaders, the numerous arrests, detentions, harassment and threats to trade unionists, the search of trade union premises, the efforts to break up demonstrations, and violently to break strike, the restrictions imposed on the organisation of trade unions and the acts of anti-union discrimination over the period  February  to  January .
.As regards the large number of violent deaths and disappearances, the failure to comply fully with legal prescriptions concerning arrests and detention, and the constant harassment and threats against trade unionists, the Committee deeply deplores these incidents. It considers that they constitute a direct obstacle to the development of a free and independent trade union movement which may fully and effectively defend the rights and interests of workers, and play a dynamic and productive role in the country's social, economic and political development. On several occasions the Committee has expressed the opinion that a free trade union movement can develop only under a regime which guarantees fundamental rights, including the right of trade unionists to hold meetings in trade union premises, freedom of opinion expressed through the printed and electronic media, and the right of detained trade unionists to enjoy the guarantees of normal judicial procedure at the earliest possible moment. (See the Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, rd edition, , para. .)
.Since the arrest and detention of trade unionists may constitute a serious interference with the exercise of trade union rights, the Committee considers that the adoption of such measures, even for reasons of internal security, may constitute a serious interference with trade union rights unless attended by appropriate judicial safeguards. (See, for example, Digest, para. .) The Committee also recalls that the detention of trade unionists against whom no charges have been filed can present obstacles to the exercise of freedom of association. The Committee urges the Government to supply information on the situation of trade union leaders and activists who have been arrested, murdered or have disappeared, and whose names were listed by the complainant, including any sentences handed down in respect of them or investigations under way. Likewise, the Committee urges the Government to give the necessary instructions to the competent authorities to ensure that no detainee is subjected to ill-treatment, and to apply effective sanctions where cases of ill-treatment are found. (See Digest, para. .)
.As regards the violent search of trade union premises without a court order, the interruption of trade union meetings and the destruction and sacking of property belonging to trade unions whose premises had been searched, the Committee considers that the search or occupation of trade union premises without a court order constitutes a serious interference on the part of the authorities in trade union activities. It reiterates the importance of the resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties, adopted by the International Labour Conference at its th Session (), which provides that the right to adequate protection of trade union property constitutes one of the civil liberties essential for the normal exercise of trade union rights. Consequently, the Committee requests the Government to open judicial inquiries into the allegations concerning attacks against trade union premises for the purpose of punishing the guilty parties and preventing the recurrence of such",-1,1990,El Salvador
217,"acts, and to communicate immediately to the Committee any information available in this connection.
.As regards the violent break up of the trade union demonstrations and the arrest and detention of trade unionists who were participating in them, the Committee recalls that, in general, the use of the forces of order during trade union demonstrations should be limited to cases of genuine necessity. The authorities should be given precise instructions in cases where the public order is not seriously threatened, so that people are not detained simply for having organised or participated in a demonstration. (See Digest, paras.  and .)
.As regards the use of force to break strikes and the subsequent dismissal of trade unionists and workers for their participation in such strikes, the Committee is of the opinion that the authorities should resort to the use of force only in serious situations where law and order is seriously threatened. The use of extremely serious measures, such as dismissal of workers for having participated in a strike and refusal to reinstate them, implies a serious risk of abuse and constitutes a violation of freedom of association. (See Digest, paras.  and .)
.As regards restrictions on the organisation of trade unions and acts of anti-union discrimination, the Committee recalls the principle according to which public servants as well as workers in the private sector should enjoy the right to set up organisations of their own choosing for the promotion and defence of their interests, and that these organisations should have the right to organise their activities and, in particular, to hold meetings, without interference from the public authorities. Likewise, it wishes to emphasise that no worker should be subjected to discrimination in employment owing to his or her membership of a trade union or current or past trade union activities, nor should his or her employment be conditional upon membership or non-membership of a trade union. The Committee requests the Government to investigate these practices and to take the necessary measures to prevent their recurrence.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) Although the Committee is aware of the difficulties facing the Government, it cannot but deeply deplore, once again, the Government's failure to co-operate with the Committee in the large amount of serious allegations in this case. It again asks the Government to send a detailed and specific reply to these allegations.(b) As regards the violent deaths and disappearances, the arrests and detentions without full compliance with legal prescriptions, and the threats and harassment against many trade unionists, the Committee deeply deplores these incidents which directly undermine the development of a free and independent trade union movement which might otherwise fully and effectively defend the rights and interests of workers, and play a dynamic and productive role in the country's social, economic and political development. The Committee urges the Government to supply information on the situation of trade union leaders and activists who have been detained, murdered or who have disappeared, and whose names were listed by the complainant, including information on any sentences handed down in respect of him or investigations under way; likewise, it urges the Government to give the necessary instructions to the competent authorities to ensure that no detainee is subjected to ill-treatment, and to impose sanctions in cases in which ill-treatment has taken place.(c) As regards the violent search of trade union premises without a court order, the interruption of trade union meetings, the sacking of trade union premises and the destruction of trade union property, the Committee requests the Government to institute judicial inquiries into these allegations for the purpose of punishing the guilty parties and preventing the recurrence of such acts, and as soon as possible to furnish information in this regard.(d) As regards the violent break up of trade union demonstrations and the arrest and detention of trade unionists who were participating in them, the Committee requests the Government to ensure that the use of the forces of order during trade union demonstrations is limited to cases of genuine necessity and that the police authorities are given precise instructions when law and order are not seriously threatened, so that people are not detained simply for having organised or participated in a demonstration.(e) As regards the use of force to break strikes and the subsequent dismissal of trade unionists and workers for their participation in such strikes, the Committee requests the Government to ensure that there is resort to the use of force only in situations where law and order is seriously threatened. The use of extremely serious measures, such as the dismissal of workers for having participated in a strike and the refusal to reinstate them, implies a serious risk of abuse and constitutes a violation of freedom of association.(f) As regards restrictions on the organisation of trade unions and acts of anti-union discrimination, the Committee request the Government to respect the principle according to which both public servants and workers in the private sector should have the right to set up organisations of their own choosing for the promotion and defence of their interests. These organisations should have the right to organise their activities and, in particular, to hold meetings, without interference from the public authorities. The Committee requests the Government to ensure that no worker is subjected to discrimination in employment owing to his or her trade union membership or current or past activities, and that employment is not conditional upon membership or non-membership of a trade union. The Committee requests the Government to investigate these practices and to take the necessary measures to prevent their recurrence.(g) In view of the seriousness of this case, the Committee requests the Government to accept that a direct contacts mission visit the country as soon as possible.",0,1990,El Salvador
218,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the General Trade Union of Workers in the Fishing and Allied Industries (SGTIPAC) dated  July . This organisation sent additional information in communications dated  August and  October . The Government replied in a communication dated  March .
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The General Trade Union of Workers in the Fishing and Allied Industries (SGTIPAC) alleges that the fishing enterprises Atarraya SA, Camaronera Industrial Salvadorea SA de CV (CAMINSA), Pesquera Industrial Salvadorea SA de CV (PESQUINSA), Camaronera Salvadorea SA, Pesquera Ruiz Quiros SA, Pesquera del Pacfico SA, Bayena SA de CV, Astilleros del Salvador SA de CV, Marina del Pacfico SA de CV, Promarisal SA de CV, Productos Pesqueros del Mar SA, Pesquera del Mar SA, Productos Cocinados del Mar SA, Mariscos San Simen and Frutos del Ocano SA (Acopuerto de RL) keep a list of the workers who are members of the trade union, and any member chosen by a captain or a skipper of a fishing vessel to join his crew is denied the right to work if his name appears on the list of members.
.The complainant organisation states further that in the enterprises of the Camaronera Industrial Salvadorea, SA de CV (CAMINSA), the contracts of the workers Eudulfo Mauricio Tadeo Estupinian, Rigoberto Concepcin Hernndez, Ismael Antonio Hernndez Cueva, David Antonio Henrquez, Flix Herrera Rivera, Jorge Alberto Escalante Cisneros, Alejandro Reyes Artola and Eduardo Martnez were terminated without just cause, simply because these workers are members of the executive of the trade union branch of the Department of Sonsonate. This action flouts the trade union guarantee laid down in labour legislation, according to which trade union officers cannot be suspended, transferred or dismissed without just cause. In the Marina del Pacfico SA de CV enterprise the individual contract of employment of Carlos Alonso Alvarenga was terminated simply because he was a member of the trade union's branch executive of Acajutla.
.From the documents supplied it appears that the complainant organisation declared a strike on  July  in the enterprises Distribuidora Marina SA, Nutica del Litoral SA, Mariscos Crustceos SA, Pesquera Vidaurre SA and Pesquera del Triunfo in order to obtain satisfaction of several labour and economic demands; the strike was declared legal by the judicial authority (August ), which ordered that the basic wage be paid (October ) for the entire duration of the work stoppage. As the enterprises failed to pay the wages, the workers initiated attachment proceedings against the assets of these enterprises, which were acted on in January and February . As a result, the workers took the initiative of setting up an enterprise (""Organised Workers' Fishing Enterprise"") and applied to the National Centre for Fishery Development and the Naval High Command for temporary fishing licences to enable them to recover their debts and prevent their vessels from falling into disrepair. However, the Commercial Agricultural Bank (the creditor of the enterprises in question) objects to the issue of such licences by the above-mentioned government institutions; this is a delaying tactic in collusion with the employers. In its latest communication, the complainant states that an agreement has not yet been reached (on the one hand the Commercial Agricultural Bank proposed that  per cent of wages or allowances be paid and that the workers leave the installations and return the enterprise's assets, while the trade union, on the other hand, proposes that, if the collective agreement continues in force,  per cent of wages be paid, with some scope for negotiation, and  per cent be paid if individual contracts are terminated).
.The complainant organisation alleges further that the workers employed by the enterprises Productos Cocinados del Mar SA, Pesquera del Mar SA, Frutos del Ocano SA, Mariscos San Simen SA and Productos Pesqueros del Mar SA, began a strike on  December  in support of several demands. The strike was declared illegal on  December  by the Civil Court of Usulutn on the following grounds: ""Having read the record of the strike agreement, the undersigned (Civil Court magistrate) concludes that this document does not meet the requirements laid down by the law and that the strike declared in the enterprises referred to should therefore be declared illegal and a decision be handed down to this effect."" According to the complainant organisation, the object of the strike was to obtain the payment of wages which the employer had ceased paying as a result of an illegal suspension of work by employers' representatives, and to recover various benefits and debts owed to the workers by the enterprises concerned. The complainant adds that on  June  some  troops of the Sixth Infantry Brigade based in Usulutn, assisted by military forces belonging to the Navy, violently occupied the dockside installations belonging to Pezca SA de CV, in the Bay of Jiquilisco, El Triunfo port jurisdiction, Department of Usulutn; they likewise forced the workers who were striking in legitimate defence of their labour rights to leave their fishing vessels.
.The Government states that collective labour disputes have arisen between the General Trade Union of Workers in the Fishing and Allied Industries and the enterprises Atarraya SA, Promarisal SA de CV and Marina del Pacfico SA de CV, as a result of the complainant being denied the right to work and because of membership of this trade union organisation (as regards the other enterprises which allegedly took anti-union measures, no collective labour disputes have been initiated against them by the complainant trade union). At the first stage of the proceedings, the legal representatives of the defendant enterprises were summoned; they denied the charges brought against them and insisted on the right of the enterprises they represented to control access to their installations, for which purpose they distribute to their gatekeepers a weekly list of the workers on the payroll so that they may be allowed access to the installations.
.As regards the alleged dismissal of the officers of the SGTIPAC's branch office in the Department of Sonsonate, employed in the Camaronera Industrial Salvadorea SA de CV enterprise, the Government states that the General Labour Directorate summoned the legal representative of the enterprise for conciliation and the latter, through his proxy, stated that owing to the nature of the fishing industry, the crews of vessels are chosen in full independence by the captains or skippers of the vessels. Since this was the case of the plaintiffs in that court action, if the latter were not accepted as crew members, the enterprise could not force them to be. As regards the case of Mr. Rigoberto Concepcin Hernndez, he resigned of his own accord, and his remuneration was accordingly suspended.
.The Government states further that the first strike referred to by the complainant organisation was ruled legal, and began on  July ; the second was ruled illegal and began on  December the same year (the Productos Pesqueros del Mar SA enterprise, explained the Government, was not involved in either of these disputes). The Government states that the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare does not normally have competence to declare a strike illegal or legal, and that this is for the competent judicial authority to determine, without right of appeal. Moreover, it should be pointed out that the General Labour Directorate complied with the procedures laid down by law for the negotiation of collective labour disputes and that the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare participated directly in the hearings (as did the Labour and Social Welfare Commission of the Legislative Assembly and the Private Secretary of the President of the Republic), with a view to achieving an equitable settlement of the dispute. In this context, a series of meetings was held between the parties and the representatives of the Commercial Agricultural Bank of El Salvador, as this bank is the mortgagee of the enterprises involved in the dispute. The latest of these meetings was held on  July  in the presence of the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare. Since June , with the arrival of the new government administration, the parties to the dispute have expressed their willingness to settle this dispute through the established legal procedures. The bank concerned therefore proposed an alternative settlement to the dispute and the opposing party was heard; both parties expressed the desire and intention to return to work for the sake of smooth labour-management relations, which should always prevail at the workplace.
.Lastly, the Government points out that in the port of Triunfo, in the Department of Usulutn, five enterprises are in the throes of a strike which has been declared legal, while four others are engaged in a similar dispute, which, however, has been ruled illegal. On  June  the vessels ""Mufi"", ""Humeito"", ""Mayguay"", ""Dany"" and ""Lulu"", were recovered, not having been attached by court order, as was clear from the records of the",1,1989,El Salvador
219,"competent court and those of the Court of the First Instance of this judicial district. It has also been ascertained that these vessels do not belong to the enterprises which are liable for payment of wages, the strike having been declared legal. Therefore the Government has at no time violated the workers' right to strike, but in order to be fair has guaranteed respect for the rights of employers and third parties.
.The Committee regrets that as regards the alleged dismissal of eight trade union officers in the fishing sector, the Government has confined itself to a general statement to the effect that the crews of vessels are chosen by captains or skippers acting in full independence. The Committee likewise regrets that out of the  cases referred to by the complainant of the use of membership lists by fishing enterprises to deny unionists the right to work, the Government has only provided observations on three enterprises (against which complaints were lodged with the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare). The Government confined itself to stating that these enterprises had denied the charges.
.In this respect, considering that the Government's replies are unsatisfactory, the Committee draws the Government's attention to the fundamental principle that no person should be dismissed or prejudiced in his employment by reason of his trade union membership or legitimate trade union activities, and to the importance of forbidding and penalising in practice all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of employment (see th Report, Case No.  (Uruguay), para. ). The Committee therefore requests the Government to conduct a careful inquiry into all of the cases of discrimination alleged by the complainant organisation, to remedy all of those discovered and to punish those responsible.
.As regards the strikes under way in various fishing enterprises since the second half of , the Committee observes that the first of these (which began on  July ) was declared legal by the judicial authority, which ordered the payment of basic wages throughout the duration of the work stoppage; the Committee notes the fact that, according to the Government, the authorities have taken initiatives to settle the collective dispute and that the parties currently express the wish and intention to achieve a settlement.
.As regards the second strike (which began on  December ), the Committee observes that the judicial authority declared it illegal, but regrets that the text of the judicial decision (sent by the complainant trade union) does not, strictly speaking, cite any grounds, as it merely states that ""having read the record of the strike agreement, the undersigned (Civil Court magistrate) concludes that this document does not meet the requirements laid down by the law and that the strike should therefore be declared illegal"". However, the Committee regrets that the complainant organisation waited until July  (the date of its complaint) to challenge the judicial decision declaring the strike illegal, handed down in December , because the dispute has been complicated further and aggravated since then. The Committee cannot fail to point out a certain amount of confusion both in the allegations of the complainant trade union and in the Government's reply in this regard.
.In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to adopt measures to ensure that the competent labour authorities enable a settlement to be reached between the parties and trusts that these collective disputes, which began in , will soon be settled to the satisfaction of all of the interested parties. The Committee requests the Government to examine the possibility of amending the legislation on strikes with a view to clarifying the rights of trade union organisations.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee draws the Government's attention to the fundamental principle that no person should be dismissed or prejudiced in his employment by reason of his trade union membership or legitimate trade union activities, and to the importance of forbidding and punishing in practice all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of employment.(b) The Committee requests the Government to conduct a careful inquiry into all of the cases of discrimination alleged by the complainant organisation (dismissal of eight trade union officers and use of black lists by  enterprises), and to remedy all those cases discovered and penalise those responsible.(c) As regards the strikes under way in various fishing enterprises since the second half of , the Committee requests the Government to adopt measures to ensure that the competent authorities achieve a settlement between the parties and trusts that these collective disputes, which began in , will soon be settled to the satisfaction of all of the interested parties. In addition, it requests the Government to examine the possibility of amending the legislation on strikes with a view to clarifying the rights of trade union organisations.",0,1989,El Salvador
220,".The Committee has examined Cases Nos. , ,  and  on several occasions, most recently at its meeting of May , when it submitted an interim report (see the Committee's th Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (May )), which drew attention to the Government's persistent negative attitude, shown since February  by its refusal to accept a direct contacts mission to the country and by its failure, in spite of the extreme seriousness of the allegations, to send the information requested by the Committee.
.Consequently, at said meeting the Committee once again urged the Government to send the information requested and to accept the mission in question; it also requested the Director-General of the ILO to contact the representatives of the Government of El Salvador at the next session of the International Labour Conference (June ), and to urge the Government to respect fully the Committee's recommendations. (See the Committee's th Report, paras.  and (f) and (g).)
.Following contacts at the Conference, the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare agreed to the direct contacts mission.
.In addition, the IFCTU submitted new allegations in the context of Case No.  in a communication of  June  (see the attached summary in the direct contacts mission report, para. ).
.The Director-General of the ILO appointed Professor Jos Vida Soria, Professor of Labour Law at the University of Grenada, and President of the Committee of Experts of the European Social Charter, to carry out the direct contacts mission, assisted by a member of the Freedom of Association Branch of the ILO. The mission took place from  September to  October .
.The Committee notes that the mission met with Dr. Juan Sifontes, Minister of Labour and Social Welfare, Dr. Carlos Mauricio Molina, Attorney-General for Human Rights, Dr. Estela Avila, Chief of the International Relations Office of the Ministry of Labour, as well as with representatives of Interoccupational Coordination (UNTS, UNOC, AGEPYM, CGT, FESINCONSTRAM, CTS, etc.) and of the National Association of Private Enterprise (NAPE). It also met with Dr. Augusto Ramirez Ocampo, Chief of the United Nations Observer Mission (ONUSAL) and with several senior officials from ONUSAL. The Committee also notes that the government authorities and the representatives of workers' and employers' organizations collaborated closely with the mission, and that government authorities gave every assistance.
.The Committee has also noted Professor Jos Vida Soria's mission report (see Annex I), as well as the Government's observations addressed to the Committee and to the mission concerning outstanding allegations.
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In as much as the direct contacts mission report contained in the Annex summarizes not only the substance of outstanding allegations, but also the Committee's previous conclusions and recommendations, as well as the Government's observations and the new allegations, the Committee proceeds directly to its conclusions and recommendations.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee notes with interest the improvement in various important aspects of the trade union situation and, especially, the decline in violence to a point, where - according to the mission report - in the last  months there have only been isolated acts of violence against trade unionists although threats have been made in certain cases.(b) Notwithstanding the current improvements in the situation, the Committee deplores once again the numerous and serious acts of violence to which the trade union movement and their leaders have been subjected in recent years and which have often resulted in loss of life or the violation of the most fundamental human and trade union rights. The Committee calls on the Government to ensure that such events are never repeated. The Committee calls on the Government to keep it informed of developments in the judicial investigations into the various cases of trade unionists being murdered or assaulted, or who disappeared in recent years. In the Committee's opinion, the absence of judgements against the guilty parties creates, in practice, a situation of impunity, which reinforces the climate of violence and insecurity, and which is extremely damaging to the exercise of trade union rights.(c) Regarding the arrest of trade unionists and threats made against them in recent years, and while it notes with interest that there are no trade unionists at present under arrest for trade union activities, the Committee deplores the large number of trade unionists who have been arrested in recent years, the threats that have been made and the climate of intimidation in which trade union activity has often taken place; it hopes that such occurrences, which prevent the normal exercise of trade union rights, will not be repeated in the future.(d) Bearing in mind the allegations of anti-union discrimination in the cases under examination and that the mission report mentions that trade union organizations have denounced many such instances, the Committee urges the Government, in its forthcoming revision of the Labour Code and in the future Act respecting industrial relations in the public administration (for which the Government has requested ILO technical assistance), to guarantee adequate protection against dismissal and other acts of discrimination for carrying out legitimate trade union activities, such as the establishment of a trade union.(e) The Committee expresses its strong reprobation and its serious concern with respect to the kidnapping of the six-month-old son of trade unionist Lucas Bernal Mrmol. The Committee insists that the Government make vigorous efforts to find the child and to punish the kidnappers and requests it to keep it informed in this regard.(f) The Committee reminds the Government that the ILO may provide its help in order to provide information on the contents of the Conventions on freedom of association with a view to possible ratifications.
.The Committee on Freedom of Association, set up by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ), met at the International Labour Office, Geneva, on ,  and  May  under the chairmanship of Mr. Jean-Jacques Oechslin, former Chairman of the Governing Body.
.The Committee had before it various complaints of violations of freedom of association in El Salvador, presented by a number of international and national trade union organizations (Cases Nos. , / and ).
.On several occasions the Governing Body asked the Government to give its consent that a representative of the Director-General visit El Salvador to carry out a study of the facts relating to the complaints, within the context of the direct contacts procedure.
.At the March  Session, the Government had not yet given a positive response to the direct contacts mission nor to the allegations concerning these cases. In these circumstances, the Committee recommended that if no reply was received from the Government prior to its next meeting, wider publicity should be given to the Committee's report.
.Since then, no reply has been received from the Government. The Committee submits for the approval of the Governing Body a further report on this matter and recommends that it examine this report at its th Session.
.In examining Cases Nos. , ,  and  at its February  meeting (see th Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (March )), the Committee deplored and emphasized the seriousness of the outstanding allegations and the new allegations which referred to the murder and disappearance of a large number of trade union leaders, as well as to death threats, physical attacks, arrest and detention of workers and trade unionists, the searching of trade unionists' homes, the searching and ransacking of trade union premises and acts of anti-union discrimination (see th Report, para. ).
.The Committee noted, once again, the Government's manifest lack of cooperation in observing the Committee's procedure and, specifically, the inexplicable failure to send almost any of the information repeatedly requested by the Committee so as to enable it to determine the veracity of the outstanding allegations. The Committee pointed out that it had made use of urgent appeals that had been ignored, and found itself obliged, in view of the time that had elapsed since the allegations had been presented, to examine those cases once again without having the Government's observations in respect of the large majority of the allegations presented by the complainants (see th Report, para. ).
.In addition, the Committee recalled that it had requested the Government, in February, May and November  and in February and May , to accept a direct contacts mission (see th Report, para. , th Report, para. , th Report, para. , st Report, paras.  and , and rd Report, para. ), there having been no response to those requests by the Government (see th Report, para. ).
.The Committee drew attention to the Government's persistent negative attitude, shown since February  by its refusal to accept a direct contacts mission to the country. The Committee, bearing in mind that the Government has shown for many years, despite the extreme seriousness",2,1989,El Salvador
221,"of the allegations, an almost total lack of cooperation with the Committee's procedure, pointed out that it intended to examine the present cases once again in May . If the Government again failed to send the required information in a full and detailed manner and if it did not accept the direct contacts mission, the Committee would recommend to the Governing Body to give the widest publicity to the report in question (see th Report, para. ).
.Since that time, the Government has still not transmitted the information requested by the Committee and has failed to respond to the Committee's request that it accept a direct contacts mission. In these circumstances, the Committee has decided to submit a new report on these cases to the Governing Body.
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee notes, once again, the Government's manifest lack of cooperation in observing the Committee's procedure and, specifically, the inexplicable failure to send almost any of the information repeatedly requested by the Committee so as to enable it to determine the veracity of the outstanding allegations. The Committee has made use of urgent appeals that have been ignored, and finds itself obliged, in view of the time that has elapsed since the allegations were presented, to examine these cases once again without having the Government's observations in respect of the large majority of the allegations presented by the complainants.
.The Committee once again reminds the Government that the aim of the whole procedure is to ensure respect for trade union rights, both in law and in practice. The Committee is convinced that whilst this procedure protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side should formulate, so as to allow objective examination, factual replies to the allegations brought against them (First Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body in March ).
.The Committee deplores and emphasizes the seriousness of the outstanding allegations and the new allegations which refer to the murder and disappearance of a large number of trade union leaders, as well as to death threats, physical attacks, arrest and detention of workers and trade unionists, the searching of trade unionists' homes, the searching and sacking of trade union premises and acts of anti-union discrimination.
.The Committee takes note of the Government's observations to the effect that it has been decided to shelve the case relating to the investigation into the criminal act of setting off explosives in the headquarters of FENASTRAS in October  which left nine persons dead and many injured, a decision which was taken in view of the impossibility of identifying the authors of this criminal act and since no group had claimed responsibility for it. The Committee considers it unacceptable in such circumstances that the investigation has been shelved because of the fact that the inquiries undertaken by a special (non-judicial) ad hoc commission failed to produce positive results. The Committee stresses the obligation on the Government to undertake the necessary measures so as to identify and punish those responsible for this condemnable attack so that the application of rapid and efficient justice serves in the re-establishment of peace.
.As regards the new allegations presented by the ICFTU, the Committee takes note of the Government's remarks to the effect that the judicial inquiries are currently under way into the murder of Porfirio Vsquez and Miguel Angel Martnez. The Committee deplores these murders and expresses the hope that the judicial procedures that are under way will serve to clarify the facts and lead to the punishment of the guilty parties. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the result of the judicial inquiries undertaken.
.The Committee likewise takes note of the information sent by the Government in which it states that  members of the National Association of Agricultural Workers (ANTA) were evicted from the San Francisco de Ass Hacienda in the cantn of Ro Fro, Achaupan jurisdiction, and arrested on a charge of usurpation; however, after the competent court considered the case, they were released. The Committee also notes that Carlos Aguilar Garca, Norma Elizabeth Flores Portillo, Carlos Enrique Escobar Figueroa, Evelyn Jeannette Alvarado Crisstomo and Mara Cristina Alvarenga were arrested by the Hacienda police upon being caught painting anti-government slogans, but that they were released following the intervention of the competent magistrates' court in the absence of sufficient grounds for their further detention. The Committee considers that the detention of the mentioned trade unionists and of the  workers belonging to ANTA is an act that should not be repeated, and draws the Government's attention to the fact that the arrest of trade unionists who are involved in acts of public protest that are not offences, or their arrest without the intervention of the corresponding judicial authority with the clear intention of teaching them a lesson as is the case when subsequently no grounds for laying charges are found which would justify their having been denied their freedom, are acts amounting to serious violations of their trade union rights. Governments should take steps to ensure that the authorities concerned receive instructions appropriate to eliminate the danger which arrest for trade union activities implies (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, rd edition, , para. ).
.The Committee draws attention to the fact that the Government has not replied to the remaining outstanding allegations, nor to the large majority of the new allegations presented by the ICFTU in Cases Nos.  and .
.As regards the large number of violent deaths (), disappearances (), physical assaults and death threats against trade union leaders and trade unionists (see Annexes  and ), the Committee once again deplores these acts, which directly undermine the most basic human rights and the development of a free and independent trade union movement. The Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that a situation which gives rise to a climate of violence such as that which encourages the murder, kidnapping or disappearance of trade union leaders and persons is totally incompatible with the principles of freedom of association. In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government urgently to order a judicial inquiry aimed at shedding light on the murder and disappearance of, and the physical assaults and death threats against trade union leaders and trade unionists, to punish the guilty parties and to avoid a recurrence of such acts. In the Committee's opinion, the absence of judgements against the guilty parties creates, in practice, a situation of impunity, which reinforces the climate of violence and insecurity, and which is extremely damaging to the exercise of trade union activities. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of all investigations undertaken.
.As regards the numerous arrests and detentions of trade union leaders and trade unionists ( in all), the Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that the arrest and detention of trade unionists on the grounds of trade union activities constitute a serious infringement of freedom of association and a serious obstacle to the exercise of trade union rights. The Committee once again requests the Government to release all those who might have been detained on the grounds of trade union activities and to provide information on the situation of all trade union members and leaders referred to in these cases, indicating whether they are currently detained, on trial or free.
.As regards the  instances of searches, carried out with violence, of trade union premises and homes of trade unionists, as alleged by the complainants (see Annex ), the Committee considers these acts to be inexcusable and points out that any search of trade union premises or unionists' homes, without a court order, constitutes an extremely serious infringement of freedom of association. It emphasizes that the resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties adopted by the International Labour Conference at its th Session (), provides that the right to adequate protection of trade union property constitutes one of the essential civil liberties for the normal exercise of trade union rights. The Committee urges the Government to undertake judicial inquiries into the violent searches carried out against trade union premises and the homes of trade unionists, with the aim of identifying and punishing the guilty parties in an exemplary manner so as to avoid a recurrence of such acts. The Committee requests the Government to supply it as soon as possible with all the relevant information it has at its disposal.
.As regards the new allegations concerning acts of anti-union discrimination at the ADOC works (the dismissal of ten trade union leaders and  workers for attempting to establish a trade union) and at ARCO S.A. (police repression of striking workers), the Committee notes that the Government has neither supplied its observations on these allegations nor put forward reasons to justify this omission, and again requests the Government to send its comments in the shortest possible time.
.The Committee draws",2,1989,El Salvador
222,"attention to the Government's persistent negative attitude, shown since February  by its refusal to accept a direct contacts mission to the country and by its failure, despite the extreme seriousness of the allegations, to send the information required by the Committee. The Committee deplores the Government's unacceptable attitude. It urges it once again to send the information and accept the mission in question, and recommends to the Governing Body to give the widest publicity to the present report, particularly in El Salvador.
.The Committee has examined these cases on various occasions. Case No.  was last examined at its February  meeting, when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body (see st Report of the Committee, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session (March )). Cases Nos.  and  were last examined at its November  meeting, when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body (see th Report of the Committee, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its st Session (November )). Case No.  was last examined at its February  meeting, when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body (see st Report of the Committee, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session (March )).
.The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) submitted new allegations in communications dated  December  and  August .
.The Government sent partial information in communications dated  and  May .
.In addition, the Committee requested the Government, in February, May and November  and in February and May , to accept a direct contacts mission (see th Report, para. , th Report, para. , th Report, para. , st Report, paras.  and , and rd Report, para. ).
.Owing to the lack of detailed information from the Government concerning the allegations, the Committee has had to adjourn these four cases on several occasions, finally making an urgent appeal to the Government at its November  meeting (see th Report, para. ). In that appeal the Committee, noting that the Government had not sent a favourable reply concerning the direct contacts mission which it had been requested to accept, drew the Government's attention to the fact that, in accordance with the procedural rules set out in paragraph  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body, it would present a report on the substance of the cases at its subsequent meeting, even if the information or observations requested had not been received in due time.
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).

.As regards the  instances of searches, carried out with violence, of trade union premises and homes of trade unionists alleged by the complainants (see Annex ), the Committee considers these acts to be inexcusable and points out that any search of trade union premises, or of unionists' homes, without a court order constitutes an extremely serious infringement of freedom of association.

.The Committee draws attention to the Government's persistent negative attitude, shown since February  by its refusal to accept a direct contacts mission to the country. The Committee, bearing in mind that the Government has shown for many years and despite the extreme seriousness of the allegations an almost total lack of cooperation with the Committee's procedure, intends to examine the present cases once again in May . If the Government again fails to send the required information in a full and detailed manner and if it does not accept the direct contacts mission, the Committee will recommend to the Governing Body that it gives the widest publicity to the report in question.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee notes once again the Government's manifest lack of cooperation in observing the Committee's procedure and, specifically, the inexplicable failure to send almost all the information repeatedly requested by the Committee so as to enable it to determine the veracity of the outstanding allegations.(b) As regards the violent death and disappearance of, physical assaults on and death threats against trade union leaders and trade unionists (see Annexes  and ), the Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that a situation which gives rise to a climate of violence such as that which encourages the murder, kidnapping or disappearance of trade union leaders and persons is totally incompatible with the principles of freedom of association. The Committee urges the Government to instigate as a matter of urgency a judicial inquiry in order to shed light on the facts, to punish the guilty parties and to avoid any recurrence of such acts. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any inquiry it undertakes and to communicate to the Committee the results of the judicial inquiry undertaken into the murder of Porfirio Vasquez and Miguel Angel Martinez.(c) As regards the numerous arrests and detentions of trade union leaders and trade unionists, the Committee once again requests the Government to release all those who might have been detained on the grounds of trade union activities and asks it to furnish the Committee with information on the situation of all trade union members and leaders referred to in these cases, indicating whether they are currently detained, on trial or free.(d) The Committee urges the Government to undertake judicial inquiries into the cases of searches of trade union premises and of the homes of trade unionists carried out with violence and without court orders (see Annex ), with a view to identifying and punishing the guilty parties and avoiding a repetition of such acts. The Committee requests the Government to inform it as soon as possible of any information it may have in that connection. The Committee likewise requests the Government to take further measures to identify and punish those responsible for the condemnable attack against the headquarters of FENESTRAS in October .(e) The Committee points out that the Government has not provided its observations on the new allegations concerning acts of anti-union discrimination at the ADOC works and at ARCO S.A. nor puts forward any reasons to justify this omission and again requests it to send its comments in the shortest possible time.(f) The Committee draws attention to the Government's persistent negative attitude, shown since February  by its refusal to accept a direct contacts mission to the country.

The Committee again requests the Government to accept a direct contacts mission without delay.
.The Committee of Freedom of Association examined these cases at its November , November  and November  meetings, and presented interim reports to the Governing Body (see th, th and th Reports of the Committee, approved by the Governing Body at its st, th and th Sessions (November , November  and November )).
.After these cases were last examined, communications were received from the United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador (FUSS) dated  March and  and  May  (Case No. ) and the World Confederation of Organisations of the Teaching Profession (WCOTP) dated  October  (Case No. ). The Government sent its observations on some of the pending allegations in communications dated  April and  and  August .
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.At its meeting of November , the Governing Body approved the following recommendations of the Committee:(a) the Committee can only reiterate its earlier recommendations and again express its deep preoccupation with the gravity and persistence of the allegations presented concerning the disappearance, murder and arrest of trade unionists, as well as the assault of trade union premises and the censorship of radio broadcasts on behalf of workers;(b) the Committee is conscious of the difficulties facing the Government at the present time but it must again appeal to the Government to take all practicable measures to guarantee the normal exercise of trade union rights having respect for human rights;(c) the Committee requests the Government to institute judicial inquiries and to keep it informed of the outcome of these inquiries concerning the death and disappearance of the trade unionists mentioned by the complainants, as well as the assaults of trade union premises; the Committee asks the Government to ensure that the arrested trade unionists whose names are supplied by the complainants are either charged or - in the absence of charges - released. It also asks the Government to furnish the information on the fate of trade union leaders and activists who have been arrested or who have disappeared, including any judgements which may have been handed down concerning these individuals;(d) lastly, the Committee requests the Government to furnish its comments and observations concerning the allegation of censorship regarding a radio broadcast of the Confederation of Cooperative Associations of El Salvador on behalf of workers.
.In its communication dated  October , the WCOTP points out that leaders of ANDES- de junio reported that on  October  the teacher Vilma Chavez was strangled at her residence. The assassination was perpetrated, according to ANDES, by members of the security forces dressed in civilian clothes as a reprisal following the end of the national teachers movement against the coming into force of the new education Act which violated teachers' rights and opened the way to the privatisation of schools. This movement managed to obtain the repeal of the Act.
.In a communication dated  March , the FUSS denounces the detention on  March, by members of the police force, of  employees, members of the General Association of Employees of the Ministry of Finance (AGEMHA) who had gone on strike. They included Inmar Rolando Reyes, Melvin Ovidio Portillo and Oscar Bonilla Segovia.
.The FUSS communication also points out that on  March the police forces detained Messrs. Ernesto Beltrn,",-1,1989,El Salvador
224,"Carlos Salvador Viscarra, Mario Alberto Aviles, Jorge Alberto Quijano, Jess Alvarado, Edgardo Orellano, Jorge Alberto Araujo, Toms Montenegro, Nelson Pineda, Ambrosia N. and another person whose name is not known. The persons were captured during a strike by more than , workers of AGEMHA in pursuance of wage and labour claims. The FUSS points out that the Government responded by taking the matter to the labour court which declared the strike unconstitutional and illegal and demanded the immediate return of workers to their workplaces. The Government, through the mass media, organised a campaign to discredit and intimidate the AGEMHA which served as a reason for justifying the arrests. The communication also denounces the capture of Mrs. Vilma Guzmn of the Seamstresses Union.
.In a communication dated  May , the FUSS states that at  p.m. on  May, in the canton of Ro Fro of the Department of Ahuachapn, Messrs. Pedro Matozo, Juan Lico and Adalberto Gonzales were captured, along with three other persons whose names are not known, all of whom were grass-roots members of the National Association of Agricultural Workers (ANTA). The members of ANTA were captured by members of the National Guard and Military Unit No.  of the Army, both of which have denied the abduction, giving rise to fears for the physical safety and psychological state of mind of the above-mentioned trade unionists.
.In the same way, in a communication dated  May , the FUSS denounces the capture, on the same date, of  members of ANTA in the same canton of Ro Fro (Ahuachapn) on the San Francisco de Ass hacienda, by members of the National Guard and Military Unit No. . Prior to the abduction of the ANTA members, the Government launched a fierce campaign of defamation against all the member organisations of the Democratic Farmers Alliance (ADC) and its officials in an attempt to legitimise the repression which had been initiated. Furthermore, the magistrates of the various legal authorities, in coordination with the military and the landowners, have circulated rumours of possible ""legal"" action being taken against officials of the peasant organisations.
.The Government, in its communication dated  April , reaffirms its determination to continue the search for peace based on dialogue and mutual understanding. As regards the dynamite attack against the trade union premises of FENASTRAS, the Government states that a proposal has been made to set up a special commission comprising officials of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), representatives of the public prosecutor's office, the Ministry of Justice, the Commission on Criminal Acts, and delegates of the Commission for Human Rights (a government agency). The objective of this Commission would be to establish with some degree of reliability the source of the attack; it was also proposed to set up a committee which would act as guarantor, with representatives of the United Nations Organisation (UNO), the Organisation of American States (OAS), CEDES, political parties, trade union organisations, including one from FENASTRAS. Furthermore, the Government reaffirmed its intention to seek clarification of this event and to ensure that the authors are punished according to the law.
.The Government also refers to the allegations made by the WCOTP concerning the assassinations on  February  of Miguel Angel Lazo Quintanilla, member of the Executive Committee of the National Association of Educators (ANDES  de junio) and Carlos Rodrguez Domnguez, member of the FUSS, and points out that these trade unionists were killed as a result of an armed conflict with units of the Air Force, while they were carrying out acts of sabotage along with other armed terrorists, creating panic amongst the population and whose arms were confiscated after they died in combat. The Government adds that it is completely false that their bodies showed signs of torture, as alleged by the complainants.
.The communication from the Government also refers to the arrest on  March  of the leader of FENASTRAS, Juan Jos Huezo, and points out that members of the National Police arrested him on charges of having committed acts of physical assault against the previous Minister of Labour and acts of serious damage and terrorism against the Ministry of Labour. He was subsequently remanded in the custody of the Fourth Criminal Court of San Salvador, under Order No.  dated  March .
.In another communication dated  August , the Government also refers to the detention of  members of ANTA on  May  and points out that on that day a group of peasants who were members of ANTA were dislodged and captured by members of the National Guard and Unit No.  in the San Francisco de Ass hacienda in the Canton of Ro Fro (Ahuachapn). The Government points out that delegates of the Santa Ana Regional Office of the El Salvador Commission for Human Rights confirmed that the First Magistrates Court of Ahuachapn ordered the detention of  persons on a charge of usurpation of patrimonial rights of Mrs. Elba Magaa de Romero; after being remanded in the custody of the above-mentioned Court, these persons were released at the end of the inquiry. The Government encloses the list of these persons: Adalberto Salazar Gonzlez, Santos Bonito, Guillermo Matozo, Ismael Moises Matozo, Cristobal Zarceo Pineda, Douglas Adonay Fabin Solis, Alfredo Ernesto Pineda Zarceo, Rodrigo Antonio Zecea Vargas, Santos Mauricio Hernndez Bonito, Miguel Antonio Cortez Ramos, Adn Matozo, Rodrigo Vargas Girn, Victor Manuel Pineda Garca, Juan Antonio Calzadilla Mendoza, Jos Antonio Lico Aguirre, Santos Aguilar Hernndez, Higinio Sandoval Zuiga, Roberto Amilcar Arriaza Lpez, Juan Antonio Ramrez Hernndez, David Antonio Galicia Hernndez, Cruz Bojorquez Luna, Carlos Roberto Snchez Ramirez and Jos Alberto Lico Hernndez.
.In another communication dated  August , the Government provides further information on the detention of the  ANTA members and points out that a group of approximately  peasants, under the influence of members of the ANTA front organisation, led by Pedro Matozo, Mximiliano Matozo and Antonio Lpez, illegally took over the San Francisco de Ass hacienda. The owner initiated proceedings in the Magistrates Court of the jurisdiction. The investigating magistrate carried out an inspection of the hacienda accompanied by members of the National Guard who provided protection. The magistrate met with the officials and members of ANTA who had taken over the building in an attempt to reach a legal solution. The meeting was attended by a lawyer who represented ANTA and one of its officials who were backed up by approximately  persons (men, women and children); the men armed with machetes surrounded the magistrate in a threatening manner. The magistrate talked with the lawyer representing ANTA and pointed out that the illegal taking over of the hacienda was an offence and that those who had seized the property had to negotiate its acquisition in a legal form. The magistrate returned three days later to inform the peasants that they had five days to vacate the property. The lawyer representing ANTA undertook to provide counsel to the usurpers and to appear on  May  in the First Magistrates Court to try to reach a satisfactory solution.
.The Government continues by pointing out that since the hacienda was not vacated by the end of the time limit established by the magistrate, the latter ordered the security forces to remove the usurpers and arrest the  persons mentioned in the previous communication from the Government, all of whom were charged with the usurpation of assets belonging to the owner of the hacienda. The persons arrested were taken to the municipal prison of the city and remanded in the custody of the competent penal court. On  May ,  peasants who were members of ANTA gathered in front of the municipal town hall demanding the release of the  persons arrested during the eviction of the peasants from the San Francisco de Ass hacienda; the persons detained were released by order of the criminal magistrate following pressure exerted by ANTA members during this demonstration.
.The Government concludes by pointing out that the eviction occurred without any incident and with the collaboration of the peasants who argued that they had been deceived and that their leaders had told them that they had purchased the property.
.The Government notes that most of the allegations in these cases refer to acts of violence and arrests which directly affect the trade union movement in El Salvador and are to be set in the context of the armed conflict which has been affecting the country for several years.
.As regards the serious allegations pending from the previous examination of the cases in November , the Committee reiterates to the Government the need to initiate judicial inquiries and to continue to keep the Committee informed of the results of such inquiries into the death, disappearance and arrest of the numerous officials mentioned by the complainant, and of the inquiries made into the attacks on trade union premises.
.The Committee takes note of the information provided by the Government, in particular its determination to continue the search for peace based on dialogue and mutual understanding. It",0,1989,El Salvador
225,"also notes that the Government expressed its intention to establish a special commission to shed light on the terrible attack against the headquarters of FENASTRAS on  November  which left nine persons dead and many injured. The Committee hopes that when the commission has finished its work, the Government will be able to inform the Committee of progress made in shedding light on to this attack.
.As regards the assassination on  February  of Miguel Angel Lazo Quintanilla, a member of the Executive Committee of ANDES, and Carlos Rodrguez Domnguez, member of the FUSS, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, these trade unionists died in an armed conflict with units of the Air Force when they were engaged in acts of sabotage, and the allegation that these trade unionists were tortured is false. In this respect, the Committee recalls that, in a previous communication dated  July , the Government had stated that the deaths of these two trade unionists were being examined by the Justice of the Peace in Soyapango. It also notes that the complainants alleged that one of the trade unionists had been arrested on  February  by members of the Air Force. Given the apparent contradiction between these statements, the Committee urges the Government to send as soon as possible the complete text of the judgement issued by the tribunal of Soyapango, concerning all the persons involved in these events, in which several trade unionists lost their lives.
.As regards the arrest on  March  of the leader of FENASTRAS, Juan Jos Huezo, the Committee notes the information from the Government that this official was arrested by members of the National Police on charges of having committed acts of physical assault against the previous Minister of Labour and acts of serious damage and terrorism against the Ministry of Justice and that he was remanded in the custody of the Fourth Criminal Court of San Salvador. Given the time which has elapsed since his detention, the Committee requests the Government to inform it without delay of the results of the proceedings initiated against the leader Juan Jos Huezo on  March .
.As regards the allegation concerning the detention of  peasants including the ANTA members Pedro Matozo, Juan Lico and Adalberto Gonzales on  May  in the San Francisco de Ass hacienda in the canton of Ro Fro (Ahuachapn), the Committee notes the detailed information provided by the Government on this allegation, in particular that these persons were detained on the instructions of the local magistrate on a charge of having seized the hacienda and that at the end of the inquiries they were released by order of the criminal court. In this respect the Committee notes that questions related to land ownership and tenure governed by specific national legislation have nothing to do with the problems of the exercise of trade union rights. (See, for example, Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, rd edition, , para. .)
.The Committee regrets that the Government has not replied to the serious allegations made following the last examination of these cases, namely: the assassination of the leader of ANDES- de junio, Vilma Chavez on  October , following the end of a national movement by teachers; the detention on  March  of  members of the General Association of Employees of the Ministry of Finance (AGEMHA) who had gone on strike in support of wage and labour claims; and the arrest of Mrs. Vilma Guzmn of the Seamstresses Union. The Committee urges the Government to send its observations on these and other serious allegations still pending in these cases and reiterates that trade union rights can only be exercised in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind against trade unionists, and that it is for governments to ensure that this principle is respected. (See th Report, Case No.  (Brazil), para. .)
.Finally, having noted the Government's desire for dialogue and mutual understanding, as well as the situation of extreme violence which is affecting society in general and the trade union movement in particular, the Committee reiterates the request made to the Government in its examination of Case No.  that it accept a direct contacts mission as soon as possible to examine the serious allegations made in the cases still pending before the Committee.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) As regards the serious allegations pending since the last examination of these cases, the Committee reiterates its request that the Government undertake judicial investigations and that it continue to inform the Committee of the results of the proceedings regarding the death, disappearance and arrest of the many trade unionists mentioned by the complainants and of the investigations carried out into the attacks against trade union premises.(b) As regards the attack against the FENASTRAS headquarters on  November , which left nine persons dead and many injured, the Committee strongly hopes that the Government will be in a position to inform the Committee of progress in the investigations carried out by the special commission set up to shed light on the circumstances of this attack.(c) As regards the assassination, on  February , of Miguel Angel Lazo Quintanilla of ANDES and Carlos Rodrguez Domnguez of the FUSS, the Committee, in the light of the apparently contradictory information, urges the Government to transmit as soon as possible the complete text of the judgement issued by the tribunal of Soyapango, concerning all the persons involved in these events, in which several trade unionists lost their lives.(d) As regards the arrest on  March  of the leader of FENASTRAS, Juan Jos Huezo, although the Committee notes the information from the Government on the circumstances of his arrest, given the time which has since elapsed, it asks the Government to inform it without delay of the results of the proceedings initiated on  March  against this official.(e) The Committee regrets that the Government has not replied to the serious allegations made following the last examination of these cases, namely: the assassination of the official of ANDES- de junio, Vilma Chavez on  October , following the end of a national movement by teachers; the detention on  March  of  members of the General Association of Employees of the Ministry of Finance (AGEMHA) who had gone on strike in support of wage and labour claims; and the detention of Mrs. Vilma Guzmn, of the Seamstresses Union. It urges the Government to send its observations on these and other serious allegations still pending in these cases.(f) Finally, having noted the desire for dialogue and mutual understanding expressed by the Government and the situation of extreme violence which is affecting society in general and the trade union movement in particular, the Committee reiterates the request made to the Government in its examination of Case No.  to accept a direct contacts mission as soon as possible to examine the serious allegations presented in the cases pending before the Committee.
.The Committee on Freedom of Association examined these cases at its November  and November  meetings, presenting interim reports to the Governing Body. (See th and th Reports of the Committee, approved by the Governing Body at its st and th Sessions (November  and November ).)
.After Case No.  was last examined, communications were received from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) ( and  November ,  January and  April ), and the United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador (FUSS) ( November  and  February and  April ). The Committee had previously decided to postpone examining the ICFTU communications dated  and  September and  October , as well as an ASTTEL communication dated  September , owing to the fact that the Government's replies to the allegations contained therein had been received very shortly before the Committee's meeting.
.Since the last examination of Case No. , communications were received from the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) ( November ) and the World Confederation of Organisations of the Teaching Profession (WCOTP) ( April ).
.The Government sent certain observations on some of the allegations in communications dated  April,  May and  and  July . The Committee also received a communication from the Government dated  October  which it had been unable to examine owing to the fact that it was received only a few days prior to the Committee's November  meeting.
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations which are still pending in these two cases concern the murder of  trade union leaders and activists, the disappearance of three trade unionists and the arrest of  trade unionists from different branches of economic activity, but primarily from",0,1989,El Salvador
226,"agriculture. These allegations are reproduced in Annex I of this report. In addition, the outstanding allegations also concern the occupation and destruction of trade union premises by law enforcement services, coupled with the theft of equipment and money, and the repression of trade union demonstrations.
.In particular, the complainants had described a first destruction of the FENASTRAS and UNTS headquarters by the explosion of a charge of dynamite on  February  which allegedly caused serious damage to the building and destroyed all the furnishings. There were no fatalities, but a number of people suffered minor injuries. An anti-communist urban commando claimed responsibility for the attack. The complainants explained that on  February  the FENASTRAS and UNTS had called a meeting of workers which met at the premises which had been attacked, and that military forces had intervened by encircling the neighbourhood and blocking off the street with tanks while some  workers were inside the building.
.The complainants had also reported that other premises had been attacked, namely, the headquarters of the National Agricultural Workers' Association (ANTA) in San Salvador on  September , during the course of which the Rural Police and infantry brigades illegally entered the premises and arrested  persons (who were released three days later), and carried off office equipment and money; also, the premises of the same Association at Santa Lucia were assaulted on  December , and the Association's treasurer was arrested by agents of the Second Infantry Brigade of Santa Ana. These agents are also alleged to have carried off all furnishings and equipment. Lastly, the complainants had referred to the violent breakup of a demonstration of the Confederation of Co-operative Associations of El Salvador (COACES) and the National Peasants' Union (UNC), on  December  in the Colon Park. They alleged that members of the Second Infantry Brigade and the Rural Police of Santa Ana struck, wounded and arrested several persons, and seized speakers, radio equipment, photographic equipment and recorders.
.At its November  Session, the Governing Body approved the Committee's following interim recommendations:(a) The Committee deeply deplores the violent situation prevailing in the country. It expresses its grave concern at the extreme seriousness of the allegations which refer mainly to  murders since , disappearances and more than  arrests of trade union officials, trade unionists and co-operative members, as well as to various acts of violence and intimidation (threats, breaking into and searching of trade union premises and a bomb attack against one of these premises).(b) The Committee can only deeply deplore and reprove the violent deaths and disappearances. It urges the Government to open judicial inquiries into these murders and disappearances and to send it as soon as possible all available information, in particular relating to the situation of the detainees and the reasons for their detention, and on the stage of the inquiries as to the whereabouts of those who have disappeared.(c) The Committee urges the Government to adopt strong measures to guarantee that trade union rights may be exercised under normal conditions, i.e., in a situation where fundamental human rights are respected and in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind. The Committee requests the Government to inform it on this matter.(d) The Committee decides to examine at its next meeting the allegations contained in the most recent communications from the ICFTU and ASTTEL as the Government's reply was received only a few days before the Committee's current meeting.
.The ASTTEL and ICFTU communications received on ,  and  September , shortly before the Committee's November  meeting, state that between  and  September  the armed forces arrested  trade unionists and peasants. In particular, the ICFTU denounces the arrest of  trade unionists on  September , reporting that they were brutally beaten and psychologically tortured, that eight women were raped and that one person was hospitalised for serious injuries in the Rosales Hospital. The ICFTU adds that  persons were released on  September, but that all those who held office in the FENASTRAS trade unions are still imprisoned. The names of the  members of AGEMHA, SELSA and FENASTRAS who were imprisoned are contained in Annex II(a).
.In a further communication of  November  the ICFTU reports a second and much more serious destruction of the FENASTRAS headquarters. It alleges that nine persons belonging to the Committee of Mothers of Detained and Disappeared Persons (COMADRES) were killed and  were injured on  October  while meeting peacefully at the FENASTRAS headquarters, when the premises were destroyed by the explosion of a powerful charge of dynamite. The United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador (FUSS) and the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) in communications of  and  November  also denounce this serious bombing of the FENASTRAS headquarters which left nine persons dead and many injured. The names of those killed and wounded are contained in Annex II(b).
.In other communications of January and April  the ICFTU expresses its deep concern over the assault of the premises of another organisation, namely, the Democratic Workers' Confederation (CTD), an ICFTU affiliate, by the National Guard and the Rural Police, on  January , and the arrest of  trade unionists whose names are listed in Annex II(c). The ICFTU also reports the disappearance of Jorge Alberto Villegas, General Secretary for Disputes of the National Association of Salvadorian Teachers (ANDES  June), who was forcefully abducted from his home in Soyapango on  April  by the National Guard. This allegation is confirmed by the WCOTP in a communication of  April  (see Annex II(d)).
.In communications of  February and  April , the FUSS denounces very serious violations of human rights which took place between November  and April , and which struck the trade union movement very hard. In particular, it denounces the murder of five trade union leaders during the period of November  to March , namely: Rodolfo Andrs Prieto, Miguel Angel Hernandez, Carlos Humberto Gomez, Ral Gonzales and Luis Colocho; the injuries inflicted on five trade unionists on  November ; and the disappearance of six trade unionists between November  and March  following bombardments of the civilian population (see Annex II(e)). The FUSS states that the Government is engaged in a campaign to murder the major trade union leaders who oppose official policy, and that it offers a reward of , colons to persons revealing the whereabouts of these trade unionists.
.The FUSS next describes in detail the tragic events of November . On  November, it states, the army arrested  workers of the University of El Salvador at their workplace. The university was subjected to intense bombings by the Salvadorian Air Force, and the ensuing fires destroyed the Schools of Medicine and Dentistry; on the th, ten trade unions of public employees called a work stoppage to protest these bombings and to enable workers to tend to their brothers who had been injured or killed; on the th, the armed forces published a list of names identifying leaders of the UNTS, accusing them of massacres which the army itself had committed, and issuing orders for their arrest; it also ordered its troops to take over and destroy the premises of popular, trade union and occupational organisations and to arrest trade unionists; at dawn on the th, direct actions of reprisal began against the leaders of trade union and popular organisations, accompanied by searches of the premises of various organisations. The armed forces searched homes of several UNTS trade union leaders and machine-gunned those of persons who were not found at home. These trade unionists are Guillermo Rojas, Humberto Centeno, Rosario Acosta, Julio Portillo, Marco Tulio Lima and Francisco Martnez; on the th, some , workers living in the town of Apopa and in districts and farms bordering the north of San Salvador were made to abandon their homes in an atmosphere of panic, when the Government's radio network urged them to leave the area, which they interpreted as a prelude to a bombardment. As a result of the indiscriminate bombardments of the civilian population by the Salvadorian Air Force, several trade unionists have been wounded. Their names appear in Annex II(e).
.Returning to the events of November , the FUSS alleges that the national police arrested six members of the "" May unit"" of the Trade Union of Social Security Workers (STISSS), as well as the leader of the Committee of Dismissed and Unemployed Workers of El Salvador (CODYDES) and the leader of FENASTRAS (see Annex II(f)).
.It also cites other arrests which took place between November  and April  and which involved  trade unionists from several branches of the economy, but primarily from agriculture. According to the allegations, some of these trade unionists were savagely tortured, hung by their arms for three days and by their feet for a further three days, and made to suffer electric shocks all over their bodies (see Annex II(g)). The FUSS also",-1,1989,El Salvador
227,"alleges that coffee plantations have been transformed into genuine military bases, inasmuch as the army maintains sizeable contingents in these plantations.
.The FUSS also refers to searches and sackings of various trade union premises and of the headquarters of the FENASTRAS, STISSS, AGEPYM (public employees) and the ANC (peasants); it explains that on  November members of the First Infantry Brigade invaded the premises of several trade union and co-operative organisations, during the course of which the members of this military unit claim to have arrested  persons, most of them in Soyapango, who were considered members of an armed organisation; in addition, the premises of the Confederation of Co-operation Associations of El Salvador (COACES), a UNTS affiliate, were closed by members of the First Infantry Brigade who captured four employees of this organisation and sacked the premises; likewise, the premises of other trade union and corporative organisations such as the UNTS, the FEASIES and the Committee of Mothers and Families of Disappeared Persons and Political Prisoners (COMADRES) were also invaded, searched and sacked. These actions were carried out by members of the First Infantry Brigade who tore up the sanitary facilities and flooring of several premises. In the UNTS headquarters they stole all office equipment, the photocopier, the mimeograph, a television set, a video recorder and files; in the CCTEM headquarters they removed typewriters, tables and files; in the ASTTEL headquarters they removed files and , colons in cash; on  December, during the sacking of the COACES premises (which was the subject of a complaint of  November), the First Infantry Brigade carried off office equipment and funds valued at more than , colons, in other words, some US$,. This organisation's headquarters are still occupied by the military.
.Lastly, the FUSS denounces the censorship which has been directed against the trade union movement. On  January  the COACES stated that the Chamber of Commerce had threatened a commercial radio station which carried a -minute daily broadcast of the COACES, with the termination of all relations if it continued to broadcast the workers' programme. According to the FUSS, this threat was carried out when the national police ordered the definitive suspension of this broadcast within the framework of the suspension of legal guarantees throughout the country, in violation of article  of the Constitution which protects and encourages the activities of co-operatives.
.The FUSS concludes its communication by stating that from November  to April , according to information furnished by Julio Portillo, a leader of the UNTS, the Salvadorian armed forces arrested and tortured  trade unionists, murdered  and were responsible for the disappearance of a further .
.In a first communication of  October , received shortly before the Committee's November  meeting, the Government replies that on  September  trade unionists belonging to FENASTRAS set fire to two city buses during a demonstration which was taking place in the centre of the capital city. The security forces intervened to prevent further troubles; during their escape, the demonstrators took over an evangelical church, taking the pastor and congregation as hostages. The authorities sought to dislodge them by using tear-gas and arrested  demonstrators. On the following day,  of them were delivered to the International Committee of the Red Cross, while the other  were sent before the courts of justice. On  October the First Criminal Court remanded  of the demonstrators, who confessed to participating in the above-mentioned criminal actions, into provisional custody, and order the release of the remainder, against whom no charges were filed.
.In further communications of  April and  May  the Government states that, as regards the case of Samuel Maldonado and other trade unionists belonging to the UCS, on  January  members of the National Guard undertook a search at , Avenida San Jos, in San Salvador, following reports by civilians that illegal meetings were being held in that place, and arrested  trade unionists belonging to the UCS. During the course of subsequent investigations it was ascertained that the persons in question were authorised by the Head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to hold trade union-type meetings, under the state of emergency which had been decreed throughout the nation to cope with a recent offensive by an armed group. Thus, there were no grounds for their detention, and the National Guard proceeded on the same day ( January) to release these trade unionists and turn them over to a representative of the El Salvador Commission for Human Rights (a government agency), which verified that the persons concerned had not been mistreated physically or psychologically.
.The Government also makes reference to the case of Jos Humberto Carrillo, a member of ASTTEL, who was arrested by members of the National Guard on  January  in San Salvador; he was remanded into the custody of the Eighth Criminal Court on  January on suspicion that he had participated in a recent terrorist offensive by an armed group.
.In a communication of  July  the Government states that according to court statistics, allegations of trade union persecution are unsupported, although it is true that in isolated instances and for purely legal reasons, proceedings are brought against people who may belong to one trade union or another. Nevertheless, this in no way implies a concerted campaign against freedom of association, since proceedings are also brought against civilians or members of the military who commit a crime or misdemeanor, whether or not they belong to any kind of association.
.As regards the second bombing of the FENASTRAS premises, the Government states in a first communication that proceedings were instituted before the Second Justice of the Peace and subsequently transferred to the Second Criminal Court, where the case is currently pending. To date, it has not been possible to identify the party or parties responsible for this action, in spite of the investigations, inspections and hearing of witnesses. In a subsequent communication the Government recognises that the bombing in question killed Elizabeth Velasquez, Luis Vasquez and others, but merely states that the investigation continues.
.The Government encloses with its communication a document prepared by the El Salvador Commission for Human Rights which contains information on the following arrested trade unionists:- Ricardo Alberto Lazo Acevedo. Arrested by members of the National Guard on  August  in San Salvador on suspicion of being a terrorist; subsequently released on  August of the same year and turned over to a delegate of the Commission for Human Rights;- Juan Jos Mendoza Avila. Arrested on  April  in San Salvador by members of the Rural Police, having been found with abundant material for the manufacture of explosive devices. The arrest took place inside the premises of the FUSS. He was subsequently released on  April of the same year and turned over to a delegate of the aforementioned Commission;- Salvador Fredy Lpez Leiva. Arrested on  November  in San Salvador by members of the First Infantry Brigade on suspicion of being a terrorist; released on  November  and turned over to a delegate of the aforementioned Commission;- Rafael Zepeda Gonzlez. Arrested on  August  by members of the Rural Police for his membership in the national resistance, and remanded to the custody of the Fourth Criminal Court of San Salvador;- Filipo Enoc Villalta Garca. Arrested by members of the Rural Police on  August  for active membership in the FPL, and remanded to the custody of the Sixth Criminal Court of San Salvador;- Pedro Garca Snchez. Arrested by members of the national police on  August  on suspicion of being a terrorist, and remanded to the custody of the Fifth Criminal Court of San Salvador;- Jorge Alberto Coreas. Arrested on  August  by members of the national police of San Salvador on suspicion of being a terrorist, and remanded to the custody of the Fifth Criminal Court of San Salvador;- Francisco Meja Guevara. Arrested by members of the Tactical Infantry Battalion on suspicion of being a terrorist; subsequently released on  November  and turned over to the International Committee of the Red Cross.
.The Government also states that Case No. / against Jos Humberto Castillo in the Eighth Criminal Court was dismissed on the judge's orders when Mr. Castillo was released on  February . The investigations into the deaths of Professors Miguel Angel Lazo Quintanilla and Carlos Rodrguez are being examined by the Justice of the Peace in Soyapango.
.In a communication of  July  the Government states that Professor Jorge Alberto Villegas, a former member of the Executive Committee of ANDES  June, who had been arrested at his home by the Civil Guard on  April  and charged with participating in subversive activities, was released by the First Criminal Court on  April .
.The Committee takes note of the information and observations furnished by the Government concerning these two cases. Nevertheless, it notes with regret that, in disregard of its earlier recommendation, the Government has not furnished information on",-1,1989,El Salvador
228,"judicial inquiries which the Committe had requested that the Government institute with respect to the murders of  trade unionists since  and the disappearances alleged by the complainants.
.The Committee notes with deep regret that the complainants continue to report violent deaths, arrests and disappearances of trade unionists, as well as even more violent assaults of trade union premises which have taken place since the cases were last examined in November . Moreover, it notes that new allegations report measures of censorship which have been taken by the authorities against the trade union movement since the national police, according to the complainants, ordered the definitive suspension of a radio broadcast of the Confederation of Co-operative Associations of El Salvador on behalf of workers. As regards these points, the Committee regrets to note that the Government has furnished very little information on the previous and new concrete and detailed allegations of the complainants.
.Faced with this situation, the Committee is conscious of the difficulties against which the Government is striving but must again appeal to the Government to adopt all practicable measures to guarantee the normal exercise of trade union rights having respect for human rights.
.The Committee notes that, according to the Government's replies, certain trade unionists who were arrested have been released after it was ascertained that their arrest was not warranted, and that a representative of the El Salvador Commission for Human Rights has ascertained that those arrested were not mistreated. It also notes that, according to the Government, certain trade unionists identified by name by the complainants, are suspected of being terrorists and have been remanded into the custody of criminal courts.
.Given that the arrest and detention of trade unionists may constitute a serious interference with the exercise of trade union rights, the Committee considers that the adoption of such measures, even for reasons of internal security, may imply serious interference in the exercise of trade union rights, and considers that they should be accompanied by appropriate judicial safeguards (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, rd edition, , para. ). The Committee recalls that the detention of trade unionists against whom no charges are brought can endanger the exercise of trade union rights. It accordingly requests the Government to ensure that the trade unionists mentioned by the complainants should either be charged or - in the absence of charges - be released. It also requests the Government to furnish information on the fate of trade union leaders and activists who have been arrested or who have disappeared, and who have been identified by name by the complainants, including information on any judgements that may have been handed down in their cases.
.As regards the many attacks against many trade union premises, accompanied by acts of violence (deaths, injuries and sackings), the Committee notes that the Government has merely indicated, as regards the second bombing of the FENASTRAS premises, that an investigation has begun, that two persons were killed, and that the investigation is proceeding. The Committee regrets to note that the Government has not furnished any information on the other allegations in this matter.
.The Committee considers that the occupation of trade union premises without a court warrant constitutes a serious interference by the authorities in trade union activities, and insists on the importance of the resolution concerning trade union rights and their relations with civil liberties, adopted by the International Labour Conference at its th Session (), which states that the right to an adequate protection of trade union property constitutes an essential freedom in the normal exercise of trade union rights. The Committee therefore urgently requests the Government to institute judicial inquiries into the allegations concerning the assaults on trade union premises with a view to punishing those responsible for such actions and preventing their recurrence, and immediately to forward information it may have in this connection.
.As regards the censorship of a radio broadcast of the Confederation of Co-operative Associations of El Salvador on behalf of the workers, the Committee notes that the Government has not refuted this allegation and that it has failed to comment on it. The Committee recalls that the right to express opinions through the press, radio, or by other means, is an essential aspect of trade union rights, and it therefore requests the Government to furnish detailed comments or observations on this allegation.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee can only reiterate its earlier recommendations and again express its deep preoccupation with the gravity and persistence of the allegations presented concerning the disappearance, murder and arrest of trade unionists, as well as the assault of trade union premises and the censorship of radio broadcasts on behalf of workers.(b) The Committee is conscious of the difficulties facing the Government at the present time but it must again appeal to the Government to take all practicable measures to guarantee the normal exercise of trade union rights having respect for human rights.(c) The Committee requests the Government to institute judicial inquiries and to keep it informed of the outcome of these inquiries concerning the death and disappearance of the trade unionists mentioned by the complainants, as well as the assaults of trade union premises; the Committee asks the Government to ensure that the arrested trade unionists whose names are supplied by the complainants are either charged or - in the absence of charges - released. It also asks the Government to furnish information on the fate of trade union leaders and activists who have been arrested or who have disappeared, including any judgements which may have been handed down concerning these individuals.(d) Lastly, the Committee requests the Government to furnish its comments and observations concerning the allegation of censorship regarding a radio broadcast of the Confederation of Co-operative Associations of El Salvador on behalf of workers.
.The Committee examined Case No.  at its November  meeting and submitted an interim report to the Governing Body. (See th Report of the Committee, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its st Session (November ).)
.After Case No.  was last examined, communications were received from: the International Federation of Plantation, Agricultural and Allied Workers (IFPAAW) ( November and  December ); the United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador (FUSS) (,  and  January,  February,  May and  August ); the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) ( March, ,  and  September and  October ); and the Association of Salvadorian Telecommunications Workers (ASTTEL) ( September ).

.The International Federation of Plantation, Agricultural and Allied Workers (IFPAAW) alleges the following:- On  September , members of the Fiscal Police and infantry brigades illegally broke into the premises of the National Association of Agricultural Workers (ANTA) in San Salvador and imprisoned  persons, who were released three days later. On this occasion, office equipment and money were stolen. Similarly, between April and June , the army of El Salvador and the police arrested  members of ANTA for short periods without bringing any charge whatsoever against them.- On  October , Andrs Martnez and Adn Santos were arrested without a warrant in San Antonio, La Juanta canton, Metapn, Department of Santa Ana, by members of the Second Infantry Brigade; on  October , Mara Cristina Meja, Rufina Figueroa and Herculano Mndez were arrested. Herculano Mndez is an ANTA official.- On  November , Eliodoro Pineda, Cecilio Aguilar Sorto (a minor), and Hos Hernn Bentez Aguilar were arrested without a warrant by members of the Military Detachment No. , with its headquarters in San Francisco Gotera, Moarazn, and were later executed. The three bodies were later found with signs of having been cruelly tortured. The father of Jos Hernn Bentez Aguilar, also a member of ANTA, has received death threats. ANTA believes that these acts were a reprisal because of the campaign carried out by harvest workers to obtain an increase in their minimum wage, which, it should be recalled, has not been increased since .
.The United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador (FUSS) alleges the following facts:- On  December , Rosa Imelda Medrano, worker at the Occidente University Centre and member of the Association of Workers of the University of El Salvador, ADUES, Santa Ana Section, was assassinated. The murder was committed at . p.m. by members of the Second Infantry Brigade, which has its headquarters in this city of Santa Ana, when the person in question was returning from a meeting held by the University of El Salvador in the capital to demand an increase its budget.- At midnight on  December , Roberto Gmez Aguirre, caretaker of the University of El Salvador, was murdered at the entrance to the physics department inside the university campus. This murder was committed by members of a security group, assumed to be the national police.- Walter Vides, member of the Press and Propaganda Commission of the Committee of Unemployed and Dismissed Workers of El Salvador (CODYDES) was arrested on  December . It has been suggested that members of the National Guard were responsible for this action.- Jaime Alejandro Estvez Ortiz, member of the National Association of Workers in the Ministry of Agriculture (ANTMAG) and his friend Vilma Gladis Vsquez, of the State and Municipal Workers' Co-ordination Council (CCTEM), were arrested by the National Guard in their home on  December .- On  December , three members of the regional branch of the National Association of Agricultural Workers (ANTA) were arrested by members of the Second Infantry Brigade, which has its headquarters in the town of Santa Ana. One of these trade union members is the Finance Secretary of ANTA. The arrest occurred when the army were searching the headquarters of the regional branch, which is located in the residential area of Santa Luca, in the above-mentioned town. Furthermore, all the furniture and equipment on the premises were removed.- On  December , at  a.m., in the Coln Park in the town of Santa Ana, members of the Second Infantry Brigade and the Fiscal Police which have their headquarters in this town, dressed in uniform and civilian clothing, violently broke up a meeting organised by the Co-operative Associations Confederation of El Salvador (COACES) and the National Peasants' Union (UNC). The aggressors seized audio equipment installed on this occasion by these organisations, as well as video equipment, cameras, tape recorders, etc. An unspecified number of persons were beaten up and arrested.- Officials receive many threats and are sometimes persecuted, and trade union demonstrations are put down violently.- On  January , the authorities detained Margarita Eugenia Navarro",0,1989,El Salvador
230,"and Alfredo Lemus, members of the National Trade Union Federation of Salvadorian Workers (FENASTRAS).- On  February , soldiers from the ""Urban Anti-communist Maximiliano Hernndez Martnez Commandos"" carried out an attack against the premises of FENASTRAS and the National Unity of Salvadorian Workers (UNTS).
.The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) points out that the headquarters of FENASTRAS and the UNTS were attacked with explosives, which caused severe material damage to the building and destroyed the furnishings. There was no loss of life although some light injuries were incurred. The ICFTU adds that on  February , FENASTRAS and UNTS called a workers' assembly which met in the same place where these events occurred. As a result, the army surrounded the area and blocked the street in which the headquarters are located with tanks. About  workers were inside the destroyed headquarters.
.In its latest communications, the United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador (FUSS) alleges the following facts:- Alberto Monge and Carlos Palacios, textile workers, were murdered in Soyapango (San Salvador) on  May . On that day, one of the death squads sent a message to all the communications media in the country, threatening to murder any persons organised in trade unions and other peoples' organisations.- Pablo Obdulio Vargas, disputes secretary of the Chalchuapa subsection of the Trade Union of the Coffee Industry (SICAFE) and official of the Occidente Workers' Committee (CTO) of the UNTS, was murdered by heavily armed persons in civilian clothing at . a.m. in the town of Chalchuapa, Department of Santa Ana, on  May .- Santiago Menndez, of the ""nd of May"" Agrarian Reform Co-operative, was arrested on  May  by heavily armed men in civilian clothing at  a.m. in his home in the town of Nejapa, municipality of San Salvador. His family and friends have asked the police and military authorities about his whereabouts and all of them deny that he is in their hands; they fear therefore for his life.- Francisco Prez Martnez, member of the Executive Committee of the UNTS and Organisational Secretary of the Trade Union Federation of Workers in the Food, Clothing, Textile and Allied Industries of El Salvador (FESTIAVTSCES), was kidnapped on  May  at  a.m. by members of the Fiscal Police dressed in civilian clothing, who violently detained him at th Avenue North and  Poniente Street in this town, pulling him into a coffee-coloured, twin-cabined truck with polarised windows and bearing the number plate , which was headed in an unknown direction. The authorities deny that Mr. Prez is in their hands, but unofficially it is known that he is being held at premises belonging to the Fiscal Police.- Jorge Lpez, member of the Executive Committee of the UNTS and Secretary-General of the General Association of Employees of the Finance Ministry (AGEMHA) was arrested on  May  at  a.m. by members of both the Fiscal Police and the National Guard who had encircled the headquarters of the UNTS. On this occasion, Jos Basilio Chvez, secretary of international relations of the Salvadorian Association of Telecommunications Workers (ASTTEL) was also arrested. Similarly, Danilo Umanzor, a worker who was accompanying the two previous persons, was also arrested. Officially, the whereabouts of these three colleagues are unknown and none of the above-mentioned authorities acknowledge holding them. Unofficially, the UNTS assumes that the High Command of the army and the Nationalist Republican Alliance Party (ARENA) are preparing a campaign against the two UNTS Executive Committee officials who were arrested, accusing them of taking part in a plot to destabilise the situation in order to boycott the taking over of the new Chairman, Alfredo Cristiani.- On  May , police and military authorities encircled the headquarters of the UNTS and the FEA SIES, encircled and searched the premises of the Co-operatives Associations Confederation of El Salvador (COACES), arresting Jos Gil Magaa, Alfredo Prez and Hugo Nelson Quintanilla, searched the headquarters of FENASTRAS and encircled and searched the headquarters of the FUSS and the headquarters of the Association of Peasant Communities.- Jos Antonio Alfaro, relations secretary of the Salvadorian Association of Workers of the Institute of Supplies Control (ASTIRA), was arrested at  a.m. on  July  in the town of Santa Ana, by persons dressed in civilian clothing who were travelling in a green jeep without number plates.- The FESTIAVTSCES officials, Abraham Rivas, Misael Venegas and Rufino Ardn, were arrested at  a.m. on  July  by members of the Fiscal Police who were dressed in civilian clothing and strongly armed; during these events, which occurred in the municipality of Mejicanos, San Salvador, the first official was injured. Three days later, the officials were released.- Juan Jos Avila Mendoza, grass-roots member of the Poultry Workers' Trade Union (STIAHCES), was arrested by unknown persons at  a.m. on  July  near Ciudad Arce. No law enforcement body has assumed responsibility for his arrest.- Sergio Antonio Rodrguez, FENASTRAS activist, was arrested on  August  by members of the National Guard dressed in civilian clothing in the town of Apopa, San Salvador. The National Guard denies his arrest.- Salvador Lpez Magaa, trade union militant of SOICES, was arrested at  a.m. on  August  on the La Corua district, Soyapango, San Salvador, by members of the airforce and, later, transferred to the prison of San Vicente.- Rafael Zepeda Gonzlez, grass-roots member of the SETA trade union and former finance secretary of the same union, was arrested in Los Planes de Renderos, San Salvador, at . a.m. on  August  by heavily armed civilians who were travelling in a coffee-coloured twin-cabined vehicle with polarised windows and the number plates -. At present, Mr. Gonzlez is in the prison of Mariona.- Filipo Enoc Villalta, of ASTAC, in charge of cultural and artistic training, was arrested at  a.m. on  August  by members of the Fiscal Police on the San Antonio de Ayutuxtepeque estate, San Salvador; however, no law enforcement agency claims responsibility for his arrest.- Alice Sigenza, member of ASTAC, was arrested at  a.m. on  August  in her home in Mejicanos, San Salvador, by members of the Fiscal Police in uniform, who first searched her house.- Pedro Garca and Jorge Corea, grass-root members of ATRAME, were arrested between  and  a.m. on  August  in San Marcos, San Salvador, by members of the national police.- Francisco Meja, first disputes secretary of STITAKCES, a member of FESTIAVTSCES, was arrested by members of the national police on  August .
.The FUSS concludes by pointing out that there is a wave of repression against the trade union and humanitarian movement, led by the High Command of the armed forces and the Nationalist Republican Alliance Party (ARENA) and its death squads.
.In their communications of September and October , the ICFTU and ASTTEL present allegations concerning the search of union headquarters, the detention, kidnapping or disappearance of a very high number of trade union leaders and members, the torture and rape of female unionists.The Government's reply
.In its communication of  June , the Government supplies a number of memoranda from the Ministry of Defence and Public Safety on the allegations submitted by the ICFTU to the Committee in November . The Ministry of Defence and Public Safety points out that the allegations made in the complaints submitted by the ICFTU and the FUSS to the ILO are totally devoid of truth and obviously an attempt to spread false information and constitute a campaign on the part of Salvadorian subversive elements to discredit the Government and the armed forces of the Republic. After carrying out an inquiry, it was proven that the Second Infantry Brigade was not at all involved in the events described in the complaints.
.The Government adds that staff belonging to the General Directorate of the National Guard arrested Mrs. Celia Yaneth Medrano Hernndez at about  a.m. on  June  and that when she was arrested, a certain amount of propaganda with Marxist-Leninist tendencies was confiscated from her. The lady in question has been studying journalism at university since  and, on the day of her arrest, was acting as a reporter for the Communications Secretariat of the National University. According to her statement, she is obliged, for her studies and work schedule, to participate in all the marches or demonstrations carried out by various groups representing university students. As no major evidence could be brought against her and out of deference to the General Directorate of the National Guard and because of a personal intervention from the Vice-Rector of the National University, she was released and handed over at  p.m. on the same day of her arrest to the university authority requesting her release.
.The Government denies that the General Directorate of the National Guard arrested Mrs. Margarita Eugenia Navarro and Mr. Alfredo Lemus. It is for this reason that an inquiry is being carried out to examine the truth of the charges brought before the ILO. The Government",-1,1989,El Salvador
231,"points out that it has taken the necessary steps and will continue taking them in the immediate future to comply with the request for information connected with the present case, paying particular attention to the new aspects of the complaints submitted, especially as regards the alleged continuation of attacks against trade unionists and co-operative members on the part of the army. In so doing, it will aim to contribute towards an impartial inquiry into the allegations.
.In its communication of  October , the Government sent certain observations refuting the allegations contained in the ICFTU and ASTTEL letters of September and October .
.First, the Committee expresses its grave concern at the extreme seriousness of the allegations which refer mainly to  murders since , disappearances and more than  detentions of trade union officials, trade unionists and co-operative members, as well as to various acts of violence and intimidation (threats, breaking into and searching of trade union premises and a bomb attack against one of these premises).
.The Committee can only deeply deplore and reprove the violent deaths and disappearances. It urges the Government to open judicial inquiries into these murders and disappearances and to send it as soon as possible all available information, in particular relating to the situation of the detainees and the reasons for their detention and on the stage of inquiries into the whereabouts of those who have disappeared.
.The Committee urges the Government to adopt strong measures to guarantee that trade union rights may be exercised under normal conditions, i.e., in a situation where fundamental human rights are respected and in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind.
.The Committee notes that the Government points out that the trade unionist Celia Yaneth Medrano Hernndez was released on the same day that she was arrested, that it denies that the Civil Guard arrested the trade unionists Alfredo Lemus and Margarita Eugenia Navarro and that an inquiry is being carried out on this matter. Similarly, the Committee notes the Government's statements that the trade union officials Miguel Lazo Quintanilla and Carlos Rodrguez Domnguez died as a result of an armed conflict with the airforce when they were carrying out acts of sabotage and that their bodies bore no signs of torture. The Committee would nevertheless stress that the Government did not refer to the press cuttings - supplied by the complainants - stating that the bodies of the trade union officials in question showed signs of torture and that Lazo Quintanilla had been arrested on the day preceding his murder by members of the airforce. The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on this matter and to set up a judicial inquiry to ascertain the facts, determine responsibilities and punish those responsible.
.In the light of the foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee deeply deplores the violent situation prevailing in the country. It expresses its grave concern at the extreme seriousness of the allegations which refer mainly to  murders since , disappearances and more than  arrests of trade union officials, trade unionists and co-operative members, as well as to various acts of violence and intimidation (threats, breaking into and searching of trade union premises and a bomb attack against one of these premises).(b) The Committee can only deeply deplore and reprove the violent deaths and disappearances. It urges the Government to open judicial inquiries into these murders and disappearances and to send it as soon as possible all available information in particular relating to the situation of the detainees and the reasons for their detention and on the stage of the inquiries as to the whereabouts of those who have disappeared.(c) The Committee urges the Government to adopt strong measures to guarantee that trade union rights may be exercised under normal conditions, i.e., in a situation where fundamental human rights are respected and in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind. The Committee requests the Government to inform it on this matter.(d) The Committee decides to examine at its next meeting the allegations contained in the most recent communications from the ICFTU and ASTTEL as the Government's reply was received only a few days before the Committee's current meeting.",-1,1989,El Salvador
232,".The Committee has examined Cases Nos. , ,  and  on several occasions, most recently at its meeting of May , when it submitted an interim report (see the Committee's th Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (May )), which drew attention to the Government's persistent negative attitude, shown since February  by its refusal to accept a direct contacts mission to the country and by its failure, in spite of the extreme seriousness of the allegations, to send the information requested by the Committee.
.Consequently, at said meeting the Committee once again urged the Government to send the information requested and to accept the mission in question; it also requested the Director-General of the ILO to contact the representatives of the Government of El Salvador at the next session of the International Labour Conference (June ), and to urge the Government to respect fully the Committee's recommendations. (See the Committee's th Report, paras.  and (f) and (g).)
.Following contacts at the Conference, the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare agreed to the direct contacts mission.
.In addition, the IFCTU submitted new allegations in the context of Case No.  in a communication of  June  (see the attached summary in the direct contacts mission report, para. ).
.The Director-General of the ILO appointed Professor Jos Vida Soria, Professor of Labour Law at the University of Grenada, and President of the Committee of Experts of the European Social Charter, to carry out the direct contacts mission, assisted by a member of the Freedom of Association Branch of the ILO. The mission took place from  September to  October .
.The Committee notes that the mission met with Dr. Juan Sifontes, Minister of Labour and Social Welfare, Dr. Carlos Mauricio Molina, Attorney-General for Human Rights, Dr. Estela Avila, Chief of the International Relations Office of the Ministry of Labour, as well as with representatives of Interoccupational Coordination (UNTS, UNOC, AGEPYM, CGT, FESINCONSTRAM, CTS, etc.) and of the National Association of Private Enterprise (NAPE). It also met with Dr. Augusto Ramirez Ocampo, Chief of the United Nations Observer Mission (ONUSAL) and with several senior officials from ONUSAL. The Committee also notes that the government authorities and the representatives of workers' and employers' organizations collaborated closely with the mission, and that government authorities gave every assistance.
.The Committee has also noted Professor Jos Vida Soria's mission report (see Annex I), as well as the Government's observations addressed to the Committee and to the mission concerning outstanding allegations.
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In as much as the direct contacts mission report contained in the Annex summarizes not only the substance of outstanding allegations, but also the Committee's previous conclusions and recommendations, as well as the Government's observations and the new allegations, the Committee proceeds directly to its conclusions and recommendations.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee notes with interest the improvement in various important aspects of the trade union situation and, especially, the decline in violence to a point, where - according to the mission report - in the last  months there have only been isolated acts of violence against trade unionists although threats have been made in certain cases.(b) Notwithstanding the current improvements in the situation, the Committee deplores once again the numerous and serious acts of violence to which the trade union movement and their leaders have been subjected in recent years and which have often resulted in loss of life or the violation of the most fundamental human and trade union rights. The Committee calls on the Government to ensure that such events are never repeated. The Committee calls on the Government to keep it informed of developments in the judicial investigations into the various cases of trade unionists being murdered or assaulted, or who disappeared in recent years. In the Committee's opinion, the absence of judgements against the guilty parties creates, in practice, a situation of impunity, which reinforces the climate of violence and insecurity, and which is extremely damaging to the exercise of trade union rights.(c) Regarding the arrest of trade unionists and threats made against them in recent years, and while it notes with interest that there are no trade unionists at present under arrest for trade union activities, the Committee deplores the large number of trade unionists who have been arrested in recent years, the threats that have been made and the climate of intimidation in which trade union activity has often taken place; it hopes that such occurrences, which prevent the normal exercise of trade union rights, will not be repeated in the future.(d) Bearing in mind the allegations of anti-union discrimination in the cases under examination and that the mission report mentions that trade union organizations have denounced many such instances, the Committee urges the Government, in its forthcoming revision of the Labour Code and in the future Act respecting industrial relations in the public administration (for which the Government has requested ILO technical assistance), to guarantee adequate protection against dismissal and other acts of discrimination for carrying out legitimate trade union activities, such as the establishment of a trade union.(e) The Committee expresses its strong reprobation and its serious concern with respect to the kidnapping of the six-month-old son of trade unionist Lucas Bernal Mrmol. The Committee insists that the Government make vigorous efforts to find the child and to punish the kidnappers and requests it to keep it informed in this regard.(f) The Committee reminds the Government that the ILO may provide its help in order to provide information on the contents of the Conventions on freedom of association with a view to possible ratifications.
.The Committee on Freedom of Association, set up by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ), met at the International Labour Office, Geneva, on ,  and  May  under the chairmanship of Mr. Jean-Jacques Oechslin, former Chairman of the Governing Body.
.The Committee had before it various complaints of violations of freedom of association in El Salvador, presented by a number of international and national trade union organizations (Cases Nos. , / and ).
.On several occasions the Governing Body asked the Government to give its consent that a representative of the Director-General visit El Salvador to carry out a study of the facts relating to the complaints, within the context of the direct contacts procedure.
.At the March  Session, the Government had not yet given a positive response to the direct contacts mission nor to the allegations concerning these cases. In these circumstances, the Committee recommended that if no reply was received from the Government prior to its next meeting, wider publicity should be given to the Committee's report.
.Since then, no reply has been received from the Government. The Committee submits for the approval of the Governing Body a further report on this matter and recommends that it examine this report at its th Session.
.In examining Cases Nos. , ,  and  at its February  meeting (see th Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (March )), the Committee deplored and emphasized the seriousness of the outstanding allegations and the new allegations which referred to the murder and disappearance of a large number of trade union leaders, as well as to death threats, physical attacks, arrest and detention of workers and trade unionists, the searching of trade unionists' homes, the searching and ransacking of trade union premises and acts of anti-union discrimination (see th Report, para. ).
.The Committee noted, once again, the Government's manifest lack of cooperation in observing the Committee's procedure and, specifically, the inexplicable failure to send almost any of the information repeatedly requested by the Committee so as to enable it to determine the veracity of the outstanding allegations. The Committee pointed out that it had made use of urgent appeals that had been ignored, and found itself obliged, in view of the time that had elapsed since the allegations had been presented, to examine those cases once again without having the Government's observations in respect of the large majority of the allegations presented by the complainants (see th Report, para. ).
.In addition, the Committee recalled that it had requested the Government, in February, May and November  and in February and May , to accept a direct contacts mission (see th Report, para. , th Report, para. , th Report, para. , st Report, paras.  and , and rd Report, para. ), there having been no response to those requests by the Government (see th Report, para. ).
.The Committee drew attention to the Government's persistent negative attitude, shown since February  by its refusal to accept a direct contacts mission to the country. The Committee, bearing in mind that the Government has shown for many years, despite the extreme seriousness",2,1988,El Salvador
233,"of the allegations, an almost total lack of cooperation with the Committee's procedure, pointed out that it intended to examine the present cases once again in May . If the Government again failed to send the required information in a full and detailed manner and if it did not accept the direct contacts mission, the Committee would recommend to the Governing Body to give the widest publicity to the report in question (see th Report, para. ).
.Since that time, the Government has still not transmitted the information requested by the Committee and has failed to respond to the Committee's request that it accept a direct contacts mission. In these circumstances, the Committee has decided to submit a new report on these cases to the Governing Body.
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee notes, once again, the Government's manifest lack of cooperation in observing the Committee's procedure and, specifically, the inexplicable failure to send almost any of the information repeatedly requested by the Committee so as to enable it to determine the veracity of the outstanding allegations. The Committee has made use of urgent appeals that have been ignored, and finds itself obliged, in view of the time that has elapsed since the allegations were presented, to examine these cases once again without having the Government's observations in respect of the large majority of the allegations presented by the complainants.
.The Committee once again reminds the Government that the aim of the whole procedure is to ensure respect for trade union rights, both in law and in practice. The Committee is convinced that whilst this procedure protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side should formulate, so as to allow objective examination, factual replies to the allegations brought against them (First Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body in March ).
.The Committee deplores and emphasizes the seriousness of the outstanding allegations and the new allegations which refer to the murder and disappearance of a large number of trade union leaders, as well as to death threats, physical attacks, arrest and detention of workers and trade unionists, the searching of trade unionists' homes, the searching and sacking of trade union premises and acts of anti-union discrimination.
.The Committee takes note of the Government's observations to the effect that it has been decided to shelve the case relating to the investigation into the criminal act of setting off explosives in the headquarters of FENASTRAS in October  which left nine persons dead and many injured, a decision which was taken in view of the impossibility of identifying the authors of this criminal act and since no group had claimed responsibility for it. The Committee considers it unacceptable in such circumstances that the investigation has been shelved because of the fact that the inquiries undertaken by a special (non-judicial) ad hoc commission failed to produce positive results. The Committee stresses the obligation on the Government to undertake the necessary measures so as to identify and punish those responsible for this condemnable attack so that the application of rapid and efficient justice serves in the re-establishment of peace.
.As regards the new allegations presented by the ICFTU, the Committee takes note of the Government's remarks to the effect that the judicial inquiries are currently under way into the murder of Porfirio Vsquez and Miguel Angel Martnez. The Committee deplores these murders and expresses the hope that the judicial procedures that are under way will serve to clarify the facts and lead to the punishment of the guilty parties. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the result of the judicial inquiries undertaken.
.The Committee likewise takes note of the information sent by the Government in which it states that  members of the National Association of Agricultural Workers (ANTA) were evicted from the San Francisco de Ass Hacienda in the cantn of Ro Fro, Achaupan jurisdiction, and arrested on a charge of usurpation; however, after the competent court considered the case, they were released. The Committee also notes that Carlos Aguilar Garca, Norma Elizabeth Flores Portillo, Carlos Enrique Escobar Figueroa, Evelyn Jeannette Alvarado Crisstomo and Mara Cristina Alvarenga were arrested by the Hacienda police upon being caught painting anti-government slogans, but that they were released following the intervention of the competent magistrates' court in the absence of sufficient grounds for their further detention. The Committee considers that the detention of the mentioned trade unionists and of the  workers belonging to ANTA is an act that should not be repeated, and draws the Government's attention to the fact that the arrest of trade unionists who are involved in acts of public protest that are not offences, or their arrest without the intervention of the corresponding judicial authority with the clear intention of teaching them a lesson as is the case when subsequently no grounds for laying charges are found which would justify their having been denied their freedom, are acts amounting to serious violations of their trade union rights. Governments should take steps to ensure that the authorities concerned receive instructions appropriate to eliminate the danger which arrest for trade union activities implies (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, rd edition, , para. ).
.The Committee draws attention to the fact that the Government has not replied to the remaining outstanding allegations, nor to the large majority of the new allegations presented by the ICFTU in Cases Nos.  and .
.As regards the large number of violent deaths (), disappearances (), physical assaults and death threats against trade union leaders and trade unionists (see Annexes  and ), the Committee once again deplores these acts, which directly undermine the most basic human rights and the development of a free and independent trade union movement. The Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that a situation which gives rise to a climate of violence such as that which encourages the murder, kidnapping or disappearance of trade union leaders and persons is totally incompatible with the principles of freedom of association. In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government urgently to order a judicial inquiry aimed at shedding light on the murder and disappearance of, and the physical assaults and death threats against trade union leaders and trade unionists, to punish the guilty parties and to avoid a recurrence of such acts. In the Committee's opinion, the absence of judgements against the guilty parties creates, in practice, a situation of impunity, which reinforces the climate of violence and insecurity, and which is extremely damaging to the exercise of trade union activities. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of all investigations undertaken.
.As regards the numerous arrests and detentions of trade union leaders and trade unionists ( in all), the Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that the arrest and detention of trade unionists on the grounds of trade union activities constitute a serious infringement of freedom of association and a serious obstacle to the exercise of trade union rights. The Committee once again requests the Government to release all those who might have been detained on the grounds of trade union activities and to provide information on the situation of all trade union members and leaders referred to in these cases, indicating whether they are currently detained, on trial or free.
.As regards the  instances of searches, carried out with violence, of trade union premises and homes of trade unionists, as alleged by the complainants (see Annex ), the Committee considers these acts to be inexcusable and points out that any search of trade union premises or unionists' homes, without a court order, constitutes an extremely serious infringement of freedom of association. It emphasizes that the resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties adopted by the International Labour Conference at its th Session (), provides that the right to adequate protection of trade union property constitutes one of the essential civil liberties for the normal exercise of trade union rights. The Committee urges the Government to undertake judicial inquiries into the violent searches carried out against trade union premises and the homes of trade unionists, with the aim of identifying and punishing the guilty parties in an exemplary manner so as to avoid a recurrence of such acts. The Committee requests the Government to supply it as soon as possible with all the relevant information it has at its disposal.
.As regards the new allegations concerning acts of anti-union discrimination at the ADOC works (the dismissal of ten trade union leaders and  workers for attempting to establish a trade union) and at ARCO S.A. (police repression of striking workers), the Committee notes that the Government has neither supplied its observations on these allegations nor put forward reasons to justify this omission, and again requests the Government to send its comments in the shortest possible time.
.The Committee draws",2,1988,El Salvador
234,"attention to the Government's persistent negative attitude, shown since February  by its refusal to accept a direct contacts mission to the country and by its failure, despite the extreme seriousness of the allegations, to send the information required by the Committee. The Committee deplores the Government's unacceptable attitude. It urges it once again to send the information and accept the mission in question, and recommends to the Governing Body to give the widest publicity to the present report, particularly in El Salvador.
.The Committee has examined these cases on various occasions. Case No.  was last examined at its February  meeting, when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body (see st Report of the Committee, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session (March )). Cases Nos.  and  were last examined at its November  meeting, when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body (see th Report of the Committee, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its st Session (November )). Case No.  was last examined at its February  meeting, when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body (see st Report of the Committee, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session (March )).
.The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) submitted new allegations in communications dated  December  and  August .
.The Government sent partial information in communications dated  and  May .
.In addition, the Committee requested the Government, in February, May and November  and in February and May , to accept a direct contacts mission (see th Report, para. , th Report, para. , th Report, para. , st Report, paras.  and , and rd Report, para. ).
.Owing to the lack of detailed information from the Government concerning the allegations, the Committee has had to adjourn these four cases on several occasions, finally making an urgent appeal to the Government at its November  meeting (see th Report, para. ). In that appeal the Committee, noting that the Government had not sent a favourable reply concerning the direct contacts mission which it had been requested to accept, drew the Government's attention to the fact that, in accordance with the procedural rules set out in paragraph  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body, it would present a report on the substance of the cases at its subsequent meeting, even if the information or observations requested had not been received in due time.
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee notes, once again, the Government's manifest lack of cooperation in observing the Committee's procedure and, specifically, the inexplicable failure to send almost all the information repeatedly requested by the Committee so as to enable it to determine the veracity of the outstanding allegations. The Committee has made use of urgent appeals that have been ignored, and finds itself obliged, in view of the time that has elapsed since the allegations were presented, to examine these cases once again without having the Government's observations in respect of the large majority of the allegations presented by the complainants.
.The Committee once again reminds the Government that the aim of the whole procedure is to ensure respect for trade union rights, both in law and in practice. The Committee is convinced that as this procedure protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side should formulate, so as to allow objective examination, factual replies to the allegations brought against them (First Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body in March ).
.The Committee deplores and emphasizes the seriousness of the outstanding allegations and the new allegations which refer to the murder and disappearance of a large number of trade union leaders, as well as to death threats, physical attacks, arrest and detention of workers and trade unionists, the searching of trade unionists' homes, the searching and sacking of trade union premises and acts of anti-union discrimination.
.The Committee takes note of the Government's observations to the effect that it has been decided to shelve the case relating to the investigation into the criminal act of setting off explosives in the headquarters of FENASTRAS in October  which left nine persons dead and many injured, a decision which was taken in view of the impossibility of identifying the authors of this criminal act and since no group had claimed responsibility for it. The Committee considers it unacceptable in such circumstances that the investigation has been shelved because of the fact that the inquiries undertaken by a special (non-judicial) commission ad hoc failed to produce positive results. The Committee stresses the obligation on the Government to undertake the necessary measures so as to identify and punish those responsible for this condemnable attack so that the application of rapid and efficient justice serves in the re-establishment of peace.
.As regards the new allegations presented by the ICFTU, the Committee takes note of the Government's remarks to the effect that the judicial inquiries are currently under way into the murder of Porfirio Vsquez and Miguel Angel Martnez. The Committee deplores these murders and expresses the hope that the judicial procedures that are under way will serve to clarify the facts and lead to punishment of the guilty parties. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the result of the judicial inquiries undertaken.
.The Committee likewise takes note of the information sent by the Government in which it states that  members of the National Association of Agricultural Workers (ANTA) were evicted from the San Francisco de Ass Hacienda in the cantn of Ro Fro, Achaupan jurisdiction, and arrested on a charge of usurpation; however, after the corresponding court considered the case, they were released. The Committee also notes that Carlos Aguilar Garca, Norma Elizabeth Flores Portillo, Carlos Enrique Escobar Figueroa, Evelyn Jeannette Alvarado Crisstomo and Mara Cristina Alvarenga were arrested by the Hacienda police after they were caught painting anti-government slogans, but that they were released following the intervention of the corresponding magistrates' court in the absence of sufficient grounds for their further detention. The Committee considers that the detention of the mentioned trade unionists and of the  workers belonging to ANTA is an act that should not be repeated, and draws the Government's attention to the fact that the arrest of trade unionists who are involved in acts of public protest that are not offences, or their arrest without the intervention of the corresponding judicial authority with the clear intention of teaching them a lesson as is the case when subsequently no grounds for laying charges are found which would justify their having been denied their freedom, are acts amounting to serious violations of their trade union rights. Governments should take steps to ensure that the authorities concerned have instructions appropriate to eliminate the danger which arrest for trade union activities implies (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, rd edition, , para. ).
.The Committee draws attention to the fact that the Government has refrained from replying to the remaining outstanding allegations as well as to the large majority of the new allegations presented by the ICFTU in Cases Nos.  and .
.As regards the large number of violent deaths (), disappearances (), physical assaults and death threats against trade union leaders and trade unionists (see Annexes  and ), the Committee once again deplores these acts, which directly undermine the most basic human rights and the development of a free and independent trade union movement. The Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that a situation which gives rise to a climate of violence such as that which encourages the murder, kidnapping or disappearance of trade union leaders and persons is totally incompatible with the principles of freedom of association. In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government urgently to order a judicial inquiry aimed at shedding light on the murder and disappearance of, and the physical assaults and death threats against trade union leaders and trade unionists, to punish the guilty parties and to avoid a recurrence of such acts. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of all investigations undertaken.
.As regards the numerous arrests and detentions of trade union leaders and trade unionists ( in all), the Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that the arrest and detention of trade unionists on the grounds of trade union activities constitute a serious infringement of freedom of association and a serious obstacle to the exercise of trade union rights. The Committee once again requests the Government to release all those who might have been detained on the grounds of trade union activities and to furnish it with information on the situation of all trade union members and leaders referred to in these cases, indicating whether they are currently detained,",-1,1988,El Salvador
235,"on trial or free.
.As regards the  instances of searches, carried out with violence, of trade union premises and homes of trade unionists alleged by the complainants (see Annex ), the Committee considers these acts to be inexcusable and points out that any search of trade union premises, or of unionists' homes, without a court order constitutes an extremely serious infringement of freedom of association. It emphasizes that the resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties adopted by the International Labour Conference at its th Session (), provides that the right to adequate protection of trade union property constitutes one of the essential civil liberties for the normal exercise of trade union rights. The Committee urges the Government to undertake judicial inquiries into the violent searches carried out against trade union premises and the homes of trade unionists, with the aim of identifying and punishing the guilty parties in an exemplary manner so as to avoid a recurrence of such acts. The Committee requests the Government to supply it as soon as possible with all the relevant information it has at its disposal.
.As regards the new allegations concerning acts of anti-union discrimination at the ADOC works (the dismissal of ten trade union leaders and  workers for attempting to establish a trade union) and at ARCO S.A. (police repression of striking workers), the Committee notes that the Government has neither supplied its observations on these allegations nor put forward reasons to justify this omission, and again requests the Government to send its comments in the shortest possible time.
.The Committee draws attention to the Government's persistent negative attitude, shown since February  by its refusal to accept a direct contacts mission to the country. The Committee, bearing in mind that the Government has shown for many years and despite the extreme seriousness of the allegations an almost total lack of cooperation with the Committee's procedure, intends to examine the present cases once again in May . If the Government again fails to send the required information in a full and detailed manner and if it does not accept the direct contacts mission, the Committee will recommend to the Governing Body that it gives the widest publicity to the report in question.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee notes once again the Government's manifest lack of cooperation in observing the Committee's procedure and, specifically, the inexplicable failure to send almost all the information repeatedly requested by the Committee so as to enable it to determine the veracity of the outstanding allegations.(b) As regards the violent death and disappearance of, physical assaults on and death threats against trade union leaders and trade unionists (see Annexes  and ), the Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that a situation which gives rise to a climate of violence such as that which encourages the murder, kidnapping or disappearance of trade union leaders and persons is totally incompatible with the principles of freedom of association. The Committee urges the Government to instigate as a matter of urgency a judicial inquiry in order to shed light on the facts, to punish the guilty parties and to avoid any recurrence of such acts. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any inquiry it undertakes and to communicate to the Committee the results of the judicial inquiry undertaken into the murder of Porfirio Vasquez and Miguel Angel Martinez.(c) As regards the numerous arrests and detentions of trade union leaders and trade unionists, the Committee once again requests the Government to release all those who might have been detained on the grounds of trade union activities and asks it to furnish the Committee with information on the situation of all trade union members and leaders referred to in these cases, indicating whether they are currently detained, on trial or free.(d) The Committee urges the Government to undertake judicial inquiries into the cases of searches of trade union premises and of the homes of trade unionists carried out with violence and without court orders (see Annex ), with a view to identifying and punishing the guilty parties and avoiding a repetition of such acts. The Committee requests the Government to inform it as soon as possible of any information it may have in that connection. The Committee likewise requests the Government to take further measures to identify and punish those responsible for the condemnable attack against the headquarters of FENESTRAS in October .(e) The Committee points out that the Government has not provided its observations on the new allegations concerning acts of anti-union discrimination at the ADOC works and at ARCO S.A. nor puts forward any reasons to justify this omission and again requests it to send its comments in the shortest possible time.(f) The Committee draws attention to the Government's persistent negative attitude, shown since February  by its refusal to accept a direct contacts mission to the country. The Committee, bearing in mind that the Government has shown for many years and despite the extreme seriousness of the allegations an almost total lack of cooperation with the Committee's procedure, intends to examine the present cases once again in May . If the Government again fails to send the required information in a full and detailed manner and if it does not accept the direct contacts mission, the Committee will recommend to the Governing Body that it give the widest publicity to the report in question. The Committee again requests the Government to accept a direct contacts mission without delay.
.The Committee of Freedom of Association examined these cases at its November , November  and November  meetings, and presented interim reports to the Governing Body (see th, th and th Reports of the Committee, approved by the Governing Body at its st, th and th Sessions (November , November  and November )).
.After these cases were last examined, communications were received from the United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador (FUSS) dated  March and  and  May  (Case No. ) and the World Confederation of Organisations of the Teaching Profession (WCOTP) dated  October  (Case No. ). The Government sent its observations on some of the pending allegations in communications dated  April and  and  August .
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.At its meeting of November , the Governing Body approved the following recommendations of the Committee:(a) the Committee can only reiterate its earlier recommendations and again express its deep preoccupation with the gravity and persistence of the allegations presented concerning the disappearance, murder and arrest of trade unionists, as well as the assault of trade union premises and the censorship of radio broadcasts on behalf of workers;(b) the Committee is conscious of the difficulties facing the Government at the present time but it must again appeal to the Government to take all practicable measures to guarantee the normal exercise of trade union rights having respect for human rights;(c) the Committee requests the Government to institute judicial inquiries and to keep it informed of the outcome of these inquiries concerning the death and disappearance of the trade unionists mentioned by the complainants, as well as the assaults of trade union premises; the Committee asks the Government to ensure that the arrested trade unionists whose names are supplied by the complainants are either charged or - in the absence of charges - released. It also asks the Government to furnish the information on the fate of trade union leaders and activists who have been arrested or who have disappeared, including any judgements which may have been handed down concerning these individuals;(d) lastly, the Committee requests the Government to furnish its comments and observations concerning the allegation of censorship regarding a radio broadcast of the Confederation of Cooperative Associations of El Salvador on behalf of workers.
.In its communication dated  October , the WCOTP points out that leaders of ANDES- de junio reported that on  October  the teacher Vilma Chavez was strangled at her residence. The assassination was perpetrated, according to ANDES, by members of the security forces dressed in civilian clothes as a reprisal following the end of the national teachers movement against the coming into force of the new education Act which violated teachers' rights and opened the way to the privatisation of schools. This movement managed to obtain the repeal of the Act.
.In a communication dated  March , the FUSS denounces the detention on  March, by members of the police force, of  employees, members of the General Association of Employees of the Ministry of Finance (AGEMHA) who had gone on strike. They included Inmar Rolando Reyes, Melvin Ovidio Portillo and Oscar Bonilla Segovia.
.The FUSS communication also points out that on  March the police forces detained Messrs. Ernesto Beltrn,",-1,1988,El Salvador
236,"Carlos Salvador Viscarra, Mario Alberto Aviles, Jorge Alberto Quijano, Jess Alvarado, Edgardo Orellano, Jorge Alberto Araujo, Toms Montenegro, Nelson Pineda, Ambrosia N. and another person whose name is not known. The persons were captured during a strike by more than , workers of AGEMHA in pursuance of wage and labour claims. The FUSS points out that the Government responded by taking the matter to the labour court which declared the strike unconstitutional and illegal and demanded the immediate return of workers to their workplaces. The Government, through the mass media, organised a campaign to discredit and intimidate the AGEMHA which served as a reason for justifying the arrests. The communication also denounces the capture of Mrs. Vilma Guzmn of the Seamstresses Union.
.In a communication dated  May , the FUSS states that at  p.m. on  May, in the canton of Ro Fro of the Department of Ahuachapn, Messrs. Pedro Matozo, Juan Lico and Adalberto Gonzales were captured, along with three other persons whose names are not known, all of whom were grass-roots members of the National Association of Agricultural Workers (ANTA). The members of ANTA were captured by members of the National Guard and Military Unit No.  of the Army, both of which have denied the abduction, giving rise to fears for the physical safety and psychological state of mind of the above-mentioned trade unionists.
.In the same way, in a communication dated  May , the FUSS denounces the capture, on the same date, of  members of ANTA in the same canton of Ro Fro (Ahuachapn) on the San Francisco de Ass hacienda, by members of the National Guard and Military Unit No. . Prior to the abduction of the ANTA members, the Government launched a fierce campaign of defamation against all the member organisations of the Democratic Farmers Alliance (ADC) and its officials in an attempt to legitimise the repression which had been initiated. Furthermore, the magistrates of the various legal authorities, in coordination with the military and the landowners, have circulated rumours of possible ""legal"" action being taken against officials of the peasant organisations.
.The Government, in its communication dated  April , reaffirms its determination to continue the search for peace based on dialogue and mutual understanding. As regards the dynamite attack against the trade union premises of FENASTRAS, the Government states that a proposal has been made to set up a special commission comprising officials of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), representatives of the public prosecutor's office, the Ministry of Justice, the Commission on Criminal Acts, and delegates of the Commission for Human Rights (a government agency). The objective of this Commission would be to establish with some degree of reliability the source of the attack; it was also proposed to set up a committee which would act as guarantor, with representatives of the United Nations Organisation (UNO), the Organisation of American States (OAS), CEDES, political parties, trade union organisations, including one from FENASTRAS. Furthermore, the Government reaffirmed its intention to seek clarification of this event and to ensure that the authors are punished according to the law.
.The Government also refers to the allegations made by the WCOTP concerning the assassinations on  February  of Miguel Angel Lazo Quintanilla, member of the Executive Committee of the National Association of Educators (ANDES  de junio) and Carlos Rodrguez Domnguez, member of the FUSS, and points out that these trade unionists were killed as a result of an armed conflict with units of the Air Force, while they were carrying out acts of sabotage along with other armed terrorists, creating panic amongst the population and whose arms were confiscated after they died in combat. The Government adds that it is completely false that their bodies showed signs of torture, as alleged by the complainants.
.The communication from the Government also refers to the arrest on  March  of the leader of FENASTRAS, Juan Jos Huezo, and points out that members of the National Police arrested him on charges of having committed acts of physical assault against the previous Minister of Labour and acts of serious damage and terrorism against the Ministry of Labour. He was subsequently remanded in the custody of the Fourth Criminal Court of San Salvador, under Order No.  dated  March .
.In another communication dated  August , the Government also refers to the detention of  members of ANTA on  May  and points out that on that day a group of peasants who were members of ANTA were dislodged and captured by members of the National Guard and Unit No.  in the San Francisco de Ass hacienda in the Canton of Ro Fro (Ahuachapn). The Government points out that delegates of the Santa Ana Regional Office of the El Salvador Commission for Human Rights confirmed that the First Magistrates Court of Ahuachapn ordered the detention of  persons on a charge of usurpation of patrimonial rights of Mrs. Elba Magaa de Romero; after being remanded in the custody of the above-mentioned Court, these persons were released at the end of the inquiry. The Government encloses the list of these persons: Adalberto Salazar Gonzlez, Santos Bonito, Guillermo Matozo, Ismael Moises Matozo, Cristobal Zarceo Pineda, Douglas Adonay Fabin Solis, Alfredo Ernesto Pineda Zarceo, Rodrigo Antonio Zecea Vargas, Santos Mauricio Hernndez Bonito, Miguel Antonio Cortez Ramos, Adn Matozo, Rodrigo Vargas Girn, Victor Manuel Pineda Garca, Juan Antonio Calzadilla Mendoza, Jos Antonio Lico Aguirre, Santos Aguilar Hernndez, Higinio Sandoval Zuiga, Roberto Amilcar Arriaza Lpez, Juan Antonio Ramrez Hernndez, David Antonio Galicia Hernndez, Cruz Bojorquez Luna, Carlos Roberto Snchez Ramirez and Jos Alberto Lico Hernndez.
.In another communication dated  August , the Government provides further information on the detention of the  ANTA members and points out that a group of approximately  peasants, under the influence of members of the ANTA front organisation, led by Pedro Matozo, Mximiliano Matozo and Antonio Lpez, illegally took over the San Francisco de Ass hacienda. The owner initiated proceedings in the Magistrates Court of the jurisdiction. The investigating magistrate carried out an inspection of the hacienda accompanied by members of the National Guard who provided protection. The magistrate met with the officials and members of ANTA who had taken over the building in an attempt to reach a legal solution. The meeting was attended by a lawyer who represented ANTA and one of its officials who were backed up by approximately  persons (men, women and children); the men armed with machetes surrounded the magistrate in a threatening manner. The magistrate talked with the lawyer representing ANTA and pointed out that the illegal taking over of the hacienda was an offence and that those who had seized the property had to negotiate its acquisition in a legal form. The magistrate returned three days later to inform the peasants that they had five days to vacate the property. The lawyer representing ANTA undertook to provide counsel to the usurpers and to appear on  May  in the First Magistrates Court to try to reach a satisfactory solution.
.The Government continues by pointing out that since the hacienda was not vacated by the end of the time limit established by the magistrate, the latter ordered the security forces to remove the usurpers and arrest the  persons mentioned in the previous communication from the Government, all of whom were charged with the usurpation of assets belonging to the owner of the hacienda. The persons arrested were taken to the municipal prison of the city and remanded in the custody of the competent penal court. On  May ,  peasants who were members of ANTA gathered in front of the municipal town hall demanding the release of the  persons arrested during the eviction of the peasants from the San Francisco de Ass hacienda; the persons detained were released by order of the criminal magistrate following pressure exerted by ANTA members during this demonstration.
.The Government concludes by pointing out that the eviction occurred without any incident and with the collaboration of the peasants who argued that they had been deceived and that their leaders had told them that they had purchased the property.
.The Government notes that most of the allegations in these cases refer to acts of violence and arrests which directly affect the trade union movement in El Salvador and are to be set in the context of the armed conflict which has been affecting the country for several years.
.As regards the serious allegations pending from the previous examination of the cases in November , the Committee reiterates to the Government the need to initiate judicial inquiries and to continue to keep the Committee informed of the results of such inquiries into the death, disappearance and arrest of the numerous officials mentioned by the complainant, and of the inquiries made into the attacks on trade union premises.
.The Committee takes note of the information provided by the Government, in particular its determination to continue the search for peace based on dialogue and mutual understanding. It",0,1988,El Salvador
237,"also notes that the Government expressed its intention to establish a special commission to shed light on the terrible attack against the headquarters of FENASTRAS on  November  which left nine persons dead and many injured. The Committee hopes that when the commission has finished its work, the Government will be able to inform the Committee of progress made in shedding light on to this attack.
.As regards the assassination on  February  of Miguel Angel Lazo Quintanilla, a member of the Executive Committee of ANDES, and Carlos Rodrguez Domnguez, member of the FUSS, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, these trade unionists died in an armed conflict with units of the Air Force when they were engaged in acts of sabotage, and the allegation that these trade unionists were tortured is false. In this respect, the Committee recalls that, in a previous communication dated  July , the Government had stated that the deaths of these two trade unionists were being examined by the Justice of the Peace in Soyapango. It also notes that the complainants alleged that one of the trade unionists had been arrested on  February  by members of the Air Force. Given the apparent contradiction between these statements, the Committee urges the Government to send as soon as possible the complete text of the judgement issued by the tribunal of Soyapango, concerning all the persons involved in these events, in which several trade unionists lost their lives.
.As regards the arrest on  March  of the leader of FENASTRAS, Juan Jos Huezo, the Committee notes the information from the Government that this official was arrested by members of the National Police on charges of having committed acts of physical assault against the previous Minister of Labour and acts of serious damage and terrorism against the Ministry of Justice and that he was remanded in the custody of the Fourth Criminal Court of San Salvador. Given the time which has elapsed since his detention, the Committee requests the Government to inform it without delay of the results of the proceedings initiated against the leader Juan Jos Huezo on  March .
.As regards the allegation concerning the detention of  peasants including the ANTA members Pedro Matozo, Juan Lico and Adalberto Gonzales on  May  in the San Francisco de Ass hacienda in the canton of Ro Fro (Ahuachapn), the Committee notes the detailed information provided by the Government on this allegation, in particular that these persons were detained on the instructions of the local magistrate on a charge of having seized the hacienda and that at the end of the inquiries they were released by order of the criminal court. In this respect the Committee notes that questions related to land ownership and tenure governed by specific national legislation have nothing to do with the problems of the exercise of trade union rights. (See, for example, Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, rd edition, , para. .)
.The Committee regrets that the Government has not replied to the serious allegations made following the last examination of these cases, namely: the assassination of the leader of ANDES- de junio, Vilma Chavez on  October , following the end of a national movement by teachers; the detention on  March  of  members of the General Association of Employees of the Ministry of Finance (AGEMHA) who had gone on strike in support of wage and labour claims; and the arrest of Mrs. Vilma Guzmn of the Seamstresses Union. The Committee urges the Government to send its observations on these and other serious allegations still pending in these cases and reiterates that trade union rights can only be exercised in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind against trade unionists, and that it is for governments to ensure that this principle is respected. (See th Report, Case No.  (Brazil), para. .)
.Finally, having noted the Government's desire for dialogue and mutual understanding, as well as the situation of extreme violence which is affecting society in general and the trade union movement in particular, the Committee reiterates the request made to the Government in its examination of Case No.  that it accept a direct contacts mission as soon as possible to examine the serious allegations made in the cases still pending before the Committee.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) As regards the serious allegations pending since the last examination of these cases, the Committee reiterates its request that the Government undertake judicial investigations and that it continue to inform the Committee of the results of the proceedings regarding the death, disappearance and arrest of the many trade unionists mentioned by the complainants and of the investigations carried out into the attacks against trade union premises.(b) As regards the attack against the FENASTRAS headquarters on  November , which left nine persons dead and many injured, the Committee strongly hopes that the Government will be in a position to inform the Committee of progress in the investigations carried out by the special commission set up to shed light on the circumstances of this attack.(c) As regards the assassination, on  February , of Miguel Angel Lazo Quintanilla of ANDES and Carlos Rodrguez Domnguez of the FUSS, the Committee, in the light of the apparently contradictory information, urges the Government to transmit as soon as possible the complete text of the judgement issued by the tribunal of Soyapango, concerning all the persons involved in these events, in which several trade unionists lost their lives.(d) As regards the arrest on  March  of the leader of FENASTRAS, Juan Jos Huezo, although the Committee notes the information from the Government on the circumstances of his arrest, given the time which has since elapsed, it asks the Government to inform it without delay of the results of the proceedings initiated on  March  against this official.(e) The Committee regrets that the Government has not replied to the serious allegations made following the last examination of these cases, namely: the assassination of the official of ANDES- de junio, Vilma Chavez on  October , following the end of a national movement by teachers; the detention on  March  of  members of the General Association of Employees of the Ministry of Finance (AGEMHA) who had gone on strike in support of wage and labour claims; and the detention of Mrs. Vilma Guzmn, of the Seamstresses Union. It urges the Government to send its observations on these and other serious allegations still pending in these cases.(f) Finally, having noted the desire for dialogue and mutual understanding expressed by the Government and the situation of extreme violence which is affecting society in general and the trade union movement in particular, the Committee reiterates the request made to the Government in its examination of Case No.  to accept a direct contacts mission as soon as possible to examine the serious allegations presented in the cases pending before the Committee.
.The Committee on Freedom of Association examined these cases at its November  and November  meetings, presenting interim reports to the Governing Body. (See th and th Reports of the Committee, approved by the Governing Body at its st and th Sessions (November  and November ).)
.After Case No.  was last examined, communications were received from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) ( and  November ,  January and  April ), and the United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador (FUSS) ( November  and  February and  April ). The Committee had previously decided to postpone examining the ICFTU communications dated  and  September and  October , as well as an ASTTEL communication dated  September , owing to the fact that the Government's replies to the allegations contained therein had been received very shortly before the Committee's meeting.
.Since the last examination of Case No. , communications were received from the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) ( November ) and the World Confederation of Organisations of the Teaching Profession (WCOTP) ( April ).
.The Government sent certain observations on some of the allegations in communications dated  April,  May and  and  July . The Committee also received a communication from the Government dated  October  which it had been unable to examine owing to the fact that it was received only a few days prior to the Committee's November  meeting.
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations which are still pending in these two cases concern the murder of  trade union leaders and activists, the disappearance of three trade unionists and the arrest of  trade unionists from different branches of economic activity, but primarily from",0,1988,El Salvador
238,"agriculture. These allegations are reproduced in Annex I of this report. In addition, the outstanding allegations also concern the occupation and destruction of trade union premises by law enforcement services, coupled with the theft of equipment and money, and the repression of trade union demonstrations.
.In particular, the complainants had described a first destruction of the FENASTRAS and UNTS headquarters by the explosion of a charge of dynamite on  February  which allegedly caused serious damage to the building and destroyed all the furnishings. There were no fatalities, but a number of people suffered minor injuries. An anti-communist urban commando claimed responsibility for the attack. The complainants explained that on  February  the FENASTRAS and UNTS had called a meeting of workers which met at the premises which had been attacked, and that military forces had intervened by encircling the neighbourhood and blocking off the street with tanks while some  workers were inside the building.
.The complainants had also reported that other premises had been attacked, namely, the headquarters of the National Agricultural Workers' Association (ANTA) in San Salvador on  September , during the course of which the Rural Police and infantry brigades illegally entered the premises and arrested  persons (who were released three days later), and carried off office equipment and money; also, the premises of the same Association at Santa Lucia were assaulted on  December , and the Association's treasurer was arrested by agents of the Second Infantry Brigade of Santa Ana. These agents are also alleged to have carried off all furnishings and equipment. Lastly, the complainants had referred to the violent breakup of a demonstration of the Confederation of Co-operative Associations of El Salvador (COACES) and the National Peasants' Union (UNC), on  December  in the Colon Park. They alleged that members of the Second Infantry Brigade and the Rural Police of Santa Ana struck, wounded and arrested several persons, and seized speakers, radio equipment, photographic equipment and recorders.
.At its November  Session, the Governing Body approved the Committee's following interim recommendations:(a) The Committee deeply deplores the violent situation prevailing in the country. It expresses its grave concern at the extreme seriousness of the allegations which refer mainly to  murders since , disappearances and more than  arrests of trade union officials, trade unionists and co-operative members, as well as to various acts of violence and intimidation (threats, breaking into and searching of trade union premises and a bomb attack against one of these premises).(b) The Committee can only deeply deplore and reprove the violent deaths and disappearances. It urges the Government to open judicial inquiries into these murders and disappearances and to send it as soon as possible all available information, in particular relating to the situation of the detainees and the reasons for their detention, and on the stage of the inquiries as to the whereabouts of those who have disappeared.(c) The Committee urges the Government to adopt strong measures to guarantee that trade union rights may be exercised under normal conditions, i.e., in a situation where fundamental human rights are respected and in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind. The Committee requests the Government to inform it on this matter.(d) The Committee decides to examine at its next meeting the allegations contained in the most recent communications from the ICFTU and ASTTEL as the Government's reply was received only a few days before the Committee's current meeting.
.The ASTTEL and ICFTU communications received on ,  and  September , shortly before the Committee's November  meeting, state that between  and  September  the armed forces arrested  trade unionists and peasants. In particular, the ICFTU denounces the arrest of  trade unionists on  September , reporting that they were brutally beaten and psychologically tortured, that eight women were raped and that one person was hospitalised for serious injuries in the Rosales Hospital. The ICFTU adds that  persons were released on  September, but that all those who held office in the FENASTRAS trade unions are still imprisoned. The names of the  members of AGEMHA, SELSA and FENASTRAS who were imprisoned are contained in Annex II(a).
.In a further communication of  November  the ICFTU reports a second and much more serious destruction of the FENASTRAS headquarters. It alleges that nine persons belonging to the Committee of Mothers of Detained and Disappeared Persons (COMADRES) were killed and  were injured on  October  while meeting peacefully at the FENASTRAS headquarters, when the premises were destroyed by the explosion of a powerful charge of dynamite. The United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador (FUSS) and the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) in communications of  and  November  also denounce this serious bombing of the FENASTRAS headquarters which left nine persons dead and many injured. The names of those killed and wounded are contained in Annex II(b).
.In other communications of January and April  the ICFTU expresses its deep concern over the assault of the premises of another organisation, namely, the Democratic Workers' Confederation (CTD), an ICFTU affiliate, by the National Guard and the Rural Police, on  January , and the arrest of  trade unionists whose names are listed in Annex II(c). The ICFTU also reports the disappearance of Jorge Alberto Villegas, General Secretary for Disputes of the National Association of Salvadorian Teachers (ANDES  June), who was forcefully abducted from his home in Soyapango on  April  by the National Guard. This allegation is confirmed by the WCOTP in a communication of  April  (see Annex II(d)).
.In communications of  February and  April , the FUSS denounces very serious violations of human rights which took place between November  and April , and which struck the trade union movement very hard. In particular, it denounces the murder of five trade union leaders during the period of November  to March , namely: Rodolfo Andrs Prieto, Miguel Angel Hernandez, Carlos Humberto Gomez, Ral Gonzales and Luis Colocho; the injuries inflicted on five trade unionists on  November ; and the disappearance of six trade unionists between November  and March  following bombardments of the civilian population (see Annex II(e)). The FUSS states that the Government is engaged in a campaign to murder the major trade union leaders who oppose official policy, and that it offers a reward of , colons to persons revealing the whereabouts of these trade unionists.
.The FUSS next describes in detail the tragic events of November . On  November, it states, the army arrested  workers of the University of El Salvador at their workplace. The university was subjected to intense bombings by the Salvadorian Air Force, and the ensuing fires destroyed the Schools of Medicine and Dentistry; on the th, ten trade unions of public employees called a work stoppage to protest these bombings and to enable workers to tend to their brothers who had been injured or killed; on the th, the armed forces published a list of names identifying leaders of the UNTS, accusing them of massacres which the army itself had committed, and issuing orders for their arrest; it also ordered its troops to take over and destroy the premises of popular, trade union and occupational organisations and to arrest trade unionists; at dawn on the th, direct actions of reprisal began against the leaders of trade union and popular organisations, accompanied by searches of the premises of various organisations. The armed forces searched homes of several UNTS trade union leaders and machine-gunned those of persons who were not found at home. These trade unionists are Guillermo Rojas, Humberto Centeno, Rosario Acosta, Julio Portillo, Marco Tulio Lima and Francisco Martnez; on the th, some , workers living in the town of Apopa and in districts and farms bordering the north of San Salvador were made to abandon their homes in an atmosphere of panic, when the Government's radio network urged them to leave the area, which they interpreted as a prelude to a bombardment. As a result of the indiscriminate bombardments of the civilian population by the Salvadorian Air Force, several trade unionists have been wounded. Their names appear in Annex II(e).
.Returning to the events of November , the FUSS alleges that the national police arrested six members of the "" May unit"" of the Trade Union of Social Security Workers (STISSS), as well as the leader of the Committee of Dismissed and Unemployed Workers of El Salvador (CODYDES) and the leader of FENASTRAS (see Annex II(f)).
.It also cites other arrests which took place between November  and April  and which involved  trade unionists from several branches of the economy, but primarily from agriculture. According to the allegations, some of these trade unionists were savagely tortured, hung by their arms for three days and by their feet for a further three days, and made to suffer electric shocks all over their bodies (see Annex II(g)). The FUSS also",-1,1988,El Salvador
239,"alleges that coffee plantations have been transformed into genuine military bases, inasmuch as the army maintains sizeable contingents in these plantations.
.The FUSS also refers to searches and sackings of various trade union premises and of the headquarters of the FENASTRAS, STISSS, AGEPYM (public employees) and the ANC (peasants); it explains that on  November members of the First Infantry Brigade invaded the premises of several trade union and co-operative organisations, during the course of which the members of this military unit claim to have arrested  persons, most of them in Soyapango, who were considered members of an armed organisation; in addition, the premises of the Confederation of Co-operation Associations of El Salvador (COACES), a UNTS affiliate, were closed by members of the First Infantry Brigade who captured four employees of this organisation and sacked the premises; likewise, the premises of other trade union and corporative organisations such as the UNTS, the FEASIES and the Committee of Mothers and Families of Disappeared Persons and Political Prisoners (COMADRES) were also invaded, searched and sacked. These actions were carried out by members of the First Infantry Brigade who tore up the sanitary facilities and flooring of several premises. In the UNTS headquarters they stole all office equipment, the photocopier, the mimeograph, a television set, a video recorder and files; in the CCTEM headquarters they removed typewriters, tables and files; in the ASTTEL headquarters they removed files and , colons in cash; on  December, during the sacking of the COACES premises (which was the subject of a complaint of  November), the First Infantry Brigade carried off office equipment and funds valued at more than , colons, in other words, some US$,. This organisation's headquarters are still occupied by the military.
.Lastly, the FUSS denounces the censorship which has been directed against the trade union movement. On  January  the COACES stated that the Chamber of Commerce had threatened a commercial radio station which carried a -minute daily broadcast of the COACES, with the termination of all relations if it continued to broadcast the workers' programme. According to the FUSS, this threat was carried out when the national police ordered the definitive suspension of this broadcast within the framework of the suspension of legal guarantees throughout the country, in violation of article  of the Constitution which protects and encourages the activities of co-operatives.
.The FUSS concludes its communication by stating that from November  to April , according to information furnished by Julio Portillo, a leader of the UNTS, the Salvadorian armed forces arrested and tortured  trade unionists, murdered  and were responsible for the disappearance of a further .
.In a first communication of  October , received shortly before the Committee's November  meeting, the Government replies that on  September  trade unionists belonging to FENASTRAS set fire to two city buses during a demonstration which was taking place in the centre of the capital city. The security forces intervened to prevent further troubles; during their escape, the demonstrators took over an evangelical church, taking the pastor and congregation as hostages. The authorities sought to dislodge them by using tear-gas and arrested  demonstrators. On the following day,  of them were delivered to the International Committee of the Red Cross, while the other  were sent before the courts of justice. On  October the First Criminal Court remanded  of the demonstrators, who confessed to participating in the above-mentioned criminal actions, into provisional custody, and order the release of the remainder, against whom no charges were filed.
.In further communications of  April and  May  the Government states that, as regards the case of Samuel Maldonado and other trade unionists belonging to the UCS, on  January  members of the National Guard undertook a search at , Avenida San Jos, in San Salvador, following reports by civilians that illegal meetings were being held in that place, and arrested  trade unionists belonging to the UCS. During the course of subsequent investigations it was ascertained that the persons in question were authorised by the Head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to hold trade union-type meetings, under the state of emergency which had been decreed throughout the nation to cope with a recent offensive by an armed group. Thus, there were no grounds for their detention, and the National Guard proceeded on the same day ( January) to release these trade unionists and turn them over to a representative of the El Salvador Commission for Human Rights (a government agency), which verified that the persons concerned had not been mistreated physically or psychologically.
.The Government also makes reference to the case of Jos Humberto Carrillo, a member of ASTTEL, who was arrested by members of the National Guard on  January  in San Salvador; he was remanded into the custody of the Eighth Criminal Court on  January on suspicion that he had participated in a recent terrorist offensive by an armed group.
.In a communication of  July  the Government states that according to court statistics, allegations of trade union persecution are unsupported, although it is true that in isolated instances and for purely legal reasons, proceedings are brought against people who may belong to one trade union or another. Nevertheless, this in no way implies a concerted campaign against freedom of association, since proceedings are also brought against civilians or members of the military who commit a crime or misdemeanor, whether or not they belong to any kind of association.
.As regards the second bombing of the FENASTRAS premises, the Government states in a first communication that proceedings were instituted before the Second Justice of the Peace and subsequently transferred to the Second Criminal Court, where the case is currently pending. To date, it has not been possible to identify the party or parties responsible for this action, in spite of the investigations, inspections and hearing of witnesses. In a subsequent communication the Government recognises that the bombing in question killed Elizabeth Velasquez, Luis Vasquez and others, but merely states that the investigation continues.
.The Government encloses with its communication a document prepared by the El Salvador Commission for Human Rights which contains information on the following arrested trade unionists:- Ricardo Alberto Lazo Acevedo. Arrested by members of the National Guard on  August  in San Salvador on suspicion of being a terrorist; subsequently released on  August of the same year and turned over to a delegate of the Commission for Human Rights;- Juan Jos Mendoza Avila. Arrested on  April  in San Salvador by members of the Rural Police, having been found with abundant material for the manufacture of explosive devices. The arrest took place inside the premises of the FUSS. He was subsequently released on  April of the same year and turned over to a delegate of the aforementioned Commission;- Salvador Fredy Lpez Leiva. Arrested on  November  in San Salvador by members of the First Infantry Brigade on suspicion of being a terrorist; released on  November  and turned over to a delegate of the aforementioned Commission;- Rafael Zepeda Gonzlez. Arrested on  August  by members of the Rural Police for his membership in the national resistance, and remanded to the custody of the Fourth Criminal Court of San Salvador;- Filipo Enoc Villalta Garca. Arrested by members of the Rural Police on  August  for active membership in the FPL, and remanded to the custody of the Sixth Criminal Court of San Salvador;- Pedro Garca Snchez. Arrested by members of the national police on  August  on suspicion of being a terrorist, and remanded to the custody of the Fifth Criminal Court of San Salvador;- Jorge Alberto Coreas. Arrested on  August  by members of the national police of San Salvador on suspicion of being a terrorist, and remanded to the custody of the Fifth Criminal Court of San Salvador;- Francisco Meja Guevara. Arrested by members of the Tactical Infantry Battalion on suspicion of being a terrorist; subsequently released on  November  and turned over to the International Committee of the Red Cross.
.The Government also states that Case No. / against Jos Humberto Castillo in the Eighth Criminal Court was dismissed on the judge's orders when Mr. Castillo was released on  February . The investigations into the deaths of Professors Miguel Angel Lazo Quintanilla and Carlos Rodrguez are being examined by the Justice of the Peace in Soyapango.
.In a communication of  July  the Government states that Professor Jorge Alberto Villegas, a former member of the Executive Committee of ANDES  June, who had been arrested at his home by the Civil Guard on  April  and charged with participating in subversive activities, was released by the First Criminal Court on  April .
.The Committee takes note of the information and observations furnished by the Government concerning these two cases. Nevertheless, it notes with regret that, in disregard of its earlier recommendation, the Government has not furnished information on",-1,1988,El Salvador
240,"judicial inquiries which the Committe had requested that the Government institute with respect to the murders of  trade unionists since  and the disappearances alleged by the complainants.
.The Committee notes with deep regret that the complainants continue to report violent deaths, arrests and disappearances of trade unionists, as well as even more violent assaults of trade union premises which have taken place since the cases were last examined in November . Moreover, it notes that new allegations report measures of censorship which have been taken by the authorities against the trade union movement since the national police, according to the complainants, ordered the definitive suspension of a radio broadcast of the Confederation of Co-operative Associations of El Salvador on behalf of workers. As regards these points, the Committee regrets to note that the Government has furnished very little information on the previous and new concrete and detailed allegations of the complainants.
.Faced with this situation, the Committee is conscious of the difficulties against which the Government is striving but must again appeal to the Government to adopt all practicable measures to guarantee the normal exercise of trade union rights having respect for human rights.
.The Committee notes that, according to the Government's replies, certain trade unionists who were arrested have been released after it was ascertained that their arrest was not warranted, and that a representative of the El Salvador Commission for Human Rights has ascertained that those arrested were not mistreated. It also notes that, according to the Government, certain trade unionists identified by name by the complainants, are suspected of being terrorists and have been remanded into the custody of criminal courts.
.Given that the arrest and detention of trade unionists may constitute a serious interference with the exercise of trade union rights, the Committee considers that the adoption of such measures, even for reasons of internal security, may imply serious interference in the exercise of trade union rights, and considers that they should be accompanied by appropriate judicial safeguards (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, rd edition, , para. ). The Committee recalls that the detention of trade unionists against whom no charges are brought can endanger the exercise of trade union rights. It accordingly requests the Government to ensure that the trade unionists mentioned by the complainants should either be charged or - in the absence of charges - be released. It also requests the Government to furnish information on the fate of trade union leaders and activists who have been arrested or who have disappeared, and who have been identified by name by the complainants, including information on any judgements that may have been handed down in their cases.
.As regards the many attacks against many trade union premises, accompanied by acts of violence (deaths, injuries and sackings), the Committee notes that the Government has merely indicated, as regards the second bombing of the FENASTRAS premises, that an investigation has begun, that two persons were killed, and that the investigation is proceeding. The Committee regrets to note that the Government has not furnished any information on the other allegations in this matter.
.The Committee considers that the occupation of trade union premises without a court warrant constitutes a serious interference by the authorities in trade union activities, and insists on the importance of the resolution concerning trade union rights and their relations with civil liberties, adopted by the International Labour Conference at its th Session (), which states that the right to an adequate protection of trade union property constitutes an essential freedom in the normal exercise of trade union rights. The Committee therefore urgently requests the Government to institute judicial inquiries into the allegations concerning the assaults on trade union premises with a view to punishing those responsible for such actions and preventing their recurrence, and immediately to forward information it may have in this connection.
.As regards the censorship of a radio broadcast of the Confederation of Co-operative Associations of El Salvador on behalf of the workers, the Committee notes that the Government has not refuted this allegation and that it has failed to comment on it. The Committee recalls that the right to express opinions through the press, radio, or by other means, is an essential aspect of trade union rights, and it therefore requests the Government to furnish detailed comments or observations on this allegation.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee can only reiterate its earlier recommendations and again express its deep preoccupation with the gravity and persistence of the allegations presented concerning the disappearance, murder and arrest of trade unionists, as well as the assault of trade union premises and the censorship of radio broadcasts on behalf of workers.(b) The Committee is conscious of the difficulties facing the Government at the present time but it must again appeal to the Government to take all practicable measures to guarantee the normal exercise of trade union rights having respect for human rights.(c) The Committee requests the Government to institute judicial inquiries and to keep it informed of the outcome of these inquiries concerning the death and disappearance of the trade unionists mentioned by the complainants, as well as the assaults of trade union premises; the Committee asks the Government to ensure that the arrested trade unionists whose names are supplied by the complainants are either charged or - in the absence of charges - released. It also asks the Government to furnish information on the fate of trade union leaders and activists who have been arrested or who have disappeared, including any judgements which may have been handed down concerning these individuals.(d) Lastly, the Committee requests the Government to furnish its comments and observations concerning the allegation of censorship regarding a radio broadcast of the Confederation of Co-operative Associations of El Salvador on behalf of workers.
.The Committee examined Case No.  at its November  meeting and submitted an interim report to the Governing Body. (See th Report of the Committee, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its st Session (November ).)
.After Case No.  was last examined, communications were received from: the International Federation of Plantation, Agricultural and Allied Workers (IFPAAW) ( November and  December ); the United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador (FUSS) (,  and  January,  February,  May and  August ); the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) ( March, ,  and  September and  October ); and the Association of Salvadorian Telecommunications Workers (ASTTEL) ( September ).

The three bodies were later found with signs of having been cruelly tortured. The father of Jos Hernn Bentez Aguilar, also a member of ANTA, has received death threats. ANTA believes that these acts were a reprisal because of the campaign carried out by harvest workers to obtain an increase in their minimum wage, which, it should be recalled, has not been increased since .
.The United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador (FUSS) alleges the following facts:- On  December , Rosa Imelda Medrano, worker at the Occidente University Centre and member of the Association of Workers of the University of El Salvador, ADUES, Santa Ana Section, was assassinated.

Similarly, Danilo Umanzor, a worker who was accompanying the two previous persons, was also arrested. Officially, the whereabouts of these three colleagues are unknown and none of the above-mentioned authorities acknowledge holding them. Unofficially, the UNTS assumes that the High Command of the army and the Nationalist Republican Alliance Party (ARENA) are preparing a campaign against the two UNTS Executive Committee officials who were arrested, accusing them of taking part in a plot to destabilise the situation in order to boycott the taking over of the new Chairman, Alfredo Cristiani.- On  May , police and military authorities encircled the headquarters of the UNTS and the FEA SIES, encircled and searched the premises of the Co-operatives Associations Confederation of El Salvador (COACES), arresting Jos Gil Magaa, Alfredo Prez and Hugo Nelson Quintanilla, searched the headquarters of FENASTRAS and encircled and searched the headquarters of the FUSS and the headquarters of the Association of Peasant Communities.- Jos Antonio Alfaro, relations secretary of the Salvadorian Association of Workers of the Institute of Supplies Control (ASTIRA), was arrested at  a.m. on  July  in the town of Santa Ana, by persons dressed in civilian clothing who were travelling in a green jeep without number plates.- The FESTIAVTSCES officials, Abraham Rivas, Misael Venegas and Rufino Ardn, were arrested at  a.m. on  July  by members of the Fiscal Police who were dressed in civilian clothing and strongly armed; during these events, which occurred in the municipality of Mejicanos, San Salvador, the first official was injured.

.In their communications of September and October , the ICFTU and ASTTEL present allegations concerning the search of union headquarters, the detention, kidnapping or disappearance of a very high number of trade union leaders and members, the torture and rape of female unionists.The Government's reply
.In its communication of  June , the Government supplies a number of memoranda from the Ministry of Defence and Public Safety on the allegations submitted by the ICFTU to the Committee in November . The Ministry of Defence and Public Safety points out that the allegations made in the complaints submitted by the ICFTU and the FUSS to the ILO are totally devoid of truth and obviously an attempt to spread false information and constitute a campaign on the part of Salvadorian subversive elements to discredit the Government and the armed forces of the Republic. After carrying out an inquiry, it was proven that the Second Infantry Brigade was not at all involved in the events described in the complaints.
.The Government adds that staff belonging to the General Directorate of the National Guard arrested Mrs. Celia Yaneth Medrano Hernndez at about  a.m. on  June  and that when she was arrested, a certain amount of propaganda with Marxist-Leninist tendencies was confiscated from her. The lady in question has been studying journalism at university since  and, on the day of her arrest, was acting as a reporter for the Communications Secretariat of the National University. According to her statement, she is obliged, for her studies and work schedule, to participate in all the marches or demonstrations carried out by various groups representing university students. As no major evidence could be brought against her and out of deference to the General Directorate of the National Guard and because of a personal intervention from the Vice-Rector of the National University, she was released and handed over at  p.m. on the same day of her arrest to the university authority requesting her release.
.The Government denies that the General Directorate of the National Guard arrested Mrs. Margarita Eugenia Navarro and Mr. Alfredo Lemus. It is for this reason that an inquiry is being carried out to examine the truth of the charges brought before the ILO. The Government",-1,1988,El Salvador
243,"points out that it has taken the necessary steps and will continue taking them in the immediate future to comply with the request for information connected with the present case, paying particular attention to the new aspects of the complaints submitted, especially as regards the alleged continuation of attacks against trade unionists and co-operative members on the part of the army. In so doing, it will aim to contribute towards an impartial inquiry into the allegations.
.In its communication of  October , the Government sent certain observations refuting the allegations contained in the ICFTU and ASTTEL letters of September and October .
.First, the Committee expresses its grave concern at the extreme seriousness of the allegations which refer mainly to  murders since , disappearances and more than  detentions of trade union officials, trade unionists and co-operative members, as well as to various acts of violence and intimidation (threats, breaking into and searching of trade union premises and a bomb attack against one of these premises).
.The Committee can only deeply deplore and reprove the violent deaths and disappearances. It urges the Government to open judicial inquiries into these murders and disappearances and to send it as soon as possible all available information, in particular relating to the situation of the detainees and the reasons for their detention and on the stage of inquiries into the whereabouts of those who have disappeared.
.The Committee urges the Government to adopt strong measures to guarantee that trade union rights may be exercised under normal conditions, i.e., in a situation where fundamental human rights are respected and in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind.
.The Committee notes that the Government points out that the trade unionist Celia Yaneth Medrano Hernndez was released on the same day that she was arrested, that it denies that the Civil Guard arrested the trade unionists Alfredo Lemus and Margarita Eugenia Navarro and that an inquiry is being carried out on this matter. Similarly, the Committee notes the Government's statements that the trade union officials Miguel Lazo Quintanilla and Carlos Rodrguez Domnguez died as a result of an armed conflict with the airforce when they were carrying out acts of sabotage and that their bodies bore no signs of torture. The Committee would nevertheless stress that the Government did not refer to the press cuttings - supplied by the complainants - stating that the bodies of the trade union officials in question showed signs of torture and that Lazo Quintanilla had been arrested on the day preceding his murder by members of the airforce. The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on this matter and to set up a judicial inquiry to ascertain the facts, determine responsibilities and punish those responsible.
.In the light of the foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee deeply deplores the violent situation prevailing in the country. It expresses its grave concern at the extreme seriousness of the allegations which refer mainly to  murders since , disappearances and more than  arrests of trade union officials, trade unionists and co-operative members, as well as to various acts of violence and intimidation (threats, breaking into and searching of trade union premises and a bomb attack against one of these premises).(b) The Committee can only deeply deplore and reprove the violent deaths and disappearances. It urges the Government to open judicial inquiries into these murders and disappearances and to send it as soon as possible all available information in particular relating to the situation of the detainees and the reasons for their detention and on the stage of the inquiries as to the whereabouts of those who have disappeared.(c) The Committee urges the Government to adopt strong measures to guarantee that trade union rights may be exercised under normal conditions, i.e., in a situation where fundamental human rights are respected and in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind. The Committee requests the Government to inform it on this matter.(d) The Committee decides to examine at its next meeting the allegations contained in the most recent communications from the ICFTU and ASTTEL as the Government's reply was received only a few days before the Committee's current meeting.
.The complaint is contained in communications from the InternationalConfederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), dated  March,  April,  May, June and  October . The Government supplied its observations incommunications dated  June and  September .
.El Salvador has not ratified either the Freedom of Association andProtection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right toOrganise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee observes that the complainant provides a general picture ofthe economic, political and social situation of the country and includes inthe annex a list of alleged acts of repression carried out between August andDecember .
.The Committee also takes note of the general information provided by theGovernment, in particular that the sources of many of the accusations made bythe ICFTU come from the various press media which pass on information they aregiven by persons Or organisations claiming to be the victims of repression,without ascertaining the truth Of such information. According to theGovernment, this is all part of a campaign to distort the truth of what ishappening in the country at the international level by the complainants whoare trying to protect the authors of criminal and terrorist acts carried outby the FMLN-FDR with the support of other governments and internationalorganisations.
.The Committee likewise takes note of the explanations given by theGovernment regarding the accusations of repression by the Government and thearmed forces against trade unions and grass-roots organisations in which itstates that in recent years the trade union organisations have set out tocreate labour disputes, not with the aim of achieving wage increases but ofdestabilising the Government by means of political intransigence. Someorganisations have joined the ranks of the FMLN and act as cover groups andtheir actions are part of the FMLN-FDR's destabilising programmes. As regardsthe Government's comments, the Committee emphasises the principle that aclimate of violence which results in the assassination or disappearance oftrade union leaders is a serious obstacle to the exercise of trade unionrights; such acts require severe measures on the part of the authorities.
.As regards the allegation concerning the arrest of the trade unionistFredy Torres, on  April , on suspicion of having committed terroristacts, the Committee observes that according to the Government he was releasedby the Sixth Criminal Court as there were no charges against him. TheCommittee recalls in this connection the principle that the arrest by theauthorities of trade unionists against whom no charges are subsequentlybrought can result in restrictions on trade union rights. Governments shouldtake steps to ensure that the competent authorities receive appropriateinstructions to avoid the danger which detention measures pose to trade unionactivities.
.The Committee takes note of the observations of the Government concerningthe assassination of the trade unionist Adrin Chavarra Girn that an inquiryis being carried out by the executive unit of the Criminal InvestigationCommittee and that the findings of this inquiry will be communicated in duecourse.
.As regards the machine-gunning on  February  of a bus belonging tothe IUSA undertaking which resulted in the deaths of the trade unionistsCustodia de Jess Rivas, Xenia Marisol Lpez Molina and Rosa Cndida MartnezMarroqun and which caused serious injury to Mara Anglica Mejas, MartaRomero Guilln, Elas Segura Cern and Hernn Eduardo Contreras, the Committeerecalls the principle that a genuinely free and independent trade unionmovement cannot develop in a climate of violence and uncertainty. It is theresponsibility of the governments to ensure that basic human rights arerespected.
.As regards the allegations made by the ICFTU in a list appended to itscommunication of  March  concerning government repression of trade unionsand grass-roots organisations during the period of August to December ,the Committee notes the observations of the Government on some of theallegations contained in this list (see Annexes I and II at the end of thiscase)..As regards the allegations made by the ICFTU concerning the assassination
.As regards the allegations made by the ICFTU concerning the assassination
.Finally, the Committee observes that the Government has not providedobservations on the following allegations: the arrest on  June , of theco-operative worker Jos Parada by soldiers from the Jucuaran battalion, inSan Francisco Xavier, when he was found to be in possession of , colonesbelonging to the co-operative; the thorough search for arms carried out in theGuayojo co-operative in the municipality of Matapan, Department of Santa Ana,and the subsequent arrest for five days of the co-operative workers RolandoAguirre Areola, Eugenio Galdans and Orlando Areola Lpez; the arrest warrantwhich has been issued since  March  against four FENASTRAS officials:Gerardo Daz, Antonio Guatemala, Antonio Ingls and Juan Huezo for allegedattacks against the Minister of Labour and the arrest order issued by thearmed forces against nine officials of the National Association of Workers ofthe Supplies Control Institute (ASTIRA): Celestino Nez, Francisco Aguilar,Manuel Prez Avila, Gilberto Fuentes, Antonio Rivora, Rogelio Guevara, PedroBentez, Milton Retana and Oscar",-1,1988,El Salvador

245,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the Committee of Trade Union Unity of El Salvador, dated  June . The Government replied in a communication of  December .
.El Salvador has not ratified either the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  June , the complainant alleges that the Judge of the Court of the First Instance in the district of Metapn (Department of Santa Ana) had declared illegal the strike carried out by the workers of the ""Cemento de El Salvador, S.A."" undertaking (CESSA), ordering an end to the strike by  June and the massive dismissal of workers.
.In its communication of  December , the Government transmits a copy of a full and detailed report drawn up by the General Director of Labour of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs on the collective dispute which had arisen in the undertaking ""Cemento de El Salvador, S.A."" (CESSA). The following information is contained in this report:- On  May , the workers in the undertaking ""Cemento de El Salvador, S.A."" decided to down tools as from seven o'clock because of the various labour problems existing in the undertaking; at a meeting between the representatives of the Trade Union of the El Salvador Cement Industry and the legal representative of the undertaking ""Cemento de El Salvador, S.A."", held on the same day at  p.m. at the General Labour Directorate, the workers referred to these problems and requested the following: (a) the reinstatement of the worker Santos Humberto Aldana; (b) negotiations on wage increases; (c) the dismissal of the plant Superintendent, the engineer Miguel Peralta, and the Head of the Administration, David Prez Vanegas; (d) strike pay; and (e) that there should be no reprisals for having taken part in the present strike. At this same meeting, the undertaking's legal adviser explained that the decision to dismiss the worker Santos Humberto Aldana was being upheld, as he had infringed the relevant provisions by not obeying orders to carry out a job; furthermore, in accordance with agreements signed by the undertaking and trade union on  April of the current year, the former is entitled to dismiss persons for infringing the legal provisions laid down in the Labour Code, in the internal regulations or in the collective labour agreement; this is a right conferred by law upon the undertaking that may not be waived.- On  June , the Judge of the First Instance of Metapn declared that the strike was illegal because the trade union had not brought the ""collective dispute of an economic nature"" before the General Labour Directorate, as laid down in the Labour Code, to request that the collective labour agreement between the trade union and the CESSA undertaking should be reviewed.- After several meetings between representatives of the Trade Union of the El Salvador Cement Industry and the CESSA undertaking (which, on  May , had guaranteed that no reprisals would be taken against the workers on strike), a meeting was held on  June  in the office of the Ministry of Labour, attended by members of the Union's bargaining committee, members of the undertaking's Board of Management and - representing the Secretary of State of Labour - the Minister and Vice-Minister of Labour, the General Director of Labour and the General Labour Inspector; this meeting gave the following results: ""both parties agreed to come to a total and final agreement on the present dispute, on the following terms: first, David Prez Vanegas, Head of the Administration, would be temporarily transferred to the plant in Metapn and a tripartite committee (undertaking, workers and Ministry of Labour) would carry out an inquiry into his conduct and submit its conclusions at a later date. Second, with respect to strike pay, the undertaking offered to pay each worker an incentive equivalent to five days' wages. It will also, if the worker wishes, grant a loan up to a maximum of  days' wages, which is interest-free and repayable every  days up to a maximum period of three months. Third, the undertaking formally agreed not to take any reprisals, either de facto or de jure, against the workers who had taken part in the present dispute. Fourth, both parties agreed to meet on  June, to discuss the case of the worker Jos Santos Aldana and to continue wage negotiations in accordance with the schedule of meetings already agreed upon. Similarly, on the eleventh of this month, they agreed to inform the Ministry of Labour of the persons who will make up the committee of inquiry, to which the first point of the agreement refers. Fifth, the trade union representatives undertook to call off the strike immediately and inform all those workers outside the plant, so that work would be normally resumed at seven o'clock on  June of the current year. At . on  June , the trade union appeared before the court to fulfill the first part of the agreement; on  June , the undertaking did the same, by means of a statement it submitted.""
.The Committee notes that in the present case, the complainant alleges that, on  May , the legal authorities declared illegal the strike called by the workers in the undertaking ""Cemento de El Salvador, S.A."" (CESSA) and ordered the massive dismissal of the workers.
.The Committee notes that, according to the Government, the strike was declared illegal because the trade union had not brought what it calls a ""collective dispute of an economic nature"" before the General Labour Director, thus failing to comply with the provisions contained in the Labour Code. The Committee also notes that on  June , thanks to the intervention of the authorities of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, the parties to the dispute reached an agreement putting an end to the dispute and that, in particular, the undertaking agreed not to take reprisals against the workers who had taken part in the strike and the trade union undertook to call off the strike. The Committee also notes from the Government's account of these events that it appears that the undertaking did not dismiss any workers during the strike.
.In these circumstances, since the collective dispute has been settled in a manner satisfactory to both parties, the Committee considers that this case does not call for further examination.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.",1,1984,El Salvador
246,".At its February  meeting the Committee on Freedom of Association was informed that the Government of El Salvador was ready to accept a direct contacts mission to examine the various aspects of Cases Nos. , , , , , , , ,  and , noted this information with interest and expressed the hope that, upon receipt of confirmation from the Government, arrangements could be made at an early date for such a mission to take place (see th Report of the Committee, para. , approved by the Governing Board at its th Session (February-March )).
.During the visit of the Director-General of the ILO to El Salvador in May , he proposed a direct contacts mission to His Excellency the President of the Republic, in conformity with the decision adopted by the Committee on Freedom of Association at its February  meeting regarding the complaints pending against El Salvador. n this occasion the President stated that, although he had not requested an ILO mission, he did not reject the direct contact; mission proposed, and indicated that the country opened its doors to the ILO mission.
.In its th Report (May ), approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (May-June ), the Committee took the following decision in connection with the cases relating to El Salvador: ""As regards the cases relating to El Salvador (Cases Nos. , , , , , , ,  and ), the Committee notes that following an official visit by the Director-General to the country, the Government is willing to accept a direct contacts mission with a view to examining the various aspects of these cases. The Committee hopes that the necessary arrangements will be able to be made shortly so that this mission can take place as soon as possible.""
.In a communication received on  November  the Salvadorian Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the ILO that the direct contacts mission could visit the country.
.The Director-General of the ILO appointed Mr. Andrs Aguilar, member and former president of the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights and member of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights as his representative to conduct the mission. The mission took place in San Salvador from  to  January . During the mission the Director-General's representative was accompanied by Mr. Alberto Odero, member of the Freedom of Association Branch of the International Labour Standards Department, and Mr. Luis Zamudio, Regional Adviser on Standards.
.The mission was received by the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare, His Excellency Miguel Alejandro Gallegos, by Dr. Lzaro Tadeo Bernal Lizama, Vice Minister of Labour and Social Welfare, and Dr. Antonio Lara Gavidia, Head of the International Affairs Department of the Ministry, by the members of the Labour and Social Welfare Committee of the Legislative Assembly, by senior officials of the Ministry of Justice, and by representatives of employers"" and workers' organisations.
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the first place, the Committee wishes to thank Mr. Andrs Aguilar for having agreed to carry out the direct contacts mission, as well as for his detailed report on the pending cases, which has allowed the Committee to examine them. The Committee considers that the report of the Director-General's representative attests to the usefulness of missions of this kind in clarifying matters arising from allegations by the complainant organisations.
.Since the content of the allegations and the information supplied by the Government, as well as the information obtained by the Director-General's representative during the mission are contained in the mission report (see Annex), the Committee can proceed directly to formulate its conclusions on the various cases.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:General recommendations(a) The Committee takes note of the report of the Director-General's representative on the mission carried out in El Salvador from  to  January . The Committee also notes that the mission enjoyed full freedom of action and movement and that the authorities of the Ministries of Labour and Justice with which it came into contact gave it every facility and co-operated actively in obtaining the information requested by the Committee on Freedom of Association.(b) The Committee notes that, according to the mission report, although there has been a marked drop in the frequency of attempts on lives and physical integrity and in the number of disappearances and arrests of persons connected with the trade union movement since the elections of May , there is continued insecurity.(c) The Committee also notes that the mission ascertained that a wide variety of trade union organisations representing all tendencies exist and operate in the country and that they play an active and militant role in national life and resort to strikes. The organisations having recourse to such action include public-sector workers' organisations, despite the fact that such action is illegal for this category of workers. Nevertheless, according to the mission report, trade union activities are often conducted in an atmosphere of fear which has an unfavourable effect on their exercise, and according to the organisations interviewed, such activities are viewed with hostility in many employers' circles - particularly in the private sector - which oppose the formation of organisations and the exercise of their rights.(d) In general, the Committee concludes from the mission report that there is still a need to make much progress in El Salvador to achieve genuine respect for human rights in general and trade union rights in particular. The Committee notes that according to the authorities of the Ministry of Labour, this is one of the main objectives of Government policy, and concrete measures to this effect have been and are being taken.(e) While the Committee is aware of the serious difficulties El Salvador is facing, it calls on the Government to adopt appropriate measures to guarantee that trade union rights may be exercised in a normal fashion; this will only be possible in conditions in which fundamental human rights are respected and in a climate free of violence, pressures and threats of any kind.Cases Nos. , ,  and (a) The Committee regrets that the proceedings relative to the homicide of Manuel Antonio and Jos Antonio Carrillo Vzquez and of Santiago Hernndez have failed to identify those responsible for the crime, and that they have been dropped.(b) The Committee requests the Government to take steps with a view to the opening of an investigation into the alleged homicide of Toms Rosales, Jos Santos Tiznado and Pedro Gonzlez, in respect of whom there is no record of proceedings having been opened. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments concerning the disappearance of the trade union leader Rafael Hernndez Olivo, as well as of the final outcome of the proceedings concerning the wilful homicide of the trade unionists Rodolfo Viera, Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer, indicating whether the investigation has been able to establish who instigated the crime committed by the two defendants.Case No. (a) The Committee regrets that the trade unionist Marta Imelda Dimas remained in prison for over two months.(b) The Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that the detention of trade unionists for trade union activities or membership is contrary to the principles of freedom of association.Case No. (a) The Committee requests the Government to undertake an investigation to determine the whereabouts of the trade union leaders Elsy Mrquez and Jos Snchez Gallegos, and to keep it informed thereof.(b) The Committee notes that some of the trade unionists mentioned by the complainants are free, and awaits the information promised by the Government concerning another  trade unionists whose arrest has been alleged and whose names are listed in the conclusions (concerning these  trade unionists, the Government reported that none of the persons listed is at present imprisoned in any of the detention centres in the country, but that further investigations will be carried out to determine whether they had been imprisoned at some stage in police centres).Case No. (a) As regards the murder of trade union leader Juan Pablo Meja Rodriguez, the Committee notes that proceedings have reached the stage of examination of witnesses, and that no one has yet been arrested. The Committee deeply regrets the murder of this trade union leader and requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in the proceedings.(b) While noting that all of the trade union leaders whose detention had been alleged in connection with this case are now free, the Committee none the less recalls that some of them were detained for trade union activities, and draws the Government's attention to the fact that the detention of trade union leaders or members for reasons connected with their activities in defence of the interests of workers constitutes serious interference with civil liberties in general and with trade union rights in particular.Case No. (a) The Committee points to the principle",2,1984,El Salvador
247,"that all workers' organisations have the right to affiliate with international organisations of workers implies the right of national and international trade union organisations to maintain contact with one another, without interference by the public authorities.(b) While noting that the judicial authority dropped the charges against Modesto Rodriguez and Elsy Esperanza Alvarenga, the Committee deplores their detention and draws the Government's attention to the fact that the detention of trade union leaders and members against whom no specific charges are retained restricts the exercise of trade union rights, and that such measures can give rise to a climate of intimidation and fear prejudicial to the normal exercise of trade union activities.Case No. (a) The Committee observes that the Government has not sent observations on the alleged murder of the trade union leader Marco Antonio Orantes. Faced with this very serious situation and while deeply regretting the murder of this trade union leader, the Committee requests the Government to send its observations on this matter, indicating in particular whether any proceedings have been instituted and if so, their current status.(b) The Committee concludes that the judicial decision declaring the strike in the Salvadorian Social Security Institute illegal and ordering the removal of those occupying its premises does not constitute a violation of the principles of freedom of association, inasmuch as the Institute is engaged in medical and health-care services. The Committee regrets the death of several members of the public security forces and some insured persons, and notes that, according to the Government and contrary to what the complainants maintain, none of the dead or wounded were members of the trade union organisations involved.(c) The Committee notes that the judicial authority dropped the charges against four of the trade union leaders whose detention had been alleged, but regrets their detention and draws the Government's attention to the fact that the detention of trade union leaders and members against whom no specific charges are retained restricts the exercise of trade union rights and that such measures can give rise to a climate of intimidation and fear prejudicial to the normal exercise of trade union activities.Case No. (a) The Committee requests the Government to take conciliatory measures with a view to promoting a climate of reconciliation and understanding between the Servipronto S.A. undertaking and its trade union enabling the resolution of current problems concerning the guarantees for the exercise of trade union rights, and an examination of the possibility of reinstating the trade union leader Israel Snchez Cruz, a measure that would undoubtedly contribute to more harmonious labour relations.(b) The Committee wishes to point out in general that in the event of a strike the authorities should resort to the use of force only when law and order are seriously threatened.",0,1984,El Salvador
248,".The Committee has examined Cases Nos. , ,  and  on several occasions, most recently at its meeting of May , when it submitted an interim report (see the Committee's th Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (May )), which drew attention to the Government's persistent negative attitude, shown since February  by its refusal to accept a direct contacts mission to the country and by its failure, in spite of the extreme seriousness of the allegations, to send the information requested by the Committee.
.Consequently, at said meeting the Committee once again urged the Government to send the information requested and to accept the mission in question; it also requested the Director-General of the ILO to contact the representatives of the Government of El Salvador at the next session of the International Labour Conference (June ), and to urge the Government to respect fully the Committee's recommendations. (See the Committee's th Report, paras.  and (f) and (g).)
.Following contacts at the Conference, the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare agreed to the direct contacts mission.
.In addition, the IFCTU submitted new allegations in the context of Case No.  in a communication of  June  (see the attached summary in the direct contacts mission report, para. ).
.The Director-General of the ILO appointed Professor Jos Vida Soria, Professor of Labour Law at the University of Grenada, and President of the Committee of Experts of the European Social Charter, to carry out the direct contacts mission, assisted by a member of the Freedom of Association Branch of the ILO. The mission took place from  September to  October .
.The Committee notes that the mission met with Dr. Juan Sifontes, Minister of Labour and Social Welfare, Dr. Carlos Mauricio Molina, Attorney-General for Human Rights, Dr. Estela Avila, Chief of the International Relations Office of the Ministry of Labour, as well as with representatives of Interoccupational Coordination (UNTS, UNOC, AGEPYM, CGT, FESINCONSTRAM, CTS, etc.) and of the National Association of Private Enterprise (NAPE). It also met with Dr. Augusto Ramirez Ocampo, Chief of the United Nations Observer Mission (ONUSAL) and with several senior officials from ONUSAL. The Committee also notes that the government authorities and the representatives of workers' and employers' organizations collaborated closely with the mission, and that government authorities gave every assistance.
.The Committee has also noted Professor Jos Vida Soria's mission report (see Annex I), as well as the Government's observations addressed to the Committee and to the mission concerning outstanding allegations.
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In as much as the direct contacts mission report contained in the Annex summarizes not only the substance of outstanding allegations, but also the Committee's previous conclusions and recommendations, as well as the Government's observations and the new allegations, the Committee proceeds directly to its conclusions and recommendations.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee notes with interest the improvement in various important aspects of the trade union situation and, especially, the decline in violence to a point, where - according to the mission report - in the last  months there have only been isolated acts of violence against trade unionists although threats have been made in certain cases.(b) Notwithstanding the current improvements in the situation, the Committee deplores once again the numerous and serious acts of violence to which the trade union movement and their leaders have been subjected in recent years and which have often resulted in loss of life or the violation of the most fundamental human and trade union rights. The Committee calls on the Government to ensure that such events are never repeated. The Committee calls on the Government to keep it informed of developments in the judicial investigations into the various cases of trade unionists being murdered or assaulted, or who disappeared in recent years. In the Committee's opinion, the absence of judgements against the guilty parties creates, in practice, a situation of impunity, which reinforces the climate of violence and insecurity, and which is extremely damaging to the exercise of trade union rights.(c) Regarding the arrest of trade unionists and threats made against them in recent years, and while it notes with interest that there are no trade unionists at present under arrest for trade union activities, the Committee deplores the large number of trade unionists who have been arrested in recent years, the threats that have been made and the climate of intimidation in which trade union activity has often taken place; it hopes that such occurrences, which prevent the normal exercise of trade union rights, will not be repeated in the future.(d) Bearing in mind the allegations of anti-union discrimination in the cases under examination and that the mission report mentions that trade union organizations have denounced many such instances, the Committee urges the Government, in its forthcoming revision of the Labour Code and in the future Act respecting industrial relations in the public administration (for which the Government has requested ILO technical assistance), to guarantee adequate protection against dismissal and other acts of discrimination for carrying out legitimate trade union activities, such as the establishment of a trade union.(e) The Committee expresses its strong reprobation and its serious concern with respect to the kidnapping of the six-month-old son of trade unionist Lucas Bernal Mrmol. The Committee insists that the Government make vigorous efforts to find the child and to punish the kidnappers and requests it to keep it informed in this regard.(f) The Committee reminds the Government that the ILO may provide its help in order to provide information on the contents of the Conventions on freedom of association with a view to possible ratifications.
.The Committee on Freedom of Association, set up by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ), met at the International Labour Office, Geneva, on ,  and  May  under the chairmanship of Mr. Jean-Jacques Oechslin, former Chairman of the Governing Body.
.The Committee had before it various complaints of violations of freedom of association in El Salvador, presented by a number of international and national trade union organizations (Cases Nos. , / and ).
.On several occasions the Governing Body asked the Government to give its consent that a representative of the Director-General visit El Salvador to carry out a study of the facts relating to the complaints, within the context of the direct contacts procedure.
.At the March  Session, the Government had not yet given a positive response to the direct contacts mission nor to the allegations concerning these cases. In these circumstances, the Committee recommended that if no reply was received from the Government prior to its next meeting, wider publicity should be given to the Committee's report.
.Since then, no reply has been received from the Government. The Committee submits for the approval of the Governing Body a further report on this matter and recommends that it examine this report at its th Session.
.In examining Cases Nos. , ,  and  at its February  meeting (see th Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (March )), the Committee deplored and emphasized the seriousness of the outstanding allegations and the new allegations which referred to the murder and disappearance of a large number of trade union leaders, as well as to death threats, physical attacks, arrest and detention of workers and trade unionists, the searching of trade unionists' homes, the searching and ransacking of trade union premises and acts of anti-union discrimination (see th Report, para. ).
.The Committee noted, once again, the Government's manifest lack of cooperation in observing the Committee's procedure and, specifically, the inexplicable failure to send almost any of the information repeatedly requested by the Committee so as to enable it to determine the veracity of the outstanding allegations. The Committee pointed out that it had made use of urgent appeals that had been ignored, and found itself obliged, in view of the time that had elapsed since the allegations had been presented, to examine those cases once again without having the Government's observations in respect of the large majority of the allegations presented by the complainants (see th Report, para. ).
.In addition, the Committee recalled that it had requested the Government, in February, May and November  and in February and May , to accept a direct contacts mission (see th Report, para. , th Report, para. , th Report, para. , st Report, paras.  and , and rd Report, para. ), there having been no response to those requests by the Government (see th Report, para. ).
.The Committee drew attention to the Government's persistent negative attitude, shown since February  by its refusal to accept a direct contacts mission to the country. The Committee, bearing in mind that the Government has shown for many years, despite the extreme seriousness",2,1984,El Salvador
249,"of the allegations, an almost total lack of cooperation with the Committee's procedure, pointed out that it intended to examine the present cases once again in May . If the Government again failed to send the required information in a full and detailed manner and if it did not accept the direct contacts mission, the Committee would recommend to the Governing Body to give the widest publicity to the report in question (see th Report, para. ).
.Since that time, the Government has still not transmitted the information requested by the Committee and has failed to respond to the Committee's request that it accept a direct contacts mission. In these circumstances, the Committee has decided to submit a new report on these cases to the Governing Body.
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee notes, once again, the Government's manifest lack of cooperation in observing the Committee's procedure and, specifically, the inexplicable failure to send almost any of the information repeatedly requested by the Committee so as to enable it to determine the veracity of the outstanding allegations. The Committee has made use of urgent appeals that have been ignored, and finds itself obliged, in view of the time that has elapsed since the allegations were presented, to examine these cases once again without having the Government's observations in respect of the large majority of the allegations presented by the complainants.
.The Committee once again reminds the Government that the aim of the whole procedure is to ensure respect for trade union rights, both in law and in practice. The Committee is convinced that whilst this procedure protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side should formulate, so as to allow objective examination, factual replies to the allegations brought against them (First Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body in March ).
.The Committee deplores and emphasizes the seriousness of the outstanding allegations and the new allegations which refer to the murder and disappearance of a large number of trade union leaders, as well as to death threats, physical attacks, arrest and detention of workers and trade unionists, the searching of trade unionists' homes, the searching and sacking of trade union premises and acts of anti-union discrimination.
.The Committee takes note of the Government's observations to the effect that it has been decided to shelve the case relating to the investigation into the criminal act of setting off explosives in the headquarters of FENASTRAS in October  which left nine persons dead and many injured, a decision which was taken in view of the impossibility of identifying the authors of this criminal act and since no group had claimed responsibility for it. The Committee considers it unacceptable in such circumstances that the investigation has been shelved because of the fact that the inquiries undertaken by a special (non-judicial) ad hoc commission failed to produce positive results. The Committee stresses the obligation on the Government to undertake the necessary measures so as to identify and punish those responsible for this condemnable attack so that the application of rapid and efficient justice serves in the re-establishment of peace.
.As regards the new allegations presented by the ICFTU, the Committee takes note of the Government's remarks to the effect that the judicial inquiries are currently under way into the murder of Porfirio Vsquez and Miguel Angel Martnez. The Committee deplores these murders and expresses the hope that the judicial procedures that are under way will serve to clarify the facts and lead to the punishment of the guilty parties. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the result of the judicial inquiries undertaken.
.The Committee likewise takes note of the information sent by the Government in which it states that  members of the National Association of Agricultural Workers (ANTA) were evicted from the San Francisco de Ass Hacienda in the cantn of Ro Fro, Achaupan jurisdiction, and arrested on a charge of usurpation; however, after the competent court considered the case, they were released. The Committee also notes that Carlos Aguilar Garca, Norma Elizabeth Flores Portillo, Carlos Enrique Escobar Figueroa, Evelyn Jeannette Alvarado Crisstomo and Mara Cristina Alvarenga were arrested by the Hacienda police upon being caught painting anti-government slogans, but that they were released following the intervention of the competent magistrates' court in the absence of sufficient grounds for their further detention. The Committee considers that the detention of the mentioned trade unionists and of the  workers belonging to ANTA is an act that should not be repeated, and draws the Government's attention to the fact that the arrest of trade unionists who are involved in acts of public protest that are not offences, or their arrest without the intervention of the corresponding judicial authority with the clear intention of teaching them a lesson as is the case when subsequently no grounds for laying charges are found which would justify their having been denied their freedom, are acts amounting to serious violations of their trade union rights. Governments should take steps to ensure that the authorities concerned receive instructions appropriate to eliminate the danger which arrest for trade union activities implies (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, rd edition, , para. ).
.The Committee draws attention to the fact that the Government has not replied to the remaining outstanding allegations, nor to the large majority of the new allegations presented by the ICFTU in Cases Nos.  and .
.As regards the large number of violent deaths (), disappearances (), physical assaults and death threats against trade union leaders and trade unionists (see Annexes  and ), the Committee once again deplores these acts, which directly undermine the most basic human rights and the development of a free and independent trade union movement. The Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that a situation which gives rise to a climate of violence such as that which encourages the murder, kidnapping or disappearance of trade union leaders and persons is totally incompatible with the principles of freedom of association. In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government urgently to order a judicial inquiry aimed at shedding light on the murder and disappearance of, and the physical assaults and death threats against trade union leaders and trade unionists, to punish the guilty parties and to avoid a recurrence of such acts. In the Committee's opinion, the absence of judgements against the guilty parties creates, in practice, a situation of impunity, which reinforces the climate of violence and insecurity, and which is extremely damaging to the exercise of trade union activities. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of all investigations undertaken.
.As regards the numerous arrests and detentions of trade union leaders and trade unionists ( in all), the Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that the arrest and detention of trade unionists on the grounds of trade union activities constitute a serious infringement of freedom of association and a serious obstacle to the exercise of trade union rights. The Committee once again requests the Government to release all those who might have been detained on the grounds of trade union activities and to provide information on the situation of all trade union members and leaders referred to in these cases, indicating whether they are currently detained, on trial or free.
.As regards the  instances of searches, carried out with violence, of trade union premises and homes of trade unionists, as alleged by the complainants (see Annex ), the Committee considers these acts to be inexcusable and points out that any search of trade union premises or unionists' homes, without a court order, constitutes an extremely serious infringement of freedom of association. It emphasizes that the resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties adopted by the International Labour Conference at its th Session (), provides that the right to adequate protection of trade union property constitutes one of the essential civil liberties for the normal exercise of trade union rights. The Committee urges the Government to undertake judicial inquiries into the violent searches carried out against trade union premises and the homes of trade unionists, with the aim of identifying and punishing the guilty parties in an exemplary manner so as to avoid a recurrence of such acts. The Committee requests the Government to supply it as soon as possible with all the relevant information it has at its disposal.
.As regards the new allegations concerning acts of anti-union discrimination at the ADOC works (the dismissal of ten trade union leaders and  workers for attempting to establish a trade union) and at ARCO S.A. (police repression of striking workers), the Committee notes that the Government has neither supplied its observations on these allegations nor put forward reasons to justify this omission, and again requests the Government to send its comments in the shortest possible time.
.The Committee draws",2,1984,El Salvador
250,"attention to the Government's persistent negative attitude, shown since February  by its refusal to accept a direct contacts mission to the country and by its failure, despite the extreme seriousness of the allegations, to send the information required by the Committee. The Committee deplores the Government's unacceptable attitude. It urges it once again to send the information and accept the mission in question, and recommends to the Governing Body to give the widest publicity to the present report, particularly in El Salvador.
.The Committee has examined these cases on various occasions. Case No.  was last examined at its February  meeting, when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body (see st Report of the Committee, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session (March )). Cases Nos.  and  were last examined at its November  meeting, when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body (see th Report of the Committee, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its st Session (November )). Case No.  was last examined at its February  meeting, when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body (see st Report of the Committee, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session (March )).
.The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) submitted new allegations in communications dated  December  and  August .
.The Government sent partial information in communications dated  and  May .
.In addition, the Committee requested the Government, in February, May and November  and in February and May , to accept a direct contacts mission (see th Report, para. , th Report, para. , th Report, para. , st Report, paras.  and , and rd Report, para. ).
.Owing to the lack of detailed information from the Government concerning the allegations, the Committee has had to adjourn these four cases on several occasions, finally making an urgent appeal to the Government at its November  meeting (see th Report, para. ). In that appeal the Committee, noting that the Government had not sent a favourable reply concerning the direct contacts mission which it had been requested to accept, drew the Government's attention to the fact that, in accordance with the procedural rules set out in paragraph  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body, it would present a report on the substance of the cases at its subsequent meeting, even if the information or observations requested had not been received in due time.
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).

.As regards the  instances of searches, carried out with violence, of trade union premises and homes of trade unionists alleged by the complainants (see Annex ), the Committee considers these acts to be inexcusable and points out that any search of trade union premises, or of unionists' homes, without a court order constitutes an extremely serious infringement of freedom of association.

The Committee urges the Government to instigate as a matter of urgency a judicial inquiry in order to shed light on the facts, to punish the guilty parties and to avoid any recurrence of such acts. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any inquiry it undertakes and to communicate to the Committee the results of the judicial inquiry undertaken into the murder of Porfirio Vasquez and Miguel Angel Martinez.(c) As regards the numerous arrests and detentions of trade union leaders and trade unionists, the Committee once again requests the Government to release all those who might have been detained on the grounds of trade union activities and asks it to furnish the Committee with information on the situation of all trade union members and leaders referred to in these cases, indicating whether they are currently detained, on trial or free.(d) The Committee urges the Government to undertake judicial inquiries into the cases of searches of trade union premises and of the homes of trade unionists carried out with violence and without court orders (see Annex ), with a view to identifying and punishing the guilty parties and avoiding a repetition of such acts.

If the Government again fails to send the required information in a full and detailed manner and if it does not accept the direct contacts mission, the Committee will recommend to the Governing Body that it give the widest publicity to the report in question. The Committee again requests the Government to accept a direct contacts mission without delay.
.The Committee has already examined this case on seven occasions (see th, rd, st, th, th, th and nd Reports of the Committee, approved by the Governing Body, respectively, in November , February , May , May and November , November  and May-June ) when it presented interim conclusions. This case was also among the cases presented against the Government of El Salvador which were examined jointly by the direct contacts mission which visited the country in January .
.The Government made partial observations in a communication of  November , which was sent to the ILO on  April . Since then, the Government has not sent the information requested. At its November  meeting (see th Report, para. ), the Committee stated that, in accordance with the procedural rules set out in paragraph  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body, it would present a report on the substance of this case at its next meeting even if the observations or information requested from the Government had not been received in due time.
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.When it last examined Case No.  (see the nd Report of the Committee, paras. - (May-June )), the Committee made the following recommendations on the allegations still pending: ""The Committee urges the Government to inform it of the progress in the trial concerning the murder of the trade union official Jos Arstides Mndez (which commenced in July ) and to reply to the allegations concerning the serious threats against two female members of the Coffee Union (Mrs. Castaeda and Mrs. Marta Alicia Sigenza) in April ; the disappearance of the trade unionist Alberto Luis Alfaro on  March ; the death of the trade unionists Jess Rodas Barahona ( April ) and Julio Csar Ingls Chinchilla (May ); and the dynamiting of the ASTTEL premises on  April .""
.In its communication dated  November  (sent to the ILO on  April ), the Government refers to certain problems of a trade union nature within the National Telecommunications Administration (ANTEL) (problems which are totally unrelated to the outstanding allegations, and specifically to the attempted dynamiting of the premises of the Association of Salvadorian Telecommunications Workers (ASTTEL) on  April ). In this context, the Government adds that the ASTTEL is an association governed by the Civil Code, and not a trade union; that the complaint presented by the WFTU against the ANTEL is slanderous with respect to that organisation's officials; that the ASTTEL has participated in stirring up popular unrest which has led to criminal activities; and that the leadership of the ASTTEL has falsely and maliciously accused the former president of the ANTEL of responsibility in the murder of three employees of that enterprise.
.The Committee deplores the fact that the Government, in its observations, has not replied to the specific allegations outstanding in this case in spite of the gravity of these allegations and the fact that the Committee had addressed three urgent appeals for this information, at its meetings of February, May and November  (see th, th and th Reports, paras. ,  and , respectively).
.The Committee again reminds the Government that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law",-1,1984,El Salvador
252,"and in practice. The Committee is convinced that if the procedure protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side should recognise the importance for their own reputation of formulating, so as to allow objective examination, detailed replies to the allegations brought against them (see First Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body in March ).
.The Committee recalls that the allegations which have been outstanding in this case since it was last examined in May-June , refer to a request for information on the progress in the trial concerning the murder of trade union leader Jos Arstides Mndez, which commenced in July , the serious threats against two members of the Coffee Union (Mrs. Castaeda and Mrs. Mara Alicia Sigenza), the death of trade unionists Jsus Rodas Barahona, on  April , and Julio Ingls Chinchilla, in May , and the dynamiting of the ASTTEL premises on  April .
.Once again, the Committee expresses its concern at the seriousness of these allegations and requests the Government to reply to them urgently, stating whether judicial investigations have been carried out with a view to clarifying the allegations, identifying the parties responsible, punishing the guilty and preventing the recurrence of such acts. Likewise, the Committee again requests the Government to inform it of developments in the trial concerning the murder of the trade union leader Jos Arstides Mndez.
.The Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that a climate of violence, such as that surrounding the murder or disappearance of trade union leaders, constitutes a serious obstacle to the exercise of trade union rights; such acts require severe measures to be taken by the authorities (Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, rd edition, , para. ).
.Given the seriousness of this case and the new political situation in the country, the Committee considers that it would now be appropriate for a direct contacts mission to visit the country. It therefore urges the Government to accept such a mission.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee expresses the hope that the encouraging political developments taking place in the country will allow for a decisive improvement in the exercise of trade union rights and a rapid reply to all the allegations.(b) Nevertheless, the Committee must once again deeply deplore the total lack of cooperation so far by the Government in the Committee's procedure and the fact that the latter has been obliged to examine these serious allegations without the Government's reply.(c) Once again the Committee emphasises the principle according to which trade union rights can be exercised only in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind against trade unionists; it is for governments to ensure that this principle is respected.(d) The Committee again expresses its concern at the seriousness of the allegations and requests the Government to reply to them urgently, and to state whether judicial investigations have been carried out for the purposes of clarifying the alleged facts, identifying the parties responsible, punishing the guilty and preventing the recurrence of such acts. Likewise, the Committee again requests the Government to inform it of developments in the trial concerning the murder of the trade union leader Jos Arstides Mndez, which commenced in July .(e) The Committee urges the Government to accept a direct contacts mission on this case.
.The Committee has already examined this case on six occasions (see th, rd, st, th, th and th Reports approved by the Governing Body, respectively, in November , February , May , May and November  and November ) when it reached interim conclusions. It was also among the ten cases presented against the Government of El Salvador which were examined jointly by the direct contacts mission which visited the country in January .
.Since the last examination of the case, the Government sent information in communications dated  January and  March .
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.When it last examined Case No.  (see th Report of the Committee, paras.  to ), the Committee made the following recommendations on the allegations still pending:(a) The Committee must reiterate its regret that the Government has not sent all the information requested from it and once again requests its comments on the following allegations:(i) the serious threats against two female members of the Coffee Union (Mrs. Castaeda and Mrs. Marta Alicia Sigenza, in April );(ii) progress in the trial concerning the murder of Jos Aristides Mndez, which commenced in July ;(iii) the disappearance of Mr. Alberto Luis Alfaro on  March ;(iv) the death of Mr. Jess Rodas Barahona on  April ;(v) the arrest, in March and April , of ASTTEL members Messrs. L. W. Berrios, Misael Flores and Jos Mazariego.(b) As regards the various allegations of anti-union harassment against the Association of Salvadorian Telecommunications Workers, the Committee notes with concern the poor industrial relations climate reigning in the ANTEL telecommunications company and recalls again that a genuinely free and independent trade union movement can only develop in a climate free of violence and uncertainty.(c) The Committee requests the Government to adopt the necessary measures to put a stop to all acts of anti-union harassment which might affect ASTTEL leaders and members and, in particular, to ensure that all employees who may have been dismissed for their trade union activities are reinstated in their jobs.(d) The Committee urgently requests the Government to supply information on the death of the trade unionist Julio Chinchilla, in suspicious circumstances, following his arrest by military forces (May ).(e) The Committee requests the Government to supply information on the dynamiting of the ASTTEL premises on  April .
.In its communication of  January , the Government states that there is at present an understanding between the ANTEL telecommunications company and the members of the Association of Salvadorian Telecommunications Workers (ASTTEL) and that there could not be a better climate of freedom of association; in support of this information, it refers to a number of documents signed between the company and the workers' association since June , which the Government encloses as an annex to its communication. These records of agreements, signed, amongst others, by the trade union officials Messrs. Flores and Berrios, contain the company's agreement to reinstate all the members of the Association's executive (including Messrs. Flores, Berrios and Mazariego) and to authorise the workers' association to pin up messages at the workplace. None the less, according to the document dated  November , the Association of Salvadorian Telecommunications Workers had not attended the meeting (provided for in previous records).
.The Government states that the ASTTEL officials that had been dismissed did not want to be reinstated, in spite of the agreement that had been reached in this respect, because they had joined their cause with that of the National Union of Salvadorian Workers, which had carried out activities in support of the Salvadorian guerrilla grouped together in the FMLN.
.In its communication of  March , the Government states that it did not know that Messrs. Berrios, Flores and Mazariego had been arrested.
.The Committee notes that the ANTEL telecommunications company and the Association of Salvadorian Telecommunications Workers (ASTTEL) reached an agreement in , under which the members of the executive of the workers' association who had been dismissed would be reinstated, although the officials in question apparently decided not to take up their former jobs in spite of this agreement. The Committee also notes the Government's statement to the effect that it was unaware of the arrest of Messrs. Berrios, Flores and Mazariego in  and notes that the signature of two of these three trade union officials appears in the documents containing the agreement to reinstate all the members of the executive of the workers' association who had been dismissed (an agreement that also extended to the three trade union officials in question).
.However, the Committee deplores the fact that once again it must observe that the Government has not sent its observations on the remaining allegations, in spite of their gravity. Consequently, the Committee urges the Government to inform it of the progress in the trial concerning the murder of the trade union official Mr. Jos Aristides Mndez (which commenced in July ) and to reply to the following allegations: the serious threats against two female members of the Coffee Union (Mrs. Castaeda and Mrs. Marta Alicia Sigenza) in April ; the disappearance of the trade unionist Mr. Alberto Luis Alfaro, on  March ; the death of the trade unionists Jess Rodas Barahona ( April ) and Julio Csar Ingls Chinchilla (murdered in May , in suspicious circumstances - according to the complainants - following his arrest by military forces); and the dynamiting of the ASTTEL premises on  April .
.The Committee stresses that a genuinely free trade union movement",0,1984,El Salvador
253,"can develop and trade union rights be exercised only in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind against trade unionists, and that it is up to governments to ensure that this principle is respected.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee, while taking note of the Government's reply according to which an agreement had been concluded on the reinstatement of the dismissed trade union leaders of the telecommunications sector, deplores the fact that once again the Government has not sent information on the other allegations pending, in spite of their gravity.(b) Consequently, the Committee urges the Government to inform it of the progress in the trial concerning the murder of the trade union official Jos Aristides Mndez (which commenced in July ) and to reply to the allegations concerning: the serious threats against two female members of the Coffee Union (Mrs. Castaeda and Mrs. Marta Alicia Sigenza) in April , the disappearance of the trade unionist Alberto Luis Alfaro on  March ; the death of the trade unionist Jess Rodas Barahona ( April ) and Julio Csar Ingls Chinchilla (May ); and the dynamiting of the ASTTEL premises on  April .(c) The Committee stresses that a genuinely free trade union movement can develop and trade union rights exercised only in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind against trade unionists, and that it is up to governments to ensure that this principle is respected.
.The Committee has already examined this case on five occasions (see th, rd, st, th and th Reports approved by the Governing Body, respectively, in November , February , May , and May and November ) when it reached interim conclusions. This case was also among the ten cases presented against the Government of El Salvador and examined jointly by the direct contacts mission which visited the country in January .
.Since the last examination of the case, the Association of Salvadorian Telecommunications Workers (ASTTEL) supplied new information in a communication dated  November . The Government sent information in a communication dated  June .
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.Following the latest examination of Case No.  (see th Report, paras.  to ), the following questions remained pending before the Committee:(a) The Committee once again expressed its regret that the Government had not sent all the information requested on the pending allegations and requested its comments on: (i) the threats against two female members of the Coffee Union (SICAFE) in April ; (ii) progress in the trial concerning the murder of Jos Arstides Mendez which commenced in July ; (iii) the disappearance of Mr. Alberto Luis Alfaro on  March  and the death of Mr. de Jesus Rodas Barahona on  April ; (iv) the brief arrests of ASTTEL members, Messrs. L.W. Barrios, Misael Flores and Jos Mazariego in March and April .(b) As regards the various measures of anti-union harassment aimed at the Association of Salvadorian Telecommunications Workers, the Committee noted with concern the poor industrial relations climate reigning in the telecommunications company (ANTEL) and recalled that a genuinely free and independent trade union movement can only develop in a climate free of violence and uncertainty.(c) As regards the legislative aspect of the case, the Committee requested the Government to adopt legislative provisions ensuring that the workers of the telecommunications company (ANTEL) have the right to associate in unions and to carry out activities, such as collective bargaining, to promote and defend their interests and that they are protected against acts of anti-union discrimination in employment.
.In its communication of  November , ASTTEL states that it groups together  per cent of the some , workers employed in the ANTEL telecommunications company, that it is affiliated at the national level to various trade union federations and confederations, and has applied for affiliation to the Postal, Telegraph and Telephone International (PTTI). ASTTEL, which was officially founded on  October  at a general assembly attended by  delegates, has legal status and its by-laws were published in the Official Gazette on  April .
.On  and  September , ASTTEL signed agreements with the ANTEL management, which has so far refused to honour them. ANTEL is now headed by Colonel Mauricio Daniel Vides Casanova (brother of the current Defence Minister) and Lieutenant-Colonel No Orlando Gonzlez, President and Director-General, respectively, of the company, which has been under direct military control since it was set up. It is well known in El Salvador that ANTEL acts as an intelligence service for the benefit of the Salvadorian armed forces. The ANTEL management is violently opposed to the trade union movement and, backed by the Government, the armed forces and the security forces, carries out brutal and systematic repression against ASTTEL with the aim of destroying it and creating a climate of terror and intimidation impeding its normal development.
.The complainant alleges that the Salvadorian authorities commit serious, systematic and repeated infringements of ASTTEL's trade union rights and that the situation deterioriated considerably in ; it mentions several new facts.
.A member of ASTTEL, Julio Cesar Ingles Chinchilla, was murdered on  May . He had been kidnapped by soldiers of the San Nicolas district, Apastepeque, in the department of San Vicente; his body, which was subsequently found, showed signs of torture.
.On  September , national police officers arrested ASTTEL executive council members Natividad de Jesus Pinchinte, Juan Francisco Garcia Catalan and Jose Tamas Mazariego as they were holding a trade union meeting with employees of the public works branch of ANTEL. Moreover, on the orders of the company's President, the freedom of movement of the  members of the ASTTEL's executive council has been restricted; policemen and members of the national guard posted at the entrance to the workplace and provided with lists of the names of the members of the executive council have prevented them from going to work since  July . ASTTEL lodged an appeal with the constitutional court to have this measure lifted, but it was dismissed.
.Members of the security forces and Salvadorian army troops have continually occupied the ANTEL premises since  June  in order to create a climate of terror and intimidation among the workers. The military were ordered to confiscate all ASTTEL publications and impose a five-day suspension on any worker found in possession of such publications. The police search workers' clothing and other belongings when the latter go to work.
.On  April , the Salvadorian army dynamited the premises used by ASTTEL, the Unidad de los Trabajadores Salvadoreos (UNTS) and other trade union organisations in order to terrorise the workers and deter them from taking part in the May Day parade. Office equipment was damaged in the attack.
.The Government and ANTEL management are waging a constant smear campaign against ASTTEL in the press, and on radio and television, accusing it of being a ""subversive and terrorist"" organisation, for the sole purpose of providing justification in advance for any repressive measures subsequently taken. The management defames the executive council of ASTTEL in posters and communiqus compulsorily distributed to the workers and seeks to deter the latter from supporting this organisation, which seriously impedes its normal development. In addition, legal proceedings were brought against the executive council of ASTTEL on  March  for having denounced poor working conditions, low wages and corruption within ANTEL, as well as the country's political, social and economic situation in general.
.The Government and ANTEL management support the Salvadorian Association of Workers in ANTEL (ASTA), an organisation which is not at all representative as it groups together less than . per cent of the workers, allow it to carry out trade union activities in the enterprise and bring various means of pressure to bear in favour of it, such as deduction of trade union contributions at source, coercion by means of circulars and dismissal for failure to support ASTA.
.Since , the management has systematically dismissed ASTTEL leaders and activists, including the following:- on  January , Rafael Sanchez, then Secretary-General of the organisation;
.In addition, from  September to  October , the ASTTEL executive council received eight death threats for having denounced these repressive measures both nationally and internationally. Lastly, Mario Wilfredo Valiente, elected on  October  to ASTTEL's new executive council, has been denied access to his place of work at the San Miguelito telephone exchange since  October.
.ASTTEL states that all these actions constitute a grave and systematic infringement of its trade union rights and requests the Committee to intervene with the Government to put a stop to this wave of murders, disappearances, arrests and ill treatment of its leaders and members.
.In addition, on  August , ASTTEL requested the ILO to intervene with the Government on behalf of the organisation's secretary,",0,1984,El Salvador
254,"Ricardo Lazo Quevedo. At  a.m. that day, a detachment of members of the National Guard, the rural police and the national police had broken down the door of his home and taken Mr. Quevedo and his wife to the National Guard headquarters, leaving their three sons alone. Mr. and Mrs. Quevedo were released on  August following intervention by the ILO.
.In its communication dated  June , the Government sent information on the pending allegations. This information is contained in two communications of the National Administration of Telecommunications (ANTEL), dated  June and  October .
.In its communications, the Government repeats that ASTTEL is a special interest association governed by the Civil Code, and not a trade union. It adds that ASTTEL leaders repeatedly petitioned the courts for legal protection, but that until now no definitive judgement has ever been handed down pronouncing ANTEL guilty of infringing the law. Of course, ANTEL will comply with any decision or judgement handed down by the courts, whatever their contents. It is therefore paradoxical that an international organisation such as the World Federation of Trade Unions should claim to exercise, on behalf of ASTTEL, a legal guardianship which would somehow be above Salvadorian law and judgements handed down by Salvadorian courts.
.The Government also points out that ANTEL management has not signed a collective agreement with ASTTEL; the documents signed were a set of proposals to negotiate certain economic and social measures with the Government. Negotiations were and are being carried out by ANTEL; however, their implementation does not depend exclusively on ANTEL management but rather on the government authorities, and these benefits are part of a general government policy.
.The Government states that the accusations of repression and violation of human rights made by ASTTEL against the ANTEL management are vague, irresponsible and not supported by evidence; thus, they constitute a new propaganda attempt as part of a disinformation policy concerning the real situation in El Salvador.
.The Government reiterates that ASTTEL is not a trade union, the latter being governed by the Labour Code, and that it assumes rights to which it has no claim. Its officers do not have the status of trade union leaders and therefore cannot claim the right to immunity. Moreover, the Government states that ANTEL management has always recognised the right of leaders of workers' associations to mobilise themselves, to promote the affiliation of new members and to disseminate information on their activities. ASTTEL has always enjoyed complete freedom in this respect in the past, but, in view of the need to put an end to the anarchy, permanent unrest and violations of the law which had come to characterise this association, it was necessary, within the limits of the law, to curb this freedom somewhat.
.The Government concludes by pointing out that, in addition to ASTTEL, another similar association exists within the National Administration of Telecommunications - the Salvadorian Association of Workers in ANTEL (ASTA) - which, contrary to ASTTEL's allegations, enjoys wide support in its activities. The difference in attitude between ASTTEL and ASTA lies in the fact that the latter does not mainly pursue political objectives, a conclusion which one cannot help reaching in the case of ASTTEL if one examines the history of this association.
.The Committee deeply regrets the fact that the Government has not supplied all of the information requested.
.Before examining the new allegations put forward in this case, the Committee once again reminds the Government that it has still not supplied the information requested on:(i) the serious threats against two female members of the Coffee Union;(ii) progress in the trial concerning the murder of Mr. Jos Arstides Mendes which commenced in July ;(iii) the disappearance of Mr. Alberto Luis Alfaro on  March ;(iv) the death of Mr. Jesus Rodas Barahona on  April ;(v) the arrests, in March and April , of ASTTEL members, Messrs. L.W. Barrios, Misael Flores and Jos Mazariego;(vi) legislative provisions which it has adopted or intends to adopt, with a view to ensuring that the workers of the ANTEL telecommunications company have the right to associate in unions and carry out activities, such as collective bargaining, to promote and defend their interests and that they are protected against acts of anti-union discrimination in employment.
.As regards the new allegations, the Committee observes with increasing concern that, in general terms, the poor labour relations climate is gaining hold in the ANTEL company. It is alleged that this deterioration is the result of a convergence of views, if not collusion, between the company management, the Government and its various military, police and security forces, and is manifested daily in various ways, of which the common denominator is anti-union harassment against ASTTEL, its leaders, its activists and its members. Examples of such harassment apparently include defamation in the press, radio and television; favouritism towards another organisation which is far less representative and less militant; a general climate of violence and intimidation (death threats, murders, dynamiting of the organisation's premises); arrests; restriction of freedom of movement of trade union leaders; blacklisting of trade unionists and denial of their access to work; abuse of judicial procedures; refusal to honour the agreements signed in September ; and interference in the organisation's normal activities.
.In its communication, the Government denies that ASTTEL is a trade union organisation and therefore rejects as groundless all of the allegations of anti-union harassment.
.The Committee reminds the Government that it has repeatedly decided that where public employees - especially in public enterprises and nationalised undertakings - are not involved directly in the administration of the State, the national legislation should allow them to bargain collectively (see, for example, th Report, Case No.  (Malaysia), para. ). The Committee has indeed specifically pointed out in past cases that employees of the telecommunications services should enjoy this aspect of freedom of association (see th Report, Case No.  (Japan), para. ).
.The Committee accordingly urges the Government to review the situation of ANTEL employees with a view to ensuring that their rights to associate in workers' organisations and to carry out activities, such as bargaining, to promote and defend their interests, are protected.
.In view of the particularly alarming situation in this case, the Committee once again emphasises that this review should include, in particular, coverage of the workers concerned by the appropriate legislation on protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in employment. This is so since the Committee has recalled on many occasions that one of the fundamental principles of the freedom of association is that workers should enjoy adequate protection against all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment, such as dismissal; in this respect, the Committee would stress that, besides preventive machinery to forestall anti-union dismissals (such as, for example, a request for the prior authorisation of the labour inspectorate before carrying out a dismissal), a further means of ensuring effective protection could be to make it compulsory for each employer to prove that his decision to dismiss a worker or to provide less favourable conditions for a worker's employment has no connection with the worker's union activities.
.The Committee recalls that this protection is particularly desirable in the case of trade union officials because, in order to be able to perform their trade union duties in full independence, they should have a guarantee that they will not be prejudiced on account of the mandate which they hold from their trade unions. The Committee considers that the guarantee of such protection in the case of trade union officials is also necessary in order to ensure that effect is given to the fundamental principle that workers' organisations should have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom. (See, for example, th Report, Case No.  (India), para. ; Case No.  (Chile), para. .)
.In addition to these general considerations, the Committee can only express its extremely serious concern at the fate of another member of ASTTEL, Julio Cesar Ingles Chinchilla, alleged to have been tortured before being murdered. The Committee would recall that a genuinely free trade union movement can develop, and trade union rights be exercised, only in a climate free of violence, coercion or threats of any kind against trade unionists, and that it is for governments to ensure that this principle is respected. It urges the Government to supply information regarding the death in suspicious circumstances of Julio Chinchilla following his arrest by military forces.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee must reiterate its regret that the Government has not sent all the information requested from it and once again requests its comments on the following allegations:(i) the serious threats against two female members of the Coffee Union;(ii) progress in the trial concerning the murder of Jos Arstides Mendes, which commenced in July ;(iii) the disappearance of Mr. Alberto Luis Alfaro on  March ;(iv) the death of Mr. Jesus Rodas Barahona, on  April ;(v) the arrest in March and April , of ASTTEL",1,1984,El Salvador
255,"members, Messrs. L.W. Barrios, Misael Flores and Jos Mazariego.(b) As regards the various allegations of anti-union harassment against the Association of Salvadorian Telecommunications Workers, the Committee notes with concern the poor industrial relations climate reigning in the ANTEL telecommunications company and recalls again that a genuinely free and independent trade union movement can only develop in a climate free of violence and uncertainty.(c) The Committee requests the Government to adopt the necessary measures to put a stop to all acts of anti-union harassment which might affect ASTTEL leaders and members and, in particular, to ensure that all employees who may have been dismissed for their trade union activities are reinstated in their jobs.(d) The Committee urgently requests the Government to supply information on the death of the trade unionist Julio Chinchilla, in suspicious circumstances, following his arrest by military forces.(e) The Committee requests the Government to supply information on the dynamiting of the ASTTEL premises on  April .(f) As regards the legislative aspects of the case, the Committee again requests the Government to adopt legislative provisions ensuring that the workers of the telecommunications company ANTEL have the right to associate in unions and to carry out activities, such as collective bargaining, to promote and defend their interests and that they are protected against acts of anti-union discrimination in employment, in particular in the case of trade union leaders and officials.
.This case has already been examined by the Committee on four previousoccasions (th, rd, st and th Reports approved by the GoverningBody, respectively, in November , February , May  and May ) onall of which it came to interim conclusions. This case also figured among theten cases against the Government of El Salvador examined jointly by the directcontacts mission which visited the country in January . The WorldFederation of Trade Unions (WFTU) presented further information relating tothe case in a communication dated  May . The Government supplied itsobservations on the case in a letter of  July .
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association andProtection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) nor the Right toOrganise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.At its latest examination of Case No.  (th Report, paras.
.On  May  the WFTU provided further information concerning thepersecution of members of the ASTTEL, already referred to in its April letter mentioned above. It states that:- on  April  Manuel de Jesus Rodas Barahona was shot dead outside hishome by two men in civilian clothing ""death squad style"";- on  April Jos Mazariego was abducted by the police and interrogatedabout his union work for  hours;- on  March L.W. Barrios and Misael Flores were abducted by the FirstInfantry Brigade, beaten and threatened before their release in an effort tocoerce them into leaving ASTTEL;- on  March Alberto Luis Alfaro disappeared around . a.m. when leavingfor work and his whereabouts remain unknown;- since January  ASTTEL has been working without a contract because thetelecommunications company (ANTEL) reneged the collective agreement and,despite requests from the union and the -day (April ) strike referred toin previous examinations of this case, refuses to negotiate a new contract ormeet with ASTTEL.
.In general, the WFTU points out that despite article  of the ElSalvadorian Constitution, which guarantees public sector employees the rightto organise and bargain collectively, the authorities make use of the LabourCode to deny ASTTEL the status of a ""union"" having it only as an""association""; the telecommunications company workers are denied the right tostrike and are punished under section  of the Penal Code or Decree No. for any absence from work; Decree No.  of  permitting transfer ofpublic sector workers is being used to break up branch unions and remove theirleaders.
.In addition, the WFTU alleges that the telecommunications company iscontrolled by the military (the alleged death squad founder, Defence MinisterGeneral Eugene Casanova, appointed his brother, Colonel Mauricio Casanova, asPresident of the company). It quotes the March  American WATCH report""Labour rights in El Salvador"" stating: ""Government repression againstorganised workers in El Salvador ... is extensive, systematic and often brutal... Although no one organisation has had a monopoly on victimisation, ASTTELhas in recent years emerged as a special target of the security forces. ""C. The Government's reply
.In its letter of  July , the Government states that there is notrade union in the national telecommunications administration of the typecovered by El Salvadorian legislation. The description ""de facto union""referred to in this complaint is not known in Salvadorian law or industrialrelations practice and it is therefore totally inappropriate to call ASTTEL(Asociacin Salvadorea de Trabajadores de Telecomunicaciones) a ""union"".According to the Government, this is not just a point of formality, but is ofvital importance to the issue of legitimate representation of the workers. Asan ""association"", under section () of the Civil Code, ASTTEL comes underthe jurisdiction of the Ministry of the Interior, whereas ""unions"" areregulated by the Labour Code and administered by the Ministry of Labour.
.According to the Government, ASTTEL claimed rights and powers which itcould not enjoy as it is not a union; likewise, its leaders, not being tradeunion leaders, have no right to protection against dismissal. The Governmentpoints out that, despite this, the employer had allowed the workers'associations to carry out activities and ASTTEL had, in the past, had completefreedom for this. However, its mobility is somewhat restricted because of itsconstant agitation and infringements of the law. Whenever ASTTEL leaderschallenged the employer's disciplinary measures before various jurisdictions(labour courts, Supreme Court), they have been unsuccessful.
.The Government adds that there is a second similar body in thetelecommunications company, namely the Salvadorian Association of Workers inANTEL (ASTA), which also enjoys freedom of actions and movement. The basicdifference between the two associations is that ASTA is not involved inpolitical objectives. ASTTEL, on the other hand, states the Government, hascalled  illegal strikes just between  and  and has taken part indisturbances and street violence and a dozen street demonstrations which haveresulted in damage to the employer's buildings and vehicles.
.The Government explains certain of the specific WFTU allegationsagainst the above background. For example, three telecommunications workerswere dismissed after an illegal strike in November  called for the releasefrom criminal detention of an ASTTEL leader's (Mr. Jos Humberto Centeno) twosons; the employer had won from the labour court a declaration that the strikewas illegal and had warned the strikers that they risked punishment forunjustified absences from work; it points out, however, that the strikeleaders were not dismissed but merely were not paid for the days not worked.In this connection, the Government observes that article  of theSalvadorian Constitution bans strikes by workers in public and municipalservices. Moreover, the Labour Code (sections , , ,  and ) setsout the legal formalities required for strike action and Decree No.  of June  also bans strikes by government employees. It is thusincomprehensible that ASTTEL claimed rights that it could not enjoy under thelaw.
.According to the Government, the WFTU letter of  April  isincorrect in alleging that Mr. Centeno's two sons were still detained ""as ameans of pressuring the union"", since Jos and Jaime Centeno were released inNovember  under an Amnesty Decree applying to criminals sentenced forpolitical offences. It stresses that the November  strike called by ASTTELhad nothing to do with labour matters, but was used for the liberation ofthese two individuals who had no link to the employer involved.
.The Government states that over the last year, the ASTTEL leadershiphas introduced a new element to its systematic confrontation with theemploying public enterprise ANTEL, namely the false and malicious accusationthat its president is responsible for the death of three workers carried outby unknown persons. Although the Government has given full replies to variousnational and foreign bodies on this, it has requested the Public Prosecutor toclarify the facts. The Government stresses that even the widow of the lateJos Herbert Guardado has requested, through the national press, that ASTTELcease manipulating the tragic death of her husband for political andpropaganda ends. A copy of the press clipping publishing her letter to theemployer dated  March  is enclosed in which she states that the leadersof ASTTEL ""... are trying - without any basis and only for their own interests- to make (her husband's) death look like a result of labour struggles inwhich they are also making false accusations against the authorities of ANTEL,who deserve our respect and gratitude"".
.The Government claims that to link these deaths to thelabour-management problems shows the particular bad faith of the personsconcerned since ANTEL, being a huge undertaking employing almost , workersand given the circumstances reigning in the country, would most probably havesome workers getting involved in events liable to lead to tragic deaths. Itgives the following specific information on the deaths:- Mr. Guardado was, according to newspaper reports, attacked in a bus bythieves;- Victor Manuel Hernandez Vasquez was the son of one of ANTEL's sectionchiefs and had been on an internship for  days when he died; he cannottherefore be called a permanent employee or an ASTTEL member;- Medano Ceferino Ayala had never been an",0,1984,El Salvador
256,"ASTTEL leader and it is not knownwhether he was even a member or participated in the association's activities.
.In conclusion, the Government states that the claims against thetelecommunications company form part of an orchestrated disinformationprogramme at the international level and go beyond the legitimate interests ofsafeguarding workers. It recalls that certain ASTTEL leaders, such as Mr. J.H.Centeno, are members of the Unidad de los Trabajadores Salvadorenos (UNTS)which supports and promotes acts of provocation and disrespect for the forcesof law and order. It explains that the March  strike at the Ministry ofLabour and Social Security saw Mr. Centeno beat members of the military. Hewas detained because of his violent behaviour and later released. Accordingto press clippings from ""Latino"" and ""La Prensa Grafica"" supplied by theGovernment, on  March ,  or so persons arrived in buses and groupedthemselves around the Ministry shouting insults at and threatening themilitary personnel who were present to protect the buildings; after Mr.Centeno attacked one soldier there was general tumult which left variouspeople injured and led to Mr. Centeno's arrest; he was taken to a policestation and from there by the police to a private hospital for treatment ofthe blows he had received during the disturbance at the Ministry.
.Before examining the various allegations which relate to anti-unionharassment by the telecommunications company ANTEL, the Committee reminds theGovernment that it has neither replied to the recent allegations concerningthreats to two female members of the Coffee Union (SICAFE) in April , norhas it supplied further information on progress in the trial of two personsaccused of the murder of the trade union leader Jos Arstides Mendez whichcommenced in July . It accordingly requests the Government to reply asrapidly as possible, particularly as regards the trial before the FourthCriminal Court and recalls in this connection that governments should doeverything possible to avoid excessively lengthy trials. The Committee hasstated in past cases that it should be the policy of every government toensure observance of human rights and especially the right of all detained oraccused persons to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment. (See,for example, th Report, Case No.  (Grenada), para. , and th Report,Cases Nos. ,  and  (Turkey), para. .)
.As regards the outstanding issue (see rd Report, para. ) of thealleged murder of the trade unionists Francisco Mndez (on  October )and Marco Antonio Orantes (on  January ), the Committee recalls that theGovernment had previously replied that it - and the various security bodies -had no information on them but they were trying to ascertain the whereaboutsof Mr. Mndez and to clarify the situation of Mr. Orantes. Since the Committeehas received no more recent information than these general denials andprotestations of ignorance, it can only deeply deplore the disappearance insuspicious circumstances of these two trade union leaders. It draws theGovernment's attention to the importance of vigilance in investigating suchcases since a climate of violence, such as that surrounding the murder ordisappearance of trade union leaders, constitutes a serious obstacle to theexercise of trade union rights. (See, for example, th Report, Cases Nos.
.As regards the Committee's request for additional information on thereasons which were the basis for the arrests of four named trade unionists inFebruary, June and August  (see st Report, para. , May-June ),it can only regret the Government's lack of co-operation in following up onthese events and draw its attention to the principle that the arrest anddetention of trade unionists, even for reasons of internal security, mayconstitute a serious interference with trade union rights unless attended byappropriate judicial safeguards such as a prompt and fair trial. (See, forexample, rd Report, Case No.  (Bahrain), para. .)
.Likewise, as regards the Government's total silence on the alleged raidby the armed forces on the headquarters of the National Association ofEducators of El Salvador (ANDES) on  April  (first raised in theCommittee's st Report, para. , May-June ), the Committee can onlyconclude that this raid and the accompanying confiscation of union propertyinfringed the principles of freedom of association. It draws the Government'sattention to the fact that the resolution on trade union rights and theirrelation to civil liberties, adopted by the International Labour Conference at
.Turning to what now remains as the central group of allegations in Case
.The Committee notes that the Government disputes the occupationalnature of ASTTEL and argues that its complaints concerning collectiveagreements and lack of protection against dismissals are legally without basissince the association is not a ""union"" and is thus not entitled to the rightsand protections accorded to unions. Moreover, according to the Government,ASTTEL is pursuing political objectives through violent means.
.While it is difficult for the Committee to take a stand when faced withdirectly contradictory descriptions of the industrial relations climate in aparticular sector, it nevertheless is in a position to guide the parties inthis case since it has repeatedly decided that where public employees -especially in public enterprises and nationalised undertakings - are notinvolved directly in the administration of the State, the national legislationshould allow them to bargain collectively (see, for example, th Report,Case No.  (Malaysia), para. ). The Committee has indeed specificallypointed out in past cases that employees of the telecommunications servicesshould enjoy this aspect of freedom of association (see th Report, Case No.
.The Committee adds that the review requested above should includecoverage of the workers concerned by the appropriate legislation on protectionagainst acts of anti-union discrimination in employment. This is so since theCommittee has recalled on many occasions that one of the fundamentalprinciples of freedom of association is that workers should enjoy adequateprotection against all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of theiremployment, such as dismissal, particularly for trade union officials because,in order to be able to perform their trade union duties in full independence,they should have a guarantee that they will not be prejudiced on account ofthe mandate which they hold from their trade unions. The Committee hasconsidered that the guarantee of such protection in the case of trade unionofficials is also necessary in order to ensure that effect is given to thefundamental principle that workers' organisations shall have the right toelect their representatives in full freedom. (See, for example, th Report,Case No.  (India), para. , Case No.  (Chile), para. .)
.As regards the disappearance and deaths, the Committee notes thatinformation is yet to be provided on that of Mr. Alberto Luis Alfaro and Mr.M. de Jesus Rodas Barahona; it requests the Government to send its comments assoon as possible. As for the other three deaths, the Committee notes that,according to the Government, Mr. Guardado's murder at the hands of thieves hadnothing to do with his trade union activities and that the deaths of Messrs.Vasquez and Ayala could not have been related to union functions or activitiessince they were never union members. Since the complainants give no furtherdetails in support of their allegations that these deaths by unknown armedbandits were in retaliation for the labour unrest in the telecommunicationscompany, the Committee can only regret this loss of life and stress that agenuinely free and independent trade union movement can only develop in aclimate free of violence and uncertainty. (See, for example, th Report,Case No.  (Bolivia), para. .)
.Lastly, as regards the arrests of unionists and alleged beating whilein police custody, the Committee awaits the Government's comments on thealleged arrests in March and April  of Messrs. L.W. Barrios, Misael Floresand Jos Mazariego, all ASTTEL members. It notes the Government's descriptionof the release of the two Centeno sons and of the violence started by Mr.Humberto Centeno on  March . It notes in particular that Mr. H.Centeno's detention was due to his disorderly behaviour, that his injurieswere directly related to his attack on military guards and occurred before hewas taken into custody and that, after treatment at a private hospital, he wasreleased. It accordingly recalls that workers and their organisations, likeall other citizens, should respect the law of the land and considers that thisaspect of the case does not call for further examination.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committeeinvites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:a) The Committee must once again express its regret that the Government hasnot sent all the information requested on the pending allegations and requestsits comments on:i)the threats against two female members of the Coffee Union (SICAFE) inApril ; (ii) progress in the trial concerning the murder of Jos ArstidesMendez which commenced in July ; (iii) the disappearance of Mr. AlbertoLuis Alfaro on  March  and the death of Mr. M. de Jesus Rodas Barahona
.The Committee had already examined Case No.  at its meetings in May , May , February-March  and May  (see th, th, rd and st Reports of the Committee) and Case No.  at its meetings in November , February-March  and May  (see th, rd and st Reports of the Committee).
.At its meeting in November , the Committee pointed out that the Government had stated in a communication that it would shortly be transmitting its observations on these cases (Nos.  and ) (see rd Report, para. ). Since then new allegations have",0,1984,El Salvador
257,"been received from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) dated  July , the United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador (FUSS) dated  April  and the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) dated  April . The Government sent certain observations on  September  concerning the allegations made by ICFTU.
.As the Committee had not received any information from the Government since then on a large number of pending allegations, at its meeting in February-March  it drew the attention of the Government to the fact that, according to the procedure established in Paragraph  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body, it would present at its next meeting a report on the substance of the cases in question even if the information and observations requested from the Government had not been received in time. Consequently, the Committee appealed to the Government to transmit its observations as a matter of urgency (see th Report, para. ). Up to the present date, no new information has been received from the Government.
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.At its latest examination of the substance of Cases Nos.  and  (May  (st Report)) certain questions remained pending before the Committee. The Committee had in particular requested that (Case No. ):- a judicial inquiry should be undertaken into the disappearance of the trade union leaders Elsy Mrquez and Jos Snchez Gallegos;- further information should be provided on the arrest of some trade union members who were being held in custody and/or tried, indicating in particular the specific charges brought against them. The Government had reported that these persons were not in any of the detention centres in the country, but that it would ascertain whether they had been held at some stage in police security centres. The Committee also requested that (Case No. ):- a judicial inquiry be instituted into the alleged murder of the trade unionists Francisco Mndez and Marco Antonio Orantes (the Government had reported that the former had disappeared but that no state security body knew anything about his disappearance);- it should be informed of the progress in the trial concerning the murder of the trade union leader Jos Arstides Meja;- it should be sent additional information on the arrest of Adalberto Martnez ( June ), a member of the ANDA Workers' Union; Andrs Miranda ( June ), a member of the FUSS, and Gregorio Aguilln Ventura ( February ), who had been arrested by the rural police (polica de hacienda) and allegedly placed at the disposal of a military court, accused of political and related offences, as well as Jos Antonio Rodrguez ( August ), a member of the Building Workers' Trade Union, arrested by armed men in civilian clothing while he was on his way to the Construction Company ""Bruno Tonza"" where he worked. It requested indications as to the specific reasons for these arrests and whether the persons concerned had already been released;- observations should be transmitted on the raid of the ANDES premises on  April  by members of the armed forces, who confiscated documents and part of the files of the organisation, including the list of members;- observations should be sent on the dismissal of six trade union leaders in the telecommunications sector as a result of the strike called on  April .
.In a communication dated  July  the ICFTU denounces the fact that on  July  during a mass meeting organised by the Workers' Union of the Social Security Institute, which was on strike for socio-economic demands, the strikers were violently repressed by military forces stationed inside the Institute building. The communication adds that the military fired against the demonstrators, injuring a number of people more or less severely, and that the Social Security Institute subsequently continued to be occupied by military forces (Case No. ).
.The United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador (FUSS), in a communication of  April , alleges that on  April at . a.m. the house of Mrs. Marta Castaneda, a member of the Coffee Union (SICAFE) and leader of the Women's Committee of that union, was blown up. The building, at number , Colonia Lamatepec, Pasaje F, Zona D, in the town of Santa Ana, was completely destroyed, together with all that was in it. The communication from the FUSS states that five minutes after the attack against the trade unionist Castaneda and her son, who were fortunately not in the building, a unit of the Second Infantry Brigade of the same town, accompanied by the rural police, appeared on the scene. On  and  April, the Colonia was surrounded and searched by members of the Second Infantry Brigade who kept it sealed off until . p.m. on  April when the trade unionist Castaneda was allowed to leave. Finally, the communication denounces the persecution of the trade unionist Marta Alicia Sigenza, a member of the general executive committee of SICAFE, who has been unable to come to her place of work, the San Ignacio Co-operative, and has been forced to hide for fear of being killed by the government forces (Case No. ).
.In a communication of  April , the WFTU alleges the persecution of members of the Union of Salvadorian Telecommunications Workers (ASTTEL), in particular its General Secretary, Mr. Raphael Sanchez, who was dismissed, and the current General Secretary, Mr. Humberto Centeno, who was arrested and beaten. It also alleges the detention and torture of Mr. Centeno's two sons as a means of pressuring the Union, and the death at the hands of death squads of the unionists Victor Manuel Hrnandez Vasquez, Medardo Ceferino Ayala and Jos Herbert Guardado.
.On  September  the Government sent its observations concerning the incidents that had occurred at the Salvadorian Social Security Institute and been denounced by ICFTU, stating that on the morning of  July  a group of trade union members were demonstrating in front of the administrative offices of the Institute. Acting on higher orders, members of the national police were guarding the building and  per cent of the staff who were working at the time. The Government's communication states that the demonstrators entered by force, breaking through the safety cordon and, in spite of the repeated appeals of the officials to remain calm and reasonable, threw themselves on the police, attacking them with clubs in which nails were embedded and shoving them, injuring several of them as a result. After these violent actions on the part of the demonstrators, shots were heard and the security forces spread out to seek cover and ascertain where the shots came from. Two members of the police, as well as two national television journalists, were wounded by bullets. The communication adds that the Government condemns this type of action, whose planning had been denounced on various occasions as forming part of the politico-military strategy of the FMLN-FDR to bring about a confrontation between these unions and the authorities in order to destabilise the democratic process and tarnish the image of the Government in national and international public opinion.
.Before examining the substance of the cases, the Committee considers it necessary to recall the views that it expressed in its First Report (para. ) and which it has had occasion to repeat in various circumstances: the purpose of the whole procedure set up in the ILO for the examination of allegations of violations of freedom of association is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact. As the procedure protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side should formulate, so as to allow objective examination, detailed replies to the allegations brought against them. The Committee wishes to stress that, in all the cases presented to it since it was first set up, it has always considered that the replies from governments against whom complaints are made should not be limited to general observations.
.The Committee deeply regrets that the Government has not sent all the information requested by the Committee on these cases and that, in view of the time that has elapsed, it has had to consider them without having access to all the information necessary for a thorough examination.
.The Committee notes that the pending allegations concern the disappearance of the trade union leaders Elsy Mrquez and Jos Snchez Gallegos; the detention and/or proceedings against certain trade union members, in particular Ral Baires, Francisco Gmez Calles, Jos Vidal Cortez, Luis Adalberto Daz, Hctor Fernndez, Hctor Hernndez, Jorge Hernndez, Carlos Bonilla Ortiz, Silvestre Ortiz, Maximiliano Montoya Pineda, Ral Alfaro Pleitez, Roberto Portillo, Antonio Quintanilla and wife, Santos Cerrano, Auricio Alejandro Valenzuela, Ren Pompillo Vsquez, Manuel de la Paz Villalta and Jos Alfredo Cruz Vivas (Case No. ).
.The Committee also notes that there are allegations still pending concerning the alleged murder of the trade unionists Francisco Mndez and Marco Antonio Orantes;",1,1984,El Salvador
258,"the progress of the trial relating to the murder of the trade union leader Jos Arstides Meja; further details on the detention of Adalberto Martnez ( June ) a member of the ANDA trade union, Andrs Miranda ( June ) a member of the FUSS, Gregorio Aguilln Ventura ( February ) who is believed to have been detained by the rural police and to have been placed at the disposal of a military court, accused of political and related crimes, and Jos Antonio Rodrguez ( August ) a member of the Union of Workers of the Building Industry. Other allegations pending relate to the raid on the premises of ANDES by armed forces on  April , when part of the files and documents of the organisation were seized together with the membership list, and to the dismissal of six trade union leaders in the telecommunications sector as a result of the strike called on  April  (Case No. ).
.The Committee wishes to express its deep concern at the gravity and persistence of the allegations presented which relate to the disappearance, murder, detention and intimidation of a large number of trade unionists in El Salvador. Similarly it deplores the lack of additional information on the alleged violations of the fundamental human rights and freedom of association of the persons concerned. While bearing in mind Article  of Convention No.  according to which workers and employers and their respective organisations, like other persons or organised collectivities, must respect the law of the land, on condition that the said law does not impair the guarantees provided for in the Convention, the Committee wishes to underline the principle it has expressed on numerous occasions that a free trade union movement cannot develop in a system which does not guarantee fundamental rights, and especially the right of workers who are members of a union to meet on union premises, the right to free expression of opinion whether verbally or in writing, and the right of workers who are union members to be protected, in case of detention, by the guarantees of due legal process, which should be initiated as soon as possible. Similarly, the Committee would recall that a climate of violence such as that surrounding the murder or disappearance of trade union leaders is a serious obstacle to the exercise of trade union rights; such acts require stringent measures to be taken by the authorities. As regards the search of trade union premises, the resolution on trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties, adopted by the International Labour Conference at its th Session (), states that the right to effective protection of trade union property is a fundamental civil liberty essential for the normal exercise of trade union rights.
.With respect to the denunciation made by ICFTU concerning the incidents that occurred on  July  during a mass meeting organised by the Workers' Union of the Social Security Institute, the Committee takes note of the Government's information to the effect that it condemns this type of action and that the action in question is, in its opinion, part of the politico-military plans of an organisation bent on destabilising the Government. The Committee notes that the complainant's allegations and the comments of the Government give a contradictory version of events. It would recall that, in the past, when unrest broke out leading to loss of life and/or serious injuries, it had pointed out that the instigation of independent judicial inquiries by the government concerned is a particularly effective method for elucidating all the facts, determining responsibilities, punishing the guilty parties and preventing the repetition of such acts.
.Lastly, the Committee notes that the Government has not supplied its observations on the allegation made by the FUSS on  April  concerning the bomb attack against the trade union leader Marta Castaneda and her son, or on the alleged persecution of the trade unionist Marta Alicia Sigenza.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:a) The Committee must once again deeply regret that the Government has not sent all the information requested on the pending allegations.b) The Committee once again requests the Government to set up a judicial inquiry into the disappearance of Elsy Mrquez and Jos Snchez Gallegos, and expresses the hope that it will be possible to throw light on the fate of these trade union leaders in the near future (Case No. ).c) With regard to the detention and/or proceedings against the trade unionists Ral Baires, Francisco Gmez Calles, Jos Vidal Cortez, Luis Adalberto Daz, Hctor Fernndez, Hctor Hernndez, Jorge Hernndez, Carlos Bonilla Ortiz, Silvestre Ortiz, Maximiliano Montoya Pineda, Ral Alfaro Pleitez, Roberto Portillo, Antonio Quintanilla, Santos Serrano, Auricio Alejandro Valenzuela, Ren Pompillo Vazquez, Manuel de la Paz Villalta and Jos Alfredo Cruz Vivas (Case No. ), the Committee requests the Government to provide additional information on their arrest, explaining the specific charges against them, the status of the proceedings and whether they are being held in custody at present or not (Case No. ).d) The Committee requests the Government to supply additional information on the alleged murder of the trade unionists Francisco Mndez and Marco Antonio Orantes, and to carry out a judicial inquiry into this matter. The Committee also requests information on the progress of the trial concerning the murder of the trade union leader Jos Arstides Meja (Case No. ).e) The Committee requests the Government to provide additional information on the arrests of Adalberto Martnez ( June ), Andrs Miranda ( June ), Gregorio Aguilln Ventura ( February ), and Jos Antonio Rodrguez ( August ); as well as on the raid on the premises of ANDES and confiscation of its documents by armed forces on  April , and the dismissal of six union leaders in the telecommunications sector as the result of a strike called on  April .f) With regard to the incidents that occurred on  July  between military and police forces and workers of the Social Security Institute, the Committee deeply deplores violent acts of this kind and urges the Government to instigate an independent judicial inquiry with a view to determining responsibilities, punishing the guilty parties and preventing the repetition of such acts, and also to keep the Committee informed of any steps taken to open a judicial investigation.g) Lastly, the Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the allegations made by the complainants on  and  April .
.The Committee last examined these cases at its February  meeting, in the light of information obtained during a direct contacts mission conducted in El Salvador from  to  January . (See rd Report of the Committee, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session (February-March ).)
.The Committee had already examined Case No.  at its meetings in November , November , November , May  and May  (see th, th, th, th and th Reports of the Committee); Case No.  at its meetings in November , November , May  and May  (see th, th, th and th Reports of the Committee); Case No.  at its meetings in November , November , May  and May  (see th, th, th and th Reports of the Committee); Case No.  at its meetings in May  and May  (see th and th Reports of the Committee); and Case No.  at its meeting in November  (see th Report of the Committee).
.Since these cases were last examined by the Committee, new allegations have been submitted by the following organisations: the World Confederation of Organisations of the Teaching Profession ( May ), the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions ( May and  June ), the World Federation of Trade Unions ( May ) and the United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador ( June,  and  July,  September,  October and  December ). The Government submitted certain observations in communications dated  July,  August and  September ,  and  January,  and  February and  April .
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee notes with concern that since the last examination of the case, the complainant organisations have submitted extremely serious allegations concerning the death and arrest of trade union officials and trade unionists, the searching of the headquarters of a trade union organisation and various actions of interference and anti-trade union discrimination.
.The Committee notes that the trial concerning the murder of the trade union official Jos Aristides Mndez has been opened and that the presumed authors of the crime have been identified and arrested. The Committee nevertheless notes that in referring to the other two cases, the Government has merely pointed out that the trade unionist Francisco Mndez is not on the",0,1984,El Salvador
259,"lists of forensic tests carried out and that the security forces know nothing about the death or disappearance of the trade union leader Marco Antonio Orantes, although investigations are still under way. The Committee stresses the importance of carrying out a judicial investigation in all cases with a view to elucidating the facts, determining the responsibilities and punishing the guilty parties if it is proven that offences have been committed. Furthermore, the Committee notes that with respect to the alleged murder of Toms Rosales and the injuries allegedly suffered by Rafael Hernndez, judicial investigations carried out proved that crimes of this nature had not been committed. Finally, the Committee notes that it has not been possible to identify the murderers of Jos Santos Tiznado and Pedro Gonzlez during the trial conducted to this effect and that the trial concerning the death of Rodolfo Viera and two North American trade unionists (Michael Hammer and Mark Pearlman) is still under way.
.As regards the alleged arrests of trade union officials and trade unionists, the Committee notes the release of Victor Manuel Martnez, Francisco Palacios, Febe Elizabeth Velsquez, Etelvina Snchez Vsquez, Adela Margarita Navarrete, David Rolando Oliva and Juan Gilberto Durn. As charges against those concerned were dropped and bearing in mind the general grounds for arrest communicated by the Government in some cases against the persons concerned, the Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that measures of detention which restrict the exercise of trade union rights can give rise to a climate of intimidation and fear prejudicial to the normal exercise of trade union activities (see, for example, rd Report, Cases Nos.  and  (El Salvador), paras.  and ) and that when this is connected with activities in the defence of the interests of workers, it constitutes a serious interference with civil liberties in general and with trade union rights in particular (see, for example, rd Report, Case No.  (El Salvador), para. ).
.Furthermore, the Committee notes that the Government pointed out that Jos Edgar Gmez Guerrero, Cecilio Guzmn Prez, Leonel Arvalo Morales, Jaime Ernesto Martnez Menjvar, Andrs Valiente and Celso Antonio Rivas Henrquez were arrested and put on trial on charges of belonging to terrorist groups. The Government also mentioned the trial of Daniel Rosaide Cullar and Rafael Vsquez Fabin without going into further detail. The Committee requests the Government to give information on this and, in particular, to indicate the specific facts with which all the trade unionists mentioned above are charged so that it might examine the allegations in full knowledge of the facts. The Committee also requests the complainant organisations to supply additional information on the circumstances surrounding these arrests. Finally, the Committee notes that the name of Santos Ventura is not on the lists of detained persons, that Jos Antonio Garca Hernndez and Julio Hernndez Rojas are being detained on the charge of murdering a trade union official and that the Government has not replied specifically to the allegations concerning the arrest of Gregorio Aguilln Ventura ( February ), Adalberto Martnez ( June ), Andrs Miranda ( June ), Jos Antonio Rodrguez ( August ), and the arrest of the  trade unionists mentioned in paragraph  of the rd Report.
.The Committee also notes that, according to the Government, no public security body knows anything about the arrest of the trade union officials Elsy Mrquez and Jos Snchez Gallegos. In view of the allegations that these persons are missing, the Committee repeats its request that a judicial inquiry should be carried out to ascertain their whereabouts.
.As regards the allegation that the registration of the most representative executive committee of the Textile Workers' Trade Union of Industras Unidas SA was refused, the Committee notes the Government's comments, according to which various general assemblies were held one after the other and that, apart from one case, irregularities had occurred. The Committee considers that in the present case it does not have enough information at its disposal to be able to come to a decision on this matter. However, it notes that there is a possibility that there might be grounds to initiate legal proceedings and that this right does not seem to have been exercised.
.Finally, the Committee regrets that the Government has not replied to the allegations concerning the raid of the ANDES premises on  April  by the armed forces, who took away documents such as the list of members; it also failed to mention the dismissal of six union officials in the telecommunications sector because of the strike of  April .
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:a) The Committee is conscious of the difficult situation that the country is going through; however, it considers it necessary to request from the Government the information referred to below so as to be able to reach conclusions in full knowledge of all the facts raised in the allegations and in the light of the situation prevailing in the country.b) The Committee requests the Government to provide additional information on the alleged murders of the trade unionists Francisco Mndez and Marco Antonio Orantes (Case No. ), and to carry out a judicial inquiry into this matter. The Committee also requests the Government to provide information on developments in the trials concerning the murder of trade union official Jos Aristides Meja (Case No. ) and the murder of Rodolfo Viera and the two North American trade unionists, Michael Hammer and Mark Pearlman (Case No. ). As regards this last point, the Committee regrets that, despite the time which has elapsed since the murders, a final judgement has not been handed down.c) The Committee requests the Government to carry out a judicial inquiry into the disappearance of Elsy Mrquez and Jos Snchez Gallegos (Case No. ) and expresses the hope that this will ascertain their whereabouts.d) The Committee requests the Government to provide additional information on the trade unionists who are still detained and/or being tried, indicating, in particular, the specific facts with which they are charged (Cases Nos.  and ). It also requests the complainant organisations to supply additional information on the circumstances surrounding the arrests of those concerned.e) The Committee requests the Government to comment on the allegations to which it has not replied, which are referred to in the previous paragraph.
.At its February  meeting the Committee on Freedom of Association was informed that the Government of El Salvador was ready to accept a direct contacts mission to examine the various aspects of Cases Nos. , , , , , , , ,  and , noted this information with interest and expressed the hope that, upon receipt of confirmation from the Government, arrangements could be made at an early date for such a mission to take place (see th Report of the Committee, para. , approved by the Governing Board at its th Session (February-March )).
.During the visit of the Director-General of the ILO to El Salvador in May , he proposed a direct contacts mission to His Excellency the President of the Republic, in conformity with the decision adopted by the Committee on Freedom of Association at its February  meeting regarding the complaints pending against El Salvador. n this occasion the President stated that, although he had not requested an ILO mission, he did not reject the direct contact; mission proposed, and indicated that the country opened its doors to the ILO mission.
.In its th Report (May ), approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (May-June ), the Committee took the following decision in connection with the cases relating to El Salvador: ""As regards the cases relating to El Salvador (Cases Nos. , , , , , , ,  and ), the Committee notes that following an official visit by the Director-General to the country, the Government is willing to accept a direct contacts mission with a view to examining the various aspects of these cases. The Committee hopes that the necessary arrangements will be able to be made shortly so that this mission can take place as soon as possible.""
.In a communication received on  November  the Salvadorian Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the ILO that the direct contacts mission could visit the country.
.The Director-General of the ILO appointed Mr. Andrs Aguilar, member and former president of the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights and member of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights as his representative to conduct the mission. The mission took place in San Salvador from  to  January . During the mission the Director-General's representative was accompanied by Mr. Alberto Odero, member of the Freedom of Association Branch of the International Labour Standards Department, and Mr. Luis Zamudio, Regional Adviser on Standards.
.The mission was received by the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare, His Excellency Miguel Alejandro Gallegos, by Dr. Lzaro Tadeo Bernal Lizama, Vice Minister of Labour and Social Welfare, and Dr. Antonio Lara Gavidia, Head of the International",0,1984,El Salvador
260,"Affairs Department of the Ministry, by the members of the Labour and Social Welfare Committee of the Legislative Assembly, by senior officials of the Ministry of Justice, and by representatives of employers"" and workers' organisations.
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the first place, the Committee wishes to thank Mr. Andrs Aguilar for having agreed to carry out the direct contacts mission, as well as for his detailed report on the pending cases, which has allowed the Committee to examine them. The Committee considers that the report of the Director-General's representative attests to the usefulness of missions of this kind in clarifying matters arising from allegations by the complainant organisations.
.Since the content of the allegations and the information supplied by the Government, as well as the information obtained by the Director-General's representative during the mission are contained in the mission report (see Annex), the Committee can proceed directly to formulate its conclusions on the various cases.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:General recommendations(a) The Committee takes note of the report of the Director-General's representative on the mission carried out in El Salvador from  to  January . The Committee also notes that the mission enjoyed full freedom of action and movement and that the authorities of the Ministries of Labour and Justice with which it came into contact gave it every facility and co-operated actively in obtaining the information requested by the Committee on Freedom of Association.(b) The Committee notes that, according to the mission report, although there has been a marked drop in the frequency of attempts on lives and physical integrity and in the number of disappearances and arrests of persons connected with the trade union movement since the elections of May , there is continued insecurity.(c) The Committee also notes that the mission ascertained that a wide variety of trade union organisations representing all tendencies exist and operate in the country and that they play an active and militant role in national life and resort to strikes. The organisations having recourse to such action include public-sector workers' organisations, despite the fact that such action is illegal for this category of workers. Nevertheless, according to the mission report, trade union activities are often conducted in an atmosphere of fear which has an unfavourable effect on their exercise, and according to the organisations interviewed, such activities are viewed with hostility in many employers' circles - particularly in the private sector - which oppose the formation of organisations and the exercise of their rights.(d) In general, the Committee concludes from the mission report that there is still a need to make much progress in El Salvador to achieve genuine respect for human rights in general and trade union rights in particular. The Committee notes that according to the authorities of the Ministry of Labour, this is one of the main objectives of Government policy, and concrete measures to this effect have been and are being taken.(e) While the Committee is aware of the serious difficulties El Salvador is facing, it calls on the Government to adopt appropriate measures to guarantee that trade union rights may be exercised in a normal fashion; this will only be possible in conditions in which fundamental human rights are respected and in a climate free of violence, pressures and threats of any kind.Cases Nos. , ,  and (a) The Committee regrets that the proceedings relative to the homicide of Manuel Antonio and Jos Antonio Carrillo Vzquez and of Santiago Hernndez have failed to identify those responsible for the crime, and that they have been dropped.(b) The Committee requests the Government to take steps with a view to the opening of an investigation into the alleged homicide of Toms Rosales, Jos Santos Tiznado and Pedro Gonzlez, in respect of whom there is no record of proceedings having been opened. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments concerning the disappearance of the trade union leader Rafael Hernndez Olivo, as well as of the final outcome of the proceedings concerning the wilful homicide of the trade unionists Rodolfo Viera, Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer, indicating whether the investigation has been able to establish who instigated the crime committed by the two defendants.Case No. (a) The Committee regrets that the trade unionist Marta Imelda Dimas remained in prison for over two months.(b) The Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that the detention of trade unionists for trade union activities or membership is contrary to the principles of freedom of association.Case No. (a) The Committee requests the Government to undertake an investigation to determine the whereabouts of the trade union leaders Elsy Mrquez and Jos Snchez Gallegos, and to keep it informed thereof.(b) The Committee notes that some of the trade unionists mentioned by the complainants are free, and awaits the information promised by the Government concerning another  trade unionists whose arrest has been alleged and whose names are listed in the conclusions (concerning these  trade unionists, the Government reported that none of the persons listed is at present imprisoned in any of the detention centres in the country, but that further investigations will be carried out to determine whether they had been imprisoned at some stage in police centres).Case No. (a) As regards the murder of trade union leader Juan Pablo Meja Rodriguez, the Committee notes that proceedings have reached the stage of examination of witnesses, and that no one has yet been arrested. The Committee deeply regrets the murder of this trade union leader and requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in the proceedings.(b) While noting that all of the trade union leaders whose detention had been alleged in connection with this case are now free, the Committee none the less recalls that some of them were detained for trade union activities, and draws the Government's attention to the fact that the detention of trade union leaders or members for reasons connected with their activities in defence of the interests of workers constitutes serious interference with civil liberties in general and with trade union rights in particular.Case No. (a) The Committee points to the principle that all workers' organisations have the right to affiliate with international organisations of workers implies the right of national and international trade union organisations to maintain contact with one another, without interference by the public authorities.(b) While noting that the judicial authority dropped the charges against Modesto Rodriguez and Elsy Esperanza Alvarenga, the Committee deplores their detention and draws the Government's attention to the fact that the detention of trade union leaders and members against whom no specific charges are retained restricts the exercise of trade union rights, and that such measures can give rise to a climate of intimidation and fear prejudicial to the normal exercise of trade union activities.Case No. (a) The Committee observes that the Government has not sent observations on the alleged murder of the trade union leader Marco Antonio Orantes. Faced with this very serious situation and while deeply regretting the murder of this trade union leader, the Committee requests the Government to send its observations on this matter, indicating in particular whether any proceedings have been instituted and if so, their current status.(b) The Committee concludes that the judicial decision declaring the strike in the Salvadorian Social Security Institute illegal and ordering the removal of those occupying its premises does not constitute a violation of the principles of freedom of association, inasmuch as the Institute is engaged in medical and health-care services. The Committee regrets the death of several members of the public security forces and some insured persons, and notes that, according to the Government and contrary to what the complainants maintain, none of the dead or wounded were members of the trade union organisations involved.(c) The Committee notes that the judicial authority dropped the charges against four of the trade union leaders whose detention had been alleged, but regrets their detention and draws the Government's attention to the fact that the detention of trade union leaders and members against whom no specific charges are retained restricts the exercise of trade union rights and that such measures can give rise to a climate of intimidation and fear prejudicial to the normal exercise of trade union activities.Case No. (a) The Committee requests the Government to take conciliatory measures with a view to promoting a climate of reconciliation and understanding between the Servipronto S.A. undertaking and its trade union enabling the resolution of current problems concerning the guarantees for the exercise of trade union rights, and an examination of the possibility of reinstating the trade union leader Israel Snchez Cruz, a measure that would undoubtedly contribute to more harmonious labour relations.(b) The Committee wishes to point out in general that in the event of a strike the",2,1984,El Salvador
261,"authorities should resort to the use of force only when law and order are seriously threatened.
.The complaints are contained in communications from the Revolutionary Trade Union Federation (FSR) and Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of Latin America (CPUSTAL), dated respectively  and  April . The FSR sent additional information in a communication dated  April . The Government replied in a communication dated  July .
.Prior to the submission of the complaints, a number of trade union organisations requested the Director-General of the ILO to approach the Government in connection with the very matters raised in the allegations presented in this case. The Director-General immediately contacted the Government which sent certain observations in communications dated  January and  February .
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants allege that on  January , when the FSR was holding its Fifth Regular Federal Congress on the premises of the General Confederation of Trade Unions to elect a new Federal Executive Board, heavily armed members of the national police force broke into the premises and forcibly abducted a large number of union leaders and members.
.The complainants add that, after fierce interrogation and ill-treatment, some of the detained union leaders and members were released but that Jos Jeremas Pereira (Secretary-General of the FSR), Juan Jos Vargas Lemus, Juan Salvador Ramos, Cruz Alfaro Escalante (Minutes Secretary of the FSR), Salvador Chvez (Relations Secretary of the FSR), Oscar Armando Benavides, Esteban Gonzlez (Secretary-General of SETIVU), Dinora Ramrez de Pereira (Organisation Secretary of the FSR) and Amanda Ramos de Villegas are still in custody.
.Finally, the complainants state that the Government's claim that the arrests were made because a meeting had been held in the ""Loyola"" home for spiritual retreats with the participation of members of the People's Liberation Forces (FPL), which have set up a, Revolutionary Workers' Movement, is false.
.The Government states that on  January  members of the national police force went to the ""Loyola"" home for spiritual retreats where a trade union congress was in progress and arrested  persons there in order to investigate reports that a meeting of the FSR was being held on the premises with the participation of members of a clandestine terrorist group known as the People's Liberation Forces which has set up a Revolutionary Workers' Movement.
.The Government adds that between  and  January , after careful investigation, six persons were released. The nine remaining trade unionists (those names were cited by the complainants) were placed under provisional arrest by the first military examining magistrate and sent to Mariona prison pending trial.
.In its latest communication the Government states that, according to its investigations, of these nine persons Oscar Armando Benavides, Juan Jos Vargas Lemus, Dinora Ramrez de Pereira, Esteban Gonzlez Prez and Amanda Ramos de Villegas were arrested for being members of a mass mobilisation organisation of the FMLN in the course of a meeting with Jos Jeremas Pereira Amaya, Cruz Alfaro Escalante and Salvador Escalente Chvez to study an FPL plan of action entitled ""A decisive battle"".
.The Committee observes that, according to the complainants, members of the national police force broke into premises where a congress of the Revolutionary Trade Union Federation (FSR) was being held on  January  and arrested union leaders and members, some of whom were released a few days later. The Government has confirmed that members of the national police force went to the place where the FSR congress was being held and, for investigation purposes, arrested  persons, six of whom were later released. According to the Government, charges have been brought against the nine remaining persons for membership of a terrorist group known as the People's Liberation Forces (denied by the complainants) or for having links with this group and were taken by surprise while studying an FPL plan entitled ""A decisive battle"".
.In this connection, the Committee regrets that the Government has not provided detailed information on the FLP plan of action entitled ""A decisive battle"", which it claims the nine trade union leaders or members currently detained and awaiting trial were studying when captured and, in particular, on the objectives of the plan and the means envisaged to achieve them. The Committee requests the Government to send this information along with details of developments in their current trial and the text of any judgment handed down so that it can have sufficient information at its disposal on which to base its conclusions on the allegations. However, in view of the fact that six other trade unionists belonging to the same organisation were arrested during the aforementioned trade union congress and released a few days later without any charges being brought against them, the Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that the arrest and detention of union leaders and members for activities connected with the exercise of their trade union rights are contrary to the principles of freedom of association [see, for example, rd Report, Case No.  (Nicaragua), para. .].
.Finally, the Committee wishes to draw attention to the fact that the Government's reply makes no reference whatsoever to a warrant to search the premises in which the FSR was holding its fifth trade union congress. In this connection, the Committee draws the Government's attention to the principle that the right of inviolability of union premises necessarily implies that the public authorities cannot demand entry into such premises without having obtained a legal warrant to do so [see, for example, th Report, Case No.  (Chile), para. .].
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions.(a) The committee regrets that the Government has not provided sufficiently detailed information on the reasons for the arrest and trial of nine of the  union leaders and members of the Revolutionary Trade Union Federation who were taken into custody during the course of a union congress. The Committee therefore requests the Government to send further details on the matter and on developments in the trial under way and the text of any judgment handed down so that it can have sufficient information at its disposal on which to base its conclusions on the allegations.(b) However, in view of the fact that the six other members of the same organisation were arrested during the aforementioned trade union congress and released a few days later without any charges being brought against them, the Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that the arrest and detention of union leaders and members for activities connected with the exercise of their trade union rights are contrary to the principles of freedom of association.(c) Furthermore, the Committee draws the Government's attention to the principle that the right of inviolability of union premises necessarily implies that the public authorities cannot demand entry to such premises without having obtained a legal warrant to do so.",1,1984,El Salvador

.During the visit of the Director-General of the ILO to El Salvador in May , he proposed a direct contacts mission to His Excellency the President of the Republic, in conformity with the decision adopted by the Committee on Freedom of Association at its February  meeting regarding the complaints pending against El Salvador. n this occasion the President stated that, although he had not requested an ILO mission, he did not reject the direct contact; mission proposed, and indicated that the country opened its doors to the ILO mission.
.In its th Report (May ), approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (May-June ), the Committee took the following decision in connection with the cases relating to El Salvador: ""As regards the cases relating to El Salvador (Cases Nos. , , , , , , ,  and ), the Committee notes that following an official visit by the Director-General to the country, the Government is willing to accept a direct contacts mission with a view to examining the various aspects of these cases. The Committee hopes that the necessary arrangements will be able to be made shortly so that this mission can take place as soon as possible.""
.In a communication received on  November  the Salvadorian Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the ILO that the direct contacts mission could visit the country.
.The Director-General of the ILO appointed Mr. Andrs Aguilar, member and former president of the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights and member of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights as his representative to conduct the mission. The mission took place in San Salvador from  to  January . During the mission the Director-General's representative was accompanied by Mr. Alberto Odero, member of the Freedom of Association Branch of the International Labour Standards Department, and Mr. Luis Zamudio, Regional Adviser on Standards.
.The mission was received by the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare, His Excellency Miguel Alejandro Gallegos, by Dr. Lzaro Tadeo Bernal Lizama, Vice Minister of Labour and Social Welfare, and Dr. Antonio Lara Gavidia, Head of the International Affairs Department of the Ministry, by the members of the Labour and Social Welfare Committee of the Legislative Assembly, by senior officials of the Ministry of Justice, and by representatives of employers"" and workers' organisations.
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the first place, the Committee wishes to thank Mr. Andrs Aguilar for having agreed to carry out the direct contacts mission, as well as for his detailed report on the pending cases, which has allowed the Committee to examine them. The Committee considers that the report of the Director-General's representative attests to the usefulness of missions of this kind in clarifying matters arising from allegations by the complainant organisations.
.Since the content of the allegations and the information supplied by the Government, as well as the information obtained by the Director-General's representative during the mission are contained in the mission report (see Annex), the Committee can proceed directly to formulate its conclusions on the various cases.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:General recommendations(a) The Committee takes note of the report of the Director-General's representative on the mission carried out in El Salvador from  to  January . The Committee also notes that the mission enjoyed full freedom of action and movement and that the authorities of the Ministries of Labour and Justice with which it came into contact gave it every facility and co-operated actively in obtaining the information requested by the Committee on Freedom of Association.(b) The Committee notes that, according to the mission report, although there has been a marked drop in the frequency of attempts on lives and physical integrity and in the number of disappearances and arrests of persons connected with the trade union movement since the elections of May , there is continued insecurity.(c) The Committee also notes that the mission ascertained that a wide variety of trade union organisations representing all tendencies exist and operate in the country and that they play an active and militant role in national life and resort to strikes. The organisations having recourse to such action include public-sector workers' organisations, despite the fact that such action is illegal for this category of workers. Nevertheless, according to the mission report, trade union activities are often conducted in an atmosphere of fear which has an unfavourable effect on their exercise, and according to the organisations interviewed, such activities are viewed with hostility in many employers' circles - particularly in the private sector - which oppose the formation of organisations and the exercise of their rights.(d) In general, the Committee concludes from the mission report that there is still a need to make much progress in El Salvador to achieve genuine respect for human rights in general and trade union rights in particular. The Committee notes that according to the authorities of the Ministry of Labour, this is one of the main objectives of Government policy, and concrete measures to this effect have been and are being taken.(e) While the Committee is aware of the serious difficulties El Salvador is facing, it calls on the Government to adopt appropriate measures to guarantee that trade union rights may be exercised in a normal fashion; this will only be possible in conditions in which fundamental human rights are respected and in a climate free of violence, pressures and threats of any kind.Cases Nos. , ,  and (a) The Committee regrets that the proceedings relative to the homicide of Manuel Antonio and Jos Antonio Carrillo Vzquez and of Santiago Hernndez have failed to identify those responsible for the crime, and that they have been dropped.(b) The Committee requests the Government to take steps with a view to the opening of an investigation into the alleged homicide of Toms Rosales, Jos Santos Tiznado and Pedro Gonzlez, in respect of whom there is no record of proceedings having been opened. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments concerning the disappearance of the trade union leader Rafael Hernndez Olivo, as well as of the final outcome of the proceedings concerning the wilful homicide of the trade unionists Rodolfo Viera, Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer, indicating whether the investigation has been able to establish who instigated the crime committed by the two defendants.Case No. (a) The Committee regrets that the trade unionist Marta Imelda Dimas remained in prison for over two months.(b) The Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that the detention of trade unionists for trade union activities or membership is contrary to the principles of freedom of association.Case No. (a) The Committee requests the Government to undertake an investigation to determine the whereabouts of the trade union leaders Elsy Mrquez and Jos Snchez Gallegos, and to keep it informed thereof.(b) The Committee notes that some of the trade unionists mentioned by the complainants are free, and awaits the information promised by the Government concerning another  trade unionists whose arrest has been alleged and whose names are listed in the conclusions (concerning these  trade unionists, the Government reported that none of the persons listed is at present imprisoned in any of the detention centres in the country, but that further investigations will be carried out to determine whether they had been imprisoned at some stage in police centres).Case No. (a) As regards the murder of trade union leader Juan Pablo Meja Rodriguez, the Committee notes that proceedings have reached the stage of examination of witnesses, and that no one has yet been arrested. The Committee deeply regrets the murder of this trade union leader and requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in the proceedings.(b) While noting that all of the trade union leaders whose detention had been alleged in connection with this case are now free, the Committee none the less recalls that some of them were detained for trade union activities, and draws the Government's attention to the fact that the detention of trade union leaders or members for reasons connected with their activities in defence of the interests of workers constitutes serious interference with civil liberties in general and with trade union rights in particular.Case No. (a) The Committee points to the principle",2,1984,El Salvador
263,"that all workers' organisations have the right to affiliate with international organisations of workers implies the right of national and international trade union organisations to maintain contact with one another, without interference by the public authorities.(b) While noting that the judicial authority dropped the charges against Modesto Rodriguez and Elsy Esperanza Alvarenga, the Committee deplores their detention and draws the Government's attention to the fact that the detention of trade union leaders and members against whom no specific charges are retained restricts the exercise of trade union rights, and that such measures can give rise to a climate of intimidation and fear prejudicial to the normal exercise of trade union activities.Case No. (a) The Committee observes that the Government has not sent observations on the alleged murder of the trade union leader Marco Antonio Orantes. Faced with this very serious situation and while deeply regretting the murder of this trade union leader, the Committee requests the Government to send its observations on this matter, indicating in particular whether any proceedings have been instituted and if so, their current status.(b) The Committee concludes that the judicial decision declaring the strike in the Salvadorian Social Security Institute illegal and ordering the removal of those occupying its premises does not constitute a violation of the principles of freedom of association, inasmuch as the Institute is engaged in medical and health-care services. The Committee regrets the death of several members of the public security forces and some insured persons, and notes that, according to the Government and contrary to what the complainants maintain, none of the dead or wounded were members of the trade union organisations involved.(c) The Committee notes that the judicial authority dropped the charges against four of the trade union leaders whose detention had been alleged, but regrets their detention and draws the Government's attention to the fact that the detention of trade union leaders and members against whom no specific charges are retained restricts the exercise of trade union rights and that such measures can give rise to a climate of intimidation and fear prejudicial to the normal exercise of trade union activities.Case No. (a) The Committee requests the Government to take conciliatory measures with a view to promoting a climate of reconciliation and understanding between the Servipronto S.A. undertaking and its trade union enabling the resolution of current problems concerning the guarantees for the exercise of trade union rights, and an examination of the possibility of reinstating the trade union leader Israel Snchez Cruz, a measure that would undoubtedly contribute to more harmonious labour relations.(b) The Committee wishes to point out in general that in the event of a strike the authorities should resort to the use of force only when law and order are seriously threatened.
.The World Confederation of Organisations of the Teaching Profession (WCOTP) presented its complaint in a communication dated  March . This organisation sent additional information in a communication dated  March .+ The Government replied in a communication dated  May .
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainant alleges that on the morning of  March  the Salvadoran national police searched the premises of the Salvadoran teachers' organisation ""ANDES  de Junio"" and expresses its concern at the fact that the police seized lists containing the names and addresses of all the members of that organisation. This action took place in a context in which, since , more than  members of the teaching profession have been murdered by death squadrons of the extreme right and by paramilitary groups, mainly because of their affiliation with ANDES. This search and the seizure of the addresses can therefore be interpreted only as a measure of intimidation against ANDES, particularly since threats of elimination of the organisation and of its members have been made both by a high public official and by the extreme right.
.The complainant states that it fears the information concerning membership will be used not only as a basis for further political action, but that it will be transmitted to supposedly independent rightist groups which have been responsible for various attacks and murders, as a number of events have taken place which clearly show that the security forces have been unable or have not wished to protect the organisation and ensure its freedom to operate.
.The complainant also alleges that interference with the postal service is taking place which is manifestly designed to hamper communication and co-operation between ANDES and WCOTP, with which ANDES is affiliated. For example, although ANDES has not changed its address, correspondence addressed to it by WCOTP does not arrive or is returned marked ""the addressee has moved without leaving a new address"".
.Finally, the complainant alleges that the threats being made against ANDES are preventing that organisation from holding its meetings regularly and in a normal manner.
.The Government states that the organisation ""ANDES  de Junio"" is not a trade union but a general association of teachers governed by a special law and not by the Labour Code. For this reason the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare has no relations with it.
.The Government adds that it must be understood that a state of emergency is in force in El Salvador which involves restriction of certain constitutional guarantees and that the teachers' association referred to have stated publicly that it has joined the Revolutionary Democratic Front (FDR) which, together with the F.M.L.N. constitute the political and military front which has declared war on the Supreme Government of El Salvador. It is quite natural, the Government further states, that because of this fact the persons belonging to the above-mentioned extremist front or its related organisations should be investigated and that their premises should be checked for security reasons.
.The Committee notes that this case concerns a search of the premises of the organisation ""ANDES  de Junio"" and the seizure of its membership lists, as well as to the interception of correspondence addressed to this organisation. The complainant has expressed its fear that the above-mentioned lists may be transmitted to murder squads of the extreme right, as these squads are said to have carried out the murder of hundreds of members of ""ANDES  de Junio"" since .
.The Committee notes the Government's statements and, in particular, the statement that ""ANDES  de Junio"" is not a trade union but a general association of teachers governed by a special law. In this connection, the Committee observes that ""ANDES  de Junio"" is an organisation affiliated with an international trade union organisation (the World Confederation of Organisations of the Teaching Profession) and that it is composed of teachers. In these circumstances, everything appears to indicate that the organisation ""ANDES  de Junio"" is a worker's organisation whose purpose is furthering and defending the interests of workers; the Committee, however, requests the Government to indicate to what extent the national legislation guarantees to the organisation ""ANDES  de Junio"" the rights contained in Convention No. .
.The Committee also notes that the Government acknowledges the fact that the premises of ""ANDES  de Junio"" were searched and that investigations of its members have been carried out. The Committee observes that the Government justifies these measures by invoking the state of emergency, as well as security reasons, on the ground that ""ANDES  de Junio"" has publicly stated that it has joined one of the fronts forming the political and military front which has declared war o n the Government.
.The Committee observes, however, that the Government has not explained the specific grounds for the carrying out of the alleged search. In this connection, the Committee considers that ""ANDES  de Junio"", being an organisation having legal existence, should receive the same treatment as other worker's organisations and be allowed fully to exercise trade union rights.
.The Committee therefore regrets that the premises of ""ANDES  de Junio"" were searched and that its membership lists were seized without any judicial warrant authorising this action apparently being issued. The Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that searches of trade union premises should be made only following the issue of a warrant by the ordinary judicial authority where that authority is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for supposing that evidence exists on the said premises material to a prosecution for a penal offence and on condition that the search be restricted to the purposes in respect of which the warrant was issued (see, for example, General Survey by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, Report III (Part B), International Labour Conference, th Session, , para. ).
.More generally, and having regard to the historical context of the allegations made and the large number of members of ""ANDES  de Junio"" who - according to the complainant - have been murdered since  or threatened, the Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that freedom of association",0,1984,El Salvador
264,"can only be exercised in conditions in which fundamental human rights, and in particular those relating to the inviolability of human life and personal safety, are fully respected and guaranteed [see, for example, rd Report, Case No.  (El Salvador), para. ]. The Committee requests the Government to take steps to end the persecution of ""ANDES  de Junio"" and its members and to enable them fully to exercise their trade union rights.
.With reference to the allegation concerning interception of correspondence addressed by WCOTP to ""ANDES  de Junio"", the Committee wishes to point out that the principle that all workers' organisations have the right to affiliate with international organisations of workers implies the right of national and international trade union organisations to maintain contact with one another [see, for example, rd Report, Case No.  (Peru), paragraph ]. The Committee requests the Government to conduct an investigation into this alleged interception of correspondence.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions.(a) The Committee requests the Government to indicate to what extent the national legislation guarantees to the organisation ""ANDES  de Junio"" the rights contained in Convention No. .(b) The Committee regrets that the premises of ""ANDES  de Junio"" were searched and that lists of members were seized without any judicial warrant authorising this action appearing to have been issued.

.The complaints are contained in communications from the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) dated respectively  January and  April . The Government replied in communications dated  July and  and  October .
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The WFTU alleges that on  January  the Government of El Salvador handed over to the military courts a group of  union members and leaders of the Electrical Energy Workers' Trade Union who had been taken into custody on  August  for coming out on strike at their place of work in order to obtain an increase in wages. Those concerned are Hctor Bernab Recinos, Santos Rivera, Jos Arnulfo Grande, Arcadio Randa, Chedor Ascendio, Jorge A. Valencia, Jos Valencia, Francisco Ramos, Alfredo Hernndez, Orlando Machuca and Jorge Artiga. The WFTU says that the charges brought against them have not yet been made public and that they may be sentenced to death or to more severe penalties than could be handed down by the civil courts.
.The WFTU adds that coffee plantation leaders Isabel Flores, Jos Rico Amayas Checa, Julio Csar Gonzlez Lpez, Santos Valentn Velsquez and Rafael Martn Mendoza, who were arrested in December  in the western department of Sonsonete, are in a similar situation.
.The ICFTU alleges the arrest of Carlos Someta, Secretary-General of the Union of Workers of the National Water and Sewage Administration and requests the ILO to intercede with the Government to guarantee the personal safety of Salvador Carazo, Secretary-General of the Federation of Construction Industry Trade Unions (FESINCONSTRANS), whose life has repeatedly been threatened. Specifically, Mr. Carazo was obliged to abandon his home with his family because a group of armed civilians went to his house to take him prisoner although they failed to do so because he was absent at the time.
.With its communication dated  July , the Government encloses an official note from the Military Court of First Instance dated  March  containing information on the state of the trial of the  union leaders and members of the Electrical Energy Workers' Trade Union (STECEL) referred to by the WFTU. The note indicates that proceedings in respect of trial No. /, for acts of terrorism involving the seizing of public installations and cutting of the national electrical energy supply, have been temporarily staged and  defendants have been released but that the Supreme Court of Justice has ordered that proceedings against  other defendants, including Hctor Bernab Recinos, Santos Rivera, Jos Arnulfo Grande, Arcadio Rauda against whom legal grounds for arrest exist, be continued. The official note also indicates that Decree No.  containing the amnesty and civil rehabilitation Act does not apply to these  defendants as they have committed political offences punishable by more than four years' imprisonment.
.In its communications of  and  October , the Government states that the STECEL trade union leader Hctor Bernab Recinos and another nine STECEL members (whose names are given) were released on  October . The Government supplies no information on Jorge Artigas.
.Regarding the arrest and trial of  union leaders and members of. the Electrical Energy Workers' Trade Union taken into custody on  August , the Committee notes that, according to information supplied by the Government, these persons were being tried by the military court for acts of terrorism involving the seizing of public installations and cutting of the national electrical energy supply (offences that are considered to be political in nature and punishable by more than four years' imprisonment). It also notes that ten of them have been released.
.In view of the lack of details supplied by the Government concerning the specific facts with which the  union members were charged (it merely states that they allegedly committed acts of terrorism involving the seizing of public installations and cutting of the national electrical energy supply) and bearing in mind that, according to the complainants, the persons concerned were arrested for trade union reasons and specifically, for having come out on strike in order to obtain wage increases, the Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that the detention or sentencing of trade union leaders or members for reasons connected with their activities in defence of the interests of workers constitutes a serious interference with civil liberties in general and with trade union rights in particular [see, for example, th Report, Case No.  (Central African Republic), para. .] The Committee notes that one STECEL unionist (Jorge Artigas) is apparently still detained and on trial and it accordingly requests the Government to indicate the specific facts with which he is charged, as well as to supply information on developments in his trial so' that it can come to a decision on this matter in full knowledge of the facts. The Committee wishes to express concern at the fact that this trade unionist is apparently being tried by the military court and requests the Government to explain why this matter is apparently before the military rather than the civil courts.
.Finally, the Committee regrets that the Government has not replied to the remaining allegations (arrest and trial of the coffee plantation leaders Isabel Flores, Jos Rico Amayas Checa, Julio Csar Gonzlez Lpez, Santos Valentn Velsquez and Rafael Martn Mendoza; arrest of Carlos Someta, Secretary-General of the Union of Workers of the National Water and Sewage Administration; and threats on the life of FESINCONSTRANS union leader Salvador Carazo by a group of armed civilians and their attempts to take him prisoner). The Committee insists upon the-Government replying to these allegations at a matter of urgency.
.In the circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions.(a) Regarding the arrest and trial of  union leaders and members of the Electrical Energy Workers' Trade Union, the Committee notes that ten have been released; it requests the Government to indicate the specific facts with which the unionist who remains in detention (Jorge Artigas) is charged and to inform it of developments in his trial so that it can come to a",0,1984,El Salvador
267,"decision on the matter in full knowledge of the facts. The Committee nevertheless wishes to express concern at the fact that this trade unionist is apparently being tried by the military court and requests the Government to explain why this matter is apparently before the military rather than the civil courts.(b) In view of the lack of detail supplied by the Government on the specific facts which led to the arrest and trial of these trade unionists, the Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that the detention or sentencing of union leaders or members for reasons connected with their activities in defence of the interests of workers constitutes a serious interference with civil liberties in general and with trade union rights in particular.(c) Furthermore, the Committee regrets that the Government has not replied to the remaining allegations (arrest and trial of the coffee plantation leaders Isabel Flores, Jos Rico Amayas Checa, Julio Csar Gonzlez Lpez, Santos Valentin Velsquez and Rafael Martn Mendoza; arrest of Carlos Someta, Secretary-General of the Union of Workers of the National Water and Sewage Administration; and threats on the life of FESINCONSTRANS union leader Salvador Carazo by a group of armed civilians and their attempts to take him prisoner). The Committee insists upon the Government replying to these allegations as a matter of urgency.",0,1984,El Salvador
268,".At its February  meeting the Committee on Freedom of Association was informed that the Government of El Salvador was ready to accept a direct contacts mission to examine the various aspects of Cases Nos. , , , , , , , ,  and , noted this information with interest and expressed the hope that, upon receipt of confirmation from the Government, arrangements could be made at an early date for such a mission to take place (see th Report of the Committee, para. , approved by the Governing Board at its th Session (February-March )).
.During the visit of the Director-General of the ILO to El Salvador in May , he proposed a direct contacts mission to His Excellency the President of the Republic, in conformity with the decision adopted by the Committee on Freedom of Association at its February  meeting regarding the complaints pending against El Salvador. n this occasion the President stated that, although he had not requested an ILO mission, he did not reject the direct contact; mission proposed, and indicated that the country opened its doors to the ILO mission.
.In its th Report (May ), approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (May-June ), the Committee took the following decision in connection with the cases relating to El Salvador: ""As regards the cases relating to El Salvador (Cases Nos. , , , , , , ,  and ), the Committee notes that following an official visit by the Director-General to the country, the Government is willing to accept a direct contacts mission with a view to examining the various aspects of these cases. The Committee hopes that the necessary arrangements will be able to be made shortly so that this mission can take place as soon as possible.""
.In a communication received on  November  the Salvadorian Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the ILO that the direct contacts mission could visit the country.
.The Director-General of the ILO appointed Mr. Andrs Aguilar, member and former president of the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights and member of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights as his representative to conduct the mission. The mission took place in San Salvador from  to  January . During the mission the Director-General's representative was accompanied by Mr. Alberto Odero, member of the Freedom of Association Branch of the International Labour Standards Department, and Mr. Luis Zamudio, Regional Adviser on Standards.
.The mission was received by the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare, His Excellency Miguel Alejandro Gallegos, by Dr. Lzaro Tadeo Bernal Lizama, Vice Minister of Labour and Social Welfare, and Dr. Antonio Lara Gavidia, Head of the International Affairs Department of the Ministry, by the members of the Labour and Social Welfare Committee of the Legislative Assembly, by senior officials of the Ministry of Justice, and by representatives of employers"" and workers' organisations.
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the first place, the Committee wishes to thank Mr. Andrs Aguilar for having agreed to carry out the direct contacts mission, as well as for his detailed report on the pending cases, which has allowed the Committee to examine them. The Committee considers that the report of the Director-General's representative attests to the usefulness of missions of this kind in clarifying matters arising from allegations by the complainant organisations.
.Since the content of the allegations and the information supplied by the Government, as well as the information obtained by the Director-General's representative during the mission are contained in the mission report (see Annex), the Committee can proceed directly to formulate its conclusions on the various cases.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:General recommendations(a) The Committee takes note of the report of the Director-General's representative on the mission carried out in El Salvador from  to  January . The Committee also notes that the mission enjoyed full freedom of action and movement and that the authorities of the Ministries of Labour and Justice with which it came into contact gave it every facility and co-operated actively in obtaining the information requested by the Committee on Freedom of Association.(b) The Committee notes that, according to the mission report, although there has been a marked drop in the frequency of attempts on lives and physical integrity and in the number of disappearances and arrests of persons connected with the trade union movement since the elections of May , there is continued insecurity.(c) The Committee also notes that the mission ascertained that a wide variety of trade union organisations representing all tendencies exist and operate in the country and that they play an active and militant role in national life and resort to strikes. The organisations having recourse to such action include public-sector workers' organisations, despite the fact that such action is illegal for this category of workers. Nevertheless, according to the mission report, trade union activities are often conducted in an atmosphere of fear which has an unfavourable effect on their exercise, and according to the organisations interviewed, such activities are viewed with hostility in many employers' circles - particularly in the private sector - which oppose the formation of organisations and the exercise of their rights.(d) In general, the Committee concludes from the mission report that there is still a need to make much progress in El Salvador to achieve genuine respect for human rights in general and trade union rights in particular. The Committee notes that according to the authorities of the Ministry of Labour, this is one of the main objectives of Government policy, and concrete measures to this effect have been and are being taken.(e) While the Committee is aware of the serious difficulties El Salvador is facing, it calls on the Government to adopt appropriate measures to guarantee that trade union rights may be exercised in a normal fashion; this will only be possible in conditions in which fundamental human rights are respected and in a climate free of violence, pressures and threats of any kind.Cases Nos. , ,  and (a) The Committee regrets that the proceedings relative to the homicide of Manuel Antonio and Jos Antonio Carrillo Vzquez and of Santiago Hernndez have failed to identify those responsible for the crime, and that they have been dropped.(b) The Committee requests the Government to take steps with a view to the opening of an investigation into the alleged homicide of Toms Rosales, Jos Santos Tiznado and Pedro Gonzlez, in respect of whom there is no record of proceedings having been opened. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments concerning the disappearance of the trade union leader Rafael Hernndez Olivo, as well as of the final outcome of the proceedings concerning the wilful homicide of the trade unionists Rodolfo Viera, Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer, indicating whether the investigation has been able to establish who instigated the crime committed by the two defendants.Case No. (a) The Committee regrets that the trade unionist Marta Imelda Dimas remained in prison for over two months.(b) The Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that the detention of trade unionists for trade union activities or membership is contrary to the principles of freedom of association.Case No. (a) The Committee requests the Government to undertake an investigation to determine the whereabouts of the trade union leaders Elsy Mrquez and Jos Snchez Gallegos, and to keep it informed thereof.(b) The Committee notes that some of the trade unionists mentioned by the complainants are free, and awaits the information promised by the Government concerning another  trade unionists whose arrest has been alleged and whose names are listed in the conclusions (concerning these  trade unionists, the Government reported that none of the persons listed is at present imprisoned in any of the detention centres in the country, but that further investigations will be carried out to determine whether they had been imprisoned at some stage in police centres).Case No. (a) As regards the murder of trade union leader Juan Pablo Meja Rodriguez, the Committee notes that proceedings have reached the stage of examination of witnesses, and that no one has yet been arrested. The Committee deeply regrets the murder of this trade union leader and requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in the proceedings.(b) While noting that all of the trade union leaders whose detention had been alleged in connection with this case are now free, the Committee none the less recalls that some of them were detained for trade union activities, and draws the Government's attention to the fact that the detention of trade union leaders or members for reasons connected with their activities in defence of the interests of workers constitutes serious interference with civil liberties in general and with trade union rights in particular.Case No. (a) The Committee points to the principle",2,1983,El Salvador
269,"that all workers' organisations have the right to affiliate with international organisations of workers implies the right of national and international trade union organisations to maintain contact with one another, without interference by the public authorities.(b) While noting that the judicial authority dropped the charges against Modesto Rodriguez and Elsy Esperanza Alvarenga, the Committee deplores their detention and draws the Government's attention to the fact that the detention of trade union leaders and members against whom no specific charges are retained restricts the exercise of trade union rights, and that such measures can give rise to a climate of intimidation and fear prejudicial to the normal exercise of trade union activities.Case No. (a) The Committee observes that the Government has not sent observations on the alleged murder of the trade union leader Marco Antonio Orantes. Faced with this very serious situation and while deeply regretting the murder of this trade union leader, the Committee requests the Government to send its observations on this matter, indicating in particular whether any proceedings have been instituted and if so, their current status.(b) The Committee concludes that the judicial decision declaring the strike in the Salvadorian Social Security Institute illegal and ordering the removal of those occupying its premises does not constitute a violation of the principles of freedom of association, inasmuch as the Institute is engaged in medical and health-care services. The Committee regrets the death of several members of the public security forces and some insured persons, and notes that, according to the Government and contrary to what the complainants maintain, none of the dead or wounded were members of the trade union organisations involved.(c) The Committee notes that the judicial authority dropped the charges against four of the trade union leaders whose detention had been alleged, but regrets their detention and draws the Government's attention to the fact that the detention of trade union leaders and members against whom no specific charges are retained restricts the exercise of trade union rights and that such measures can give rise to a climate of intimidation and fear prejudicial to the normal exercise of trade union activities.Case No. (a) The Committee requests the Government to take conciliatory measures with a view to promoting a climate of reconciliation and understanding between the Servipronto S.A. undertaking and its trade union enabling the resolution of current problems concerning the guarantees for the exercise of trade union rights, and an examination of the possibility of reinstating the trade union leader Israel Snchez Cruz, a measure that would undoubtedly contribute to more harmonious labour relations.(b) The Committee wishes to point out in general that in the event of a strike the authorities should resort to the use of force only when law and order are seriously threatened.
.The complaint is contained in communications from the World Federation of Trade Union (WFTU) and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), dated  September . The WFTU and ICFTU sent further information in communications, dated respectively  and  October . Both the contents of the complaint and the supplementary information were forwarded to the Government the day following their receipt by the Office. In view of the gravity of the allegations, the Director-General sent a telegram to the Government inviting it to submit information on this matter with the utmost urgency. The Government replied in communications of  October  and  February .
.El Salvador has not ratified either the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communications of  September , the complainants allege that on  September at . a.m., the trade union leader, Santiago Hernndez Jimnez, was arrested in the Morazn Square in San Salvador by three armed persons, presumably members of the state security police force. According to the complainants, Mr. Hernndez, who held the office of Secretary-General of the United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador (FUSS) and was representative of the Committee of Trade Union Unity of El Salvador (CUS), was one of the leaders of the recent strikes which had taken place in the banking sector.
.In their communications of  and  of October "" respectively, the WFTU and the ICFTU state that this trade union leader had been murdered. According to the WFTU, the security forces had tortured him to death and his corpse was found on  October , together with that of four other persons, in a central district of San Salvador. The ICFTU points out that Mr. Hernndez was murdered by strangling in the San Miguelito municipality of San Salvador and that an extreme right-wing commando had claimed responsibility for his abduction and subsequent murder.
.In its communication of  October , the Government states the trade union leader of the United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador (FUSS), Mr. Santiago Hernndez Jimnez, was not abducted by persons belonging to any security body of the armed forces but by members of the right-wing death squad ""Maximiliano Hernndez Martnez"", who had murdered him, together with three other persons, on  October ; the squad had publicly claimed that they were the authors of these crimes.
.In the press cuttings enclosed by the Government, it is mentioned that a communication from the anti-communist brigade ""Maximiliano Hernndez Martnez"" had been fastened onto each of the bodies in a plastic bag. One of these communications states that the persons in question had been executed ""for being members of the Salvadorian communist party bent on destroying our country; they have therefore been found guilty of having committed high treason against the Fatherland"".
.In its communication of  February , the Government states that at present the Third Court of Criminal Investigation of San Salvador is carrying out investigations concerning the authors of the above-mentioned murders, but that their identity has not yet been able to be verified. According to the Government, at the first hearings, it was established that the deceased died from asphyxiation by strangling.
.The Committee notes the complainants' allegations concerning the arrest and murder of the trade union leader, Santiago Hernndez Jimnez, and the Government's reply.
.In particular, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, Santiago Hernndez was not abducted by persons belonging to any security body of the armed forces but by members of the right-wing death squad ""Maximilano Hernndez Martinez"", who later murdered him.
.In this respect, the Committee deeply deplores the murder of this trade union leader, especially in view of the circumstances in which, according to the complainants, this occurred.
.Furthermore, the Committee must draw to the Government's attention that freedom of association can only be exercised in conditions in which fundamental human rights, and in particular those relating to human life and personal safety, are fully respected and guaranteed.
.On previous occasions when examining allegations concerning the death of trade union leaders [see, for example, th report, Cases Nos.  and  (Turkey), paragraph ], the Committee has requested the Government to undertake without delay an independent judicial inquiry with a view to elucidating the facts in full, determining responsibilities and punishing the guilty parties. The Committee notes in this connection that the Third Court of Criminal Investigation of San Salvador is carrying out investigations concerning the authors of the murder of Santiago Hernndez. The Committee asks the Government to inform it as soon as possible of developments in these investigations and to let it know the outcome of the trial.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report and in particular the following conclusions.(a) The Committee deeply deplores the murder of the trade union leader, Santiago Hernndez Jimnez, especially in view of the circumstances under which this occurred.(b) The Committee asks the Government to inform it as soon as possible of developments in the judicial investigations into the murder of Santiago Hernndez and to let it know the outcome of trial.(c) The Committee calls the Government's attention to the fact that freedom of association can only be exercised in conditions in which fundamental human rights, and in particular those relating to human life and personal safety, are fully respected and guaranteed.Geneva,  February  Roberto Ago, Chairman.",0,1983,El Salvador
270,".The Committee has examined this case on five previous occasions, often jointly with other cases concerning similar incidents, and most recently in its th Report, paragraphs  to  (approved by the Governing Body at its th Session, May-June ).
.At its February  meeting, the Committee addressed an urgent appeal to the Government for its further comments and observations on this case, failing which it would, in accordance with its established procedure, present a report on the allegations even if the Government's reply was not received in due time.
.To date there has been no reply received from the Government.
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Government subsequently sent a series of short communications referring to the release of various union leaders by virtue of the Amnesty Act of  May  and stating generally that the detainees were held on criminal charges carrying penalties of more than four years' imprisonment. At the Committee's second examination (th Report, paras.  to  and Annex containing  names, approved in May ), it noted these releases but reiterated its concern that many trade unionists had been in custody since  awaiting trial on charges carrying sentences of more than four years' imprisonment or had disappeared. It again urged the Government to supply precise information on the accusations made against these persons, on progress in their trials and on the whereabouts of those who had disappeared.
.In February  the Committee noted with interest as regards the cases before it at that time concerning El Salvador that the Government was ready to accept a direct contacts mission to examine the various aspects of all the cases (th Report, para. ). In its th Report of May , the Committee noted as regards the cases then relating to El Salvador (Cases Nos. , , , , , , ,  and )that, following an official visit by the Director-General to the country, the Government was willing to accept a direct contacts mission with a view to examining the various aspects of these cases.
.The mission took place in January  and, in February , the Committee took note of the mission report during its third examination of Case No.  (rd Report, paras.  to ). Among other things, it stated that while the Committee was aware of the serious difficulties El Salvador was facing, it called on the Government to adopt appropriate measures to guarantee that trade union rights may be exercised in a normal fashion; this would only be possible in conditions in which fundamental human rights are respected and in a climate free of violence, pressures and threats of any kind. As for Case No.  in particular, the Committee requested the Government to undertake an investigation to determine the whereabouts of the trade union leaders Elsy Mrquez and Jos Snchez Gallegos, and to keep it informed thereof; and it noted that some of the trade unionists mentioned by the complainants were free, and awaited the information promised by the Government concerning another  named trade unionists whose arrest had been alleged (concerning these  trade unionists, the Government reported that none of the persons listed was then imprisoned in any of the detention centres in the country, but that further investigations would be carried out to determine whether they had been imprisoned at some stage in police centres) .
.No further information was received and the Committee addressed an urgent appeal to the Government for a reply at its February  meeting (th Report, para. ). This resulted in a new communication from the Government and the fourth examination of the case by the Committee at its May  meeting (st Report, paras.  to ). The Committee stated that it was conscious of the difficult situation that the country was going through but considered it necessary to request from the Government yet further information so as to be able to reach conclusions in full knowledge of all the facts raised in the allegations and in the light of the situation prevailing in the country. It requested the Government to carry out a judicial inquiry into the disappearance of Elsy Mrquez and Jos Snchez Gallegos and asked for more infomation on the  named unionists facing trial and apparently still in detention.
.Since no further information was forthcoming, the Committee addressed an urgent appeal - its third - for a reply to the Government at its February  meeting (th Report, para. ). This resulted in a new communication from the Government and the Committee's fifth examination of the case (th Report, paras.  to ). In the light of the Committee's interim conclusions, the Governing Body approved the following recommendations at its May-June  Session: a) The Committee must once again deeply regret that the Government has not sent all the information requested on the pending allegations. b) The Committee once again requests the Government to set up a judicial inquiry into the disappearance of Elsy Mrquez and Jos Snchez Gallegos, and expresses the hope that it will be possible to throw light on the fate of these trade union leaders in the near future. c) With regard to the detention and/or proceedings against the trade unionists Ral Baires, Francisco Gmez Calles, Jos Vidal Cortez, Luis Adalberto Daz, Hctor Fernndez, Hctor Hernndez, Jorge Hernndez, Carlos Bonilla Ortiz, Silvestre Ortiz, Maximiliano Montoya Pineda, Ral Alfaro Pleitez, Roberto Portillo, Antonio Quintanilla, Santos Serrano, Auricio Alejandro Valenzuela, Ren Pompillo Vasquez, Manuel de la Paz Villalta and Jos Alfredo Cruz Vivas, the Committee requests the Government to provide additional information on their arrest, explaining the specific charges against them, the status of the proceedings and whether they are being held in custody at present or not.
.At the same time, the Government was requested to supply information on ongoing allegations contained in Case No.  against El Salvador, which was the last remaining case to be examined jointly with the present case since the  direct contacts mission (in which ten cases were considered).
.No information was received and the Committee addressed its fourth urgent appeal in the history of this case to the Government at its February  meeting (nd Report, para. ).
.The Committee deeply regrets that, since the very opening of this case in October , the Government has not sent all the details requested from it and then, only after many adjournments, Office reminders and urgent appeals. This attitude has now culminated in the fact that, in view of the time that has elapsed, the Committee has had to consider the case without having access to any recent information or details which it has specifically stated were necessary for a thorough examination.
.The Committee recalls that a certain amount of information was obtained on this case during the  direct contacts mission which had received every facility and active co-operation in its search for the information requested by the Committee. The mission noted that El Salvador faced serious difficulties owing to the armed conflict between Government and guerilla forces but that since the  elections there was a certain positive evolution. The Committee has shown considerable patience and comprehension in relation to the situation facing El Salvador, as witnessed by its report on the case after the direct contacts mission and its st report. However, the fact remains that no substantive information has been forthcoming on  named persons. Two of them were reported missing in suspicious circumstances in the WFTU's letter of May  and  were the subject of a search in  but their names did not appear in the records of the Directorate-General of Penal Centres and Rehabilitation although they might have been held by the security forces (no reply has come on this from the Ministry of Public Safety despite inquiries by the direct contacts mission: see rd Report of the Committee, para. ). The Committee considers it unacceptable that a member State would not provide detailed and complete answers when the lives and freedom of trade union leaders and trade unionists are at stake.
.The Committee can only draw the Government's attention to the great importance it attaches to the principle that a climate of violence such as that surrounding the disappearance of trade union leaders constitutes a serious obstacle to the exercise of trade union rights and such an event requires severe measures to be taken by the authorities (see, for example, Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, , para. ). The Committee is also committed to the principle that because detention of unionists may involve serious interference with trade union rights and because of the importance of a fair trial, governments should bring detainees to trial in all cases without delay, irrespective of the reasons put forward for prolonging the detention (see Digest, para. ).
.The Committee considers that it is now imperative that the Government open independent judicial inquiries into",1,1982,El Salvador
271,"the whereabouts of the  trade unionists whose names are listed in the Annex, as has been done by other governments when faced with a total inability to obtain data on missing individuals, and requests the Government to keep it informed on the results of said inquiries.
.The Committee had already examined Case No.  at its meetings in May , May , February-March  and May  (see th, th, rd and st Reports of the Committee) and Case No.  at its meetings in November , February-March  and May  (see th, rd and st Reports of the Committee).
.At its meeting in November , the Committee pointed out that the Government had stated in a communication that it would shortly be transmitting its observations on these cases (Nos.  and ) (see rd Report, para. ). Since then new allegations have been received from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) dated  July , the United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador (FUSS) dated  April  and the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) dated  April . The Government sent certain observations on  September  concerning the allegations made by ICFTU.
.As the Committee had not received any information from the Government since then on a large number of pending allegations, at its meeting in February-March  it drew the attention of the Government to the fact that, according to the procedure established in Paragraph  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body, it would present at its next meeting a report on the substance of the cases in question even if the information and observations requested from the Government had not been received in time. Consequently, the Committee appealed to the Government to transmit its observations as a matter of urgency (see th Report, para. ). Up to the present date, no new information has been received from the Government.
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.At its latest examination of the substance of Cases Nos.  and  (May  (st Report)) certain questions remained pending before the Committee. The Committee had in particular requested that (Case No. ):- a judicial inquiry should be undertaken into the disappearance of the trade union leaders Elsy Mrquez and Jos Snchez Gallegos;- further information should be provided on the arrest of some trade union members who were being held in custody and/or tried, indicating in particular the specific charges brought against them. The Government had reported that these persons were not in any of the detention centres in the country, but that it would ascertain whether they had been held at some stage in police security centres. The Committee also requested that (Case No. ):- a judicial inquiry be instituted into the alleged murder of the trade unionists Francisco Mndez and Marco Antonio Orantes (the Government had reported that the former had disappeared but that no state security body knew anything about his disappearance);- it should be informed of the progress in the trial concerning the murder of the trade union leader Jos Arstides Meja;- it should be sent additional information on the arrest of Adalberto Martnez ( June ), a member of the ANDA Workers' Union; Andrs Miranda ( June ), a member of the FUSS, and Gregorio Aguilln Ventura ( February ), who had been arrested by the rural police (polica de hacienda) and allegedly placed at the disposal of a military court, accused of political and related offences, as well as Jos Antonio Rodrguez ( August ), a member of the Building Workers' Trade Union, arrested by armed men in civilian clothing while he was on his way to the Construction Company ""Bruno Tonza"" where he worked. It requested indications as to the specific reasons for these arrests and whether the persons concerned had already been released;- observations should be transmitted on the raid of the ANDES premises on  April  by members of the armed forces, who confiscated documents and part of the files of the organisation, including the list of members;- observations should be sent on the dismissal of six trade union leaders in the telecommunications sector as a result of the strike called on  April .
.In a communication dated  July  the ICFTU denounces the fact that on  July  during a mass meeting organised by the Workers' Union of the Social Security Institute, which was on strike for socio-economic demands, the strikers were violently repressed by military forces stationed inside the Institute building. The communication adds that the military fired against the demonstrators, injuring a number of people more or less severely, and that the Social Security Institute subsequently continued to be occupied by military forces (Case No. ).
.The United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador (FUSS), in a communication of  April , alleges that on  April at . a.m. the house of Mrs. Marta Castaneda, a member of the Coffee Union (SICAFE) and leader of the Women's Committee of that union, was blown up. The building, at number , Colonia Lamatepec, Pasaje F, Zona D, in the town of Santa Ana, was completely destroyed, together with all that was in it. The communication from the FUSS states that five minutes after the attack against the trade unionist Castaneda and her son, who were fortunately not in the building, a unit of the Second Infantry Brigade of the same town, accompanied by the rural police, appeared on the scene. On  and  April, the Colonia was surrounded and searched by members of the Second Infantry Brigade who kept it sealed off until . p.m. on  April when the trade unionist Castaneda was allowed to leave. Finally, the communication denounces the persecution of the trade unionist Marta Alicia Sigenza, a member of the general executive committee of SICAFE, who has been unable to come to her place of work, the San Ignacio Co-operative, and has been forced to hide for fear of being killed by the government forces (Case No. ).
.In a communication of  April , the WFTU alleges the persecution of members of the Union of Salvadorian Telecommunications Workers (ASTTEL), in particular its General Secretary, Mr. Raphael Sanchez, who was dismissed, and the current General Secretary, Mr. Humberto Centeno, who was arrested and beaten. It also alleges the detention and torture of Mr. Centeno's two sons as a means of pressuring the Union, and the death at the hands of death squads of the unionists Victor Manuel Hrnandez Vasquez, Medardo Ceferino Ayala and Jos Herbert Guardado.
.On  September  the Government sent its observations concerning the incidents that had occurred at the Salvadorian Social Security Institute and been denounced by ICFTU, stating that on the morning of  July  a group of trade union members were demonstrating in front of the administrative offices of the Institute. Acting on higher orders, members of the national police were guarding the building and  per cent of the staff who were working at the time. The Government's communication states that the demonstrators entered by force, breaking through the safety cordon and, in spite of the repeated appeals of the officials to remain calm and reasonable, threw themselves on the police, attacking them with clubs in which nails were embedded and shoving them, injuring several of them as a result. After these violent actions on the part of the demonstrators, shots were heard and the security forces spread out to seek cover and ascertain where the shots came from. Two members of the police, as well as two national television journalists, were wounded by bullets. The communication adds that the Government condemns this type of action, whose planning had been denounced on various occasions as forming part of the politico-military strategy of the FMLN-FDR to bring about a confrontation between these unions and the authorities in order to destabilise the democratic process and tarnish the image of the Government in national and international public opinion.
.Before examining the substance of the cases, the Committee considers it necessary to recall the views that it expressed in its First Report (para. ) and which it has had occasion to repeat in various circumstances: the purpose of the whole procedure set up in the ILO for the examination of allegations of violations of freedom of association is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact. As the procedure protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side should formulate, so as to allow objective examination, detailed replies to the allegations brought against them. The Committee wishes to stress that, in all the cases presented to it since it was first set up, it has always considered that the replies from governments against whom complaints are made should not be limited to general observations.
.The Committee deeply regrets that the Government has not sent all the information requested",1,1982,El Salvador
272,"by the Committee on these cases and that, in view of the time that has elapsed, it has had to consider them without having access to all the information necessary for a thorough examination.
.The Committee notes that the pending allegations concern the disappearance of the trade union leaders Elsy Mrquez and Jos Snchez Gallegos; the detention and/or proceedings against certain trade union members, in particular Ral Baires, Francisco Gmez Calles, Jos Vidal Cortez, Luis Adalberto Daz, Hctor Fernndez, Hctor Hernndez, Jorge Hernndez, Carlos Bonilla Ortiz, Silvestre Ortiz, Maximiliano Montoya Pineda, Ral Alfaro Pleitez, Roberto Portillo, Antonio Quintanilla and wife, Santos Cerrano, Auricio Alejandro Valenzuela, Ren Pompillo Vsquez, Manuel de la Paz Villalta and Jos Alfredo Cruz Vivas (Case No. ).
.The Committee also notes that there are allegations still pending concerning the alleged murder of the trade unionists Francisco Mndez and Marco Antonio Orantes; the progress of the trial relating to the murder of the trade union leader Jos Arstides Meja; further details on the detention of Adalberto Martnez ( June ) a member of the ANDA trade union, Andrs Miranda ( June ) a member of the FUSS, Gregorio Aguilln Ventura ( February ) who is believed to have been detained by the rural police and to have been placed at the disposal of a military court, accused of political and related crimes, and Jos Antonio Rodrguez ( August ) a member of the Union of Workers of the Building Industry. Other allegations pending relate to the raid on the premises of ANDES by armed forces on  April , when part of the files and documents of the organisation were seized together with the membership list, and to the dismissal of six trade union leaders in the telecommunications sector as a result of the strike called on  April  (Case No. ).
.The Committee wishes to express its deep concern at the gravity and persistence of the allegations presented which relate to the disappearance, murder, detention and intimidation of a large number of trade unionists in El Salvador. Similarly it deplores the lack of additional information on the alleged violations of the fundamental human rights and freedom of association of the persons concerned. While bearing in mind Article  of Convention No.  according to which workers and employers and their respective organisations, like other persons or organised collectivities, must respect the law of the land, on condition that the said law does not impair the guarantees provided for in the Convention, the Committee wishes to underline the principle it has expressed on numerous occasions that a free trade union movement cannot develop in a system which does not guarantee fundamental rights, and especially the right of workers who are members of a union to meet on union premises, the right to free expression of opinion whether verbally or in writing, and the right of workers who are union members to be protected, in case of detention, by the guarantees of due legal process, which should be initiated as soon as possible. Similarly, the Committee would recall that a climate of violence such as that surrounding the murder or disappearance of trade union leaders is a serious obstacle to the exercise of trade union rights; such acts require stringent measures to be taken by the authorities. As regards the search of trade union premises, the resolution on trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties, adopted by the International Labour Conference at its th Session (), states that the right to effective protection of trade union property is a fundamental civil liberty essential for the normal exercise of trade union rights.
.With respect to the denunciation made by ICFTU concerning the incidents that occurred on  July  during a mass meeting organised by the Workers' Union of the Social Security Institute, the Committee takes note of the Government's information to the effect that it condemns this type of action and that the action in question is, in its opinion, part of the politico-military plans of an organisation bent on destabilising the Government. The Committee notes that the complainant's allegations and the comments of the Government give a contradictory version of events. It would recall that, in the past, when unrest broke out leading to loss of life and/or serious injuries, it had pointed out that the instigation of independent judicial inquiries by the government concerned is a particularly effective method for elucidating all the facts, determining responsibilities, punishing the guilty parties and preventing the repetition of such acts.
.Lastly, the Committee notes that the Government has not supplied its observations on the allegation made by the FUSS on  April  concerning the bomb attack against the trade union leader Marta Castaneda and her son, or on the alleged persecution of the trade unionist Marta Alicia Sigenza.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:a) The Committee must once again deeply regret that the Government has not sent all the information requested on the pending allegations.b) The Committee once again requests the Government to set up a judicial inquiry into the disappearance of Elsy Mrquez and Jos Snchez Gallegos, and expresses the hope that it will be possible to throw light on the fate of these trade union leaders in the near future (Case No. ).c) With regard to the detention and/or proceedings against the trade unionists Ral Baires, Francisco Gmez Calles, Jos Vidal Cortez, Luis Adalberto Daz, Hctor Fernndez, Hctor Hernndez, Jorge Hernndez, Carlos Bonilla Ortiz, Silvestre Ortiz, Maximiliano Montoya Pineda, Ral Alfaro Pleitez, Roberto Portillo, Antonio Quintanilla, Santos Serrano, Auricio Alejandro Valenzuela, Ren Pompillo Vazquez, Manuel de la Paz Villalta and Jos Alfredo Cruz Vivas (Case No. ), the Committee requests the Government to provide additional information on their arrest, explaining the specific charges against them, the status of the proceedings and whether they are being held in custody at present or not (Case No. ).d) The Committee requests the Government to supply additional information on the alleged murder of the trade unionists Francisco Mndez and Marco Antonio Orantes, and to carry out a judicial inquiry into this matter. The Committee also requests information on the progress of the trial concerning the murder of the trade union leader Jos Arstides Meja (Case No. ).e) The Committee requests the Government to provide additional information on the arrests of Adalberto Martnez ( June ), Andrs Miranda ( June ), Gregorio Aguilln Ventura ( February ), and Jos Antonio Rodrguez ( August ); as well as on the raid on the premises of ANDES and confiscation of its documents by armed forces on  April , and the dismissal of six union leaders in the telecommunications sector as the result of a strike called on  April .f) With regard to the incidents that occurred on  July  between military and police forces and workers of the Social Security Institute, the Committee deeply deplores violent acts of this kind and urges the Government to instigate an independent judicial inquiry with a view to determining responsibilities, punishing the guilty parties and preventing the repetition of such acts, and also to keep the Committee informed of any steps taken to open a judicial investigation.g) Lastly, the Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the allegations made by the complainants on  and  April .
.The Committee last examined these cases at its February  meeting, in the light of information obtained during a direct contacts mission conducted in El Salvador from  to  January . (See rd Report of the Committee, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session (February-March ).)
.The Committee had already examined Case No.  at its meetings in November , November , November , May  and May  (see th, th, th, th and th Reports of the Committee); Case No.  at its meetings in November , November , May  and May  (see th, th, th and th Reports of the Committee); Case No.  at its meetings in November , November , May  and May  (see th, th, th and th Reports of the Committee); Case No.  at its meetings in May  and May  (see th and th Reports of the Committee); and Case No.  at its meeting in November  (see th Report of the Committee).
.Since these cases were last examined by the Committee, new allegations have been submitted by the following organisations: the World Confederation of Organisations of the Teaching Profession ( May ), the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions ( May and  June ), the World Federation of Trade Unions ( May ) and the United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador ( June,  and  July,  September,  October and  December ). The Government submitted certain observations in communications dated  July,  August and  September ,  and  January,  and  February and  April",0,1982,El Salvador
273,".
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee notes with concern that since the last examination of the case, the complainant organisations have submitted extremely serious allegations concerning the death and arrest of trade union officials and trade unionists, the searching of the headquarters of a trade union organisation and various actions of interference and anti-trade union discrimination.
.The Committee notes that the trial concerning the murder of the trade union official Jos Aristides Mndez has been opened and that the presumed authors of the crime have been identified and arrested. The Committee nevertheless notes that in referring to the other two cases, the Government has merely pointed out that the trade unionist Francisco Mndez is not on the lists of forensic tests carried out and that the security forces know nothing about the death or disappearance of the trade union leader Marco Antonio Orantes, although investigations are still under way. The Committee stresses the importance of carrying out a judicial investigation in all cases with a view to elucidating the facts, determining the responsibilities and punishing the guilty parties if it is proven that offences have been committed. Furthermore, the Committee notes that with respect to the alleged murder of Toms Rosales and the injuries allegedly suffered by Rafael Hernndez, judicial investigations carried out proved that crimes of this nature had not been committed. Finally, the Committee notes that it has not been possible to identify the murderers of Jos Santos Tiznado and Pedro Gonzlez during the trial conducted to this effect and that the trial concerning the death of Rodolfo Viera and two North American trade unionists (Michael Hammer and Mark Pearlman) is still under way.
.As regards the alleged arrests of trade union officials and trade unionists, the Committee notes the release of Victor Manuel Martnez, Francisco Palacios, Febe Elizabeth Velsquez, Etelvina Snchez Vsquez, Adela Margarita Navarrete, David Rolando Oliva and Juan Gilberto Durn. As charges against those concerned were dropped and bearing in mind the general grounds for arrest communicated by the Government in some cases against the persons concerned, the Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that measures of detention which restrict the exercise of trade union rights can give rise to a climate of intimidation and fear prejudicial to the normal exercise of trade union activities (see, for example, rd Report, Cases Nos.  and  (El Salvador), paras.  and ) and that when this is connected with activities in the defence of the interests of workers, it constitutes a serious interference with civil liberties in general and with trade union rights in particular (see, for example, rd Report, Case No.  (El Salvador), para. ).
.Furthermore, the Committee notes that the Government pointed out that Jos Edgar Gmez Guerrero, Cecilio Guzmn Prez, Leonel Arvalo Morales, Jaime Ernesto Martnez Menjvar, Andrs Valiente and Celso Antonio Rivas Henrquez were arrested and put on trial on charges of belonging to terrorist groups. The Government also mentioned the trial of Daniel Rosaide Cullar and Rafael Vsquez Fabin without going into further detail. The Committee requests the Government to give information on this and, in particular, to indicate the specific facts with which all the trade unionists mentioned above are charged so that it might examine the allegations in full knowledge of the facts. The Committee also requests the complainant organisations to supply additional information on the circumstances surrounding these arrests. Finally, the Committee notes that the name of Santos Ventura is not on the lists of detained persons, that Jos Antonio Garca Hernndez and Julio Hernndez Rojas are being detained on the charge of murdering a trade union official and that the Government has not replied specifically to the allegations concerning the arrest of Gregorio Aguilln Ventura ( February ), Adalberto Martnez ( June ), Andrs Miranda ( June ), Jos Antonio Rodrguez ( August ), and the arrest of the  trade unionists mentioned in paragraph  of the rd Report.
.The Committee also notes that, according to the Government, no public security body knows anything about the arrest of the trade union officials Elsy Mrquez and Jos Snchez Gallegos. In view of the allegations that these persons are missing, the Committee repeats its request that a judicial inquiry should be carried out to ascertain their whereabouts.
.As regards the allegation that the registration of the most representative executive committee of the Textile Workers' Trade Union of Industras Unidas SA was refused, the Committee notes the Government's comments, according to which various general assemblies were held one after the other and that, apart from one case, irregularities had occurred. The Committee considers that in the present case it does not have enough information at its disposal to be able to come to a decision on this matter. However, it notes that there is a possibility that there might be grounds to initiate legal proceedings and that this right does not seem to have been exercised.
.Finally, the Committee regrets that the Government has not replied to the allegations concerning the raid of the ANDES premises on  April  by the armed forces, who took away documents such as the list of members; it also failed to mention the dismissal of six union officials in the telecommunications sector because of the strike of  April .
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:a) The Committee is conscious of the difficult situation that the country is going through; however, it considers it necessary to request from the Government the information referred to below so as to be able to reach conclusions in full knowledge of all the facts raised in the allegations and in the light of the situation prevailing in the country.b) The Committee requests the Government to provide additional information on the alleged murders of the trade unionists Francisco Mndez and Marco Antonio Orantes (Case No. ), and to carry out a judicial inquiry into this matter. The Committee also requests the Government to provide information on developments in the trials concerning the murder of trade union official Jos Aristides Meja (Case No. ) and the murder of Rodolfo Viera and the two North American trade unionists, Michael Hammer and Mark Pearlman (Case No. ). As regards this last point, the Committee regrets that, despite the time which has elapsed since the murders, a final judgement has not been handed down.c) The Committee requests the Government to carry out a judicial inquiry into the disappearance of Elsy Mrquez and Jos Snchez Gallegos (Case No. ) and expresses the hope that this will ascertain their whereabouts.d) The Committee requests the Government to provide additional information on the trade unionists who are still detained and/or being tried, indicating, in particular, the specific facts with which they are charged (Cases Nos.  and ). It also requests the complainant organisations to supply additional information on the circumstances surrounding the arrests of those concerned.e) The Committee requests the Government to comment on the allegations to which it has not replied, which are referred to in the previous paragraph.
.At its February  meeting the Committee on Freedom of Association was informed that the Government of El Salvador was ready to accept a direct contacts mission to examine the various aspects of Cases Nos. , , , , , , , ,  and , noted this information with interest and expressed the hope that, upon receipt of confirmation from the Government, arrangements could be made at an early date for such a mission to take place (see th Report of the Committee, para. , approved by the Governing Board at its th Session (February-March )).
.During the visit of the Director-General of the ILO to El Salvador in May , he proposed a direct contacts mission to His Excellency the President of the Republic, in conformity with the decision adopted by the Committee on Freedom of Association at its February  meeting regarding the complaints pending against El Salvador. n this occasion the President stated that, although he had not requested an ILO mission, he did not reject the direct contact; mission proposed, and indicated that the country opened its doors to the ILO mission.
.In its th Report (May ), approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (May-June ), the Committee took the following decision in connection with the cases relating to El Salvador: ""As regards the cases relating to El Salvador (Cases Nos. , , , , , , ,  and ), the Committee notes that following an official visit by the Director-General to the country, the Government is willing to accept a direct contacts mission with a view to examining the various aspects of these cases. The Committee hopes that the necessary arrangements will be able to be made shortly so that this mission can take place as soon as possible.""
.In a communication",0,1982,El Salvador
274,"received on  November  the Salvadorian Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the ILO that the direct contacts mission could visit the country.
.The Director-General of the ILO appointed Mr. Andrs Aguilar, member and former president of the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights and member of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights as his representative to conduct the mission. The mission took place in San Salvador from  to  January . During the mission the Director-General's representative was accompanied by Mr. Alberto Odero, member of the Freedom of Association Branch of the International Labour Standards Department, and Mr. Luis Zamudio, Regional Adviser on Standards.
.The mission was received by the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare, His Excellency Miguel Alejandro Gallegos, by Dr. Lzaro Tadeo Bernal Lizama, Vice Minister of Labour and Social Welfare, and Dr. Antonio Lara Gavidia, Head of the International Affairs Department of the Ministry, by the members of the Labour and Social Welfare Committee of the Legislative Assembly, by senior officials of the Ministry of Justice, and by representatives of employers"" and workers' organisations.
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the first place, the Committee wishes to thank Mr. Andrs Aguilar for having agreed to carry out the direct contacts mission, as well as for his detailed report on the pending cases, which has allowed the Committee to examine them. The Committee considers that the report of the Director-General's representative attests to the usefulness of missions of this kind in clarifying matters arising from allegations by the complainant organisations.
.Since the content of the allegations and the information supplied by the Government, as well as the information obtained by the Director-General's representative during the mission are contained in the mission report (see Annex), the Committee can proceed directly to formulate its conclusions on the various cases.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:General recommendations(a) The Committee takes note of the report of the Director-General's representative on the mission carried out in El Salvador from  to  January . The Committee also notes that the mission enjoyed full freedom of action and movement and that the authorities of the Ministries of Labour and Justice with which it came into contact gave it every facility and co-operated actively in obtaining the information requested by the Committee on Freedom of Association.(b) The Committee notes that, according to the mission report, although there has been a marked drop in the frequency of attempts on lives and physical integrity and in the number of disappearances and arrests of persons connected with the trade union movement since the elections of May , there is continued insecurity.(c) The Committee also notes that the mission ascertained that a wide variety of trade union organisations representing all tendencies exist and operate in the country and that they play an active and militant role in national life and resort to strikes. The organisations having recourse to such action include public-sector workers' organisations, despite the fact that such action is illegal for this category of workers. Nevertheless, according to the mission report, trade union activities are often conducted in an atmosphere of fear which has an unfavourable effect on their exercise, and according to the organisations interviewed, such activities are viewed with hostility in many employers' circles - particularly in the private sector - which oppose the formation of organisations and the exercise of their rights.(d) In general, the Committee concludes from the mission report that there is still a need to make much progress in El Salvador to achieve genuine respect for human rights in general and trade union rights in particular. The Committee notes that according to the authorities of the Ministry of Labour, this is one of the main objectives of Government policy, and concrete measures to this effect have been and are being taken.(e) While the Committee is aware of the serious difficulties El Salvador is facing, it calls on the Government to adopt appropriate measures to guarantee that trade union rights may be exercised in a normal fashion; this will only be possible in conditions in which fundamental human rights are respected and in a climate free of violence, pressures and threats of any kind.Cases Nos. , ,  and (a) The Committee regrets that the proceedings relative to the homicide of Manuel Antonio and Jos Antonio Carrillo Vzquez and of Santiago Hernndez have failed to identify those responsible for the crime, and that they have been dropped.(b) The Committee requests the Government to take steps with a view to the opening of an investigation into the alleged homicide of Toms Rosales, Jos Santos Tiznado and Pedro Gonzlez, in respect of whom there is no record of proceedings having been opened. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments concerning the disappearance of the trade union leader Rafael Hernndez Olivo, as well as of the final outcome of the proceedings concerning the wilful homicide of the trade unionists Rodolfo Viera, Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer, indicating whether the investigation has been able to establish who instigated the crime committed by the two defendants.Case No. (a) The Committee regrets that the trade unionist Marta Imelda Dimas remained in prison for over two months.(b) The Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that the detention of trade unionists for trade union activities or membership is contrary to the principles of freedom of association.Case No. (a) The Committee requests the Government to undertake an investigation to determine the whereabouts of the trade union leaders Elsy Mrquez and Jos Snchez Gallegos, and to keep it informed thereof.(b) The Committee notes that some of the trade unionists mentioned by the complainants are free, and awaits the information promised by the Government concerning another  trade unionists whose arrest has been alleged and whose names are listed in the conclusions (concerning these  trade unionists, the Government reported that none of the persons listed is at present imprisoned in any of the detention centres in the country, but that further investigations will be carried out to determine whether they had been imprisoned at some stage in police centres).Case No. (a) As regards the murder of trade union leader Juan Pablo Meja Rodriguez, the Committee notes that proceedings have reached the stage of examination of witnesses, and that no one has yet been arrested. The Committee deeply regrets the murder of this trade union leader and requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in the proceedings.(b) While noting that all of the trade union leaders whose detention had been alleged in connection with this case are now free, the Committee none the less recalls that some of them were detained for trade union activities, and draws the Government's attention to the fact that the detention of trade union leaders or members for reasons connected with their activities in defence of the interests of workers constitutes serious interference with civil liberties in general and with trade union rights in particular.Case No. (a) The Committee points to the principle that all workers' organisations have the right to affiliate with international organisations of workers implies the right of national and international trade union organisations to maintain contact with one another, without interference by the public authorities.(b) While noting that the judicial authority dropped the charges against Modesto Rodriguez and Elsy Esperanza Alvarenga, the Committee deplores their detention and draws the Government's attention to the fact that the detention of trade union leaders and members against whom no specific charges are retained restricts the exercise of trade union rights, and that such measures can give rise to a climate of intimidation and fear prejudicial to the normal exercise of trade union activities.Case No. (a) The Committee observes that the Government has not sent observations on the alleged murder of the trade union leader Marco Antonio Orantes. Faced with this very serious situation and while deeply regretting the murder of this trade union leader, the Committee requests the Government to send its observations on this matter, indicating in particular whether any proceedings have been instituted and if so, their current status.(b) The Committee concludes that the judicial decision declaring the strike in the Salvadorian Social Security Institute illegal and ordering the removal of those occupying its premises does not constitute a violation of the principles of freedom of association, inasmuch as the Institute is engaged in medical and health-care services. The Committee regrets the death of several members of the public security forces and some insured persons, and notes that, according to the Government and contrary to what the complainants maintain, none of the dead or wounded were members of the trade union organisations involved.(c) The Committee notes that the judicial authority dropped the charges against four of the trade union leaders whose detention had been alleged, but regrets their detention",2,1982,El Salvador
275,"and draws the Government's attention to the fact that the detention of trade union leaders and members against whom no specific charges are retained restricts the exercise of trade union rights and that such measures can give rise to a climate of intimidation and fear prejudicial to the normal exercise of trade union activities.Case No. (a) The Committee requests the Government to take conciliatory measures with a view to promoting a climate of reconciliation and understanding between the Servipronto S.A. undertaking and its trade union enabling the resolution of current problems concerning the guarantees for the exercise of trade union rights, and an examination of the possibility of reinstating the trade union leader Israel Snchez Cruz, a measure that would undoubtedly contribute to more harmonious labour relations.(b) The Committee wishes to point out in general that in the event of a strike the authorities should resort to the use of force only when law and order are seriously threatened.
.The complaint presented by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) on  July  is concerned mainly with the death on  June  of Toms Rosales, a leader of the workers' union Granja Santa Ins, and the wounding of four other trade unionists during clashes with the armed forces which occurred in connection with a peaceful strike called by them in support of a number of wage claims.
.From the outset the Government, although it transmitted no comments on this case, refuted none of these allegations and on  September  furnished information to the effect that Carlos Hernndez, another trade union leader, had been arrested on  June , the day of the strike, for disturbing the peace and threatening to damage the installations of the undertaking and had been released on  June .
.Thereafter, in other communications, the Government never denied the facts alleged by the complainant organisation but did not transmit, as requested by the Committee, its observations concerning the death of Toms Rosales and the wounds inflicted on four other trade unionists on  June  during a peaceful strike at the Granja Santa Ins.
.The Committee observes, however, that in its communication of  January  the Government denies any knowledge of the facts alleged, according to a report of the Ministry of Defence and Public Safety contained in Note No.  dated  June .
.The Committee keenly regrets that the Government has not supplied specific information on this case, which has been requested several times and it recalls that a free and independent trade union movement can develop only where fundamental human rights are respected. It can only deplore the existence of situations in which trade unionists are killed or wounded in the performance of their trade union functions and in particular when engaged in peaceful strikes. It draws the Government's attention to the urgent need to take active measures to prevent in the future any loss of human life in similar situations.
.The complaint of the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) concerned the murder of trade union leaders. In a communication of  April  the WCL reported that Jos Santos Tiznado and Pedro Gonzlez, the leaders of the Salvadorian Peasants' Central, had been murdered by uniformed members of the National Guard in the Jess Suburb of San Ramn, Department of Cuscatln, at midnight on  May . In addition Manuel Antonio Carillo and Jos Antonio Carillo, former leaders of the Salvadorian Peasants' Central and members of the El Rosario Agricultural and Consumers Limited, had been murdered by agents of repressive forces on  June ; this, said the complainant organisation, was proved by the calibre of the bullets found near their bodies. In addition, Rafael Hernndez Olivo, Secretary-General of the Irrigation and Drainage Section of the National Association of Workers in the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry (ANTMAG), had been taken to Metapn Hospital after being injured in an accident, had subsequently been arrested by the rural police and had since disappeared.
.Successive items of information transmitted by the Government showed that investigations were being made into the murder of these four peasants and the disappearance of the Secretary-General of ANTMAG. The Government had never denied the facts but had not supplied specific information on the circumstances surrounding the death of Jos Santos Tiznado, Pedro Gonzlez, Manuel Antonio Carillo or Jos Antonio Carillo or the disappearance of Rafael Hernndez Olivo. In May  the Committee urged the Government to supply such information without delay. In addition it drew attention to the importance it attached to the holding of an independent judicial inquiry when there was loss of human life.
.As in the previous case, the Committee notes that the Government, in its communication of  January last, declares that the Ministry of Defence and Public Safety knows nothing whatsoever about the death of these persons and that Rafael Hernndez is not, to its knowledge, detained by any unit of the forces of public safety according to information received in Note No.  of  February  which contains a report from the Ministry in question.
.The Committee draws attention to the contradiction between the earlier information and this last communication, inasmuch as it was stated previously that investigations into these murders were under way. The Committee again emphasises the need to ensure that justice punishes the guilty parties and for the Government to keep it informed of the results of the investigation and any penalties imposed. In addition it urges the Government to supply precise information on these events and, in particular, on the fate of Rafael Hernndez Olivo.
.In this case, on  January  the ICFTU denounced the assassination on  January , of Rodolfo Viera, Secretary-General of the Salvadorian Communal Union, and of two American trade unionists, Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer, representatives of the AFL-CIO in El Salvador, while staying at the Hotel Sheraton in San Salvador where they were working on an agrarian reform programme to improve living and working conditions in rural areas.
.In June , the Government stated that a trial was being held in the Fifth Criminal Court of San Salvador and that the accused, Ernesto Sol Meza, had been released by order of the Supreme Court after submitting an appeal, and that the other accused, Hans Krist, had been acquitted. The Committee therefore urged the Government to pursue actively its investigations into the case and to send it the text of any judgment handed down.
.The Government, in its communication of  March , repeated the same information but added that judgment had been delivered in the proceedings against other accused persons who were deemed to have been material perpetrators of the crime, but that the parties had lodged appeals.
.The Government states in its communication of  January  that the Second Criminal Chamber of the First Section of the Central Court delivered on appeal a ruling dated  April  pursuant to sections  and  of the Code of Criminal Procedure of which the Government supplies an extract. This ruling upholds the dismissal, by order of the Supreme Court dated  December , of the charges against Ernesto Sol Meza and Hans Krist after they had lodged their application therefore; it confirms the judgment delivered against the accused Jos Dimas Valle Acevedo and Santiago Gmez Gonzlez, from which they had appealed, and stays execution with a reservation in favour of Lieutenant Lpez Sibrian; it vacates the order for the detention of Hans Krist and Lpez Sibrian for lack of grounds; it orders that the statement made by the Prosecutor of the Chamber in his reply to the accusations concerning the accused Lpez Sibrian should be reported to the Supreme Court.
.The Committee takes note of this information and notes in particular that a sentence has been handed down against the persons deemed to have been material perpetrators of the crime, namely Jos Dimas Valle Acevedo and Santiago Gmez Gonzlez. It requests the Government to continue to send it information on the final outcome of this case and to inform it in particular whether the investigation has managed to identify the instigator or instigators of the crime.
.The Trade Unions International of Transport Workers, in its communication of  August , alleged that several trade union activists including Alejandro Martinez Alvarado had been wrongfully arrested by the police at the premises of the""Transport Workers' Trade Union on  August . After the Committee had examined the case in November , the question of the detention of Mr. Martinez Alvarado remained pending; the Government stated that he had been arrested by the police on  August  and detained at ""La Esperanza"" Penitentiary Centre in the Canton of San Luis Mariona. The Government later indicated that this trade unionist had been in custody at the Central Penitentiary by order of the military examining magistrate since  August  and had been prosecuted under Decree No. , which contains provisions concerning procedure in case of offences against the peace and independence of the State and against international law.
.In a communication of  April",1,1982,El Salvador
276," the complainant organisation supplied additional allegations concerning Marta Imelda Dimas, the secretary of the trade union, who had also been in prison since  October , and further alleged that the Government had arrested Jorge Benjamin Rodriguez, Disputes Secretary of the same trade union, on  February .
.At its previous examination of the case, in May-June , the Committee noted with grave concern that Alejandro Martinez Alvarado had been in custody without trial since August . The Committee also observed that, according to the Government, this trade unionist was being prosecuted for offences against the peace and independence of the State and against international law but that the Government had communicated no information about the specific acts of which he was accused; according to the complainants, on the other hand, the person in question had been arrested without justification - along with others who had since been released - by the police at the premises of the Transport Workers' Trade Union.
.The Committee also noted that the trade unionists Marta Imelda Dimas and Jorge Benjamin Rodriguez were reported to have been in prison since October  and February  respectively, and the Committee requested the Government to communicate its observations in this regard.
.In its telegram of  June  the Government mentions that Alejandro Martinez Alvarado has been released under a Legislative Decree of amnesty. It repeats this information in its telegram of  June and adds that Jorge Benjamin Rodriguez has also been released under the same law. In its communication of  January last, the Government explains that Alejandro Martinez Alvarado was released under the amnesty law adopted by the Government of El Salvador on  May .
.The Committee, while noting the release of the two above-mentioned trade unionists under the amnesty law of  May , observes that the Government supplies no information concerning Marta Imelda Dimas, the union secretary, who according to the complainant organisation has been in prison since  October .
.Consequently, the Committee urges the Government to supply precise information concerning the detention in which this trade unionist has been held for many months and to state the specific acts with which she is charged. The Committee requests that this person be released or tried as soon as possible by an impartial and independent judicial authority, and asks the Government to keep it informed of developments in the situation.
.In this case the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) reported on  October  that the following trade union leaders had been arrested or had disappeared during October : Silvestre Ortz, treasurer of a sugar refinery trade union, arrested on  October; Daniel Avalos, leader of the trade union of a dairy products undertaking, and Pablo Ramrez Cornejo, leader of the Industrial Workers' Trade Union, both arrested on  October; Ral Antonio Castro Palomares, secretary of the Federation of the Unions of Workers in the Food, Clothing, Textile and Allied Industries arrested at his home on  October; Hctor Hernndez, second secretary of SETRAS, imprisoned by the rural police; and Berta Alicia Cosme of the FENASTRAS trade union, who had disappeared on  October. In a supplementary letter dated  May , the WFTU also referred to many other arrests and disappearances of persons, a list of whom is supplied as an annex to this case.
.With its letter of  March  the Government transmitted a photocopy of a note from the Ministry of Defence and Public Safety (Note No.  of  February  signed by Colonel Ren E. Auerbach) in which this officer admitted that Daniel de Jess Avalos de Paz, Pablo Cornejo Ramirez and Ral Antonio Castro Palomares had been arrested by the police, the first two on  October and the third on  October. These three persons were being detained by order of the competent court, Ral Antonio Castro Palomares being at the Mariona Penal Centre.
.In a communication of  March  the Government stated further that Berta Alicia Cosme, known as Berta, had been arrested in October  with other persons who, like her, were accused of being members or leaders of organisations engaged in terrorist activities, and that they were being held by order of the judge because the proceedings against them were at the preliminary investigation stage.
.The Committee, while expressing its concern at the length of time for which these trade unionists had been kept in detention pending trial, considered in May-June  that the Government ought to take steps to ensure that the persons mentioned in the complainants' communications of  October  and  May  be released or, if charges were being preferred against them, brought before the courts. The Committee further requested the Government to supply detailed information concerning the fate of those persons.
.By a telegram of  June  the Government reported that Ral Antonio Castro Palomares, Pablo Cornejo Ramrez, Alicia Cosme, known as Berta, and Pedro Ramirez Esquivel had been released under the Legislative Decree of amnesty of  May . This information was enlarged upon in the communication of  January , in which the Government states that, according to the report of the Ministry of Defence and Public Safety, Ral Antonio Castro Palomares had indeed been amnestied on  May , Pablo Cornejo Ramirez on  May , Berta Alicia Cosme on  May  and Antonio Campos Mendoza on  August , and that Daniel de Jess Avalos de Paz had been released under a ruling of the Supreme Court of Justice on  May .
.The Committee, while taking note of this information, observes with deep concern that in this case most of the persons mentioned by the complainants remain in custody since October , or are still missing, and that no explanation of their fate has been provided by the Government. The Government stated in its telegram of  June  that, generally speaking, the annexed list was made up of trade unionists detained for criminal offences and awaiting trial for acts carrying penalties of more than four years' imprisonment. The Government states that it respects fully human rights but that persons involved in activities running counter to the rights and freedoms of the people of El Salvador as recognised in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights could not be exonerated under the basic domestic legislation.
.In these circumstances the Committee urges the Government to keep it informed in detail on the situation of all these trade unionists; to communicate to the Committee its observations on the specific acts with which these persons are charged and the text of the judgments concerning them; and to provide details as to the fate of those who are missing.
.The Committee keenly deplores the fact that, in all the cases examined above, a very violent situation has resulted in the death, wounding or arrest of trade unionists in circumstances which, in the absence of specific and detailed information, are difficult for it to assess. The Committee emphasises that such a climate of violence is unpropitious for the development not only of industrial relations but also of a free and independent trade union movement inasmuch as, for such a movement to develop, fundamental human rights must be respected.
.The Committee points out that, when cases of this nature - namely, of detention under emergency regulations - have been referred to it, it has always [see, for example, Fourth Report, Case No.  (United Kingdom/Malaya), para.  stressed the importance which it attaches to all detained persons receiving a fair trial at the earliest possible moment. The Committee considers that measures of preventive detention should be limited to very short periods intended solely to facilitate the course of a judicial inquiry. [See rd Report, Case No.  (Argentina), para. .]
.The complaint presented by the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) is contained in a telegram dated  October . The WFTU supplied additional information in support of its complaint in a letter of  May . The Government transmitted certain observations in letters dated  and  March .
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communications, the WFTU denounces the arrest or disappearance in October  of the following trade union leaders: Silvestre Ortiz, treasurer of a sugar refinery trade union, arrested on  October, Daniel Avalos, leader of the trade union of dairy products undertaking, and Pablo Ramirez Cornejo, leader of the trade union of industrial workers, both arrested on  October, Paul Antonio Castro Palomares, secretary of the Federation of the Unions of Workers in the Food, Clothing, Textile and Allied industries, arrested at his residence on  October, Hector Hernandez, second secretary of SETRAS, imprisoned by the rural police, and Berta Alicia Cosme of the trade union FENASTRAS who disappeared on  October. The WFTU also refers to numerous other arrests and disappearances of persons whose names are supplied.
.With its letter dated ",-1,1982,El Salvador
277,"March , the Government includes the photocopy of a note from the Ministry of Defence and Public Security (Note No.  of  February  signed by Colonel Ren E. Auerbach) in which this officer confirms that Daniel de Jesus Avalos de Paz, Pablo Cornejo Ramirez and Paul Antonio Castro Palomares were arrested by the police, the first two on  October and the third on  October. These three persons are being detained on the instructions of the competent judge and the third is being held at the penal centre of Mariona.
.In its communication dated  March , the Government states furthermore that Verta Alicia Cosme Soto, whose pseudonym is Berta, was arrested with other persons in October  and all of whom have been accused of being members and leaders of organisations engaged in terrorist activities and that they are being held on the instructions of the judge since their trials are now at the stage of preliminary investigation.
.As regards this case the Committee notes with concern that the Government admits that most of the trade union leaders whose names have been mentioned by the complainants have been held in prison since October  and that their trials are at the stage of preliminary investigation.
.Consequently, the Committee considers that the Government should take steps to ensure that the persons mentioned in the complainant's communications of October  and May  are released or brought to trial if charges are brought against them. In the latter case, the Committee requests the Government to supply detailed information on the fate of these persons, including the specific charges made against them and in particular the specific acts of which they are accused, the text of the judgements concerning them and details or the whereabouts of the persons who are said to have disappeared.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present interim report and in particular the following conclusions:(a) The Committee notes with concern that several trade union leaders whose names have been mentioned by the complainant organisation have been held in prison without trial since October .(b) The Committee considers that the Government should take steps to ensure that the persons mentioned by the complainant in its communications of October  and May  are released or brought to trial if charges are brought against them. In the latter case, the Committee requests the Government to supply detailed information on the fate of these persons, including the specific charges brought against them and the specific acts of which they are accused, the text of the judgements concerning these persons and on the whereabouts of the persons who are said to have disappeared.",-1,1982,El Salvador
278,".At its February  meeting the Committee on Freedom of Association was informed that the Government of El Salvador was ready to accept a direct contacts mission to examine the various aspects of Cases Nos. , , , , , , , ,  and , noted this information with interest and expressed the hope that, upon receipt of confirmation from the Government, arrangements could be made at an early date for such a mission to take place (see th Report of the Committee, para. , approved by the Governing Board at its th Session (February-March )).
.During the visit of the Director-General of the ILO to El Salvador in May , he proposed a direct contacts mission to His Excellency the President of the Republic, in conformity with the decision adopted by the Committee on Freedom of Association at its February  meeting regarding the complaints pending against El Salvador. n this occasion the President stated that, although he had not requested an ILO mission, he did not reject the direct contact; mission proposed, and indicated that the country opened its doors to the ILO mission.
.In its th Report (May ), approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (May-June ), the Committee took the following decision in connection with the cases relating to El Salvador: ""As regards the cases relating to El Salvador (Cases Nos. , , , , , , ,  and ), the Committee notes that following an official visit by the Director-General to the country, the Government is willing to accept a direct contacts mission with a view to examining the various aspects of these cases. The Committee hopes that the necessary arrangements will be able to be made shortly so that this mission can take place as soon as possible.""
.In a communication received on  November  the Salvadorian Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the ILO that the direct contacts mission could visit the country.
.The Director-General of the ILO appointed Mr. Andrs Aguilar, member and former president of the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights and member of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights as his representative to conduct the mission. The mission took place in San Salvador from  to  January . During the mission the Director-General's representative was accompanied by Mr. Alberto Odero, member of the Freedom of Association Branch of the International Labour Standards Department, and Mr. Luis Zamudio, Regional Adviser on Standards.
.The mission was received by the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare, His Excellency Miguel Alejandro Gallegos, by Dr. Lzaro Tadeo Bernal Lizama, Vice Minister of Labour and Social Welfare, and Dr. Antonio Lara Gavidia, Head of the International Affairs Department of the Ministry, by the members of the Labour and Social Welfare Committee of the Legislative Assembly, by senior officials of the Ministry of Justice, and by representatives of employers"" and workers' organisations.
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the first place, the Committee wishes to thank Mr. Andrs Aguilar for having agreed to carry out the direct contacts mission, as well as for his detailed report on the pending cases, which has allowed the Committee to examine them. The Committee considers that the report of the Director-General's representative attests to the usefulness of missions of this kind in clarifying matters arising from allegations by the complainant organisations.
.Since the content of the allegations and the information supplied by the Government, as well as the information obtained by the Director-General's representative during the mission are contained in the mission report (see Annex), the Committee can proceed directly to formulate its conclusions on the various cases.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:General recommendations(a) The Committee takes note of the report of the Director-General's representative on the mission carried out in El Salvador from  to  January . The Committee also notes that the mission enjoyed full freedom of action and movement and that the authorities of the Ministries of Labour and Justice with which it came into contact gave it every facility and co-operated actively in obtaining the information requested by the Committee on Freedom of Association.(b) The Committee notes that, according to the mission report, although there has been a marked drop in the frequency of attempts on lives and physical integrity and in the number of disappearances and arrests of persons connected with the trade union movement since the elections of May , there is continued insecurity.(c) The Committee also notes that the mission ascertained that a wide variety of trade union organisations representing all tendencies exist and operate in the country and that they play an active and militant role in national life and resort to strikes. The organisations having recourse to such action include public-sector workers' organisations, despite the fact that such action is illegal for this category of workers. Nevertheless, according to the mission report, trade union activities are often conducted in an atmosphere of fear which has an unfavourable effect on their exercise, and according to the organisations interviewed, such activities are viewed with hostility in many employers' circles - particularly in the private sector - which oppose the formation of organisations and the exercise of their rights.(d) In general, the Committee concludes from the mission report that there is still a need to make much progress in El Salvador to achieve genuine respect for human rights in general and trade union rights in particular. The Committee notes that according to the authorities of the Ministry of Labour, this is one of the main objectives of Government policy, and concrete measures to this effect have been and are being taken.(e) While the Committee is aware of the serious difficulties El Salvador is facing, it calls on the Government to adopt appropriate measures to guarantee that trade union rights may be exercised in a normal fashion; this will only be possible in conditions in which fundamental human rights are respected and in a climate free of violence, pressures and threats of any kind.Cases Nos. , ,  and (a) The Committee regrets that the proceedings relative to the homicide of Manuel Antonio and Jos Antonio Carrillo Vzquez and of Santiago Hernndez have failed to identify those responsible for the crime, and that they have been dropped.(b) The Committee requests the Government to take steps with a view to the opening of an investigation into the alleged homicide of Toms Rosales, Jos Santos Tiznado and Pedro Gonzlez, in respect of whom there is no record of proceedings having been opened. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments concerning the disappearance of the trade union leader Rafael Hernndez Olivo, as well as of the final outcome of the proceedings concerning the wilful homicide of the trade unionists Rodolfo Viera, Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer, indicating whether the investigation has been able to establish who instigated the crime committed by the two defendants.Case No. (a) The Committee regrets that the trade unionist Marta Imelda Dimas remained in prison for over two months.(b) The Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that the detention of trade unionists for trade union activities or membership is contrary to the principles of freedom of association.Case No. (a) The Committee requests the Government to undertake an investigation to determine the whereabouts of the trade union leaders Elsy Mrquez and Jos Snchez Gallegos, and to keep it informed thereof.(b) The Committee notes that some of the trade unionists mentioned by the complainants are free, and awaits the information promised by the Government concerning another  trade unionists whose arrest has been alleged and whose names are listed in the conclusions (concerning these  trade unionists, the Government reported that none of the persons listed is at present imprisoned in any of the detention centres in the country, but that further investigations will be carried out to determine whether they had been imprisoned at some stage in police centres).Case No. (a) As regards the murder of trade union leader Juan Pablo Meja Rodriguez, the Committee notes that proceedings have reached the stage of examination of witnesses, and that no one has yet been arrested. The Committee deeply regrets the murder of this trade union leader and requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in the proceedings.(b) While noting that all of the trade union leaders whose detention had been alleged in connection with this case are now free, the Committee none the less recalls that some of them were detained for trade union activities, and draws the Government's attention to the fact that the detention of trade union leaders or members for reasons connected with their activities in defence of the interests of workers constitutes serious interference with civil liberties in general and with trade union rights in particular.Case No. (a) The Committee points to the principle",2,1982,El Salvador
279,"that all workers' organisations have the right to affiliate with international organisations of workers implies the right of national and international trade union organisations to maintain contact with one another, without interference by the public authorities.(b) While noting that the judicial authority dropped the charges against Modesto Rodriguez and Elsy Esperanza Alvarenga, the Committee deplores their detention and draws the Government's attention to the fact that the detention of trade union leaders and members against whom no specific charges are retained restricts the exercise of trade union rights, and that such measures can give rise to a climate of intimidation and fear prejudicial to the normal exercise of trade union activities.Case No. (a) The Committee observes that the Government has not sent observations on the alleged murder of the trade union leader Marco Antonio Orantes. Faced with this very serious situation and while deeply regretting the murder of this trade union leader, the Committee requests the Government to send its observations on this matter, indicating in particular whether any proceedings have been instituted and if so, their current status.(b) The Committee concludes that the judicial decision declaring the strike in the Salvadorian Social Security Institute illegal and ordering the removal of those occupying its premises does not constitute a violation of the principles of freedom of association, inasmuch as the Institute is engaged in medical and health-care services. The Committee regrets the death of several members of the public security forces and some insured persons, and notes that, according to the Government and contrary to what the complainants maintain, none of the dead or wounded were members of the trade union organisations involved.(c) The Committee notes that the judicial authority dropped the charges against four of the trade union leaders whose detention had been alleged, but regrets their detention and draws the Government's attention to the fact that the detention of trade union leaders and members against whom no specific charges are retained restricts the exercise of trade union rights and that such measures can give rise to a climate of intimidation and fear prejudicial to the normal exercise of trade union activities.Case No. (a) The Committee requests the Government to take conciliatory measures with a view to promoting a climate of reconciliation and understanding between the Servipronto S.A. undertaking and its trade union enabling the resolution of current problems concerning the guarantees for the exercise of trade union rights, and an examination of the possibility of reinstating the trade union leader Israel Snchez Cruz, a measure that would undoubtedly contribute to more harmonious labour relations.(b) The Committee wishes to point out in general that in the event of a strike the authorities should resort to the use of force only when law and order are seriously threatened.
.The complaint presented by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) on  July  is concerned mainly with the death on  June  of Toms Rosales, a leader of the workers' union Granja Santa Ins, and the wounding of four other trade unionists during clashes with the armed forces which occurred in connection with a peaceful strike called by them in support of a number of wage claims.
.From the outset the Government, although it transmitted no comments on this case, refuted none of these allegations and on  September  furnished information to the effect that Carlos Hernndez, another trade union leader, had been arrested on  June , the day of the strike, for disturbing the peace and threatening to damage the installations of the undertaking and had been released on  June .
.Thereafter, in other communications, the Government never denied the facts alleged by the complainant organisation but did not transmit, as requested by the Committee, its observations concerning the death of Toms Rosales and the wounds inflicted on four other trade unionists on  June  during a peaceful strike at the Granja Santa Ins.
.The Committee observes, however, that in its communication of  January  the Government denies any knowledge of the facts alleged, according to a report of the Ministry of Defence and Public Safety contained in Note No.  dated  June .
.The Committee keenly regrets that the Government has not supplied specific information on this case, which has been requested several times and it recalls that a free and independent trade union movement can develop only where fundamental human rights are respected. It can only deplore the existence of situations in which trade unionists are killed or wounded in the performance of their trade union functions and in particular when engaged in peaceful strikes. It draws the Government's attention to the urgent need to take active measures to prevent in the future any loss of human life in similar situations.
.The complaint of the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) concerned the murder of trade union leaders. In a communication of  April  the WCL reported that Jos Santos Tiznado and Pedro Gonzlez, the leaders of the Salvadorian Peasants' Central, had been murdered by uniformed members of the National Guard in the Jess Suburb of San Ramn, Department of Cuscatln, at midnight on  May . In addition Manuel Antonio Carillo and Jos Antonio Carillo, former leaders of the Salvadorian Peasants' Central and members of the El Rosario Agricultural and Consumers Limited, had been murdered by agents of repressive forces on  June ; this, said the complainant organisation, was proved by the calibre of the bullets found near their bodies. In addition, Rafael Hernndez Olivo, Secretary-General of the Irrigation and Drainage Section of the National Association of Workers in the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry (ANTMAG), had been taken to Metapn Hospital after being injured in an accident, had subsequently been arrested by the rural police and had since disappeared.
.Successive items of information transmitted by the Government showed that investigations were being made into the murder of these four peasants and the disappearance of the Secretary-General of ANTMAG. The Government had never denied the facts but had not supplied specific information on the circumstances surrounding the death of Jos Santos Tiznado, Pedro Gonzlez, Manuel Antonio Carillo or Jos Antonio Carillo or the disappearance of Rafael Hernndez Olivo. In May  the Committee urged the Government to supply such information without delay. In addition it drew attention to the importance it attached to the holding of an independent judicial inquiry when there was loss of human life.
.As in the previous case, the Committee notes that the Government, in its communication of  January last, declares that the Ministry of Defence and Public Safety knows nothing whatsoever about the death of these persons and that Rafael Hernndez is not, to its knowledge, detained by any unit of the forces of public safety according to information received in Note No.  of  February  which contains a report from the Ministry in question.
.The Committee draws attention to the contradiction between the earlier information and this last communication, inasmuch as it was stated previously that investigations into these murders were under way. The Committee again emphasises the need to ensure that justice punishes the guilty parties and for the Government to keep it informed of the results of the investigation and any penalties imposed. In addition it urges the Government to supply precise information on these events and, in particular, on the fate of Rafael Hernndez Olivo.
.In this case, on  January  the ICFTU denounced the assassination on  January , of Rodolfo Viera, Secretary-General of the Salvadorian Communal Union, and of two American trade unionists, Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer, representatives of the AFL-CIO in El Salvador, while staying at the Hotel Sheraton in San Salvador where they were working on an agrarian reform programme to improve living and working conditions in rural areas.
.In June , the Government stated that a trial was being held in the Fifth Criminal Court of San Salvador and that the accused, Ernesto Sol Meza, had been released by order of the Supreme Court after submitting an appeal, and that the other accused, Hans Krist, had been acquitted. The Committee therefore urged the Government to pursue actively its investigations into the case and to send it the text of any judgment handed down.
.The Government, in its communication of  March , repeated the same information but added that judgment had been delivered in the proceedings against other accused persons who were deemed to have been material perpetrators of the crime, but that the parties had lodged appeals.
.The Government states in its communication of  January  that the Second Criminal Chamber of the First Section of the Central Court delivered on appeal a ruling dated  April  pursuant to sections  and  of the Code of Criminal Procedure of which the Government supplies an extract. This ruling upholds the dismissal, by order of the Supreme Court dated  December , of the charges against Ernesto Sol Meza and Hans Krist after they had lodged their application therefore; it confirms the judgment delivered against the accused Jos",0,1982,El Salvador
280,"Dimas Valle Acevedo and Santiago Gmez Gonzlez, from which they had appealed, and stays execution with a reservation in favour of Lieutenant Lpez Sibrian; it vacates the order for the detention of Hans Krist and Lpez Sibrian for lack of grounds; it orders that the statement made by the Prosecutor of the Chamber in his reply to the accusations concerning the accused Lpez Sibrian should be reported to the Supreme Court.
.The Committee takes note of this information and notes in particular that a sentence has been handed down against the persons deemed to have been material perpetrators of the crime, namely Jos Dimas Valle Acevedo and Santiago Gmez Gonzlez. It requests the Government to continue to send it information on the final outcome of this case and to inform it in particular whether the investigation has managed to identify the instigator or instigators of the crime.
.The Trade Unions International of Transport Workers, in its communication of  August , alleged that several trade union activists including Alejandro Martinez Alvarado had been wrongfully arrested by the police at the premises of the""Transport Workers' Trade Union on  August . After the Committee had examined the case in November , the question of the detention of Mr. Martinez Alvarado remained pending; the Government stated that he had been arrested by the police on  August  and detained at ""La Esperanza"" Penitentiary Centre in the Canton of San Luis Mariona. The Government later indicated that this trade unionist had been in custody at the Central Penitentiary by order of the military examining magistrate since  August  and had been prosecuted under Decree No. , which contains provisions concerning procedure in case of offences against the peace and independence of the State and against international law.
.In a communication of  April  the complainant organisation supplied additional allegations concerning Marta Imelda Dimas, the secretary of the trade union, who had also been in prison since  October , and further alleged that the Government had arrested Jorge Benjamin Rodriguez, Disputes Secretary of the same trade union, on  February .
.At its previous examination of the case, in May-June , the Committee noted with grave concern that Alejandro Martinez Alvarado had been in custody without trial since August . The Committee also observed that, according to the Government, this trade unionist was being prosecuted for offences against the peace and independence of the State and against international law but that the Government had communicated no information about the specific acts of which he was accused; according to the complainants, on the other hand, the person in question had been arrested without justification - along with others who had since been released - by the police at the premises of the Transport Workers' Trade Union.
.The Committee also noted that the trade unionists Marta Imelda Dimas and Jorge Benjamin Rodriguez were reported to have been in prison since October  and February  respectively, and the Committee requested the Government to communicate its observations in this regard.
.In its telegram of  June  the Government mentions that Alejandro Martinez Alvarado has been released under a Legislative Decree of amnesty. It repeats this information in its telegram of  June and adds that Jorge Benjamin Rodriguez has also been released under the same law. In its communication of  January last, the Government explains that Alejandro Martinez Alvarado was released under the amnesty law adopted by the Government of El Salvador on  May .
.The Committee, while noting the release of the two above-mentioned trade unionists under the amnesty law of  May , observes that the Government supplies no information concerning Marta Imelda Dimas, the union secretary, who according to the complainant organisation has been in prison since  October .
.Consequently, the Committee urges the Government to supply precise information concerning the detention in which this trade unionist has been held for many months and to state the specific acts with which she is charged. The Committee requests that this person be released or tried as soon as possible by an impartial and independent judicial authority, and asks the Government to keep it informed of developments in the situation.
.In this case the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) reported on  October  that the following trade union leaders had been arrested or had disappeared during October : Silvestre Ortz, treasurer of a sugar refinery trade union, arrested on  October; Daniel Avalos, leader of the trade union of a dairy products undertaking, and Pablo Ramrez Cornejo, leader of the Industrial Workers' Trade Union, both arrested on  October; Ral Antonio Castro Palomares, secretary of the Federation of the Unions of Workers in the Food, Clothing, Textile and Allied Industries arrested at his home on  October; Hctor Hernndez, second secretary of SETRAS, imprisoned by the rural police; and Berta Alicia Cosme of the FENASTRAS trade union, who had disappeared on  October. In a supplementary letter dated  May , the WFTU also referred to many other arrests and disappearances of persons, a list of whom is supplied as an annex to this case.
.With its letter of  March  the Government transmitted a photocopy of a note from the Ministry of Defence and Public Safety (Note No.  of  February  signed by Colonel Ren E. Auerbach) in which this officer admitted that Daniel de Jess Avalos de Paz, Pablo Cornejo Ramirez and Ral Antonio Castro Palomares had been arrested by the police, the first two on  October and the third on  October. These three persons were being detained by order of the competent court, Ral Antonio Castro Palomares being at the Mariona Penal Centre.
.In a communication of  March  the Government stated further that Berta Alicia Cosme, known as Berta, had been arrested in October  with other persons who, like her, were accused of being members or leaders of organisations engaged in terrorist activities, and that they were being held by order of the judge because the proceedings against them were at the preliminary investigation stage.
.The Committee, while expressing its concern at the length of time for which these trade unionists had been kept in detention pending trial, considered in May-June  that the Government ought to take steps to ensure that the persons mentioned in the complainants' communications of  October  and  May  be released or, if charges were being preferred against them, brought before the courts. The Committee further requested the Government to supply detailed information concerning the fate of those persons.
.By a telegram of  June  the Government reported that Ral Antonio Castro Palomares, Pablo Cornejo Ramrez, Alicia Cosme, known as Berta, and Pedro Ramirez Esquivel had been released under the Legislative Decree of amnesty of  May . This information was enlarged upon in the communication of  January , in which the Government states that, according to the report of the Ministry of Defence and Public Safety, Ral Antonio Castro Palomares had indeed been amnestied on  May , Pablo Cornejo Ramirez on  May , Berta Alicia Cosme on  May  and Antonio Campos Mendoza on  August , and that Daniel de Jess Avalos de Paz had been released under a ruling of the Supreme Court of Justice on  May .
.The Committee, while taking note of this information, observes with deep concern that in this case most of the persons mentioned by the complainants remain in custody since October , or are still missing, and that no explanation of their fate has been provided by the Government. The Government stated in its telegram of  June  that, generally speaking, the annexed list was made up of trade unionists detained for criminal offences and awaiting trial for acts carrying penalties of more than four years' imprisonment. The Government states that it respects fully human rights but that persons involved in activities running counter to the rights and freedoms of the people of El Salvador as recognised in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights could not be exonerated under the basic domestic legislation.
.In these circumstances the Committee urges the Government to keep it informed in detail on the situation of all these trade unionists; to communicate to the Committee its observations on the specific acts with which these persons are charged and the text of the judgments concerning them; and to provide details as to the fate of those who are missing.
.The Committee keenly deplores the fact that, in all the cases examined above, a very violent situation has resulted in the death, wounding or arrest of trade unionists in circumstances which, in the absence of specific and detailed information, are difficult for it to assess. The Committee emphasises that such a climate of violence is unpropitious for the development not only of industrial relations but also of a free and independent trade union movement inasmuch as, for such a movement to develop, fundamental human rights must be respected.
.The Committee points out",-1,1982,El Salvador
281,"that, when cases of this nature - namely, of detention under emergency regulations - have been referred to it, it has always [see, for example, Fourth Report, Case No.  (United Kingdom/Malaya), para.  stressed the importance which it attaches to all detained persons receiving a fair trial at the earliest possible moment. The Committee considers that measures of preventive detention should be limited to very short periods intended solely to facilitate the course of a judicial inquiry. [See rd Report, Case No.  (Argentina), para. .]
.The Committee already examined this case at its November  Session when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body. The Government subsequently sent a very brief communication dated  March  and the complainant organisation transmitted additional allegations in a letter dated  April . The office has written to the Government to request more detailed information on the matter.
.El Salvador has Lot ratified either the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainant alleged that on  August  the police broke into the transport workers' trade union premises and without any justification detained several trade union activists, including Alejandro Martinez Alvarado. Since the Committee's initial examination of the case, the matter of the detention of Alejandro Martinez Alvarado, whom the Government stated had been arrested by the police on  August and imprisoned in the ""la Esperanza"" penal establishment in the Canton of San Luis Mariona, has remained in abeyance.
.In November , the Committee therefore requested the Government to send detailed information about the charges brought against Alejandro Martinez Alvarado and the text of the judgement to be handed down by the judicial authorities.
.In a communication dated  March , the Government states that Alejandro Martinez Alvarado has been held in the central penitentiary since  August  by order of the military examining magistrate, pursuant to Decree No.  which contains provisions regarding procedure in the case of offences against the peace and independence of the State and against the law of nations - offences which the Government states are covered to by article  of the Constitution.
.In a letter dated  April , the complainant states that, in addition to Alejandro Martinez Alvarado, the secretary of the trade union, Marta Imelda Dimas, has also been in prison since  October . The complainant further alleges that the Government arrested the union's Disputes Secretary, Jorge Benjamin Rodriguez, on  February .
.The Committee notes with grave concern that the trade unionist Alejandro Martinez Alvarado has been held in custody since August  without being brought to trial. It also notes that the trade unionists Marte Imelda Dimas and Jorge Benjamin Rodriguez have allegedly been in prison since October  and February , respectively.
.The Committee observes, in the first place, that the Government states that the trade unionist Alejandro Martinez Alvarado has been charged with offences against the peace and independence of the State and against the law of nations but has not communicated any information on the specific acts of which he is accused. According to the complainant, he was in fact, along with other persons, arrested by the police without any justification on the premises of the transport workers' trade union.
.The Committee further notes that article  of the Constitution reads as follows:When a suspension of constitutional guarantees has been declared, the military tribunals shall have jurisdiction in trying cases of treason, espionage, rebellion, sedition and other offences against the peace or independence of the State or against the law of nations.Cases that are pending before the regular courts at the time constitutional guarantees are suspended shall continue under the jurisdiction of such courts.When constitutional guarantees are re-established, the military tribunals shall continue the trials of cases pending before them.
.In its previous dealings with cases of this nature involving detention under emergency regulations, the Committee has invariably stressed the importance it attaches to all detained persons receiving a fair trial at the earliest possible moment. In the Committee's view, measures of preventive detention must be limited to very short periods intended solely to facilitate the course of a judicial inquiry.,
.The Committee therefore calls upon the Government to bring this trade union activist, who has been imprisoned for almost a year without the Government stating the specific acts with which he is charged, to trial as soon as possible by an impartial and independent judicial authority or to release him. The Committee urges the Government to continue to keep it informed of his situation and to communicate its observations on the specific facts motivating his arrest and the text of the judgement handed down.
.The Committee further requests the Government to communicate its observations on the alleged imprisonment of the two other trade unionists cited by name by the complainant.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:(a) The Committee notes with grave concern that the trade unionist Alejandro Martinez Alvarado has been in preventive detention for almost a year under emergency regulations and calls upon the Government to release him or to bring him to trial as soon as possible by an impartial and independent judicial authority.(b) The Committee urges the Government to continue to keep it informed of the situation of this trade unionist, who has been imprisoned in the central penitentiary since  August , and to communicate its observations on the specific facts motivating his arrest and the text of the judgement handed down.(c) The Committee further requests the Government to communicate its observations on the alleged imprisonment of the two other trade unionists cited by name by the complainant.
.The complaint appears in a communication from the Trade, Unions International of Transport Workers dated  August . The Government replied in a communication dated  October .
.El Salvador has not ratified the freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainant alleges that on  August  the police broke into the transport workers trade union premises and detained without any justification the trade union militants Maximiliano Castro Nava, Hctor Lpez Rivas, Gabriel Argueta, Jorge Rodriguez Dueas and Alejandro Martinez Alvarado.
.The Government declares that the persons referred to by the complainant were apprehended by members of the police on  August at the headquarters of the Trade Union of workers in the Transport, Similar and Allied Industries and handed over to a military examining judge in pursuance of Decree No.  of  December  for possession of communist propaganda. Subsequently, continues the Government, the military judge set them free, with the exception of Alejandro Martinez Alvarado who is imprisoned in the ""La Esperanza"" penal establishment.
.The Committee observes that this case refers to the forcible entry of the headquarters of the Trade Union of workers in the Transport, Similar and Allied Industries (STITSC) and the detention of five trade union leaders.
.The Committee notes that, according to the Government's statement, the trade union leaders in question were apprehended in pursuance of Decree No. , dated  December , for possession of communist propaganda and were subsequently brought before the military judge and set free, with the exception of Alejandro Martinez Alvarado who is now imprisoned. The Committee observes that Decree No.  regulates the judicial proceedings to be followed in respect of certain offences while the constitutional guarantees continue to be suspended.
.In this respect the Committee considers that, even in the extremely grave circumstances which gave rise to the suspension of constitutional guarantees, the detention of trade union leaders or the entry of the police into the headquarters of a trade union without a court warrant should only be possible in cases where there are objective grounds for believing that a crime has been or is about to be committed. Consequently, bearing in mind that the alleged events occurred, as the Government's reply seems to indicate, because of the possession of communist propaganda in the headquarters of the STITSC and bearing in mind, also, that the right to express opinions is one of the essential aspects of trade union rights, the Committee can only express regret at the forcible entry of the headquarters of this trade union and the detention of the four trade union leaders who were subsequently set free.
.As regards the trade union leader Alejandro Martinez Alvarado, who - according to the Government's statements - is imprisoned in a penal establishment, the Committee requests the Government to send detailed information about the acts with which he was charged and, where appropriate, the text of the judgement handed down by the judicial authority.",1,1982,El Salvador
282,".The Committee last examined these cases at its February  meeting, in the light of information obtained during a direct contacts mission conducted in El Salvador from  to  January . (See rd Report of the Committee, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session (February-March ).)
.The Committee had already examined Case No.  at its meetings in November , November , November , May  and May  (see th, th, th, th and th Reports of the Committee); Case No.  at its meetings in November , November , May  and May  (see th, th, th and th Reports of the Committee); Case No.  at its meetings in November , November , May  and May  (see th, th, th and th Reports of the Committee); Case No.  at its meetings in May  and May  (see th and th Reports of the Committee); and Case No.  at its meeting in November  (see th Report of the Committee).
.Since these cases were last examined by the Committee, new allegations have been submitted by the following organisations: the World Confederation of Organisations of the Teaching Profession ( May ), the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions ( May and  June ), the World Federation of Trade Unions ( May ) and the United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador ( June,  and  July,  September,  October and  December ). The Government submitted certain observations in communications dated  July,  August and  September ,  and  January,  and  February and  April .
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee notes with concern that since the last examination of the case, the complainant organisations have submitted extremely serious allegations concerning the death and arrest of trade union officials and trade unionists, the searching of the headquarters of a trade union organisation and various actions of interference and anti-trade union discrimination.
.The Committee notes that the trial concerning the murder of the trade union official Jos Aristides Mndez has been opened and that the presumed authors of the crime have been identified and arrested. The Committee nevertheless notes that in referring to the other two cases, the Government has merely pointed out that the trade unionist Francisco Mndez is not on the lists of forensic tests carried out and that the security forces know nothing about the death or disappearance of the trade union leader Marco Antonio Orantes, although investigations are still under way. The Committee stresses the importance of carrying out a judicial investigation in all cases with a view to elucidating the facts, determining the responsibilities and punishing the guilty parties if it is proven that offences have been committed. Furthermore, the Committee notes that with respect to the alleged murder of Toms Rosales and the injuries allegedly suffered by Rafael Hernndez, judicial investigations carried out proved that crimes of this nature had not been committed. Finally, the Committee notes that it has not been possible to identify the murderers of Jos Santos Tiznado and Pedro Gonzlez during the trial conducted to this effect and that the trial concerning the death of Rodolfo Viera and two North American trade unionists (Michael Hammer and Mark Pearlman) is still under way.
.As regards the alleged arrests of trade union officials and trade unionists, the Committee notes the release of Victor Manuel Martnez, Francisco Palacios, Febe Elizabeth Velsquez, Etelvina Snchez Vsquez, Adela Margarita Navarrete, David Rolando Oliva and Juan Gilberto Durn. As charges against those concerned were dropped and bearing in mind the general grounds for arrest communicated by the Government in some cases against the persons concerned, the Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that measures of detention which restrict the exercise of trade union rights can give rise to a climate of intimidation and fear prejudicial to the normal exercise of trade union activities (see, for example, rd Report, Cases Nos.  and  (El Salvador), paras.  and ) and that when this is connected with activities in the defence of the interests of workers, it constitutes a serious interference with civil liberties in general and with trade union rights in particular (see, for example, rd Report, Case No.  (El Salvador), para. ).
.Furthermore, the Committee notes that the Government pointed out that Jos Edgar Gmez Guerrero, Cecilio Guzmn Prez, Leonel Arvalo Morales, Jaime Ernesto Martnez Menjvar, Andrs Valiente and Celso Antonio Rivas Henrquez were arrested and put on trial on charges of belonging to terrorist groups. The Government also mentioned the trial of Daniel Rosaide Cullar and Rafael Vsquez Fabin without going into further detail. The Committee requests the Government to give information on this and, in particular, to indicate the specific facts with which all the trade unionists mentioned above are charged so that it might examine the allegations in full knowledge of the facts. The Committee also requests the complainant organisations to supply additional information on the circumstances surrounding these arrests. Finally, the Committee notes that the name of Santos Ventura is not on the lists of detained persons, that Jos Antonio Garca Hernndez and Julio Hernndez Rojas are being detained on the charge of murdering a trade union official and that the Government has not replied specifically to the allegations concerning the arrest of Gregorio Aguilln Ventura ( February ), Adalberto Martnez ( June ), Andrs Miranda ( June ), Jos Antonio Rodrguez ( August ), and the arrest of the  trade unionists mentioned in paragraph  of the rd Report.
.The Committee also notes that, according to the Government, no public security body knows anything about the arrest of the trade union officials Elsy Mrquez and Jos Snchez Gallegos. In view of the allegations that these persons are missing, the Committee repeats its request that a judicial inquiry should be carried out to ascertain their whereabouts.
.As regards the allegation that the registration of the most representative executive committee of the Textile Workers' Trade Union of Industras Unidas SA was refused, the Committee notes the Government's comments, according to which various general assemblies were held one after the other and that, apart from one case, irregularities had occurred. The Committee considers that in the present case it does not have enough information at its disposal to be able to come to a decision on this matter. However, it notes that there is a possibility that there might be grounds to initiate legal proceedings and that this right does not seem to have been exercised.
.Finally, the Committee regrets that the Government has not replied to the allegations concerning the raid of the ANDES premises on  April  by the armed forces, who took away documents such as the list of members; it also failed to mention the dismissal of six union officials in the telecommunications sector because of the strike of  April .
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:a) The Committee is conscious of the difficult situation that the country is going through; however, it considers it necessary to request from the Government the information referred to below so as to be able to reach conclusions in full knowledge of all the facts raised in the allegations and in the light of the situation prevailing in the country.b) The Committee requests the Government to provide additional information on the alleged murders of the trade unionists Francisco Mndez and Marco Antonio Orantes (Case No. ), and to carry out a judicial inquiry into this matter. The Committee also requests the Government to provide information on developments in the trials concerning the murder of trade union official Jos Aristides Meja (Case No. ) and the murder of Rodolfo Viera and the two North American trade unionists, Michael Hammer and Mark Pearlman (Case No. ). As regards this last point, the Committee regrets that, despite the time which has elapsed since the murders, a final judgement has not been handed down.c) The Committee requests the Government to carry out a judicial inquiry into the disappearance of Elsy Mrquez and Jos Snchez Gallegos (Case No. ) and expresses the hope that this will ascertain their whereabouts.d) The Committee requests the Government to provide additional information on the trade unionists who are still detained and/or being tried, indicating, in particular, the specific facts with which they are charged (Cases Nos.  and ). It also requests the complainant organisations to supply additional information on the circumstances surrounding the arrests of those concerned.e) The Committee requests the Government to comment on the allegations to which it has not replied, which are referred to in the previous paragraph.
.At its February  meeting the Committee on Freedom of Association was informed that the Government of El Salvador was ready to accept a",-1,1981,El Salvador
283,"direct contacts mission to examine the various aspects of Cases Nos. , , , , , , , ,  and , noted this information with interest and expressed the hope that, upon receipt of confirmation from the Government, arrangements could be made at an early date for such a mission to take place (see th Report of the Committee, para. , approved by the Governing Board at its th Session (February-March )).
.During the visit of the Director-General of the ILO to El Salvador in May , he proposed a direct contacts mission to His Excellency the President of the Republic, in conformity with the decision adopted by the Committee on Freedom of Association at its February  meeting regarding the complaints pending against El Salvador. n this occasion the President stated that, although he had not requested an ILO mission, he did not reject the direct contact; mission proposed, and indicated that the country opened its doors to the ILO mission.
.In its th Report (May ), approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (May-June ), the Committee took the following decision in connection with the cases relating to El Salvador: ""As regards the cases relating to El Salvador (Cases Nos. , , , , , , ,  and ), the Committee notes that following an official visit by the Director-General to the country, the Government is willing to accept a direct contacts mission with a view to examining the various aspects of these cases. The Committee hopes that the necessary arrangements will be able to be made shortly so that this mission can take place as soon as possible.""
.In a communication received on  November  the Salvadorian Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the ILO that the direct contacts mission could visit the country.
.The Director-General of the ILO appointed Mr. Andrs Aguilar, member and former president of the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights and member of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights as his representative to conduct the mission. The mission took place in San Salvador from  to  January . During the mission the Director-General's representative was accompanied by Mr. Alberto Odero, member of the Freedom of Association Branch of the International Labour Standards Department, and Mr. Luis Zamudio, Regional Adviser on Standards.
.The mission was received by the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare, His Excellency Miguel Alejandro Gallegos, by Dr. Lzaro Tadeo Bernal Lizama, Vice Minister of Labour and Social Welfare, and Dr. Antonio Lara Gavidia, Head of the International Affairs Department of the Ministry, by the members of the Labour and Social Welfare Committee of the Legislative Assembly, by senior officials of the Ministry of Justice, and by representatives of employers"" and workers' organisations.
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the first place, the Committee wishes to thank Mr. Andrs Aguilar for having agreed to carry out the direct contacts mission, as well as for his detailed report on the pending cases, which has allowed the Committee to examine them. The Committee considers that the report of the Director-General's representative attests to the usefulness of missions of this kind in clarifying matters arising from allegations by the complainant organisations.
.Since the content of the allegations and the information supplied by the Government, as well as the information obtained by the Director-General's representative during the mission are contained in the mission report (see Annex), the Committee can proceed directly to formulate its conclusions on the various cases.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:General recommendations(a) The Committee takes note of the report of the Director-General's representative on the mission carried out in El Salvador from  to  January . The Committee also notes that the mission enjoyed full freedom of action and movement and that the authorities of the Ministries of Labour and Justice with which it came into contact gave it every facility and co-operated actively in obtaining the information requested by the Committee on Freedom of Association.(b) The Committee notes that, according to the mission report, although there has been a marked drop in the frequency of attempts on lives and physical integrity and in the number of disappearances and arrests of persons connected with the trade union movement since the elections of May , there is continued insecurity.(c) The Committee also notes that the mission ascertained that a wide variety of trade union organisations representing all tendencies exist and operate in the country and that they play an active and militant role in national life and resort to strikes. The organisations having recourse to such action include public-sector workers' organisations, despite the fact that such action is illegal for this category of workers. Nevertheless, according to the mission report, trade union activities are often conducted in an atmosphere of fear which has an unfavourable effect on their exercise, and according to the organisations interviewed, such activities are viewed with hostility in many employers' circles - particularly in the private sector - which oppose the formation of organisations and the exercise of their rights.(d) In general, the Committee concludes from the mission report that there is still a need to make much progress in El Salvador to achieve genuine respect for human rights in general and trade union rights in particular. The Committee notes that according to the authorities of the Ministry of Labour, this is one of the main objectives of Government policy, and concrete measures to this effect have been and are being taken.(e) While the Committee is aware of the serious difficulties El Salvador is facing, it calls on the Government to adopt appropriate measures to guarantee that trade union rights may be exercised in a normal fashion; this will only be possible in conditions in which fundamental human rights are respected and in a climate free of violence, pressures and threats of any kind.Cases Nos. , ,  and (a) The Committee regrets that the proceedings relative to the homicide of Manuel Antonio and Jos Antonio Carrillo Vzquez and of Santiago Hernndez have failed to identify those responsible for the crime, and that they have been dropped.(b) The Committee requests the Government to take steps with a view to the opening of an investigation into the alleged homicide of Toms Rosales, Jos Santos Tiznado and Pedro Gonzlez, in respect of whom there is no record of proceedings having been opened. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments concerning the disappearance of the trade union leader Rafael Hernndez Olivo, as well as of the final outcome of the proceedings concerning the wilful homicide of the trade unionists Rodolfo Viera, Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer, indicating whether the investigation has been able to establish who instigated the crime committed by the two defendants.Case No. (a) The Committee regrets that the trade unionist Marta Imelda Dimas remained in prison for over two months.(b) The Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that the detention of trade unionists for trade union activities or membership is contrary to the principles of freedom of association.Case No. (a) The Committee requests the Government to undertake an investigation to determine the whereabouts of the trade union leaders Elsy Mrquez and Jos Snchez Gallegos, and to keep it informed thereof.(b) The Committee notes that some of the trade unionists mentioned by the complainants are free, and awaits the information promised by the Government concerning another  trade unionists whose arrest has been alleged and whose names are listed in the conclusions (concerning these  trade unionists, the Government reported that none of the persons listed is at present imprisoned in any of the detention centres in the country, but that further investigations will be carried out to determine whether they had been imprisoned at some stage in police centres).Case No. (a) As regards the murder of trade union leader Juan Pablo Meja Rodriguez, the Committee notes that proceedings have reached the stage of examination of witnesses, and that no one has yet been arrested. The Committee deeply regrets the murder of this trade union leader and requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in the proceedings.(b) While noting that all of the trade union leaders whose detention had been alleged in connection with this case are now free, the Committee none the less recalls that some of them were detained for trade union activities, and draws the Government's attention to the fact that the detention of trade union leaders or members for reasons connected with their activities in defence of the interests of workers constitutes serious interference with civil liberties in general and with trade union rights in particular.Case No. (a) The Committee points to the principle that all workers' organisations have the right to affiliate with international organisations of workers implies the right of national and international trade union organisations",2,1981,El Salvador
284,"to maintain contact with one another, without interference by the public authorities.(b) While noting that the judicial authority dropped the charges against Modesto Rodriguez and Elsy Esperanza Alvarenga, the Committee deplores their detention and draws the Government's attention to the fact that the detention of trade union leaders and members against whom no specific charges are retained restricts the exercise of trade union rights, and that such measures can give rise to a climate of intimidation and fear prejudicial to the normal exercise of trade union activities.Case No. (a) The Committee observes that the Government has not sent observations on the alleged murder of the trade union leader Marco Antonio Orantes. Faced with this very serious situation and while deeply regretting the murder of this trade union leader, the Committee requests the Government to send its observations on this matter, indicating in particular whether any proceedings have been instituted and if so, their current status.(b) The Committee concludes that the judicial decision declaring the strike in the Salvadorian Social Security Institute illegal and ordering the removal of those occupying its premises does not constitute a violation of the principles of freedom of association, inasmuch as the Institute is engaged in medical and health-care services. The Committee regrets the death of several members of the public security forces and some insured persons, and notes that, according to the Government and contrary to what the complainants maintain, none of the dead or wounded were members of the trade union organisations involved.(c) The Committee notes that the judicial authority dropped the charges against four of the trade union leaders whose detention had been alleged, but regrets their detention and draws the Government's attention to the fact that the detention of trade union leaders and members against whom no specific charges are retained restricts the exercise of trade union rights and that such measures can give rise to a climate of intimidation and fear prejudicial to the normal exercise of trade union activities.Case No. (a) The Committee requests the Government to take conciliatory measures with a view to promoting a climate of reconciliation and understanding between the Servipronto S.A. undertaking and its trade union enabling the resolution of current problems concerning the guarantees for the exercise of trade union rights, and an examination of the possibility of reinstating the trade union leader Israel Snchez Cruz, a measure that would undoubtedly contribute to more harmonious labour relations.(b) The Committee wishes to point out in general that in the event of a strike the authorities should resort to the use of force only when law and order are seriously threatened.
.The complaint presented by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) on  July  is concerned mainly with the death on  June  of Toms Rosales, a leader of the workers' union Granja Santa Ins, and the wounding of four other trade unionists during clashes with the armed forces which occurred in connection with a peaceful strike called by them in support of a number of wage claims.
.From the outset the Government, although it transmitted no comments on this case, refuted none of these allegations and on  September  furnished information to the effect that Carlos Hernndez, another trade union leader, had been arrested on  June , the day of the strike, for disturbing the peace and threatening to damage the installations of the undertaking and had been released on  June .
.Thereafter, in other communications, the Government never denied the facts alleged by the complainant organisation but did not transmit, as requested by the Committee, its observations concerning the death of Toms Rosales and the wounds inflicted on four other trade unionists on  June  during a peaceful strike at the Granja Santa Ins.
.The Committee observes, however, that in its communication of  January  the Government denies any knowledge of the facts alleged, according to a report of the Ministry of Defence and Public Safety contained in Note No.  dated  June .
.The Committee keenly regrets that the Government has not supplied specific information on this case, which has been requested several times and it recalls that a free and independent trade union movement can develop only where fundamental human rights are respected. It can only deplore the existence of situations in which trade unionists are killed or wounded in the performance of their trade union functions and in particular when engaged in peaceful strikes. It draws the Government's attention to the urgent need to take active measures to prevent in the future any loss of human life in similar situations.
.The complaint of the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) concerned the murder of trade union leaders. In a communication of  April  the WCL reported that Jos Santos Tiznado and Pedro Gonzlez, the leaders of the Salvadorian Peasants' Central, had been murdered by uniformed members of the National Guard in the Jess Suburb of San Ramn, Department of Cuscatln, at midnight on  May . In addition Manuel Antonio Carillo and Jos Antonio Carillo, former leaders of the Salvadorian Peasants' Central and members of the El Rosario Agricultural and Consumers Limited, had been murdered by agents of repressive forces on  June ; this, said the complainant organisation, was proved by the calibre of the bullets found near their bodies. In addition, Rafael Hernndez Olivo, Secretary-General of the Irrigation and Drainage Section of the National Association of Workers in the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry (ANTMAG), had been taken to Metapn Hospital after being injured in an accident, had subsequently been arrested by the rural police and had since disappeared.
.Successive items of information transmitted by the Government showed that investigations were being made into the murder of these four peasants and the disappearance of the Secretary-General of ANTMAG. The Government had never denied the facts but had not supplied specific information on the circumstances surrounding the death of Jos Santos Tiznado, Pedro Gonzlez, Manuel Antonio Carillo or Jos Antonio Carillo or the disappearance of Rafael Hernndez Olivo. In May  the Committee urged the Government to supply such information without delay. In addition it drew attention to the importance it attached to the holding of an independent judicial inquiry when there was loss of human life.
.As in the previous case, the Committee notes that the Government, in its communication of  January last, declares that the Ministry of Defence and Public Safety knows nothing whatsoever about the death of these persons and that Rafael Hernndez is not, to its knowledge, detained by any unit of the forces of public safety according to information received in Note No.  of  February  which contains a report from the Ministry in question.
.The Committee draws attention to the contradiction between the earlier information and this last communication, inasmuch as it was stated previously that investigations into these murders were under way. The Committee again emphasises the need to ensure that justice punishes the guilty parties and for the Government to keep it informed of the results of the investigation and any penalties imposed. In addition it urges the Government to supply precise information on these events and, in particular, on the fate of Rafael Hernndez Olivo.
.In this case, on  January  the ICFTU denounced the assassination on  January , of Rodolfo Viera, Secretary-General of the Salvadorian Communal Union, and of two American trade unionists, Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer, representatives of the AFL-CIO in El Salvador, while staying at the Hotel Sheraton in San Salvador where they were working on an agrarian reform programme to improve living and working conditions in rural areas.
.In June , the Government stated that a trial was being held in the Fifth Criminal Court of San Salvador and that the accused, Ernesto Sol Meza, had been released by order of the Supreme Court after submitting an appeal, and that the other accused, Hans Krist, had been acquitted. The Committee therefore urged the Government to pursue actively its investigations into the case and to send it the text of any judgment handed down.
.The Government, in its communication of  March , repeated the same information but added that judgment had been delivered in the proceedings against other accused persons who were deemed to have been material perpetrators of the crime, but that the parties had lodged appeals.
.The Government states in its communication of  January  that the Second Criminal Chamber of the First Section of the Central Court delivered on appeal a ruling dated  April  pursuant to sections  and  of the Code of Criminal Procedure of which the Government supplies an extract. This ruling upholds the dismissal, by order of the Supreme Court dated  December , of the charges against Ernesto Sol Meza and Hans Krist after they had lodged their application therefore; it confirms the judgment delivered against the accused Jos Dimas Valle Acevedo and Santiago Gmez Gonzlez, from which they had appealed, and stays execution with a reservation in favour of Lieutenant Lpez Sibrian;",0,1981,El Salvador
285,"it vacates the order for the detention of Hans Krist and Lpez Sibrian for lack of grounds; it orders that the statement made by the Prosecutor of the Chamber in his reply to the accusations concerning the accused Lpez Sibrian should be reported to the Supreme Court.
.The Committee takes note of this information and notes in particular that a sentence has been handed down against the persons deemed to have been material perpetrators of the crime, namely Jos Dimas Valle Acevedo and Santiago Gmez Gonzlez. It requests the Government to continue to send it information on the final outcome of this case and to inform it in particular whether the investigation has managed to identify the instigator or instigators of the crime.
.The Trade Unions International of Transport Workers, in its communication of  August , alleged that several trade union activists including Alejandro Martinez Alvarado had been wrongfully arrested by the police at the premises of the""Transport Workers' Trade Union on  August . After the Committee had examined the case in November , the question of the detention of Mr. Martinez Alvarado remained pending; the Government stated that he had been arrested by the police on  August  and detained at ""La Esperanza"" Penitentiary Centre in the Canton of San Luis Mariona. The Government later indicated that this trade unionist had been in custody at the Central Penitentiary by order of the military examining magistrate since  August  and had been prosecuted under Decree No. , which contains provisions concerning procedure in case of offences against the peace and independence of the State and against international law.
.In a communication of  April  the complainant organisation supplied additional allegations concerning Marta Imelda Dimas, the secretary of the trade union, who had also been in prison since  October , and further alleged that the Government had arrested Jorge Benjamin Rodriguez, Disputes Secretary of the same trade union, on  February .
.At its previous examination of the case, in May-June , the Committee noted with grave concern that Alejandro Martinez Alvarado had been in custody without trial since August . The Committee also observed that, according to the Government, this trade unionist was being prosecuted for offences against the peace and independence of the State and against international law but that the Government had communicated no information about the specific acts of which he was accused; according to the complainants, on the other hand, the person in question had been arrested without justification - along with others who had since been released - by the police at the premises of the Transport Workers' Trade Union.
.The Committee also noted that the trade unionists Marta Imelda Dimas and Jorge Benjamin Rodriguez were reported to have been in prison since October  and February  respectively, and the Committee requested the Government to communicate its observations in this regard.
.In its telegram of  June  the Government mentions that Alejandro Martinez Alvarado has been released under a Legislative Decree of amnesty. It repeats this information in its telegram of  June and adds that Jorge Benjamin Rodriguez has also been released under the same law. In its communication of  January last, the Government explains that Alejandro Martinez Alvarado was released under the amnesty law adopted by the Government of El Salvador on  May .
.The Committee, while noting the release of the two above-mentioned trade unionists under the amnesty law of  May , observes that the Government supplies no information concerning Marta Imelda Dimas, the union secretary, who according to the complainant organisation has been in prison since  October .
.Consequently, the Committee urges the Government to supply precise information concerning the detention in which this trade unionist has been held for many months and to state the specific acts with which she is charged. The Committee requests that this person be released or tried as soon as possible by an impartial and independent judicial authority, and asks the Government to keep it informed of developments in the situation.
.In this case the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) reported on  October  that the following trade union leaders had been arrested or had disappeared during October : Silvestre Ortz, treasurer of a sugar refinery trade union, arrested on  October; Daniel Avalos, leader of the trade union of a dairy products undertaking, and Pablo Ramrez Cornejo, leader of the Industrial Workers' Trade Union, both arrested on  October; Ral Antonio Castro Palomares, secretary of the Federation of the Unions of Workers in the Food, Clothing, Textile and Allied Industries arrested at his home on  October; Hctor Hernndez, second secretary of SETRAS, imprisoned by the rural police; and Berta Alicia Cosme of the FENASTRAS trade union, who had disappeared on  October. In a supplementary letter dated  May , the WFTU also referred to many other arrests and disappearances of persons, a list of whom is supplied as an annex to this case.
.With its letter of  March  the Government transmitted a photocopy of a note from the Ministry of Defence and Public Safety (Note No.  of  February  signed by Colonel Ren E. Auerbach) in which this officer admitted that Daniel de Jess Avalos de Paz, Pablo Cornejo Ramirez and Ral Antonio Castro Palomares had been arrested by the police, the first two on  October and the third on  October. These three persons were being detained by order of the competent court, Ral Antonio Castro Palomares being at the Mariona Penal Centre.
.In a communication of  March  the Government stated further that Berta Alicia Cosme, known as Berta, had been arrested in October  with other persons who, like her, were accused of being members or leaders of organisations engaged in terrorist activities, and that they were being held by order of the judge because the proceedings against them were at the preliminary investigation stage.
.The Committee, while expressing its concern at the length of time for which these trade unionists had been kept in detention pending trial, considered in May-June  that the Government ought to take steps to ensure that the persons mentioned in the complainants' communications of  October  and  May  be released or, if charges were being preferred against them, brought before the courts. The Committee further requested the Government to supply detailed information concerning the fate of those persons.
.By a telegram of  June  the Government reported that Ral Antonio Castro Palomares, Pablo Cornejo Ramrez, Alicia Cosme, known as Berta, and Pedro Ramirez Esquivel had been released under the Legislative Decree of amnesty of  May . This information was enlarged upon in the communication of  January , in which the Government states that, according to the report of the Ministry of Defence and Public Safety, Ral Antonio Castro Palomares had indeed been amnestied on  May , Pablo Cornejo Ramirez on  May , Berta Alicia Cosme on  May  and Antonio Campos Mendoza on  August , and that Daniel de Jess Avalos de Paz had been released under a ruling of the Supreme Court of Justice on  May .
.The Committee, while taking note of this information, observes with deep concern that in this case most of the persons mentioned by the complainants remain in custody since October , or are still missing, and that no explanation of their fate has been provided by the Government. The Government stated in its telegram of  June  that, generally speaking, the annexed list was made up of trade unionists detained for criminal offences and awaiting trial for acts carrying penalties of more than four years' imprisonment. The Government states that it respects fully human rights but that persons involved in activities running counter to the rights and freedoms of the people of El Salvador as recognised in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights could not be exonerated under the basic domestic legislation.
.In these circumstances the Committee urges the Government to keep it informed in detail on the situation of all these trade unionists; to communicate to the Committee its observations on the specific acts with which these persons are charged and the text of the judgments concerning them; and to provide details as to the fate of those who are missing.
.The Committee keenly deplores the fact that, in all the cases examined above, a very violent situation has resulted in the death, wounding or arrest of trade unionists in circumstances which, in the absence of specific and detailed information, are difficult for it to assess. The Committee emphasises that such a climate of violence is unpropitious for the development not only of industrial relations but also of a free and independent trade union movement inasmuch as, for such a movement to develop, fundamental human rights must be respected.
.The Committee points out that, when cases of this nature - namely, of detention under emergency regulations - have been referred to it, it has always [see, for",-1,1981,El Salvador
286,"example, Fourth Report, Case No.  (United Kingdom/Malaya), para.  stressed the importance which it attaches to all detained persons receiving a fair trial at the earliest possible moment. The Committee considers that measures of preventive detention should be limited to very short periods intended solely to facilitate the course of a judicial inquiry. [See rd Report, Case No.  (Argentina), para. .]
.The Committee has examined these cases on several occasions, most recently at its November  meeting when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body. Subsequently, the Government sent further information in a communication dated  March .
.El Salvador has not ratified either the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complaint presented by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) on  July  is concerned mainly with the death on  June  of Toms Rosales, a leader of the workers' union Granja Santa Ins, and the wounding of four other trade unionists during clashes with the armed forces which occurred in connection with a peaceful strike called by them in support of a number of wage claims.
.Since the Government supplied no information on this aspect of the case in November , the Committee reiterated its request that the Government communicate its observations concerning the alleged killing of Toms Rosales and wounding of four other trade unionists on  June  at the undertaking of El Grarjero S. A.
.In its reply dated  March , the Government does not refute any of these allegations but merely repeats the information submitted on  September , to the effect that, on  June , Carlos Hernndez was arrested for disturbing the peace and threatening to damage the undertaking's property and that he was subsequently released on  June .
.The Committee again notes this information. It observes, however, that the Government does not deny the allegations of the complainant.
.In the circumstances, the Committee can only deplore the alleged violent death of the union leader, Toms Rosales, and the injuries inflicted by the armed forces on other Granja Santa Ins trade unionists on  June  in the course of a labour dispute. Given the fact that an independent and free trade union movement can develop only in a climate of respect for basic human rights, the committee urges the Government to take steps to prevent any loss of human life.
.The complaint presented by the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) refers to the assassination of trade union leaders. According to the WCL in a communication dated  April , Jos Santos Tiznado and Pedro Gonzals, leaders of the Salvadorian Peasants' Central, were assassinated by uniformed members of the National Guard at midnight on  May  in the Jsus suburb of San Ramn in the Department of Cuscatln. The complainant further alleges that Manual Antonio Carrillo and Jos Antonio Carrillo, former leaders o the Salvadorian Peasants' Central and members of the El Rosario Agricultural and Consumers' Co-operative Limited, were assassinated on  June  by members of repressive forces, basing their allegations on the calibre of the bullets found near the dead bodies. It also states that Rafael Hernndez Olivo, Secretary General of the Irrigation and Drainage Section of the National Association of Workers of the-Ministry of Agriculture and Cattle Farming (ANTMAG), who had been transported to the Metapn Hospital after being injured in an accident, was subsequently arrested by the rural police and that his whereabouts were unknown.
.In November , the Committee noted the Government's statement that investigations were being made into the death of the four peasants and the disappearance of the Secretary General of ANTMAG. The Committee emphasised the importance that the guilty parties should be tried and punished and that the Government should keep it informed of the results of the investigation and of the action taken against those responsible.
.In its reply dated  March , the Government states that the information concerning this complaint has been communicated to the relevant bodies to help them in their inquiries.
.The Committee observes that the alleged assassination of the peasant, trade unionists occurred in May and June , since when the Government has not denied the facts and states that investigations are still under way. The Committee deeply regrets that the Government has not yet supplied any specific information on the circumstances surrounding the alleged death of Jos Santos Tiznado, Pedro Gonzals, Marvel Antonio Carrillo and Jos Antonio Carrillo and the disappearance of Rafael Hernndez Olivo. The Committee urges the Government to transmit this information without delay. It must recall the importance in all cases involving the loss of human life of carrying out an independent judicial inquiry. As the Committee has stated in the past,' the atmosphere of confidence essential for social dialogue could be restored more easily once the responsibilities of those concerned have been established and the persons who have abused their powers have been dealt with according to law.
.The complaint presented by the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of Latin American Workers (CPUSTAI) concerns the arrest by the police on  July  of the trade union leaders Tejada, Mendoza, Mrguez, Aguirre, Snchez, Fuentes and Castro, all of whom were arrested during a discussion of a list of grievances in the premises of the undertaking Buses Ruta Urbanos -.
.In a communication dated June , the Government stated, with respect to the arrest of members of the Executive Committee of the National Union of Workers in Transport and Allied industries in the premises of the undertaking Buses Ruta Urbanos , that a trial was under way.
.In its communication dated  March , the Government indicates that information regarding Case No.  will be submitted separately.
.The Committee once again urges the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of this trial and, in particular, to indicate whether the trade unionists Tejada, Mendoza, Mrguez, Aguirre, Snchez, Fuentes and Castro cited by name by the complainants, have been released.
.In this case, the ICFTU denounced the assassination on  January  o Rodolfo Viera, Secretary General of the Salvadorian Communal Union, and the death on  January  of two American trade unionists, Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer, representatives of the AFL-CIO in El Salvador, while staying at the Hotel Sheraton in San Salvador where they were working on an agrarian reform programme to improve living and working conditions in rural areas.
.In June , the Government stated that a trial was being held in the Fifth Criminal Court of San Salvador and that the accused, Ernesto Sol Meza, had been released by order of the Supreme Court after submitting an appeal, and that the other accused, Hans Krist, had been acquitted. The Committee therefore urged the Government to pursue actively its investigations into the case and to send in the text of any judgement handed down.
.In its communication dated  March , the Government repeats its earlier statement that the trial is being held in the Fifth Criminal court, that one of the accused has been released by order of the Supreme Court and that the other has been acquitted. It adds that the judgement concerning other accused persons considered to be the actual perpetrators of the crime was handed down early in December  but that the parties concerned have lodged an appeal.
.The Committee notes the Government's statement and requests it to continue keeping it informed of developments in this case. The Committee feels that it would be of the utmost value for it to have the text of the final judgement that will be handed down.
.In the circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:(a) In general terms, the Committee once again deeply deplores the violent death of several trade union leaders and, given the fact that an independent and free trade union movement car develop only in a climate of respect for basic human rights, urges the Government to take action to prevent any loss of human life. The Committee urges the Government to transmit without delay information on the circumstances in which these trade union leaders lost their lives.(b) In Case No. , the Committee urges the Government to communicate information on the outcome of the trial concerning the arrest o members of the Executive Committee of the National Union of workers in Transport and Allied Industries, which occurred almost three years ago - on  July  - when the trade unionists concerned were discussing a list of wage claims in the premises of the undertaking Buses Ruta Urbanos -. The Committee urges the Government to indicate whether the trade unionists Tejada, Mendoza, Mrguez, Aguirre, Snchez, Fuentes and Castro, cited by name by the complainants, have been released.(c) In Case No. , the Committee notes that the trial of the presumed perpetrators of the assassination of the trade union leader, Rodolfo Viera, and of Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer, two American trade",1,1981,El Salvador
287,"unionists representing the AFI-CIC in El Salvador, is still under way. The Committee once again requests the Government to continue communicating detailed information on the case, including the text of the final judgement once it has been handed down.
.Since  numerous complaints concerning violations of freedom of association in El Salvador have been presented by the following organisations: the United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador (FUSS), the Federation of Unions of Workers in the Food, Clothing, Textile and Allied Industries of El Salvador (FESTIAVTSCES), the Committee for Trade Union Unity of Workers of Central America and Panama (CUSCA), the Trade Unions International of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur Workers, the Trade Unions International of Food, Tobacco, Hotel and Allied Industries Workers, the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the World Federation of Agricultural Workers, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of the Workers of Latin America (CPUSTAL).
.The Committee has already examined most of these cases on several occasions and submitted interim reports to the Governing Body.
.Since then, in the absence of observations from the Government, the Committee adjourned its examination of these cases to February, then May . The Office sent a telegram to the Government on  April  inviting it to submit its observations as soon as possible. In June  the Minister of Labour forwarded additional information.
.El Salvador has not ratified either the freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complaints examined by the Committee were basically of three kinds: first, concerning the violent death and disappearance of trade unionists and former trade unionists; second, arrest of trade union leaders; third, attack on trade union premises and destruction of records.
.At the last examination of the cases in question, in November , the Governing Body, in accordance with the Committee's recommendations, expressed extreme concern at the serious nature of the allegations and observed that various acts had occurred after  October , when the previous Government had been deposed.
.In particular, concerning violent deaths and disappearances, the Governing Body deplored the loss of many human lives and the injuries referred to in the complaints. It noted that investigations had been opened into some of the occurrences and requested the Government to undertake as soon as possible a judicial inquiry into those cases where investigations had not been opened and to inform it of the results.
.In his communication of June , before giving a detailed reply concerning the cases in question, the Minister of Labour stated that, as a human being and as an official, he regretted that in the past acts had occurred in El Salvador which were not perhaps compatible with humane feelings, especially as regards violations of freedom of association such as those denounced to the International Labour Organisation. However, in order to preserve his country's international prestige despite the climate of violence which has prevailed in recent years, resulting in loss of human life and material losses, he stated that he would like to present specific information on the current situation concerning these cases.
.It should therefore be recalled that, in Case No. , the complainants alleged in particular that on  October , workers who were preparing to organise a collection in support of a strike at the El Len factory were attacked by the police, and two of them lost their lives. According to the Government's communication of June , the investigations undertaken and requested from the Ministry of Defence and Public Security confirm that there is no file on events relating to the situation of trade unionists in the El Len factory which occurred under the presidential administration of Colonel Arturo Armando Molina and General Carlos Humberto Romero in  and .
.As regards Case No. , according to a communication of the WCL dated  April , Jos Santos Tiznado and Pedro Gonzlez, leaders of the Salvadorian Peasants' Central, were murdered by uniformed members of the National Guard at midnight, on  May , in the Jsus suburb of the San Ramn municipality in the department of Cuscatln. In addition, Manuel Antonio Carrillo and Jos Antonio Carrillo, former leaders of the Salvadorian Peasants' Central and members of the El Rosario Agricultural and Consumers Co-operative Ltd., were murdered on  June  by members of the forces of repression, as was evident from the calibre of the bullets found near their bodies. As regards Rafael Hernndez Olivo, Secretary General of the Irrigation and Drainage Section of the National Association of workers of the Ministry of Agriculture and Cattle Farming (ANTMAG), who had been transported to the Metapn hospital after being injured in an accident, he had subsequently disappeared, having been arrested by the hacienda police.
.Concerning the homicide of the peasants Jos Santos, Pedro Gonzlez, Manuel Carrillo and Antonio Carrillo, and the disappearance of Rafael Hernndez Olivo, the Government states that the authorities are continuing their investigations.
.In Case No. , the ICFTU alleged, in a communication dated  July , that in a clash with the armed forces on  June , Toms Rosales, a leader of the workers' union of the ""Granja Santa Ins"", had been killed and four other trade unionists had been injured, when the workers at this undertaking had called a peaceful strike in support of a list of wage claims.
.The Government has still not supplied any information on this allegation.
.In Case No. , concerning the murder on  January  of Rodolfo Viera, Secretary General of the Salvadorian Communal Union, and the death of two United States trade unionists Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer, representatives of the AFL-CIO in El Salvador, the Government confirms in its communication of June  that a trial was being held in the fifth criminal court of San Salvador. The accused, Ernesto Sol Meza, has been released on the order of the Supreme Court, after submitting an appeal, and the other accused, Hans Krist, has been acquitted, adds the Government.
.The Committee observes that the Government has supplied certain information on the development of the investigations conducted by the authorities into the death and disappearance of the trade unionists and former trade unionists referred to by the complainants.
.As regards certain events, however, the Committee regrets that despite the time which has elapsed since the complaints were presented, the Government still has not supplied any observations, particularly on the alleged death of Toms Rosales and the injuries inflicted on his fellow workers by the forces of the law on  June  at the Granja Santa Ins. In this respect, the Committee recalls, as it has stated on numerous previous occasions, that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact. It is therefore confident that if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, the latter should recognise the importance for the protection of their own good name of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to the allegations put forward,
.In Case No. , the Committee notes that, according to the Government, an investigation is being made into the homicide of the peasants Jos Santos, Pedro Gonzles, Manuel Carrillo and Antonio Carrillo and the disappearance of Rafael Hernndez Olivo. The Committee again stresses to the Government the need to ensure that the guilty parties are punished and insists that the Government inform it of the results of the current investigations and of the penalties imposed.
.The Committee also notes that in Case No. , the trial in the murder of trade union leader Rodolfo Viera has resulted in the acquittal of one of the accused and that the second has been released pending appeal. In this connection, the Committee must first keenly deplore the murder of these trade unionists. It would also observe that a climate of violence such as that in which the murders were committed constitutes a serious obstacle to the exercise of trade union rights. Consequently, such acts call for effective measures on the part of the authorities. The Committee therefore requests the Government to send it the text of any judgement handed down in this case, and to pursue actively the investigations into these cases.
.During its most recent examination of the substance of these cases, the Committee had also recommended the Governing Body to note that some trade unionists had been released, and had noted that certain arrests were made because of participation in an illegal electricity strike which led to the loss of human lives in hospitals and other welfare centres.
.However, it had also requested the Government to indicate the reasons for and circumstances surrounding the arrests of the leaders Enrique Tejada, Antonio Campos Mendoza, Salomn Snchez Mrquez, Vicente Aguirre, Melitn Snchez, Antonio Fuentes and Maximiliano Castro, and to supply information on their present situation. Recalling that it should be the policy of every government to ensure the right of all detained persons to receive a fair trial at",-1,1981,El Salvador
288,"the earliest possible moment, it pointed out that the arrests of trade unionists against whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found may involve the restriction of trade union rights and a serious interference in trade union activities.
.Lastly, in general terms, it considered that a contribution would be made towards normalising the trade union situation and labour relations - a necessary objective in the context of the full respect of human rights - and the restoration of social harmony if the Government examined the situation of the arrested persons referred to by the complainants, with a view to freeing those arrested for trade union reasons.
.In this connection, the allegations in Case No.  should be recalled. According to CPUSTAL, on  July , trade union leaders Tejada, Mendoza, Mrquez, Aguirre, Snchez, Fuentes and Castro had been arrested by police while discussing a list of claims in the premises of the undertaking Buses Ruta Urbanos -.
.In its communication of June , the Government states, concerning the detention of leaders of the National Union of Workers in the Transport and Allied Industries in the premises of the undertaking Buses Ruta Urbanos -, that a trial is under way.
.The Committee notes that in this case the trade union leaders in question seem to have been in custody for over two years. In this respect, it wishes to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that preventive detention without conviction by a court should not exceed a very brief period and should be intended only to facilitate a judicial inquiry. Holding persons indefinitely in custody without trial is a practice which involves inherent danger of abuse and is for this reason subject to criticism.
.In consequence, the Committee, while noting that a trial is under way, requests the Government to supply the text of the judgement with the grounds therefore, and hopes that, in so far as these trade union leaders have been imprisoned only for legitimate trade union activities, they will be released as soon as possible.""
.The Government was also requested to send its observations on the allegations to which it had not replied, and which, according to the ICFTU in a communication dated  March  relating to Case No. , chiefly concerned an alleged attack by the armed forces on the San Miguel premises of the Federation of Unions of Workers in the Construction, Transport and Allied Industries (FESINCONSTRANS), an organisation affiliated to the ICFTU. During the attack, which is alleged to have taken place on  February  at . p.m., the lives of trade unionists were threatened and trade union records destroyed.
.The Committee regrets, despite the time which has elapsed since the complaint was presented, the absence of the information requested of the Government on this aspect of the case. The Committee notes that this allegation involves principles relating to freedom of association. As it has pointed out before, on receiving an allegation of this kind, the Committee would stress the importance it attaches to certain fundamental principles essential to the exercise of trade union rights, namely that occupation of trade union premises and confiscation of materials and other trade union publications may constitute serious interference by the authorities in trade union affairs. The International Labour Conference, in the Resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties adopted at its th () Session, considered that the right to protection of trade union property is one of the civil liberties which is essential to the normal exercise of trade union rights. Thus, while recognising that neither trade unions nor any other association or individual can be exempt from a search of their premises, the Committee has always considered that, should such action be taken, it should occur only after a warrant has been issued by the ordinary judicial authority, when the latter is satisfied that there are serious grounds for supposing that the necessary evidence for prosecution of a crime will be found, and provided that the search is limited to the purposes for which the warrant was issued. In addition, any authorities who, during a search, exceed the powers conferred on them by law should be punished.
.The Committee therefore urges the Government to forward its observations on the events which occurred on  February  in the San Miguel premises of the trade union federation affiliated to the ICFTU, which according to the complainants was attacked by the armed forces, who also destroyed the trade union records.
.Since , numerous complaints concerning alleged violations of freedom of association in El Salvador have been presented to the Committee by the following organisations: the United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador (FUSS), the Federation of Unions of Workers in the Food, Clothing, Textile and Allied Industries of El Salvador (FESTIAVTSCES), the Committee for Trade Union Unity of Workers of Central America and Panama (CUSCA), the Trade Unions' International of Textile, Clothing and Fur Workers, the Trade Unions' International of Food, Tobacco, Hotel and Allied Industries' Workers, the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the World Federation of Agricultural Workers, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), and the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of Latin American Workers (CPUSTAL).
.The complaints submitted to the Committee include allegations referring to the Assassination, arrest, torture or disappearance of trade union officials and workers, attacks on trade union premises by the armed forces, threats and the destruction of trade union files. The contents of the complaints were successively transmitted to the Government as they were received.
.The Committee has examined Cases Nos. , ,  and  at previous meetings and has presented interim reports to the Governing Body.
.At its session in May , the Committee decided to adjourn its examination of Cases Nos. ,  and  since it had not yet received the detailed information which had been requested from the Government. At its session of November , the Committee once again adjourned its examination of these cases for the same reason and included them in its report under the heading ""Urgent appeals"". At its February  session, the Committee also included Cases Nos. ,  and  under the same heading ""Urgent appeals"" since the Government had failed to provide any detailed information. While noting with concern the troubled situation in El Salvador, the Committee pointed out to the Government that in accordance with the procedural rules currently in force, it could present a report on the substance of the cases pending even if the Government's observations had not been received.
.Given the extremely serious nature of most of the complaints, and since the Government had not provided sufficiently detailed information on the cases pending, the Committee decided at its May  session to apply the procedure contained in paragraphs  and  of its th Report. In accordance with this procedure, the Government was immediately informed that the Chairman of the Committee would make contact, on behalf of the Committee, with representatives of the Government of El Salvador at the th Session of the International Labour Conference in order to draw attention to the various cases in question and discuss the reasons for the delay in the transmission of replies to the allegations contained in these various cases.
.In accordance with the decision adopted by the Committee at its session in May , the Chairman met with the Minister of Labour and Social Security of El Salvador, Mr. Julio Alfredo Samayoa, on  June. The Chairman of the Committee explained the purpose of the meeting. The Minister of Labour stated that his Government's delay in replying to the Committee on the cases pending had been due to the unsettled situation through which his country had been passing for some time and that it was in no way the result of any lack of co-operation by his Government with the ILO and in particular with its supervisory bodies. He then transmitted a communication containing the observations of his Government on these cases, including annexes on Cases Nos.  and . The Minister added that he was prepared to provide any other information which the Committee on Freedom of Association considered necessary.
.Furthermore, the Government had already furnished certain comments on some of the allegations in communications dated , ,  and  May .
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Government states that, the Act which was applied to the case of the ""El Len"" factory (Case No. ) - in which an attack by the police led to the death of two persons - has since been repealed. The Government adds that the investigations which were supposedly ordered by the Government in power at that time did not, for reasons which are unknown, produce any results. The Government states that it considers itself free of any responsibility since the matter concerns acts allegedly committed by the previous Government, with which",-1,1981,El Salvador
289,"it has no link of continuity. However, the Government points out that a new inquiry is now being undertaken to clarify the matter, the results of which will be communicated to the Committee.
.As regards the imprisonment of the trade union leader Francisco Girn Ramos (Case No. ), the Government states that he was indicted on a charge of destroying genuine documents and that there was never any allegation that there had been an infringement of freedom of association. The Government adds that Grancisco Girn has been free since , when the judge ruled that he should be released on bail, although it was not known why a final judgement had not been pronounced at that time. A recommendation has thus been made for a decision be issued as soon as possible and the Committee will be informed accordingly.
.As regards the allegations concerning workers who were killed, wounded and arrested (Case No. ), the Government stated that the acts of violence to which reference had been made probably took place before  October  and that one of the reasons why the previous regime had been deposed was precisely because of the repeated protests against violations of human rights and freedom of association which the Revolutionary Junta was endeavouring to end by all available means. More recently, the Government has declared that a major programme of agrarian reform is currently under way, the socio-economic consequences of which will ensure that the events involved in the present case cannot recur. As regards the death of Trnsito Vsquez, the Government explained that, under a court decision issued on  March , a stay of proceedings was granted concerning the charge relating to wilful homicide and the release was ordered of Mximo Garcia Lpez, Josh Felipe Garcia Vsquez and Sarbelo Garcia Ramirez. The Government adds that the accused had admitted they were members of the Federation of Catholic Peasants of El Salvador (FECCAS) and the Onion of Field Labourers (UTC) and not the Nationalist Democratic Organisation (ORDEN), as had been stated by the complainants.
.As regards the observations made in connection with Case No. , the Government states that, on  June , after a work stoppage had been declared in the ""El Granjero S.A."" undertaking, forces of the Army intervened in order to eject the picketers who had threatened to damage plant equipment. The Government adds that terrorist elements had infiltrated into these groups.
.As regards Case No. , the Government states that it has requested the collaboration of the Ministry of Labour and the Public Prosecutor's Office of the Republic so that appropriate investigations may be made into the events of  December , the results of which will be transmitted in due course. As regards the list supplied by the complainants of workers and peasants who had died, the Government states that their deaths were not the result of repressive action due to their trade union activities and obligations, but rather of the violence which continues to be generated by the extreme left and the extreme right and which, by drawing the armed forces into a purely defensive response, are plunging the country into a bloodbath which has been criticised and deplored by the true citizens of El Salvador.
.With regard to Case No. , in which one of the complainants alleged that five trade unionists had been arrested, the Government states that the events in question were brought about by an illegal strike which bad been declared by the River Lempa Hydroelectric Company Workers' Trade Onion on  and  August . The Government adds that the instigators of the strike violated the provisions of the Constitution by not following the procedure set forth in the Labour Code when they cut off without any advance notice the electricity service throughout the country, which seriously damaged the national economy (with losses exceeding  million colones) and caused the irreparable loss of human lives in hospitals and other medical centres. According to the Government, when the situation reached the point of posing a threat to the national security, since the service involved was one which was indispensable to the community, and as a result of the public outcry, the armed forces intervened in the plant without bloodshed and proceeded to arrest the principal leaders of the strike who - with the exception of those who were not considered to be responsible and who were subsequently released - are now being held in prison, where they are being treated correctly. The Government states that the prisoners are subject to the jurisdiction of military courts, which are now investigating their case in collaboration with their defence counsel.
.With regard to the assassination of Rodolfo Viera, Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer (Case No. ), the Government stated that it had ordered the arrest of the wealthy right-wing businessmen Ricardo Sol Meza and Hans Christ; the latter is currently in Miami and proceedings are at present under way to seek his extradition. The Government adds that the Public Prosecutor has been especially instructed to appoint, on behalf of the State, representatives to take part in the trial being heard by the Fifth Criminal Court and these representatives have already participated in the investigations. The Government points out that Mr Viera was, in addition to being a member of the Salvadorean Communal Onion, a high official of the Government and was looked upon as one of the major proponents of agrarian reform, all of which constituted the motives for his assassination at the wretched hands of the extreme right and extreme left.
.Finally, as regards the allegations concerning the assassination of workers, trade union leaders and school teachers between  October  and  September  (Case No. ) under the presidency of General Carlos Humberto Romero, the Government states that it does not know why the corresponding investigations did not produce any results, if indeed such investigations took place. The Government adds, however, that in order to demonstrate clearly and sincerely that the present rulers of El Salvador are free of any links or compromises with the past, an investigation will be conducted into these deplorable events, the results of which will be transmitted to the Committee as soon as possible.
.Before considering the substance of the various matters raised by the complainants, the Committee would like to express its deep concern at the serious nature of the allegations, most of which refer to the death, assassination, arrest or disappearance of trade unionists and trade union leaders, which have continued to occur even after  October , the date on which the former Government was deposed. While noting the troubled situation which is facing the authorities in El Salvador, the Committee must draw the attention of the Government to the fact that a free and independent trade union movement can develop only in a climate of respect for fundamental human rights, and to the Resolution concerning Trade Onion Rights and their relation to civil liberties adopted by the International Labour Conference in , which states in particular that the concept of trade union rights is totally meaningless in the absence of civil liberties and that the rights conferred on workers' and employers' organisations must be baled on respect for civil liberties.
.The Committee also deplores the fact that in spite of the time which has elapsed, the Government in its observations has still not replied to all the allegations or has done so only incompletely in some of the cases.
.The Committee notes that the Government considers itself free of any responsibility for the events which allegedly occurred before  October . In this connection, the Committee considers, as it already pointed out at its session in February , that there exists a link of continuity between successive governments in the same State and that although a government cannot be held responsible for events which took place under a preceding one, it has a clear responsibility for any consequences which those events might have produced since its accession to power. This principle is particularly applicable as regards the clarification of events which have led to the loss of human lives or the detention of trade unionists who are still being held in prison.
.As regards the allegations concerning the attacks on the lives or persons of trade unionists or trade union leaders, the Committee cannot but deplore the loss of numerous lives and the injuries mentioned in the complaints. The Committee notes the Government's statement that investigations are now under way concerning the events referred to in Cases Nos. ,  and  and, more generally, into the assassinations which allegedly took place between  October  and  December  (Case No. ) concerning which the Government states that an investigation is being ordered, the results of which will be transmitted to the Committee. However, since the Government has not provided information on the death of the trade union leader Tombs Rosales (Case No. ) or the injuries to which reference is made in Cases Nos.  and  and some of the assassinations",-1,1981,El Salvador
290,"referred to in Case No. , the Committee requests the Government to undertake as soon as possible - if it has not already done so - an independent judicial inquiry into these allegations with a view to elucidating the facts in full, determining responsibilities and punishing the guilty parties, and to keep the Committee informed of the results as and when available, of these investigations and those currently under way. The Committee is also of the view that special measures should be taken with a view to guaranteeing the personal security of those persons who are more directly involved in the trade union movement.
.As regards trade union leaders and workers who have been arrested or who have disappeared, the Committee notes that Francisco Girn Ramos has now been set free and that in principle a decision will be issued on his possible guilt on the charge of destroying authentic documents, which will be communicated to the Committee. The Committee also notes that the arrests referred to in Case No.  were the result of an illegal strike in the Rio Lempa Hydroelectric Company which led to the irreparable loss of human lives in hospitals and other medical centres. However, the Committee notes that the Government has not specified the reasons or circumstances which led to the arrest of the trade union leader Rafael Hernndez Olivo, whose present whereabouts are unknown, the arrest of the two members of the National Association of Workers of the Ministry of Agriculture who accompanied Jos Flix Minero on  May  when the latter was assassinated (Case No. ) and that of trade union leaders Enrique Tejada, Antonio Campos Mendoza, Salomn Snchez Mrquez, Vicente Aguirre, Melitn Snchez, Antonio Fuentes and Maximiliano Castro who, according to the complainants, were arrested as they were discussing a list of demands in the premises of the Buses Ruta Urbanos - undertaking and whose present whereabouts are unknown (Case No. ). In this respect, since no information is available on the present situation of the persons mentioned above, and in particular as to whether proceedings have been instigated against them, the Committee cannot but recall that it should be the policy of every government to ensure the right of all detained persons to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment, and point out that the arrest of trade unionists against whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found may involve the restriction of trade union rights and a serious interference with trade union activities. The Committee requests the Government to indicate the motives and circumstances which led to the arrests of the above-mentioned persons and to furnish information on their present situation. More generally, the Committee considers that a contribution would be made towards normalising the trade union situation and labour relations - a necessary objective within the context of the full respect of human rights - and the restoration of social harmony if the Government examined the situation of the arrested persons to whom the complainants refer, with a view to freeing those who may have been arrested for trade union reasons.
.Furthermore, the Committee observes that the Government has not replied to the allegations concerning the threats made against trade unionists and trade union leaders (Cases Nos.  and ), the attack by the armed forces on the premises of FESINCONSTRANS and the destruction of the files of this trade union organisation. The Committee requests the Government to furnish its observations on these matters.",-1,1981,El Salvador
291,".Since  numerous complaints concerning violations of freedom of association in El Salvador have been presented by the following organisations: the United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador (FUSS), the Federation of Unions of Workers in the Food, Clothing, Textile and Allied Industries of El Salvador (FESTIAVTSCES), the Committee for Trade Union Unity of Workers of Central America and Panama (CUSCA), the Trade Unions International of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur Workers, the Trade Unions International of Food, Tobacco, Hotel and Allied Industries Workers, the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the World Federation of Agricultural Workers, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of the Workers of Latin America (CPUSTAL).
.The Committee has already examined most of these cases on several occasions and submitted interim reports to the Governing Body.
.Since then, in the absence of observations from the Government, the Committee adjourned its examination of these cases to February, then May . The Office sent a telegram to the Government on  April  inviting it to submit its observations as soon as possible. In June  the Minister of Labour forwarded additional information.
.El Salvador has not ratified either the freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complaints examined by the Committee were basically of three kinds: first, concerning the violent death and disappearance of trade unionists and former trade unionists; second, arrest of trade union leaders; third, attack on trade union premises and destruction of records.
.At the last examination of the cases in question, in November , the Governing Body, in accordance with the Committee's recommendations, expressed extreme concern at the serious nature of the allegations and observed that various acts had occurred after  October , when the previous Government had been deposed.
.In particular, concerning violent deaths and disappearances, the Governing Body deplored the loss of many human lives and the injuries referred to in the complaints. It noted that investigations had been opened into some of the occurrences and requested the Government to undertake as soon as possible a judicial inquiry into those cases where investigations had not been opened and to inform it of the results.
.In his communication of June , before giving a detailed reply concerning the cases in question, the Minister of Labour stated that, as a human being and as an official, he regretted that in the past acts had occurred in El Salvador which were not perhaps compatible with humane feelings, especially as regards violations of freedom of association such as those denounced to the International Labour Organisation. However, in order to preserve his country's international prestige despite the climate of violence which has prevailed in recent years, resulting in loss of human life and material losses, he stated that he would like to present specific information on the current situation concerning these cases.
.It should therefore be recalled that, in Case No. , the complainants alleged in particular that on  October , workers who were preparing to organise a collection in support of a strike at the El Len factory were attacked by the police, and two of them lost their lives. According to the Government's communication of June , the investigations undertaken and requested from the Ministry of Defence and Public Security confirm that there is no file on events relating to the situation of trade unionists in the El Len factory which occurred under the presidential administration of Colonel Arturo Armando Molina and General Carlos Humberto Romero in  and .
.As regards Case No. , according to a communication of the WCL dated  April , Jos Santos Tiznado and Pedro Gonzlez, leaders of the Salvadorian Peasants' Central, were murdered by uniformed members of the National Guard at midnight, on  May , in the Jsus suburb of the San Ramn municipality in the department of Cuscatln. In addition, Manuel Antonio Carrillo and Jos Antonio Carrillo, former leaders of the Salvadorian Peasants' Central and members of the El Rosario Agricultural and Consumers Co-operative Ltd., were murdered on  June  by members of the forces of repression, as was evident from the calibre of the bullets found near their bodies. As regards Rafael Hernndez Olivo, Secretary General of the Irrigation and Drainage Section of the National Association of workers of the Ministry of Agriculture and Cattle Farming (ANTMAG), who had been transported to the Metapn hospital after being injured in an accident, he had subsequently disappeared, having been arrested by the hacienda police.
.Concerning the homicide of the peasants Jos Santos, Pedro Gonzlez, Manuel Carrillo and Antonio Carrillo, and the disappearance of Rafael Hernndez Olivo, the Government states that the authorities are continuing their investigations.
.In Case No. , the ICFTU alleged, in a communication dated  July , that in a clash with the armed forces on  June , Toms Rosales, a leader of the workers' union of the ""Granja Santa Ins"", had been killed and four other trade unionists had been injured, when the workers at this undertaking had called a peaceful strike in support of a list of wage claims.
.The Government has still not supplied any information on this allegation.
.In Case No. , concerning the murder on  January  of Rodolfo Viera, Secretary General of the Salvadorian Communal Union, and the death of two United States trade unionists Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer, representatives of the AFL-CIO in El Salvador, the Government confirms in its communication of June  that a trial was being held in the fifth criminal court of San Salvador. The accused, Ernesto Sol Meza, has been released on the order of the Supreme Court, after submitting an appeal, and the other accused, Hans Krist, has been acquitted, adds the Government.
.The Committee observes that the Government has supplied certain information on the development of the investigations conducted by the authorities into the death and disappearance of the trade unionists and former trade unionists referred to by the complainants.
.As regards certain events, however, the Committee regrets that despite the time which has elapsed since the complaints were presented, the Government still has not supplied any observations, particularly on the alleged death of Toms Rosales and the injuries inflicted on his fellow workers by the forces of the law on  June  at the Granja Santa Ins. In this respect, the Committee recalls, as it has stated on numerous previous occasions, that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact. It is therefore confident that if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, the latter should recognise the importance for the protection of their own good name of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to the allegations put forward,
.In Case No. , the Committee notes that, according to the Government, an investigation is being made into the homicide of the peasants Jos Santos, Pedro Gonzles, Manuel Carrillo and Antonio Carrillo and the disappearance of Rafael Hernndez Olivo. The Committee again stresses to the Government the need to ensure that the guilty parties are punished and insists that the Government inform it of the results of the current investigations and of the penalties imposed.
.The Committee also notes that in Case No. , the trial in the murder of trade union leader Rodolfo Viera has resulted in the acquittal of one of the accused and that the second has been released pending appeal. In this connection, the Committee must first keenly deplore the murder of these trade unionists. It would also observe that a climate of violence such as that in which the murders were committed constitutes a serious obstacle to the exercise of trade union rights. Consequently, such acts call for effective measures on the part of the authorities. The Committee therefore requests the Government to send it the text of any judgement handed down in this case, and to pursue actively the investigations into these cases.
.During its most recent examination of the substance of these cases, the Committee had also recommended the Governing Body to note that some trade unionists had been released, and had noted that certain arrests were made because of participation in an illegal electricity strike which led to the loss of human lives in hospitals and other welfare centres.
.However, it had also requested the Government to indicate the reasons for and circumstances surrounding the arrests of the leaders Enrique Tejada, Antonio Campos Mendoza, Salomn Snchez Mrquez, Vicente Aguirre, Melitn Snchez, Antonio Fuentes and Maximiliano Castro, and to supply information on their present situation. Recalling that it should be the policy of every government to ensure the right of all detained persons to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment, it pointed out that the arrests of trade unionists against whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found may involve the restriction of trade union rights and a serious interference in trade union activities.
.Lastly,",1,1980,El Salvador
292,"in general terms, it considered that a contribution would be made towards normalising the trade union situation and labour relations - a necessary objective in the context of the full respect of human rights - and the restoration of social harmony if the Government examined the situation of the arrested persons referred to by the complainants, with a view to freeing those arrested for trade union reasons.
.In this connection, the allegations in Case No.  should be recalled. According to CPUSTAL, on  July , trade union leaders Tejada, Mendoza, Mrquez, Aguirre, Snchez, Fuentes and Castro had been arrested by police while discussing a list of claims in the premises of the undertaking Buses Ruta Urbanos -.
.In its communication of June , the Government states, concerning the detention of leaders of the National Union of Workers in the Transport and Allied Industries in the premises of the undertaking Buses Ruta Urbanos -, that a trial is under way.
.The Committee notes that in this case the trade union leaders in question seem to have been in custody for over two years. In this respect, it wishes to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that preventive detention without conviction by a court should not exceed a very brief period and should be intended only to facilitate a judicial inquiry. Holding persons indefinitely in custody without trial is a practice which involves inherent danger of abuse and is for this reason subject to criticism.
.In consequence, the Committee, while noting that a trial is under way, requests the Government to supply the text of the judgement with the grounds therefore, and hopes that, in so far as these trade union leaders have been imprisoned only for legitimate trade union activities, they will be released as soon as possible.""
.The Government was also requested to send its observations on the allegations to which it had not replied, and which, according to the ICFTU in a communication dated  March  relating to Case No. , chiefly concerned an alleged attack by the armed forces on the San Miguel premises of the Federation of Unions of Workers in the Construction, Transport and Allied Industries (FESINCONSTRANS), an organisation affiliated to the ICFTU. During the attack, which is alleged to have taken place on  February  at . p.m., the lives of trade unionists were threatened and trade union records destroyed.
.The Committee regrets, despite the time which has elapsed since the complaint was presented, the absence of the information requested of the Government on this aspect of the case. The Committee notes that this allegation involves principles relating to freedom of association. As it has pointed out before, on receiving an allegation of this kind, the Committee would stress the importance it attaches to certain fundamental principles essential to the exercise of trade union rights, namely that occupation of trade union premises and confiscation of materials and other trade union publications may constitute serious interference by the authorities in trade union affairs. The International Labour Conference, in the Resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties adopted at its th () Session, considered that the right to protection of trade union property is one of the civil liberties which is essential to the normal exercise of trade union rights. Thus, while recognising that neither trade unions nor any other association or individual can be exempt from a search of their premises, the Committee has always considered that, should such action be taken, it should occur only after a warrant has been issued by the ordinary judicial authority, when the latter is satisfied that there are serious grounds for supposing that the necessary evidence for prosecution of a crime will be found, and provided that the search is limited to the purposes for which the warrant was issued. In addition, any authorities who, during a search, exceed the powers conferred on them by law should be punished.
.The Committee therefore urges the Government to forward its observations on the events which occurred on  February  in the San Miguel premises of the trade union federation affiliated to the ICFTU, which according to the complainants was attacked by the armed forces, who also destroyed the trade union records.
.Since , numerous complaints concerning alleged violations of freedom of association in El Salvador have been presented to the Committee by the following organisations: the United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador (FUSS), the Federation of Unions of Workers in the Food, Clothing, Textile and Allied Industries of El Salvador (FESTIAVTSCES), the Committee for Trade Union Unity of Workers of Central America and Panama (CUSCA), the Trade Unions' International of Textile, Clothing and Fur Workers, the Trade Unions' International of Food, Tobacco, Hotel and Allied Industries' Workers, the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the World Federation of Agricultural Workers, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), and the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of Latin American Workers (CPUSTAL).
.The complaints submitted to the Committee include allegations referring to the Assassination, arrest, torture or disappearance of trade union officials and workers, attacks on trade union premises by the armed forces, threats and the destruction of trade union files. The contents of the complaints were successively transmitted to the Government as they were received.
.The Committee has examined Cases Nos. , ,  and  at previous meetings and has presented interim reports to the Governing Body.
.At its session in May , the Committee decided to adjourn its examination of Cases Nos. ,  and  since it had not yet received the detailed information which had been requested from the Government. At its session of November , the Committee once again adjourned its examination of these cases for the same reason and included them in its report under the heading ""Urgent appeals"". At its February  session, the Committee also included Cases Nos. ,  and  under the same heading ""Urgent appeals"" since the Government had failed to provide any detailed information. While noting with concern the troubled situation in El Salvador, the Committee pointed out to the Government that in accordance with the procedural rules currently in force, it could present a report on the substance of the cases pending even if the Government's observations had not been received.
.Given the extremely serious nature of most of the complaints, and since the Government had not provided sufficiently detailed information on the cases pending, the Committee decided at its May  session to apply the procedure contained in paragraphs  and  of its th Report. In accordance with this procedure, the Government was immediately informed that the Chairman of the Committee would make contact, on behalf of the Committee, with representatives of the Government of El Salvador at the th Session of the International Labour Conference in order to draw attention to the various cases in question and discuss the reasons for the delay in the transmission of replies to the allegations contained in these various cases.
.In accordance with the decision adopted by the Committee at its session in May , the Chairman met with the Minister of Labour and Social Security of El Salvador, Mr. Julio Alfredo Samayoa, on  June. The Chairman of the Committee explained the purpose of the meeting. The Minister of Labour stated that his Government's delay in replying to the Committee on the cases pending had been due to the unsettled situation through which his country had been passing for some time and that it was in no way the result of any lack of co-operation by his Government with the ILO and in particular with its supervisory bodies. He then transmitted a communication containing the observations of his Government on these cases, including annexes on Cases Nos.  and . The Minister added that he was prepared to provide any other information which the Committee on Freedom of Association considered necessary.
.Furthermore, the Government had already furnished certain comments on some of the allegations in communications dated , ,  and  May .
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Government states that, the Act which was applied to the case of the ""El Len"" factory (Case No. ) - in which an attack by the police led to the death of two persons - has since been repealed. The Government adds that the investigations which were supposedly ordered by the Government in power at that time did not, for reasons which are unknown, produce any results. The Government states that it considers itself free of any responsibility since the matter concerns acts allegedly committed by the previous Government, with which it has no link of continuity. However, the Government points out that a new inquiry is now being undertaken to clarify the matter, the results of which will be communicated to the Committee.
.As regards the imprisonment of the",-1,1980,El Salvador
293,"trade union leader Francisco Girn Ramos (Case No. ), the Government states that he was indicted on a charge of destroying genuine documents and that there was never any allegation that there had been an infringement of freedom of association. The Government adds that Grancisco Girn has been free since , when the judge ruled that he should be released on bail, although it was not known why a final judgement had not been pronounced at that time. A recommendation has thus been made for a decision be issued as soon as possible and the Committee will be informed accordingly.
.As regards the allegations concerning workers who were killed, wounded and arrested (Case No. ), the Government stated that the acts of violence to which reference had been made probably took place before  October  and that one of the reasons why the previous regime had been deposed was precisely because of the repeated protests against violations of human rights and freedom of association which the Revolutionary Junta was endeavouring to end by all available means. More recently, the Government has declared that a major programme of agrarian reform is currently under way, the socio-economic consequences of which will ensure that the events involved in the present case cannot recur. As regards the death of Trnsito Vsquez, the Government explained that, under a court decision issued on  March , a stay of proceedings was granted concerning the charge relating to wilful homicide and the release was ordered of Mximo Garcia Lpez, Josh Felipe Garcia Vsquez and Sarbelo Garcia Ramirez. The Government adds that the accused had admitted they were members of the Federation of Catholic Peasants of El Salvador (FECCAS) and the Onion of Field Labourers (UTC) and not the Nationalist Democratic Organisation (ORDEN), as had been stated by the complainants.
.As regards the observations made in connection with Case No. , the Government states that, on  June , after a work stoppage had been declared in the ""El Granjero S.A."" undertaking, forces of the Army intervened in order to eject the picketers who had threatened to damage plant equipment. The Government adds that terrorist elements had infiltrated into these groups.
.As regards Case No. , the Government states that it has requested the collaboration of the Ministry of Labour and the Public Prosecutor's Office of the Republic so that appropriate investigations may be made into the events of  December , the results of which will be transmitted in due course. As regards the list supplied by the complainants of workers and peasants who had died, the Government states that their deaths were not the result of repressive action due to their trade union activities and obligations, but rather of the violence which continues to be generated by the extreme left and the extreme right and which, by drawing the armed forces into a purely defensive response, are plunging the country into a bloodbath which has been criticised and deplored by the true citizens of El Salvador.
.With regard to Case No. , in which one of the complainants alleged that five trade unionists had been arrested, the Government states that the events in question were brought about by an illegal strike which bad been declared by the River Lempa Hydroelectric Company Workers' Trade Onion on  and  August . The Government adds that the instigators of the strike violated the provisions of the Constitution by not following the procedure set forth in the Labour Code when they cut off without any advance notice the electricity service throughout the country, which seriously damaged the national economy (with losses exceeding  million colones) and caused the irreparable loss of human lives in hospitals and other medical centres. According to the Government, when the situation reached the point of posing a threat to the national security, since the service involved was one which was indispensable to the community, and as a result of the public outcry, the armed forces intervened in the plant without bloodshed and proceeded to arrest the principal leaders of the strike who - with the exception of those who were not considered to be responsible and who were subsequently released - are now being held in prison, where they are being treated correctly. The Government states that the prisoners are subject to the jurisdiction of military courts, which are now investigating their case in collaboration with their defence counsel.
.With regard to the assassination of Rodolfo Viera, Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer (Case No. ), the Government stated that it had ordered the arrest of the wealthy right-wing businessmen Ricardo Sol Meza and Hans Christ; the latter is currently in Miami and proceedings are at present under way to seek his extradition. The Government adds that the Public Prosecutor has been especially instructed to appoint, on behalf of the State, representatives to take part in the trial being heard by the Fifth Criminal Court and these representatives have already participated in the investigations. The Government points out that Mr Viera was, in addition to being a member of the Salvadorean Communal Onion, a high official of the Government and was looked upon as one of the major proponents of agrarian reform, all of which constituted the motives for his assassination at the wretched hands of the extreme right and extreme left.
.Finally, as regards the allegations concerning the assassination of workers, trade union leaders and school teachers between  October  and  September  (Case No. ) under the presidency of General Carlos Humberto Romero, the Government states that it does not know why the corresponding investigations did not produce any results, if indeed such investigations took place. The Government adds, however, that in order to demonstrate clearly and sincerely that the present rulers of El Salvador are free of any links or compromises with the past, an investigation will be conducted into these deplorable events, the results of which will be transmitted to the Committee as soon as possible.
.Before considering the substance of the various matters raised by the complainants, the Committee would like to express its deep concern at the serious nature of the allegations, most of which refer to the death, assassination, arrest or disappearance of trade unionists and trade union leaders, which have continued to occur even after  October , the date on which the former Government was deposed. While noting the troubled situation which is facing the authorities in El Salvador, the Committee must draw the attention of the Government to the fact that a free and independent trade union movement can develop only in a climate of respect for fundamental human rights, and to the Resolution concerning Trade Onion Rights and their relation to civil liberties adopted by the International Labour Conference in , which states in particular that the concept of trade union rights is totally meaningless in the absence of civil liberties and that the rights conferred on workers' and employers' organisations must be baled on respect for civil liberties.
.The Committee also deplores the fact that in spite of the time which has elapsed, the Government in its observations has still not replied to all the allegations or has done so only incompletely in some of the cases.
.The Committee notes that the Government considers itself free of any responsibility for the events which allegedly occurred before  October . In this connection, the Committee considers, as it already pointed out at its session in February , that there exists a link of continuity between successive governments in the same State and that although a government cannot be held responsible for events which took place under a preceding one, it has a clear responsibility for any consequences which those events might have produced since its accession to power. This principle is particularly applicable as regards the clarification of events which have led to the loss of human lives or the detention of trade unionists who are still being held in prison.
.As regards the allegations concerning the attacks on the lives or persons of trade unionists or trade union leaders, the Committee cannot but deplore the loss of numerous lives and the injuries mentioned in the complaints. The Committee notes the Government's statement that investigations are now under way concerning the events referred to in Cases Nos. ,  and  and, more generally, into the assassinations which allegedly took place between  October  and  December  (Case No. ) concerning which the Government states that an investigation is being ordered, the results of which will be transmitted to the Committee. However, since the Government has not provided information on the death of the trade union leader Tombs Rosales (Case No. ) or the injuries to which reference is made in Cases Nos.  and  and some of the assassinations referred to in Case No. , the Committee requests the Government to undertake as soon as possible - if it has not already done so - an independent judicial inquiry into these allegations with a view to elucidating",-1,1980,El Salvador
294,"the facts in full, determining responsibilities and punishing the guilty parties, and to keep the Committee informed of the results as and when available, of these investigations and those currently under way. The Committee is also of the view that special measures should be taken with a view to guaranteeing the personal security of those persons who are more directly involved in the trade union movement.
.As regards trade union leaders and workers who have been arrested or who have disappeared, the Committee notes that Francisco Girn Ramos has now been set free and that in principle a decision will be issued on his possible guilt on the charge of destroying authentic documents, which will be communicated to the Committee. The Committee also notes that the arrests referred to in Case No.  were the result of an illegal strike in the Rio Lempa Hydroelectric Company which led to the irreparable loss of human lives in hospitals and other medical centres. However, the Committee notes that the Government has not specified the reasons or circumstances which led to the arrest of the trade union leader Rafael Hernndez Olivo, whose present whereabouts are unknown, the arrest of the two members of the National Association of Workers of the Ministry of Agriculture who accompanied Jos Flix Minero on  May  when the latter was assassinated (Case No. ) and that of trade union leaders Enrique Tejada, Antonio Campos Mendoza, Salomn Snchez Mrquez, Vicente Aguirre, Melitn Snchez, Antonio Fuentes and Maximiliano Castro who, according to the complainants, were arrested as they were discussing a list of demands in the premises of the Buses Ruta Urbanos - undertaking and whose present whereabouts are unknown (Case No. ). In this respect, since no information is available on the present situation of the persons mentioned above, and in particular as to whether proceedings have been instigated against them, the Committee cannot but recall that it should be the policy of every government to ensure the right of all detained persons to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment, and point out that the arrest of trade unionists against whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found may involve the restriction of trade union rights and a serious interference with trade union activities. The Committee requests the Government to indicate the motives and circumstances which led to the arrests of the above-mentioned persons and to furnish information on their present situation. More generally, the Committee considers that a contribution would be made towards normalising the trade union situation and labour relations - a necessary objective within the context of the full respect of human rights - and the restoration of social harmony if the Government examined the situation of the arrested persons to whom the complainants refer, with a view to freeing those who may have been arrested for trade union reasons.
.Furthermore, the Committee observes that the Government has not replied to the allegations concerning the threats made against trade unionists and trade union leaders (Cases Nos.  and ), the attack by the armed forces on the premises of FESINCONSTRANS and the destruction of the files of this trade union organisation. The Committee requests the Government to furnish its observations on these matters.",-1,1980,El Salvador
295,".The Committee has examined these cases on several occasions, most recently at its November  meeting when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body. Subsequently, the Government sent further information in a communication dated  March .
.El Salvador has not ratified either the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complaint presented by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) on  July  is concerned mainly with the death on  June  of Toms Rosales, a leader of the workers' union Granja Santa Ins, and the wounding of four other trade unionists during clashes with the armed forces which occurred in connection with a peaceful strike called by them in support of a number of wage claims.
.Since the Government supplied no information on this aspect of the case in November , the Committee reiterated its request that the Government communicate its observations concerning the alleged killing of Toms Rosales and wounding of four other trade unionists on  June  at the undertaking of El Grarjero S. A.
.In its reply dated  March , the Government does not refute any of these allegations but merely repeats the information submitted on  September , to the effect that, on  June , Carlos Hernndez was arrested for disturbing the peace and threatening to damage the undertaking's property and that he was subsequently released on  June .
.The Committee again notes this information. It observes, however, that the Government does not deny the allegations of the complainant.
.In the circumstances, the Committee can only deplore the alleged violent death of the union leader, Toms Rosales, and the injuries inflicted by the armed forces on other Granja Santa Ins trade unionists on  June  in the course of a labour dispute. Given the fact that an independent and free trade union movement can develop only in a climate of respect for basic human rights, the committee urges the Government to take steps to prevent any loss of human life.
.The complaint presented by the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) refers to the assassination of trade union leaders. According to the WCL in a communication dated  April , Jos Santos Tiznado and Pedro Gonzals, leaders of the Salvadorian Peasants' Central, were assassinated by uniformed members of the National Guard at midnight on  May  in the Jsus suburb of San Ramn in the Department of Cuscatln. The complainant further alleges that Manual Antonio Carrillo and Jos Antonio Carrillo, former leaders o the Salvadorian Peasants' Central and members of the El Rosario Agricultural and Consumers' Co-operative Limited, were assassinated on  June  by members of repressive forces, basing their allegations on the calibre of the bullets found near the dead bodies. It also states that Rafael Hernndez Olivo, Secretary General of the Irrigation and Drainage Section of the National Association of Workers of the-Ministry of Agriculture and Cattle Farming (ANTMAG), who had been transported to the Metapn Hospital after being injured in an accident, was subsequently arrested by the rural police and that his whereabouts were unknown.
.In November , the Committee noted the Government's statement that investigations were being made into the death of the four peasants and the disappearance of the Secretary General of ANTMAG. The Committee emphasised the importance that the guilty parties should be tried and punished and that the Government should keep it informed of the results of the investigation and of the action taken against those responsible.
.In its reply dated  March , the Government states that the information concerning this complaint has been communicated to the relevant bodies to help them in their inquiries.
.The Committee observes that the alleged assassination of the peasant, trade unionists occurred in May and June , since when the Government has not denied the facts and states that investigations are still under way. The Committee deeply regrets that the Government has not yet supplied any specific information on the circumstances surrounding the alleged death of Jos Santos Tiznado, Pedro Gonzals, Marvel Antonio Carrillo and Jos Antonio Carrillo and the disappearance of Rafael Hernndez Olivo. The Committee urges the Government to transmit this information without delay. It must recall the importance in all cases involving the loss of human life of carrying out an independent judicial inquiry. As the Committee has stated in the past,' the atmosphere of confidence essential for social dialogue could be restored more easily once the responsibilities of those concerned have been established and the persons who have abused their powers have been dealt with according to law.
.The complaint presented by the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of Latin American Workers (CPUSTAI) concerns the arrest by the police on  July  of the trade union leaders Tejada, Mendoza, Mrguez, Aguirre, Snchez, Fuentes and Castro, all of whom were arrested during a discussion of a list of grievances in the premises of the undertaking Buses Ruta Urbanos -.
.In a communication dated June , the Government stated, with respect to the arrest of members of the Executive Committee of the National Union of Workers in Transport and Allied industries in the premises of the undertaking Buses Ruta Urbanos , that a trial was under way.
.In its communication dated  March , the Government indicates that information regarding Case No.  will be submitted separately.
.The Committee once again urges the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of this trial and, in particular, to indicate whether the trade unionists Tejada, Mendoza, Mrguez, Aguirre, Snchez, Fuentes and Castro cited by name by the complainants, have been released.
.In this case, the ICFTU denounced the assassination on  January  o Rodolfo Viera, Secretary General of the Salvadorian Communal Union, and the death on  January  of two American trade unionists, Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer, representatives of the AFL-CIO in El Salvador, while staying at the Hotel Sheraton in San Salvador where they were working on an agrarian reform programme to improve living and working conditions in rural areas.
.In June , the Government stated that a trial was being held in the Fifth Criminal Court of San Salvador and that the accused, Ernesto Sol Meza, had been released by order of the Supreme Court after submitting an appeal, and that the other accused, Hans Krist, had been acquitted. The Committee therefore urged the Government to pursue actively its investigations into the case and to send in the text of any judgement handed down.
.In its communication dated  March , the Government repeats its earlier statement that the trial is being held in the Fifth Criminal court, that one of the accused has been released by order of the Supreme Court and that the other has been acquitted. It adds that the judgement concerning other accused persons considered to be the actual perpetrators of the crime was handed down early in December  but that the parties concerned have lodged an appeal.
.The Committee notes the Government's statement and requests it to continue keeping it informed of developments in this case. The Committee feels that it would be of the utmost value for it to have the text of the final judgement that will be handed down.
.In the circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:(a) In general terms, the Committee once again deeply deplores the violent death of several trade union leaders and, given the fact that an independent and free trade union movement car develop only in a climate of respect for basic human rights, urges the Government to take action to prevent any loss of human life. The Committee urges the Government to transmit without delay information on the circumstances in which these trade union leaders lost their lives.(b) In Case No. , the Committee urges the Government to communicate information on the outcome of the trial concerning the arrest o members of the Executive Committee of the National Union of workers in Transport and Allied Industries, which occurred almost three years ago - on  July  - when the trade unionists concerned were discussing a list of wage claims in the premises of the undertaking Buses Ruta Urbanos -. The Committee urges the Government to indicate whether the trade unionists Tejada, Mendoza, Mrguez, Aguirre, Snchez, Fuentes and Castro, cited by name by the complainants, have been released.(c) In Case No. , the Committee notes that the trial of the presumed perpetrators of the assassination of the trade union leader, Rodolfo Viera, and of Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer, two American trade unionists representing the AFI-CIC in El Salvador, is still under way. The Committee once again requests the Government to continue communicating detailed information on the case, including the text of the final judgement once it has been handed down.
.Since  numerous complaints concerning violations of freedom of association in El Salvador have been presented by the following organisations: the United Trade Union",1,1980,El Salvador
296,"Federation of El Salvador (FUSS), the Federation of Unions of Workers in the Food, Clothing, Textile and Allied Industries of El Salvador (FESTIAVTSCES), the Committee for Trade Union Unity of Workers of Central America and Panama (CUSCA), the Trade Unions International of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur Workers, the Trade Unions International of Food, Tobacco, Hotel and Allied Industries Workers, the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the World Federation of Agricultural Workers, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of the Workers of Latin America (CPUSTAL).
.The Committee has already examined most of these cases on several occasions and submitted interim reports to the Governing Body.
.Since then, in the absence of observations from the Government, the Committee adjourned its examination of these cases to February, then May . The Office sent a telegram to the Government on  April  inviting it to submit its observations as soon as possible. In June  the Minister of Labour forwarded additional information.
.El Salvador has not ratified either the freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complaints examined by the Committee were basically of three kinds: first, concerning the violent death and disappearance of trade unionists and former trade unionists; second, arrest of trade union leaders; third, attack on trade union premises and destruction of records.
.At the last examination of the cases in question, in November , the Governing Body, in accordance with the Committee's recommendations, expressed extreme concern at the serious nature of the allegations and observed that various acts had occurred after  October , when the previous Government had been deposed.
.In particular, concerning violent deaths and disappearances, the Governing Body deplored the loss of many human lives and the injuries referred to in the complaints. It noted that investigations had been opened into some of the occurrences and requested the Government to undertake as soon as possible a judicial inquiry into those cases where investigations had not been opened and to inform it of the results.
.In his communication of June , before giving a detailed reply concerning the cases in question, the Minister of Labour stated that, as a human being and as an official, he regretted that in the past acts had occurred in El Salvador which were not perhaps compatible with humane feelings, especially as regards violations of freedom of association such as those denounced to the International Labour Organisation. However, in order to preserve his country's international prestige despite the climate of violence which has prevailed in recent years, resulting in loss of human life and material losses, he stated that he would like to present specific information on the current situation concerning these cases.
.It should therefore be recalled that, in Case No. , the complainants alleged in particular that on  October , workers who were preparing to organise a collection in support of a strike at the El Len factory were attacked by the police, and two of them lost their lives. According to the Government's communication of June , the investigations undertaken and requested from the Ministry of Defence and Public Security confirm that there is no file on events relating to the situation of trade unionists in the El Len factory which occurred under the presidential administration of Colonel Arturo Armando Molina and General Carlos Humberto Romero in  and .
.As regards Case No. , according to a communication of the WCL dated  April , Jos Santos Tiznado and Pedro Gonzlez, leaders of the Salvadorian Peasants' Central, were murdered by uniformed members of the National Guard at midnight, on  May , in the Jsus suburb of the San Ramn municipality in the department of Cuscatln. In addition, Manuel Antonio Carrillo and Jos Antonio Carrillo, former leaders of the Salvadorian Peasants' Central and members of the El Rosario Agricultural and Consumers Co-operative Ltd., were murdered on  June  by members of the forces of repression, as was evident from the calibre of the bullets found near their bodies. As regards Rafael Hernndez Olivo, Secretary General of the Irrigation and Drainage Section of the National Association of workers of the Ministry of Agriculture and Cattle Farming (ANTMAG), who had been transported to the Metapn hospital after being injured in an accident, he had subsequently disappeared, having been arrested by the hacienda police.
.Concerning the homicide of the peasants Jos Santos, Pedro Gonzlez, Manuel Carrillo and Antonio Carrillo, and the disappearance of Rafael Hernndez Olivo, the Government states that the authorities are continuing their investigations.
.In Case No. , the ICFTU alleged, in a communication dated  July , that in a clash with the armed forces on  June , Toms Rosales, a leader of the workers' union of the ""Granja Santa Ins"", had been killed and four other trade unionists had been injured, when the workers at this undertaking had called a peaceful strike in support of a list of wage claims.
.The Government has still not supplied any information on this allegation.
.In Case No. , concerning the murder on  January  of Rodolfo Viera, Secretary General of the Salvadorian Communal Union, and the death of two United States trade unionists Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer, representatives of the AFL-CIO in El Salvador, the Government confirms in its communication of June  that a trial was being held in the fifth criminal court of San Salvador. The accused, Ernesto Sol Meza, has been released on the order of the Supreme Court, after submitting an appeal, and the other accused, Hans Krist, has been acquitted, adds the Government.
.The Committee observes that the Government has supplied certain information on the development of the investigations conducted by the authorities into the death and disappearance of the trade unionists and former trade unionists referred to by the complainants.
.As regards certain events, however, the Committee regrets that despite the time which has elapsed since the complaints were presented, the Government still has not supplied any observations, particularly on the alleged death of Toms Rosales and the injuries inflicted on his fellow workers by the forces of the law on  June  at the Granja Santa Ins. In this respect, the Committee recalls, as it has stated on numerous previous occasions, that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact. It is therefore confident that if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, the latter should recognise the importance for the protection of their own good name of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to the allegations put forward,
.In Case No. , the Committee notes that, according to the Government, an investigation is being made into the homicide of the peasants Jos Santos, Pedro Gonzles, Manuel Carrillo and Antonio Carrillo and the disappearance of Rafael Hernndez Olivo. The Committee again stresses to the Government the need to ensure that the guilty parties are punished and insists that the Government inform it of the results of the current investigations and of the penalties imposed.
.The Committee also notes that in Case No. , the trial in the murder of trade union leader Rodolfo Viera has resulted in the acquittal of one of the accused and that the second has been released pending appeal. In this connection, the Committee must first keenly deplore the murder of these trade unionists. It would also observe that a climate of violence such as that in which the murders were committed constitutes a serious obstacle to the exercise of trade union rights. Consequently, such acts call for effective measures on the part of the authorities. The Committee therefore requests the Government to send it the text of any judgement handed down in this case, and to pursue actively the investigations into these cases.
.During its most recent examination of the substance of these cases, the Committee had also recommended the Governing Body to note that some trade unionists had been released, and had noted that certain arrests were made because of participation in an illegal electricity strike which led to the loss of human lives in hospitals and other welfare centres.
.However, it had also requested the Government to indicate the reasons for and circumstances surrounding the arrests of the leaders Enrique Tejada, Antonio Campos Mendoza, Salomn Snchez Mrquez, Vicente Aguirre, Melitn Snchez, Antonio Fuentes and Maximiliano Castro, and to supply information on their present situation. Recalling that it should be the policy of every government to ensure the right of all detained persons to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment, it pointed out that the arrests of trade unionists against whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found may involve the restriction of trade union rights and a serious interference in trade union activities.
.Lastly, in general terms, it considered that a contribution would be made towards normalising the trade union situation and labour relations - a necessary objective",1,1980,El Salvador
297,"in the context of the full respect of human rights - and the restoration of social harmony if the Government examined the situation of the arrested persons referred to by the complainants, with a view to freeing those arrested for trade union reasons.
.In this connection, the allegations in Case No.  should be recalled. According to CPUSTAL, on  July , trade union leaders Tejada, Mendoza, Mrquez, Aguirre, Snchez, Fuentes and Castro had been arrested by police while discussing a list of claims in the premises of the undertaking Buses Ruta Urbanos -.
.In its communication of June , the Government states, concerning the detention of leaders of the National Union of Workers in the Transport and Allied Industries in the premises of the undertaking Buses Ruta Urbanos -, that a trial is under way.
.The Committee notes that in this case the trade union leaders in question seem to have been in custody for over two years. In this respect, it wishes to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that preventive detention without conviction by a court should not exceed a very brief period and should be intended only to facilitate a judicial inquiry. Holding persons indefinitely in custody without trial is a practice which involves inherent danger of abuse and is for this reason subject to criticism.
.In consequence, the Committee, while noting that a trial is under way, requests the Government to supply the text of the judgement with the grounds therefore, and hopes that, in so far as these trade union leaders have been imprisoned only for legitimate trade union activities, they will be released as soon as possible.""
.The Government was also requested to send its observations on the allegations to which it had not replied, and which, according to the ICFTU in a communication dated  March  relating to Case No. , chiefly concerned an alleged attack by the armed forces on the San Miguel premises of the Federation of Unions of Workers in the Construction, Transport and Allied Industries (FESINCONSTRANS), an organisation affiliated to the ICFTU. During the attack, which is alleged to have taken place on  February  at . p.m., the lives of trade unionists were threatened and trade union records destroyed.
.The Committee regrets, despite the time which has elapsed since the complaint was presented, the absence of the information requested of the Government on this aspect of the case. The Committee notes that this allegation involves principles relating to freedom of association. As it has pointed out before, on receiving an allegation of this kind, the Committee would stress the importance it attaches to certain fundamental principles essential to the exercise of trade union rights, namely that occupation of trade union premises and confiscation of materials and other trade union publications may constitute serious interference by the authorities in trade union affairs. The International Labour Conference, in the Resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties adopted at its th () Session, considered that the right to protection of trade union property is one of the civil liberties which is essential to the normal exercise of trade union rights. Thus, while recognising that neither trade unions nor any other association or individual can be exempt from a search of their premises, the Committee has always considered that, should such action be taken, it should occur only after a warrant has been issued by the ordinary judicial authority, when the latter is satisfied that there are serious grounds for supposing that the necessary evidence for prosecution of a crime will be found, and provided that the search is limited to the purposes for which the warrant was issued. In addition, any authorities who, during a search, exceed the powers conferred on them by law should be punished.
.The Committee therefore urges the Government to forward its observations on the events which occurred on  February  in the San Miguel premises of the trade union federation affiliated to the ICFTU, which according to the complainants was attacked by the armed forces, who also destroyed the trade union records.
.Since , numerous complaints concerning alleged violations of freedom of association in El Salvador have been presented to the Committee by the following organisations: the United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador (FUSS), the Federation of Unions of Workers in the Food, Clothing, Textile and Allied Industries of El Salvador (FESTIAVTSCES), the Committee for Trade Union Unity of Workers of Central America and Panama (CUSCA), the Trade Unions' International of Textile, Clothing and Fur Workers, the Trade Unions' International of Food, Tobacco, Hotel and Allied Industries' Workers, the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the World Federation of Agricultural Workers, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), and the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of Latin American Workers (CPUSTAL).
.The complaints submitted to the Committee include allegations referring to the Assassination, arrest, torture or disappearance of trade union officials and workers, attacks on trade union premises by the armed forces, threats and the destruction of trade union files. The contents of the complaints were successively transmitted to the Government as they were received.
.The Committee has examined Cases Nos. , ,  and  at previous meetings and has presented interim reports to the Governing Body.
.At its session in May , the Committee decided to adjourn its examination of Cases Nos. ,  and  since it had not yet received the detailed information which had been requested from the Government. At its session of November , the Committee once again adjourned its examination of these cases for the same reason and included them in its report under the heading ""Urgent appeals"". At its February  session, the Committee also included Cases Nos. ,  and  under the same heading ""Urgent appeals"" since the Government had failed to provide any detailed information. While noting with concern the troubled situation in El Salvador, the Committee pointed out to the Government that in accordance with the procedural rules currently in force, it could present a report on the substance of the cases pending even if the Government's observations had not been received.
.Given the extremely serious nature of most of the complaints, and since the Government had not provided sufficiently detailed information on the cases pending, the Committee decided at its May  session to apply the procedure contained in paragraphs  and  of its th Report. In accordance with this procedure, the Government was immediately informed that the Chairman of the Committee would make contact, on behalf of the Committee, with representatives of the Government of El Salvador at the th Session of the International Labour Conference in order to draw attention to the various cases in question and discuss the reasons for the delay in the transmission of replies to the allegations contained in these various cases.
.In accordance with the decision adopted by the Committee at its session in May , the Chairman met with the Minister of Labour and Social Security of El Salvador, Mr. Julio Alfredo Samayoa, on  June. The Chairman of the Committee explained the purpose of the meeting. The Minister of Labour stated that his Government's delay in replying to the Committee on the cases pending had been due to the unsettled situation through which his country had been passing for some time and that it was in no way the result of any lack of co-operation by his Government with the ILO and in particular with its supervisory bodies. He then transmitted a communication containing the observations of his Government on these cases, including annexes on Cases Nos.  and . The Minister added that he was prepared to provide any other information which the Committee on Freedom of Association considered necessary.
.Furthermore, the Government had already furnished certain comments on some of the allegations in communications dated , ,  and  May .
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Government states that, the Act which was applied to the case of the ""El Len"" factory (Case No. ) - in which an attack by the police led to the death of two persons - has since been repealed. The Government adds that the investigations which were supposedly ordered by the Government in power at that time did not, for reasons which are unknown, produce any results. The Government states that it considers itself free of any responsibility since the matter concerns acts allegedly committed by the previous Government, with which it has no link of continuity. However, the Government points out that a new inquiry is now being undertaken to clarify the matter, the results of which will be communicated to the Committee.
.As regards the imprisonment of the trade union leader Francisco Girn Ramos (Case No. ), the Government states that he was indicted on a charge of destroying genuine documents and",-1,1980,El Salvador
298,"that there was never any allegation that there had been an infringement of freedom of association. The Government adds that Grancisco Girn has been free since , when the judge ruled that he should be released on bail, although it was not known why a final judgement had not been pronounced at that time. A recommendation has thus been made for a decision be issued as soon as possible and the Committee will be informed accordingly.
.As regards the allegations concerning workers who were killed, wounded and arrested (Case No. ), the Government stated that the acts of violence to which reference had been made probably took place before  October  and that one of the reasons why the previous regime had been deposed was precisely because of the repeated protests against violations of human rights and freedom of association which the Revolutionary Junta was endeavouring to end by all available means. More recently, the Government has declared that a major programme of agrarian reform is currently under way, the socio-economic consequences of which will ensure that the events involved in the present case cannot recur. As regards the death of Trnsito Vsquez, the Government explained that, under a court decision issued on  March , a stay of proceedings was granted concerning the charge relating to wilful homicide and the release was ordered of Mximo Garcia Lpez, Josh Felipe Garcia Vsquez and Sarbelo Garcia Ramirez. The Government adds that the accused had admitted they were members of the Federation of Catholic Peasants of El Salvador (FECCAS) and the Onion of Field Labourers (UTC) and not the Nationalist Democratic Organisation (ORDEN), as had been stated by the complainants.
.As regards the observations made in connection with Case No. , the Government states that, on  June , after a work stoppage had been declared in the ""El Granjero S.A."" undertaking, forces of the Army intervened in order to eject the picketers who had threatened to damage plant equipment. The Government adds that terrorist elements had infiltrated into these groups.
.As regards Case No. , the Government states that it has requested the collaboration of the Ministry of Labour and the Public Prosecutor's Office of the Republic so that appropriate investigations may be made into the events of  December , the results of which will be transmitted in due course. As regards the list supplied by the complainants of workers and peasants who had died, the Government states that their deaths were not the result of repressive action due to their trade union activities and obligations, but rather of the violence which continues to be generated by the extreme left and the extreme right and which, by drawing the armed forces into a purely defensive response, are plunging the country into a bloodbath which has been criticised and deplored by the true citizens of El Salvador.
.With regard to Case No. , in which one of the complainants alleged that five trade unionists had been arrested, the Government states that the events in question were brought about by an illegal strike which bad been declared by the River Lempa Hydroelectric Company Workers' Trade Onion on  and  August . The Government adds that the instigators of the strike violated the provisions of the Constitution by not following the procedure set forth in the Labour Code when they cut off without any advance notice the electricity service throughout the country, which seriously damaged the national economy (with losses exceeding  million colones) and caused the irreparable loss of human lives in hospitals and other medical centres. According to the Government, when the situation reached the point of posing a threat to the national security, since the service involved was one which was indispensable to the community, and as a result of the public outcry, the armed forces intervened in the plant without bloodshed and proceeded to arrest the principal leaders of the strike who - with the exception of those who were not considered to be responsible and who were subsequently released - are now being held in prison, where they are being treated correctly. The Government states that the prisoners are subject to the jurisdiction of military courts, which are now investigating their case in collaboration with their defence counsel.
.With regard to the assassination of Rodolfo Viera, Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer (Case No. ), the Government stated that it had ordered the arrest of the wealthy right-wing businessmen Ricardo Sol Meza and Hans Christ; the latter is currently in Miami and proceedings are at present under way to seek his extradition. The Government adds that the Public Prosecutor has been especially instructed to appoint, on behalf of the State, representatives to take part in the trial being heard by the Fifth Criminal Court and these representatives have already participated in the investigations. The Government points out that Mr Viera was, in addition to being a member of the Salvadorean Communal Onion, a high official of the Government and was looked upon as one of the major proponents of agrarian reform, all of which constituted the motives for his assassination at the wretched hands of the extreme right and extreme left.
.Finally, as regards the allegations concerning the assassination of workers, trade union leaders and school teachers between  October  and  September  (Case No. ) under the presidency of General Carlos Humberto Romero, the Government states that it does not know why the corresponding investigations did not produce any results, if indeed such investigations took place. The Government adds, however, that in order to demonstrate clearly and sincerely that the present rulers of El Salvador are free of any links or compromises with the past, an investigation will be conducted into these deplorable events, the results of which will be transmitted to the Committee as soon as possible.
.Before considering the substance of the various matters raised by the complainants, the Committee would like to express its deep concern at the serious nature of the allegations, most of which refer to the death, assassination, arrest or disappearance of trade unionists and trade union leaders, which have continued to occur even after  October , the date on which the former Government was deposed. While noting the troubled situation which is facing the authorities in El Salvador, the Committee must draw the attention of the Government to the fact that a free and independent trade union movement can develop only in a climate of respect for fundamental human rights, and to the Resolution concerning Trade Onion Rights and their relation to civil liberties adopted by the International Labour Conference in , which states in particular that the concept of trade union rights is totally meaningless in the absence of civil liberties and that the rights conferred on workers' and employers' organisations must be baled on respect for civil liberties.
.The Committee also deplores the fact that in spite of the time which has elapsed, the Government in its observations has still not replied to all the allegations or has done so only incompletely in some of the cases.
.The Committee notes that the Government considers itself free of any responsibility for the events which allegedly occurred before  October . In this connection, the Committee considers, as it already pointed out at its session in February , that there exists a link of continuity between successive governments in the same State and that although a government cannot be held responsible for events which took place under a preceding one, it has a clear responsibility for any consequences which those events might have produced since its accession to power. This principle is particularly applicable as regards the clarification of events which have led to the loss of human lives or the detention of trade unionists who are still being held in prison.
.As regards the allegations concerning the attacks on the lives or persons of trade unionists or trade union leaders, the Committee cannot but deplore the loss of numerous lives and the injuries mentioned in the complaints. The Committee notes the Government's statement that investigations are now under way concerning the events referred to in Cases Nos. ,  and  and, more generally, into the assassinations which allegedly took place between  October  and  December  (Case No. ) concerning which the Government states that an investigation is being ordered, the results of which will be transmitted to the Committee. However, since the Government has not provided information on the death of the trade union leader Tombs Rosales (Case No. ) or the injuries to which reference is made in Cases Nos.  and  and some of the assassinations referred to in Case No. , the Committee requests the Government to undertake as soon as possible - if it has not already done so - an independent judicial inquiry into these allegations with a view to elucidating the facts in full, determining responsibilities and punishing the guilty parties, and to keep the Committee informed of the results as and when available,",-1,1980,El Salvador
299,"of these investigations and those currently under way. The Committee is also of the view that special measures should be taken with a view to guaranteeing the personal security of those persons who are more directly involved in the trade union movement.
.As regards trade union leaders and workers who have been arrested or who have disappeared, the Committee notes that Francisco Girn Ramos has now been set free and that in principle a decision will be issued on his possible guilt on the charge of destroying authentic documents, which will be communicated to the Committee. The Committee also notes that the arrests referred to in Case No.  were the result of an illegal strike in the Rio Lempa Hydroelectric Company which led to the irreparable loss of human lives in hospitals and other medical centres. However, the Committee notes that the Government has not specified the reasons or circumstances which led to the arrest of the trade union leader Rafael Hernndez Olivo, whose present whereabouts are unknown, the arrest of the two members of the National Association of Workers of the Ministry of Agriculture who accompanied Jos Flix Minero on  May  when the latter was assassinated (Case No. ) and that of trade union leaders Enrique Tejada, Antonio Campos Mendoza, Salomn Snchez Mrquez, Vicente Aguirre, Melitn Snchez, Antonio Fuentes and Maximiliano Castro who, according to the complainants, were arrested as they were discussing a list of demands in the premises of the Buses Ruta Urbanos - undertaking and whose present whereabouts are unknown (Case No. ). In this respect, since no information is available on the present situation of the persons mentioned above, and in particular as to whether proceedings have been instigated against them, the Committee cannot but recall that it should be the policy of every government to ensure the right of all detained persons to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment, and point out that the arrest of trade unionists against whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found may involve the restriction of trade union rights and a serious interference with trade union activities. The Committee requests the Government to indicate the motives and circumstances which led to the arrests of the above-mentioned persons and to furnish information on their present situation. More generally, the Committee considers that a contribution would be made towards normalising the trade union situation and labour relations - a necessary objective within the context of the full respect of human rights - and the restoration of social harmony if the Government examined the situation of the arrested persons to whom the complainants refer, with a view to freeing those who may have been arrested for trade union reasons.
.Furthermore, the Committee observes that the Government has not replied to the allegations concerning the threats made against trade unionists and trade union leaders (Cases Nos.  and ), the attack by the armed forces on the premises of FESINCONSTRANS and the destruction of the files of this trade union organisation. The Committee requests the Government to furnish its observations on these matters.",-1,1980,El Salvador
300,".The Committee last examined these cases at its February  meeting, in the light of information obtained during a direct contacts mission conducted in El Salvador from  to  January . (See rd Report of the Committee, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session (February-March ).)
.The Committee had already examined Case No.  at its meetings in November , November , November , May  and May  (see th, th, th, th and th Reports of the Committee); Case No.  at its meetings in November , November , May  and May  (see th, th, th and th Reports of the Committee); Case No.  at its meetings in November , November , May  and May  (see th, th, th and th Reports of the Committee); Case No.  at its meetings in May  and May  (see th and th Reports of the Committee); and Case No.  at its meeting in November  (see th Report of the Committee).
.Since these cases were last examined by the Committee, new allegations have been submitted by the following organisations: the World Confederation of Organisations of the Teaching Profession ( May ), the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions ( May and  June ), the World Federation of Trade Unions ( May ) and the United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador ( June,  and  July,  September,  October and  December ). The Government submitted certain observations in communications dated  July,  August and  September ,  and  January,  and  February and  April .
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee notes with concern that since the last examination of the case, the complainant organisations have submitted extremely serious allegations concerning the death and arrest of trade union officials and trade unionists, the searching of the headquarters of a trade union organisation and various actions of interference and anti-trade union discrimination.
.The Committee notes that the trial concerning the murder of the trade union official Jos Aristides Mndez has been opened and that the presumed authors of the crime have been identified and arrested. The Committee nevertheless notes that in referring to the other two cases, the Government has merely pointed out that the trade unionist Francisco Mndez is not on the lists of forensic tests carried out and that the security forces know nothing about the death or disappearance of the trade union leader Marco Antonio Orantes, although investigations are still under way. The Committee stresses the importance of carrying out a judicial investigation in all cases with a view to elucidating the facts, determining the responsibilities and punishing the guilty parties if it is proven that offences have been committed. Furthermore, the Committee notes that with respect to the alleged murder of Toms Rosales and the injuries allegedly suffered by Rafael Hernndez, judicial investigations carried out proved that crimes of this nature had not been committed. Finally, the Committee notes that it has not been possible to identify the murderers of Jos Santos Tiznado and Pedro Gonzlez during the trial conducted to this effect and that the trial concerning the death of Rodolfo Viera and two North American trade unionists (Michael Hammer and Mark Pearlman) is still under way.
.As regards the alleged arrests of trade union officials and trade unionists, the Committee notes the release of Victor Manuel Martnez, Francisco Palacios, Febe Elizabeth Velsquez, Etelvina Snchez Vsquez, Adela Margarita Navarrete, David Rolando Oliva and Juan Gilberto Durn. As charges against those concerned were dropped and bearing in mind the general grounds for arrest communicated by the Government in some cases against the persons concerned, the Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that measures of detention which restrict the exercise of trade union rights can give rise to a climate of intimidation and fear prejudicial to the normal exercise of trade union activities (see, for example, rd Report, Cases Nos.  and  (El Salvador), paras.  and ) and that when this is connected with activities in the defence of the interests of workers, it constitutes a serious interference with civil liberties in general and with trade union rights in particular (see, for example, rd Report, Case No.  (El Salvador), para. ).
.Furthermore, the Committee notes that the Government pointed out that Jos Edgar Gmez Guerrero, Cecilio Guzmn Prez, Leonel Arvalo Morales, Jaime Ernesto Martnez Menjvar, Andrs Valiente and Celso Antonio Rivas Henrquez were arrested and put on trial on charges of belonging to terrorist groups. The Government also mentioned the trial of Daniel Rosaide Cullar and Rafael Vsquez Fabin without going into further detail. The Committee requests the Government to give information on this and, in particular, to indicate the specific facts with which all the trade unionists mentioned above are charged so that it might examine the allegations in full knowledge of the facts. The Committee also requests the complainant organisations to supply additional information on the circumstances surrounding these arrests. Finally, the Committee notes that the name of Santos Ventura is not on the lists of detained persons, that Jos Antonio Garca Hernndez and Julio Hernndez Rojas are being detained on the charge of murdering a trade union official and that the Government has not replied specifically to the allegations concerning the arrest of Gregorio Aguilln Ventura ( February ), Adalberto Martnez ( June ), Andrs Miranda ( June ), Jos Antonio Rodrguez ( August ), and the arrest of the  trade unionists mentioned in paragraph  of the rd Report.
.The Committee also notes that, according to the Government, no public security body knows anything about the arrest of the trade union officials Elsy Mrquez and Jos Snchez Gallegos. In view of the allegations that these persons are missing, the Committee repeats its request that a judicial inquiry should be carried out to ascertain their whereabouts.
.As regards the allegation that the registration of the most representative executive committee of the Textile Workers' Trade Union of Industras Unidas SA was refused, the Committee notes the Government's comments, according to which various general assemblies were held one after the other and that, apart from one case, irregularities had occurred. The Committee considers that in the present case it does not have enough information at its disposal to be able to come to a decision on this matter. However, it notes that there is a possibility that there might be grounds to initiate legal proceedings and that this right does not seem to have been exercised.
.Finally, the Committee regrets that the Government has not replied to the allegations concerning the raid of the ANDES premises on  April  by the armed forces, who took away documents such as the list of members; it also failed to mention the dismissal of six union officials in the telecommunications sector because of the strike of  April .
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:a) The Committee is conscious of the difficult situation that the country is going through; however, it considers it necessary to request from the Government the information referred to below so as to be able to reach conclusions in full knowledge of all the facts raised in the allegations and in the light of the situation prevailing in the country.b) The Committee requests the Government to provide additional information on the alleged murders of the trade unionists Francisco Mndez and Marco Antonio Orantes (Case No. ), and to carry out a judicial inquiry into this matter. The Committee also requests the Government to provide information on developments in the trials concerning the murder of trade union official Jos Aristides Meja (Case No. ) and the murder of Rodolfo Viera and the two North American trade unionists, Michael Hammer and Mark Pearlman (Case No. ). As regards this last point, the Committee regrets that, despite the time which has elapsed since the murders, a final judgement has not been handed down.c) The Committee requests the Government to carry out a judicial inquiry into the disappearance of Elsy Mrquez and Jos Snchez Gallegos (Case No. ) and expresses the hope that this will ascertain their whereabouts.d) The Committee requests the Government to provide additional information on the trade unionists who are still detained and/or being tried, indicating, in particular, the specific facts with which they are charged (Cases Nos.  and ). It also requests the complainant organisations to supply additional information on the circumstances surrounding the arrests of those concerned.e) The Committee requests the Government to comment on the allegations to which it has not replied, which are referred to in the previous paragraph.
.At its February  meeting the Committee on Freedom of Association was informed that the Government of El Salvador was ready to accept a",-1,1980,El Salvador
301,"direct contacts mission to examine the various aspects of Cases Nos. , , , , , , , ,  and , noted this information with interest and expressed the hope that, upon receipt of confirmation from the Government, arrangements could be made at an early date for such a mission to take place (see th Report of the Committee, para. , approved by the Governing Board at its th Session (February-March )).
.During the visit of the Director-General of the ILO to El Salvador in May , he proposed a direct contacts mission to His Excellency the President of the Republic, in conformity with the decision adopted by the Committee on Freedom of Association at its February  meeting regarding the complaints pending against El Salvador. n this occasion the President stated that, although he had not requested an ILO mission, he did not reject the direct contact; mission proposed, and indicated that the country opened its doors to the ILO mission.
.In its th Report (May ), approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (May-June ), the Committee took the following decision in connection with the cases relating to El Salvador: ""As regards the cases relating to El Salvador (Cases Nos. , , , , , , ,  and ), the Committee notes that following an official visit by the Director-General to the country, the Government is willing to accept a direct contacts mission with a view to examining the various aspects of these cases. The Committee hopes that the necessary arrangements will be able to be made shortly so that this mission can take place as soon as possible.""
.In a communication received on  November  the Salvadorian Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the ILO that the direct contacts mission could visit the country.
.The Director-General of the ILO appointed Mr. Andrs Aguilar, member and former president of the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights and member of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights as his representative to conduct the mission. The mission took place in San Salvador from  to  January . During the mission the Director-General's representative was accompanied by Mr. Alberto Odero, member of the Freedom of Association Branch of the International Labour Standards Department, and Mr. Luis Zamudio, Regional Adviser on Standards.
.The mission was received by the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare, His Excellency Miguel Alejandro Gallegos, by Dr. Lzaro Tadeo Bernal Lizama, Vice Minister of Labour and Social Welfare, and Dr. Antonio Lara Gavidia, Head of the International Affairs Department of the Ministry, by the members of the Labour and Social Welfare Committee of the Legislative Assembly, by senior officials of the Ministry of Justice, and by representatives of employers"" and workers' organisations.
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the first place, the Committee wishes to thank Mr. Andrs Aguilar for having agreed to carry out the direct contacts mission, as well as for his detailed report on the pending cases, which has allowed the Committee to examine them. The Committee considers that the report of the Director-General's representative attests to the usefulness of missions of this kind in clarifying matters arising from allegations by the complainant organisations.
.Since the content of the allegations and the information supplied by the Government, as well as the information obtained by the Director-General's representative during the mission are contained in the mission report (see Annex), the Committee can proceed directly to formulate its conclusions on the various cases.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:General recommendations(a) The Committee takes note of the report of the Director-General's representative on the mission carried out in El Salvador from  to  January . The Committee also notes that the mission enjoyed full freedom of action and movement and that the authorities of the Ministries of Labour and Justice with which it came into contact gave it every facility and co-operated actively in obtaining the information requested by the Committee on Freedom of Association.(b) The Committee notes that, according to the mission report, although there has been a marked drop in the frequency of attempts on lives and physical integrity and in the number of disappearances and arrests of persons connected with the trade union movement since the elections of May , there is continued insecurity.(c) The Committee also notes that the mission ascertained that a wide variety of trade union organisations representing all tendencies exist and operate in the country and that they play an active and militant role in national life and resort to strikes. The organisations having recourse to such action include public-sector workers' organisations, despite the fact that such action is illegal for this category of workers. Nevertheless, according to the mission report, trade union activities are often conducted in an atmosphere of fear which has an unfavourable effect on their exercise, and according to the organisations interviewed, such activities are viewed with hostility in many employers' circles - particularly in the private sector - which oppose the formation of organisations and the exercise of their rights.(d) In general, the Committee concludes from the mission report that there is still a need to make much progress in El Salvador to achieve genuine respect for human rights in general and trade union rights in particular. The Committee notes that according to the authorities of the Ministry of Labour, this is one of the main objectives of Government policy, and concrete measures to this effect have been and are being taken.(e) While the Committee is aware of the serious difficulties El Salvador is facing, it calls on the Government to adopt appropriate measures to guarantee that trade union rights may be exercised in a normal fashion; this will only be possible in conditions in which fundamental human rights are respected and in a climate free of violence, pressures and threats of any kind.Cases Nos. , ,  and (a) The Committee regrets that the proceedings relative to the homicide of Manuel Antonio and Jos Antonio Carrillo Vzquez and of Santiago Hernndez have failed to identify those responsible for the crime, and that they have been dropped.(b) The Committee requests the Government to take steps with a view to the opening of an investigation into the alleged homicide of Toms Rosales, Jos Santos Tiznado and Pedro Gonzlez, in respect of whom there is no record of proceedings having been opened. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments concerning the disappearance of the trade union leader Rafael Hernndez Olivo, as well as of the final outcome of the proceedings concerning the wilful homicide of the trade unionists Rodolfo Viera, Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer, indicating whether the investigation has been able to establish who instigated the crime committed by the two defendants.Case No. (a) The Committee regrets that the trade unionist Marta Imelda Dimas remained in prison for over two months.(b) The Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that the detention of trade unionists for trade union activities or membership is contrary to the principles of freedom of association.Case No. (a) The Committee requests the Government to undertake an investigation to determine the whereabouts of the trade union leaders Elsy Mrquez and Jos Snchez Gallegos, and to keep it informed thereof.(b) The Committee notes that some of the trade unionists mentioned by the complainants are free, and awaits the information promised by the Government concerning another  trade unionists whose arrest has been alleged and whose names are listed in the conclusions (concerning these  trade unionists, the Government reported that none of the persons listed is at present imprisoned in any of the detention centres in the country, but that further investigations will be carried out to determine whether they had been imprisoned at some stage in police centres).Case No. (a) As regards the murder of trade union leader Juan Pablo Meja Rodriguez, the Committee notes that proceedings have reached the stage of examination of witnesses, and that no one has yet been arrested. The Committee deeply regrets the murder of this trade union leader and requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in the proceedings.(b) While noting that all of the trade union leaders whose detention had been alleged in connection with this case are now free, the Committee none the less recalls that some of them were detained for trade union activities, and draws the Government's attention to the fact that the detention of trade union leaders or members for reasons connected with their activities in defence of the interests of workers constitutes serious interference with civil liberties in general and with trade union rights in particular.Case No. (a) The Committee points to the principle that all workers' organisations have the right to affiliate with international organisations of workers implies the right of national and international trade union organisations",2,1980,El Salvador
302,"to maintain contact with one another, without interference by the public authorities.(b) While noting that the judicial authority dropped the charges against Modesto Rodriguez and Elsy Esperanza Alvarenga, the Committee deplores their detention and draws the Government's attention to the fact that the detention of trade union leaders and members against whom no specific charges are retained restricts the exercise of trade union rights, and that such measures can give rise to a climate of intimidation and fear prejudicial to the normal exercise of trade union activities.Case No. (a) The Committee observes that the Government has not sent observations on the alleged murder of the trade union leader Marco Antonio Orantes. Faced with this very serious situation and while deeply regretting the murder of this trade union leader, the Committee requests the Government to send its observations on this matter, indicating in particular whether any proceedings have been instituted and if so, their current status.(b) The Committee concludes that the judicial decision declaring the strike in the Salvadorian Social Security Institute illegal and ordering the removal of those occupying its premises does not constitute a violation of the principles of freedom of association, inasmuch as the Institute is engaged in medical and health-care services. The Committee regrets the death of several members of the public security forces and some insured persons, and notes that, according to the Government and contrary to what the complainants maintain, none of the dead or wounded were members of the trade union organisations involved.(c) The Committee notes that the judicial authority dropped the charges against four of the trade union leaders whose detention had been alleged, but regrets their detention and draws the Government's attention to the fact that the detention of trade union leaders and members against whom no specific charges are retained restricts the exercise of trade union rights and that such measures can give rise to a climate of intimidation and fear prejudicial to the normal exercise of trade union activities.Case No. (a) The Committee requests the Government to take conciliatory measures with a view to promoting a climate of reconciliation and understanding between the Servipronto S.A. undertaking and its trade union enabling the resolution of current problems concerning the guarantees for the exercise of trade union rights, and an examination of the possibility of reinstating the trade union leader Israel Snchez Cruz, a measure that would undoubtedly contribute to more harmonious labour relations.(b) The Committee wishes to point out in general that in the event of a strike the authorities should resort to the use of force only when law and order are seriously threatened.
.The complaint presented by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) on  July  is concerned mainly with the death on  June  of Toms Rosales, a leader of the workers' union Granja Santa Ins, and the wounding of four other trade unionists during clashes with the armed forces which occurred in connection with a peaceful strike called by them in support of a number of wage claims.
.From the outset the Government, although it transmitted no comments on this case, refuted none of these allegations and on  September  furnished information to the effect that Carlos Hernndez, another trade union leader, had been arrested on  June , the day of the strike, for disturbing the peace and threatening to damage the installations of the undertaking and had been released on  June .
.Thereafter, in other communications, the Government never denied the facts alleged by the complainant organisation but did not transmit, as requested by the Committee, its observations concerning the death of Toms Rosales and the wounds inflicted on four other trade unionists on  June  during a peaceful strike at the Granja Santa Ins.
.The Committee observes, however, that in its communication of  January  the Government denies any knowledge of the facts alleged, according to a report of the Ministry of Defence and Public Safety contained in Note No.  dated  June .
.The Committee keenly regrets that the Government has not supplied specific information on this case, which has been requested several times and it recalls that a free and independent trade union movement can develop only where fundamental human rights are respected. It can only deplore the existence of situations in which trade unionists are killed or wounded in the performance of their trade union functions and in particular when engaged in peaceful strikes. It draws the Government's attention to the urgent need to take active measures to prevent in the future any loss of human life in similar situations.
.The complaint of the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) concerned the murder of trade union leaders. In a communication of  April  the WCL reported that Jos Santos Tiznado and Pedro Gonzlez, the leaders of the Salvadorian Peasants' Central, had been murdered by uniformed members of the National Guard in the Jess Suburb of San Ramn, Department of Cuscatln, at midnight on  May . In addition Manuel Antonio Carillo and Jos Antonio Carillo, former leaders of the Salvadorian Peasants' Central and members of the El Rosario Agricultural and Consumers Limited, had been murdered by agents of repressive forces on  June ; this, said the complainant organisation, was proved by the calibre of the bullets found near their bodies. In addition, Rafael Hernndez Olivo, Secretary-General of the Irrigation and Drainage Section of the National Association of Workers in the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry (ANTMAG), had been taken to Metapn Hospital after being injured in an accident, had subsequently been arrested by the rural police and had since disappeared.
.Successive items of information transmitted by the Government showed that investigations were being made into the murder of these four peasants and the disappearance of the Secretary-General of ANTMAG. The Government had never denied the facts but had not supplied specific information on the circumstances surrounding the death of Jos Santos Tiznado, Pedro Gonzlez, Manuel Antonio Carillo or Jos Antonio Carillo or the disappearance of Rafael Hernndez Olivo. In May  the Committee urged the Government to supply such information without delay. In addition it drew attention to the importance it attached to the holding of an independent judicial inquiry when there was loss of human life.
.As in the previous case, the Committee notes that the Government, in its communication of  January last, declares that the Ministry of Defence and Public Safety knows nothing whatsoever about the death of these persons and that Rafael Hernndez is not, to its knowledge, detained by any unit of the forces of public safety according to information received in Note No.  of  February  which contains a report from the Ministry in question.
.The Committee draws attention to the contradiction between the earlier information and this last communication, inasmuch as it was stated previously that investigations into these murders were under way. The Committee again emphasises the need to ensure that justice punishes the guilty parties and for the Government to keep it informed of the results of the investigation and any penalties imposed. In addition it urges the Government to supply precise information on these events and, in particular, on the fate of Rafael Hernndez Olivo.
.In this case, on  January  the ICFTU denounced the assassination on  January , of Rodolfo Viera, Secretary-General of the Salvadorian Communal Union, and of two American trade unionists, Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer, representatives of the AFL-CIO in El Salvador, while staying at the Hotel Sheraton in San Salvador where they were working on an agrarian reform programme to improve living and working conditions in rural areas.
.In June , the Government stated that a trial was being held in the Fifth Criminal Court of San Salvador and that the accused, Ernesto Sol Meza, had been released by order of the Supreme Court after submitting an appeal, and that the other accused, Hans Krist, had been acquitted. The Committee therefore urged the Government to pursue actively its investigations into the case and to send it the text of any judgment handed down.
.The Government, in its communication of  March , repeated the same information but added that judgment had been delivered in the proceedings against other accused persons who were deemed to have been material perpetrators of the crime, but that the parties had lodged appeals.
.The Government states in its communication of  January  that the Second Criminal Chamber of the First Section of the Central Court delivered on appeal a ruling dated  April  pursuant to sections  and  of the Code of Criminal Procedure of which the Government supplies an extract. This ruling upholds the dismissal, by order of the Supreme Court dated  December , of the charges against Ernesto Sol Meza and Hans Krist after they had lodged their application therefore; it confirms the judgment delivered against the accused Jos Dimas Valle Acevedo and Santiago Gmez Gonzlez, from which they had appealed, and stays execution with a reservation in favour of Lieutenant Lpez Sibrian;",0,1980,El Salvador
303,"it vacates the order for the detention of Hans Krist and Lpez Sibrian for lack of grounds; it orders that the statement made by the Prosecutor of the Chamber in his reply to the accusations concerning the accused Lpez Sibrian should be reported to the Supreme Court.
.The Committee takes note of this information and notes in particular that a sentence has been handed down against the persons deemed to have been material perpetrators of the crime, namely Jos Dimas Valle Acevedo and Santiago Gmez Gonzlez. It requests the Government to continue to send it information on the final outcome of this case and to inform it in particular whether the investigation has managed to identify the instigator or instigators of the crime.
.The Trade Unions International of Transport Workers, in its communication of  August , alleged that several trade union activists including Alejandro Martinez Alvarado had been wrongfully arrested by the police at the premises of the""Transport Workers' Trade Union on  August . After the Committee had examined the case in November , the question of the detention of Mr. Martinez Alvarado remained pending; the Government stated that he had been arrested by the police on  August  and detained at ""La Esperanza"" Penitentiary Centre in the Canton of San Luis Mariona. The Government later indicated that this trade unionist had been in custody at the Central Penitentiary by order of the military examining magistrate since  August  and had been prosecuted under Decree No. , which contains provisions concerning procedure in case of offences against the peace and independence of the State and against international law.
.In a communication of  April  the complainant organisation supplied additional allegations concerning Marta Imelda Dimas, the secretary of the trade union, who had also been in prison since  October , and further alleged that the Government had arrested Jorge Benjamin Rodriguez, Disputes Secretary of the same trade union, on  February .
.At its previous examination of the case, in May-June , the Committee noted with grave concern that Alejandro Martinez Alvarado had been in custody without trial since August . The Committee also observed that, according to the Government, this trade unionist was being prosecuted for offences against the peace and independence of the State and against international law but that the Government had communicated no information about the specific acts of which he was accused; according to the complainants, on the other hand, the person in question had been arrested without justification - along with others who had since been released - by the police at the premises of the Transport Workers' Trade Union.
.The Committee also noted that the trade unionists Marta Imelda Dimas and Jorge Benjamin Rodriguez were reported to have been in prison since October  and February  respectively, and the Committee requested the Government to communicate its observations in this regard.
.In its telegram of  June  the Government mentions that Alejandro Martinez Alvarado has been released under a Legislative Decree of amnesty. It repeats this information in its telegram of  June and adds that Jorge Benjamin Rodriguez has also been released under the same law. In its communication of  January last, the Government explains that Alejandro Martinez Alvarado was released under the amnesty law adopted by the Government of El Salvador on  May .
.The Committee, while noting the release of the two above-mentioned trade unionists under the amnesty law of  May , observes that the Government supplies no information concerning Marta Imelda Dimas, the union secretary, who according to the complainant organisation has been in prison since  October .
.Consequently, the Committee urges the Government to supply precise information concerning the detention in which this trade unionist has been held for many months and to state the specific acts with which she is charged. The Committee requests that this person be released or tried as soon as possible by an impartial and independent judicial authority, and asks the Government to keep it informed of developments in the situation.
.In this case the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) reported on  October  that the following trade union leaders had been arrested or had disappeared during October : Silvestre Ortz, treasurer of a sugar refinery trade union, arrested on  October; Daniel Avalos, leader of the trade union of a dairy products undertaking, and Pablo Ramrez Cornejo, leader of the Industrial Workers' Trade Union, both arrested on  October; Ral Antonio Castro Palomares, secretary of the Federation of the Unions of Workers in the Food, Clothing, Textile and Allied Industries arrested at his home on  October; Hctor Hernndez, second secretary of SETRAS, imprisoned by the rural police; and Berta Alicia Cosme of the FENASTRAS trade union, who had disappeared on  October. In a supplementary letter dated  May , the WFTU also referred to many other arrests and disappearances of persons, a list of whom is supplied as an annex to this case.
.With its letter of  March  the Government transmitted a photocopy of a note from the Ministry of Defence and Public Safety (Note No.  of  February  signed by Colonel Ren E. Auerbach) in which this officer admitted that Daniel de Jess Avalos de Paz, Pablo Cornejo Ramirez and Ral Antonio Castro Palomares had been arrested by the police, the first two on  October and the third on  October. These three persons were being detained by order of the competent court, Ral Antonio Castro Palomares being at the Mariona Penal Centre.
.In a communication of  March  the Government stated further that Berta Alicia Cosme, known as Berta, had been arrested in October  with other persons who, like her, were accused of being members or leaders of organisations engaged in terrorist activities, and that they were being held by order of the judge because the proceedings against them were at the preliminary investigation stage.
.The Committee, while expressing its concern at the length of time for which these trade unionists had been kept in detention pending trial, considered in May-June  that the Government ought to take steps to ensure that the persons mentioned in the complainants' communications of  October  and  May  be released or, if charges were being preferred against them, brought before the courts. The Committee further requested the Government to supply detailed information concerning the fate of those persons.
.By a telegram of  June  the Government reported that Ral Antonio Castro Palomares, Pablo Cornejo Ramrez, Alicia Cosme, known as Berta, and Pedro Ramirez Esquivel had been released under the Legislative Decree of amnesty of  May . This information was enlarged upon in the communication of  January , in which the Government states that, according to the report of the Ministry of Defence and Public Safety, Ral Antonio Castro Palomares had indeed been amnestied on  May , Pablo Cornejo Ramirez on  May , Berta Alicia Cosme on  May  and Antonio Campos Mendoza on  August , and that Daniel de Jess Avalos de Paz had been released under a ruling of the Supreme Court of Justice on  May .
.The Committee, while taking note of this information, observes with deep concern that in this case most of the persons mentioned by the complainants remain in custody since October , or are still missing, and that no explanation of their fate has been provided by the Government. The Government stated in its telegram of  June  that, generally speaking, the annexed list was made up of trade unionists detained for criminal offences and awaiting trial for acts carrying penalties of more than four years' imprisonment. The Government states that it respects fully human rights but that persons involved in activities running counter to the rights and freedoms of the people of El Salvador as recognised in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights could not be exonerated under the basic domestic legislation.
.In these circumstances the Committee urges the Government to keep it informed in detail on the situation of all these trade unionists; to communicate to the Committee its observations on the specific acts with which these persons are charged and the text of the judgments concerning them; and to provide details as to the fate of those who are missing.
.The Committee keenly deplores the fact that, in all the cases examined above, a very violent situation has resulted in the death, wounding or arrest of trade unionists in circumstances which, in the absence of specific and detailed information, are difficult for it to assess. The Committee emphasises that such a climate of violence is unpropitious for the development not only of industrial relations but also of a free and independent trade union movement inasmuch as, for such a movement to develop, fundamental human rights must be respected.
.The Committee points out that, when cases of this nature - namely, of detention under emergency regulations - have been referred to it, it has always [see, for",-1,1980,El Salvador
304,"example, Fourth Report, Case No.  (United Kingdom/Malaya), para.  stressed the importance which it attaches to all detained persons receiving a fair trial at the earliest possible moment. The Committee considers that measures of preventive detention should be limited to very short periods intended solely to facilitate the course of a judicial inquiry. [See rd Report, Case No.  (Argentina), para. .]
.The Committee has examined these cases on several occasions, most recently at its November  meeting when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body. Subsequently, the Government sent further information in a communication dated  March .
.El Salvador has not ratified either the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complaint presented by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) on  July  is concerned mainly with the death on  June  of Toms Rosales, a leader of the workers' union Granja Santa Ins, and the wounding of four other trade unionists during clashes with the armed forces which occurred in connection with a peaceful strike called by them in support of a number of wage claims.
.Since the Government supplied no information on this aspect of the case in November , the Committee reiterated its request that the Government communicate its observations concerning the alleged killing of Toms Rosales and wounding of four other trade unionists on  June  at the undertaking of El Grarjero S. A.
.In its reply dated  March , the Government does not refute any of these allegations but merely repeats the information submitted on  September , to the effect that, on  June , Carlos Hernndez was arrested for disturbing the peace and threatening to damage the undertaking's property and that he was subsequently released on  June .
.The Committee again notes this information. It observes, however, that the Government does not deny the allegations of the complainant.
.In the circumstances, the Committee can only deplore the alleged violent death of the union leader, Toms Rosales, and the injuries inflicted by the armed forces on other Granja Santa Ins trade unionists on  June  in the course of a labour dispute. Given the fact that an independent and free trade union movement can develop only in a climate of respect for basic human rights, the committee urges the Government to take steps to prevent any loss of human life.
.The complaint presented by the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) refers to the assassination of trade union leaders. According to the WCL in a communication dated  April , Jos Santos Tiznado and Pedro Gonzals, leaders of the Salvadorian Peasants' Central, were assassinated by uniformed members of the National Guard at midnight on  May  in the Jsus suburb of San Ramn in the Department of Cuscatln. The complainant further alleges that Manual Antonio Carrillo and Jos Antonio Carrillo, former leaders o the Salvadorian Peasants' Central and members of the El Rosario Agricultural and Consumers' Co-operative Limited, were assassinated on  June  by members of repressive forces, basing their allegations on the calibre of the bullets found near the dead bodies. It also states that Rafael Hernndez Olivo, Secretary General of the Irrigation and Drainage Section of the National Association of Workers of the-Ministry of Agriculture and Cattle Farming (ANTMAG), who had been transported to the Metapn Hospital after being injured in an accident, was subsequently arrested by the rural police and that his whereabouts were unknown.
.In November , the Committee noted the Government's statement that investigations were being made into the death of the four peasants and the disappearance of the Secretary General of ANTMAG. The Committee emphasised the importance that the guilty parties should be tried and punished and that the Government should keep it informed of the results of the investigation and of the action taken against those responsible.
.In its reply dated  March , the Government states that the information concerning this complaint has been communicated to the relevant bodies to help them in their inquiries.
.The Committee observes that the alleged assassination of the peasant, trade unionists occurred in May and June , since when the Government has not denied the facts and states that investigations are still under way. The Committee deeply regrets that the Government has not yet supplied any specific information on the circumstances surrounding the alleged death of Jos Santos Tiznado, Pedro Gonzals, Marvel Antonio Carrillo and Jos Antonio Carrillo and the disappearance of Rafael Hernndez Olivo. The Committee urges the Government to transmit this information without delay. It must recall the importance in all cases involving the loss of human life of carrying out an independent judicial inquiry. As the Committee has stated in the past,' the atmosphere of confidence essential for social dialogue could be restored more easily once the responsibilities of those concerned have been established and the persons who have abused their powers have been dealt with according to law.
.The complaint presented by the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of Latin American Workers (CPUSTAI) concerns the arrest by the police on  July  of the trade union leaders Tejada, Mendoza, Mrguez, Aguirre, Snchez, Fuentes and Castro, all of whom were arrested during a discussion of a list of grievances in the premises of the undertaking Buses Ruta Urbanos -.
.In a communication dated June , the Government stated, with respect to the arrest of members of the Executive Committee of the National Union of Workers in Transport and Allied industries in the premises of the undertaking Buses Ruta Urbanos , that a trial was under way.
.In its communication dated  March , the Government indicates that information regarding Case No.  will be submitted separately.
.The Committee once again urges the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of this trial and, in particular, to indicate whether the trade unionists Tejada, Mendoza, Mrguez, Aguirre, Snchez, Fuentes and Castro cited by name by the complainants, have been released.
.In this case, the ICFTU denounced the assassination on  January  o Rodolfo Viera, Secretary General of the Salvadorian Communal Union, and the death on  January  of two American trade unionists, Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer, representatives of the AFL-CIO in El Salvador, while staying at the Hotel Sheraton in San Salvador where they were working on an agrarian reform programme to improve living and working conditions in rural areas.
.In June , the Government stated that a trial was being held in the Fifth Criminal Court of San Salvador and that the accused, Ernesto Sol Meza, had been released by order of the Supreme Court after submitting an appeal, and that the other accused, Hans Krist, had been acquitted. The Committee therefore urged the Government to pursue actively its investigations into the case and to send in the text of any judgement handed down.
.In its communication dated  March , the Government repeats its earlier statement that the trial is being held in the Fifth Criminal court, that one of the accused has been released by order of the Supreme Court and that the other has been acquitted. It adds that the judgement concerning other accused persons considered to be the actual perpetrators of the crime was handed down early in December  but that the parties concerned have lodged an appeal.
.The Committee notes the Government's statement and requests it to continue keeping it informed of developments in this case. The Committee feels that it would be of the utmost value for it to have the text of the final judgement that will be handed down.
.In the circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:(a) In general terms, the Committee once again deeply deplores the violent death of several trade union leaders and, given the fact that an independent and free trade union movement car develop only in a climate of respect for basic human rights, urges the Government to take action to prevent any loss of human life. The Committee urges the Government to transmit without delay information on the circumstances in which these trade union leaders lost their lives.(b) In Case No. , the Committee urges the Government to communicate information on the outcome of the trial concerning the arrest o members of the Executive Committee of the National Union of workers in Transport and Allied Industries, which occurred almost three years ago - on  July  - when the trade unionists concerned were discussing a list of wage claims in the premises of the undertaking Buses Ruta Urbanos -. The Committee urges the Government to indicate whether the trade unionists Tejada, Mendoza, Mrguez, Aguirre, Snchez, Fuentes and Castro, cited by name by the complainants, have been released.(c) In Case No. , the Committee notes that the trial of the presumed perpetrators of the assassination of the trade union leader, Rodolfo Viera, and of Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer, two American trade",1,1980,El Salvador
305,"unionists representing the AFI-CIC in El Salvador, is still under way. The Committee once again requests the Government to continue communicating detailed information on the case, including the text of the final judgement once it has been handed down.
.Since  numerous complaints concerning violations of freedom of association in El Salvador have been presented by the following organisations: the United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador (FUSS), the Federation of Unions of Workers in the Food, Clothing, Textile and Allied Industries of El Salvador (FESTIAVTSCES), the Committee for Trade Union Unity of Workers of Central America and Panama (CUSCA), the Trade Unions International of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur Workers, the Trade Unions International of Food, Tobacco, Hotel and Allied Industries Workers, the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the World Federation of Agricultural Workers, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of the Workers of Latin America (CPUSTAL).
.The Committee has already examined most of these cases on several occasions and submitted interim reports to the Governing Body.
.Since then, in the absence of observations from the Government, the Committee adjourned its examination of these cases to February, then May . The Office sent a telegram to the Government on  April  inviting it to submit its observations as soon as possible. In June  the Minister of Labour forwarded additional information.
.El Salvador has not ratified either the freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complaints examined by the Committee were basically of three kinds: first, concerning the violent death and disappearance of trade unionists and former trade unionists; second, arrest of trade union leaders; third, attack on trade union premises and destruction of records.
.At the last examination of the cases in question, in November , the Governing Body, in accordance with the Committee's recommendations, expressed extreme concern at the serious nature of the allegations and observed that various acts had occurred after  October , when the previous Government had been deposed.
.In particular, concerning violent deaths and disappearances, the Governing Body deplored the loss of many human lives and the injuries referred to in the complaints. It noted that investigations had been opened into some of the occurrences and requested the Government to undertake as soon as possible a judicial inquiry into those cases where investigations had not been opened and to inform it of the results.
.In his communication of June , before giving a detailed reply concerning the cases in question, the Minister of Labour stated that, as a human being and as an official, he regretted that in the past acts had occurred in El Salvador which were not perhaps compatible with humane feelings, especially as regards violations of freedom of association such as those denounced to the International Labour Organisation. However, in order to preserve his country's international prestige despite the climate of violence which has prevailed in recent years, resulting in loss of human life and material losses, he stated that he would like to present specific information on the current situation concerning these cases.
.It should therefore be recalled that, in Case No. , the complainants alleged in particular that on  October , workers who were preparing to organise a collection in support of a strike at the El Len factory were attacked by the police, and two of them lost their lives. According to the Government's communication of June , the investigations undertaken and requested from the Ministry of Defence and Public Security confirm that there is no file on events relating to the situation of trade unionists in the El Len factory which occurred under the presidential administration of Colonel Arturo Armando Molina and General Carlos Humberto Romero in  and .
.As regards Case No. , according to a communication of the WCL dated  April , Jos Santos Tiznado and Pedro Gonzlez, leaders of the Salvadorian Peasants' Central, were murdered by uniformed members of the National Guard at midnight, on  May , in the Jsus suburb of the San Ramn municipality in the department of Cuscatln. In addition, Manuel Antonio Carrillo and Jos Antonio Carrillo, former leaders of the Salvadorian Peasants' Central and members of the El Rosario Agricultural and Consumers Co-operative Ltd., were murdered on  June  by members of the forces of repression, as was evident from the calibre of the bullets found near their bodies. As regards Rafael Hernndez Olivo, Secretary General of the Irrigation and Drainage Section of the National Association of workers of the Ministry of Agriculture and Cattle Farming (ANTMAG), who had been transported to the Metapn hospital after being injured in an accident, he had subsequently disappeared, having been arrested by the hacienda police.
.Concerning the homicide of the peasants Jos Santos, Pedro Gonzlez, Manuel Carrillo and Antonio Carrillo, and the disappearance of Rafael Hernndez Olivo, the Government states that the authorities are continuing their investigations.
.In Case No. , the ICFTU alleged, in a communication dated  July , that in a clash with the armed forces on  June , Toms Rosales, a leader of the workers' union of the ""Granja Santa Ins"", had been killed and four other trade unionists had been injured, when the workers at this undertaking had called a peaceful strike in support of a list of wage claims.
.The Government has still not supplied any information on this allegation.
.In Case No. , concerning the murder on  January  of Rodolfo Viera, Secretary General of the Salvadorian Communal Union, and the death of two United States trade unionists Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer, representatives of the AFL-CIO in El Salvador, the Government confirms in its communication of June  that a trial was being held in the fifth criminal court of San Salvador. The accused, Ernesto Sol Meza, has been released on the order of the Supreme Court, after submitting an appeal, and the other accused, Hans Krist, has been acquitted, adds the Government.
.The Committee observes that the Government has supplied certain information on the development of the investigations conducted by the authorities into the death and disappearance of the trade unionists and former trade unionists referred to by the complainants.
.As regards certain events, however, the Committee regrets that despite the time which has elapsed since the complaints were presented, the Government still has not supplied any observations, particularly on the alleged death of Toms Rosales and the injuries inflicted on his fellow workers by the forces of the law on  June  at the Granja Santa Ins. In this respect, the Committee recalls, as it has stated on numerous previous occasions, that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact. It is therefore confident that if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, the latter should recognise the importance for the protection of their own good name of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to the allegations put forward,
.In Case No. , the Committee notes that, according to the Government, an investigation is being made into the homicide of the peasants Jos Santos, Pedro Gonzles, Manuel Carrillo and Antonio Carrillo and the disappearance of Rafael Hernndez Olivo. The Committee again stresses to the Government the need to ensure that the guilty parties are punished and insists that the Government inform it of the results of the current investigations and of the penalties imposed.
.The Committee also notes that in Case No. , the trial in the murder of trade union leader Rodolfo Viera has resulted in the acquittal of one of the accused and that the second has been released pending appeal. In this connection, the Committee must first keenly deplore the murder of these trade unionists. It would also observe that a climate of violence such as that in which the murders were committed constitutes a serious obstacle to the exercise of trade union rights. Consequently, such acts call for effective measures on the part of the authorities. The Committee therefore requests the Government to send it the text of any judgement handed down in this case, and to pursue actively the investigations into these cases.
.During its most recent examination of the substance of these cases, the Committee had also recommended the Governing Body to note that some trade unionists had been released, and had noted that certain arrests were made because of participation in an illegal electricity strike which led to the loss of human lives in hospitals and other welfare centres.
.However, it had also requested the Government to indicate the reasons for and circumstances surrounding the arrests of the leaders Enrique Tejada, Antonio Campos Mendoza, Salomn Snchez Mrquez, Vicente Aguirre, Melitn Snchez, Antonio Fuentes and Maximiliano Castro, and to supply information on their present situation. Recalling that it should be the policy of every government to ensure the right of all detained persons to receive a fair trial at",-1,1980,El Salvador
306,"the earliest possible moment, it pointed out that the arrests of trade unionists against whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found may involve the restriction of trade union rights and a serious interference in trade union activities.
.Lastly, in general terms, it considered that a contribution would be made towards normalising the trade union situation and labour relations - a necessary objective in the context of the full respect of human rights - and the restoration of social harmony if the Government examined the situation of the arrested persons referred to by the complainants, with a view to freeing those arrested for trade union reasons.
.In this connection, the allegations in Case No.  should be recalled. According to CPUSTAL, on  July , trade union leaders Tejada, Mendoza, Mrquez, Aguirre, Snchez, Fuentes and Castro had been arrested by police while discussing a list of claims in the premises of the undertaking Buses Ruta Urbanos -.
.In its communication of June , the Government states, concerning the detention of leaders of the National Union of Workers in the Transport and Allied Industries in the premises of the undertaking Buses Ruta Urbanos -, that a trial is under way.
.The Committee notes that in this case the trade union leaders in question seem to have been in custody for over two years. In this respect, it wishes to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that preventive detention without conviction by a court should not exceed a very brief period and should be intended only to facilitate a judicial inquiry. Holding persons indefinitely in custody without trial is a practice which involves inherent danger of abuse and is for this reason subject to criticism.
.In consequence, the Committee, while noting that a trial is under way, requests the Government to supply the text of the judgement with the grounds therefore, and hopes that, in so far as these trade union leaders have been imprisoned only for legitimate trade union activities, they will be released as soon as possible.""
.The Government was also requested to send its observations on the allegations to which it had not replied, and which, according to the ICFTU in a communication dated  March  relating to Case No. , chiefly concerned an alleged attack by the armed forces on the San Miguel premises of the Federation of Unions of Workers in the Construction, Transport and Allied Industries (FESINCONSTRANS), an organisation affiliated to the ICFTU. During the attack, which is alleged to have taken place on  February  at . p.m., the lives of trade unionists were threatened and trade union records destroyed.
.The Committee regrets, despite the time which has elapsed since the complaint was presented, the absence of the information requested of the Government on this aspect of the case. The Committee notes that this allegation involves principles relating to freedom of association. As it has pointed out before, on receiving an allegation of this kind, the Committee would stress the importance it attaches to certain fundamental principles essential to the exercise of trade union rights, namely that occupation of trade union premises and confiscation of materials and other trade union publications may constitute serious interference by the authorities in trade union affairs. The International Labour Conference, in the Resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties adopted at its th () Session, considered that the right to protection of trade union property is one of the civil liberties which is essential to the normal exercise of trade union rights. Thus, while recognising that neither trade unions nor any other association or individual can be exempt from a search of their premises, the Committee has always considered that, should such action be taken, it should occur only after a warrant has been issued by the ordinary judicial authority, when the latter is satisfied that there are serious grounds for supposing that the necessary evidence for prosecution of a crime will be found, and provided that the search is limited to the purposes for which the warrant was issued. In addition, any authorities who, during a search, exceed the powers conferred on them by law should be punished.
.The Committee therefore urges the Government to forward its observations on the events which occurred on  February  in the San Miguel premises of the trade union federation affiliated to the ICFTU, which according to the complainants was attacked by the armed forces, who also destroyed the trade union records.
.Since , numerous complaints concerning alleged violations of freedom of association in El Salvador have been presented to the Committee by the following organisations: the United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador (FUSS), the Federation of Unions of Workers in the Food, Clothing, Textile and Allied Industries of El Salvador (FESTIAVTSCES), the Committee for Trade Union Unity of Workers of Central America and Panama (CUSCA), the Trade Unions' International of Textile, Clothing and Fur Workers, the Trade Unions' International of Food, Tobacco, Hotel and Allied Industries' Workers, the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the World Federation of Agricultural Workers, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), and the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of Latin American Workers (CPUSTAL).
.The complaints submitted to the Committee include allegations referring to the Assassination, arrest, torture or disappearance of trade union officials and workers, attacks on trade union premises by the armed forces, threats and the destruction of trade union files. The contents of the complaints were successively transmitted to the Government as they were received.
.The Committee has examined Cases Nos. , ,  and  at previous meetings and has presented interim reports to the Governing Body.
.At its session in May , the Committee decided to adjourn its examination of Cases Nos. ,  and  since it had not yet received the detailed information which had been requested from the Government. At its session of November , the Committee once again adjourned its examination of these cases for the same reason and included them in its report under the heading ""Urgent appeals"". At its February  session, the Committee also included Cases Nos. ,  and  under the same heading ""Urgent appeals"" since the Government had failed to provide any detailed information. While noting with concern the troubled situation in El Salvador, the Committee pointed out to the Government that in accordance with the procedural rules currently in force, it could present a report on the substance of the cases pending even if the Government's observations had not been received.
.Given the extremely serious nature of most of the complaints, and since the Government had not provided sufficiently detailed information on the cases pending, the Committee decided at its May  session to apply the procedure contained in paragraphs  and  of its th Report. In accordance with this procedure, the Government was immediately informed that the Chairman of the Committee would make contact, on behalf of the Committee, with representatives of the Government of El Salvador at the th Session of the International Labour Conference in order to draw attention to the various cases in question and discuss the reasons for the delay in the transmission of replies to the allegations contained in these various cases.
.In accordance with the decision adopted by the Committee at its session in May , the Chairman met with the Minister of Labour and Social Security of El Salvador, Mr. Julio Alfredo Samayoa, on  June. The Chairman of the Committee explained the purpose of the meeting. The Minister of Labour stated that his Government's delay in replying to the Committee on the cases pending had been due to the unsettled situation through which his country had been passing for some time and that it was in no way the result of any lack of co-operation by his Government with the ILO and in particular with its supervisory bodies. He then transmitted a communication containing the observations of his Government on these cases, including annexes on Cases Nos.  and . The Minister added that he was prepared to provide any other information which the Committee on Freedom of Association considered necessary.
.Furthermore, the Government had already furnished certain comments on some of the allegations in communications dated , ,  and  May .
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Government states that, the Act which was applied to the case of the ""El Len"" factory (Case No. ) - in which an attack by the police led to the death of two persons - has since been repealed. The Government adds that the investigations which were supposedly ordered by the Government in power at that time did not, for reasons which are unknown, produce any results. The Government states that it considers itself free of any responsibility since the matter concerns acts allegedly committed by the previous Government, with which",-1,1980,El Salvador
307,"it has no link of continuity. However, the Government points out that a new inquiry is now being undertaken to clarify the matter, the results of which will be communicated to the Committee.
.As regards the imprisonment of the trade union leader Francisco Girn Ramos (Case No. ), the Government states that he was indicted on a charge of destroying genuine documents and that there was never any allegation that there had been an infringement of freedom of association. The Government adds that Grancisco Girn has been free since , when the judge ruled that he should be released on bail, although it was not known why a final judgement had not been pronounced at that time. A recommendation has thus been made for a decision be issued as soon as possible and the Committee will be informed accordingly.
.As regards the allegations concerning workers who were killed, wounded and arrested (Case No. ), the Government stated that the acts of violence to which reference had been made probably took place before  October  and that one of the reasons why the previous regime had been deposed was precisely because of the repeated protests against violations of human rights and freedom of association which the Revolutionary Junta was endeavouring to end by all available means. More recently, the Government has declared that a major programme of agrarian reform is currently under way, the socio-economic consequences of which will ensure that the events involved in the present case cannot recur. As regards the death of Trnsito Vsquez, the Government explained that, under a court decision issued on  March , a stay of proceedings was granted concerning the charge relating to wilful homicide and the release was ordered of Mximo Garcia Lpez, Josh Felipe Garcia Vsquez and Sarbelo Garcia Ramirez. The Government adds that the accused had admitted they were members of the Federation of Catholic Peasants of El Salvador (FECCAS) and the Onion of Field Labourers (UTC) and not the Nationalist Democratic Organisation (ORDEN), as had been stated by the complainants.
.As regards the observations made in connection with Case No. , the Government states that, on  June , after a work stoppage had been declared in the ""El Granjero S.A."" undertaking, forces of the Army intervened in order to eject the picketers who had threatened to damage plant equipment. The Government adds that terrorist elements had infiltrated into these groups.
.As regards Case No. , the Government states that it has requested the collaboration of the Ministry of Labour and the Public Prosecutor's Office of the Republic so that appropriate investigations may be made into the events of  December , the results of which will be transmitted in due course. As regards the list supplied by the complainants of workers and peasants who had died, the Government states that their deaths were not the result of repressive action due to their trade union activities and obligations, but rather of the violence which continues to be generated by the extreme left and the extreme right and which, by drawing the armed forces into a purely defensive response, are plunging the country into a bloodbath which has been criticised and deplored by the true citizens of El Salvador.
.With regard to Case No. , in which one of the complainants alleged that five trade unionists had been arrested, the Government states that the events in question were brought about by an illegal strike which bad been declared by the River Lempa Hydroelectric Company Workers' Trade Onion on  and  August . The Government adds that the instigators of the strike violated the provisions of the Constitution by not following the procedure set forth in the Labour Code when they cut off without any advance notice the electricity service throughout the country, which seriously damaged the national economy (with losses exceeding  million colones) and caused the irreparable loss of human lives in hospitals and other medical centres. According to the Government, when the situation reached the point of posing a threat to the national security, since the service involved was one which was indispensable to the community, and as a result of the public outcry, the armed forces intervened in the plant without bloodshed and proceeded to arrest the principal leaders of the strike who - with the exception of those who were not considered to be responsible and who were subsequently released - are now being held in prison, where they are being treated correctly. The Government states that the prisoners are subject to the jurisdiction of military courts, which are now investigating their case in collaboration with their defence counsel.
.With regard to the assassination of Rodolfo Viera, Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer (Case No. ), the Government stated that it had ordered the arrest of the wealthy right-wing businessmen Ricardo Sol Meza and Hans Christ; the latter is currently in Miami and proceedings are at present under way to seek his extradition. The Government adds that the Public Prosecutor has been especially instructed to appoint, on behalf of the State, representatives to take part in the trial being heard by the Fifth Criminal Court and these representatives have already participated in the investigations. The Government points out that Mr Viera was, in addition to being a member of the Salvadorean Communal Onion, a high official of the Government and was looked upon as one of the major proponents of agrarian reform, all of which constituted the motives for his assassination at the wretched hands of the extreme right and extreme left.
.Finally, as regards the allegations concerning the assassination of workers, trade union leaders and school teachers between  October  and  September  (Case No. ) under the presidency of General Carlos Humberto Romero, the Government states that it does not know why the corresponding investigations did not produce any results, if indeed such investigations took place. The Government adds, however, that in order to demonstrate clearly and sincerely that the present rulers of El Salvador are free of any links or compromises with the past, an investigation will be conducted into these deplorable events, the results of which will be transmitted to the Committee as soon as possible.
.Before considering the substance of the various matters raised by the complainants, the Committee would like to express its deep concern at the serious nature of the allegations, most of which refer to the death, assassination, arrest or disappearance of trade unionists and trade union leaders, which have continued to occur even after  October , the date on which the former Government was deposed. While noting the troubled situation which is facing the authorities in El Salvador, the Committee must draw the attention of the Government to the fact that a free and independent trade union movement can develop only in a climate of respect for fundamental human rights, and to the Resolution concerning Trade Onion Rights and their relation to civil liberties adopted by the International Labour Conference in , which states in particular that the concept of trade union rights is totally meaningless in the absence of civil liberties and that the rights conferred on workers' and employers' organisations must be baled on respect for civil liberties.
.The Committee also deplores the fact that in spite of the time which has elapsed, the Government in its observations has still not replied to all the allegations or has done so only incompletely in some of the cases.
.The Committee notes that the Government considers itself free of any responsibility for the events which allegedly occurred before  October . In this connection, the Committee considers, as it already pointed out at its session in February , that there exists a link of continuity between successive governments in the same State and that although a government cannot be held responsible for events which took place under a preceding one, it has a clear responsibility for any consequences which those events might have produced since its accession to power. This principle is particularly applicable as regards the clarification of events which have led to the loss of human lives or the detention of trade unionists who are still being held in prison.
.As regards the allegations concerning the attacks on the lives or persons of trade unionists or trade union leaders, the Committee cannot but deplore the loss of numerous lives and the injuries mentioned in the complaints. The Committee notes the Government's statement that investigations are now under way concerning the events referred to in Cases Nos. ,  and  and, more generally, into the assassinations which allegedly took place between  October  and  December  (Case No. ) concerning which the Government states that an investigation is being ordered, the results of which will be transmitted to the Committee. However, since the Government has not provided information on the death of the trade union leader Tombs Rosales (Case No. ) or the injuries to which reference is made in Cases Nos.  and  and some of the assassinations",-1,1980,El Salvador
308,"referred to in Case No. , the Committee requests the Government to undertake as soon as possible - if it has not already done so - an independent judicial inquiry into these allegations with a view to elucidating the facts in full, determining responsibilities and punishing the guilty parties, and to keep the Committee informed of the results as and when available, of these investigations and those currently under way. The Committee is also of the view that special measures should be taken with a view to guaranteeing the personal security of those persons who are more directly involved in the trade union movement.
.As regards trade union leaders and workers who have been arrested or who have disappeared, the Committee notes that Francisco Girn Ramos has now been set free and that in principle a decision will be issued on his possible guilt on the charge of destroying authentic documents, which will be communicated to the Committee. The Committee also notes that the arrests referred to in Case No.  were the result of an illegal strike in the Rio Lempa Hydroelectric Company which led to the irreparable loss of human lives in hospitals and other medical centres. However, the Committee notes that the Government has not specified the reasons or circumstances which led to the arrest of the trade union leader Rafael Hernndez Olivo, whose present whereabouts are unknown, the arrest of the two members of the National Association of Workers of the Ministry of Agriculture who accompanied Jos Flix Minero on  May  when the latter was assassinated (Case No. ) and that of trade union leaders Enrique Tejada, Antonio Campos Mendoza, Salomn Snchez Mrquez, Vicente Aguirre, Melitn Snchez, Antonio Fuentes and Maximiliano Castro who, according to the complainants, were arrested as they were discussing a list of demands in the premises of the Buses Ruta Urbanos - undertaking and whose present whereabouts are unknown (Case No. ). In this respect, since no information is available on the present situation of the persons mentioned above, and in particular as to whether proceedings have been instigated against them, the Committee cannot but recall that it should be the policy of every government to ensure the right of all detained persons to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment, and point out that the arrest of trade unionists against whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found may involve the restriction of trade union rights and a serious interference with trade union activities. The Committee requests the Government to indicate the motives and circumstances which led to the arrests of the above-mentioned persons and to furnish information on their present situation. More generally, the Committee considers that a contribution would be made towards normalising the trade union situation and labour relations - a necessary objective within the context of the full respect of human rights - and the restoration of social harmony if the Government examined the situation of the arrested persons to whom the complainants refer, with a view to freeing those who may have been arrested for trade union reasons.
.Furthermore, the Committee observes that the Government has not replied to the allegations concerning the threats made against trade unionists and trade union leaders (Cases Nos.  and ), the attack by the armed forces on the premises of FESINCONSTRANS and the destruction of the files of this trade union organisation. The Committee requests the Government to furnish its observations on these matters.",-1,1980,El Salvador
309,".The Committee last examined these cases at its February  meeting, in the light of information obtained during a direct contacts mission conducted in El Salvador from  to  January . (See rd Report of the Committee, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session (February-March ).)
.The Committee had already examined Case No.  at its meetings in November , November , November , May  and May  (see th, th, th, th and th Reports of the Committee); Case No.  at its meetings in November , November , May  and May  (see th, th, th and th Reports of the Committee); Case No.  at its meetings in November , November , May  and May  (see th, th, th and th Reports of the Committee); Case No.  at its meetings in May  and May  (see th and th Reports of the Committee); and Case No.  at its meeting in November  (see th Report of the Committee).
.Since these cases were last examined by the Committee, new allegations have been submitted by the following organisations: the World Confederation of Organisations of the Teaching Profession ( May ), the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions ( May and  June ), the World Federation of Trade Unions ( May ) and the United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador ( June,  and  July,  September,  October and  December ). The Government submitted certain observations in communications dated  July,  August and  September ,  and  January,  and  February and  April .
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee notes with concern that since the last examination of the case, the complainant organisations have submitted extremely serious allegations concerning the death and arrest of trade union officials and trade unionists, the searching of the headquarters of a trade union organisation and various actions of interference and anti-trade union discrimination.
.The Committee notes that the trial concerning the murder of the trade union official Jos Aristides Mndez has been opened and that the presumed authors of the crime have been identified and arrested. The Committee nevertheless notes that in referring to the other two cases, the Government has merely pointed out that the trade unionist Francisco Mndez is not on the lists of forensic tests carried out and that the security forces know nothing about the death or disappearance of the trade union leader Marco Antonio Orantes, although investigations are still under way. The Committee stresses the importance of carrying out a judicial investigation in all cases with a view to elucidating the facts, determining the responsibilities and punishing the guilty parties if it is proven that offences have been committed. Furthermore, the Committee notes that with respect to the alleged murder of Toms Rosales and the injuries allegedly suffered by Rafael Hernndez, judicial investigations carried out proved that crimes of this nature had not been committed. Finally, the Committee notes that it has not been possible to identify the murderers of Jos Santos Tiznado and Pedro Gonzlez during the trial conducted to this effect and that the trial concerning the death of Rodolfo Viera and two North American trade unionists (Michael Hammer and Mark Pearlman) is still under way.
.As regards the alleged arrests of trade union officials and trade unionists, the Committee notes the release of Victor Manuel Martnez, Francisco Palacios, Febe Elizabeth Velsquez, Etelvina Snchez Vsquez, Adela Margarita Navarrete, David Rolando Oliva and Juan Gilberto Durn. As charges against those concerned were dropped and bearing in mind the general grounds for arrest communicated by the Government in some cases against the persons concerned, the Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that measures of detention which restrict the exercise of trade union rights can give rise to a climate of intimidation and fear prejudicial to the normal exercise of trade union activities (see, for example, rd Report, Cases Nos.  and  (El Salvador), paras.  and ) and that when this is connected with activities in the defence of the interests of workers, it constitutes a serious interference with civil liberties in general and with trade union rights in particular (see, for example, rd Report, Case No.  (El Salvador), para. ).
.Furthermore, the Committee notes that the Government pointed out that Jos Edgar Gmez Guerrero, Cecilio Guzmn Prez, Leonel Arvalo Morales, Jaime Ernesto Martnez Menjvar, Andrs Valiente and Celso Antonio Rivas Henrquez were arrested and put on trial on charges of belonging to terrorist groups. The Government also mentioned the trial of Daniel Rosaide Cullar and Rafael Vsquez Fabin without going into further detail. The Committee requests the Government to give information on this and, in particular, to indicate the specific facts with which all the trade unionists mentioned above are charged so that it might examine the allegations in full knowledge of the facts. The Committee also requests the complainant organisations to supply additional information on the circumstances surrounding these arrests. Finally, the Committee notes that the name of Santos Ventura is not on the lists of detained persons, that Jos Antonio Garca Hernndez and Julio Hernndez Rojas are being detained on the charge of murdering a trade union official and that the Government has not replied specifically to the allegations concerning the arrest of Gregorio Aguilln Ventura ( February ), Adalberto Martnez ( June ), Andrs Miranda ( June ), Jos Antonio Rodrguez ( August ), and the arrest of the  trade unionists mentioned in paragraph  of the rd Report.
.The Committee also notes that, according to the Government, no public security body knows anything about the arrest of the trade union officials Elsy Mrquez and Jos Snchez Gallegos. In view of the allegations that these persons are missing, the Committee repeats its request that a judicial inquiry should be carried out to ascertain their whereabouts.
.As regards the allegation that the registration of the most representative executive committee of the Textile Workers' Trade Union of Industras Unidas SA was refused, the Committee notes the Government's comments, according to which various general assemblies were held one after the other and that, apart from one case, irregularities had occurred. The Committee considers that in the present case it does not have enough information at its disposal to be able to come to a decision on this matter. However, it notes that there is a possibility that there might be grounds to initiate legal proceedings and that this right does not seem to have been exercised.
.Finally, the Committee regrets that the Government has not replied to the allegations concerning the raid of the ANDES premises on  April  by the armed forces, who took away documents such as the list of members; it also failed to mention the dismissal of six union officials in the telecommunications sector because of the strike of  April .
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:a) The Committee is conscious of the difficult situation that the country is going through; however, it considers it necessary to request from the Government the information referred to below so as to be able to reach conclusions in full knowledge of all the facts raised in the allegations and in the light of the situation prevailing in the country.b) The Committee requests the Government to provide additional information on the alleged murders of the trade unionists Francisco Mndez and Marco Antonio Orantes (Case No. ), and to carry out a judicial inquiry into this matter. The Committee also requests the Government to provide information on developments in the trials concerning the murder of trade union official Jos Aristides Meja (Case No. ) and the murder of Rodolfo Viera and the two North American trade unionists, Michael Hammer and Mark Pearlman (Case No. ). As regards this last point, the Committee regrets that, despite the time which has elapsed since the murders, a final judgement has not been handed down.c) The Committee requests the Government to carry out a judicial inquiry into the disappearance of Elsy Mrquez and Jos Snchez Gallegos (Case No. ) and expresses the hope that this will ascertain their whereabouts.d) The Committee requests the Government to provide additional information on the trade unionists who are still detained and/or being tried, indicating, in particular, the specific facts with which they are charged (Cases Nos.  and ). It also requests the complainant organisations to supply additional information on the circumstances surrounding the arrests of those concerned.e) The Committee requests the Government to comment on the allegations to which it has not replied, which are referred to in the previous paragraph.
.At its February  meeting the Committee on Freedom of Association was informed that the Government of El Salvador was ready to accept a",-1,1980,El Salvador
310,"direct contacts mission to examine the various aspects of Cases Nos. , , , , , , , ,  and , noted this information with interest and expressed the hope that, upon receipt of confirmation from the Government, arrangements could be made at an early date for such a mission to take place (see th Report of the Committee, para. , approved by the Governing Board at its th Session (February-March )).
.During the visit of the Director-General of the ILO to El Salvador in May , he proposed a direct contacts mission to His Excellency the President of the Republic, in conformity with the decision adopted by the Committee on Freedom of Association at its February  meeting regarding the complaints pending against El Salvador. n this occasion the President stated that, although he had not requested an ILO mission, he did not reject the direct contact; mission proposed, and indicated that the country opened its doors to the ILO mission.
.In its th Report (May ), approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (May-June ), the Committee took the following decision in connection with the cases relating to El Salvador: ""As regards the cases relating to El Salvador (Cases Nos. , , , , , , ,  and ), the Committee notes that following an official visit by the Director-General to the country, the Government is willing to accept a direct contacts mission with a view to examining the various aspects of these cases. The Committee hopes that the necessary arrangements will be able to be made shortly so that this mission can take place as soon as possible.""
.In a communication received on  November  the Salvadorian Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the ILO that the direct contacts mission could visit the country.
.The Director-General of the ILO appointed Mr. Andrs Aguilar, member and former president of the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights and member of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights as his representative to conduct the mission. The mission took place in San Salvador from  to  January . During the mission the Director-General's representative was accompanied by Mr. Alberto Odero, member of the Freedom of Association Branch of the International Labour Standards Department, and Mr. Luis Zamudio, Regional Adviser on Standards.
.The mission was received by the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare, His Excellency Miguel Alejandro Gallegos, by Dr. Lzaro Tadeo Bernal Lizama, Vice Minister of Labour and Social Welfare, and Dr. Antonio Lara Gavidia, Head of the International Affairs Department of the Ministry, by the members of the Labour and Social Welfare Committee of the Legislative Assembly, by senior officials of the Ministry of Justice, and by representatives of employers"" and workers' organisations.
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the first place, the Committee wishes to thank Mr. Andrs Aguilar for having agreed to carry out the direct contacts mission, as well as for his detailed report on the pending cases, which has allowed the Committee to examine them. The Committee considers that the report of the Director-General's representative attests to the usefulness of missions of this kind in clarifying matters arising from allegations by the complainant organisations.
.Since the content of the allegations and the information supplied by the Government, as well as the information obtained by the Director-General's representative during the mission are contained in the mission report (see Annex), the Committee can proceed directly to formulate its conclusions on the various cases.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:General recommendations(a) The Committee takes note of the report of the Director-General's representative on the mission carried out in El Salvador from  to  January . The Committee also notes that the mission enjoyed full freedom of action and movement and that the authorities of the Ministries of Labour and Justice with which it came into contact gave it every facility and co-operated actively in obtaining the information requested by the Committee on Freedom of Association.(b) The Committee notes that, according to the mission report, although there has been a marked drop in the frequency of attempts on lives and physical integrity and in the number of disappearances and arrests of persons connected with the trade union movement since the elections of May , there is continued insecurity.(c) The Committee also notes that the mission ascertained that a wide variety of trade union organisations representing all tendencies exist and operate in the country and that they play an active and militant role in national life and resort to strikes. The organisations having recourse to such action include public-sector workers' organisations, despite the fact that such action is illegal for this category of workers. Nevertheless, according to the mission report, trade union activities are often conducted in an atmosphere of fear which has an unfavourable effect on their exercise, and according to the organisations interviewed, such activities are viewed with hostility in many employers' circles - particularly in the private sector - which oppose the formation of organisations and the exercise of their rights.(d) In general, the Committee concludes from the mission report that there is still a need to make much progress in El Salvador to achieve genuine respect for human rights in general and trade union rights in particular. The Committee notes that according to the authorities of the Ministry of Labour, this is one of the main objectives of Government policy, and concrete measures to this effect have been and are being taken.(e) While the Committee is aware of the serious difficulties El Salvador is facing, it calls on the Government to adopt appropriate measures to guarantee that trade union rights may be exercised in a normal fashion; this will only be possible in conditions in which fundamental human rights are respected and in a climate free of violence, pressures and threats of any kind.Cases Nos. , ,  and (a) The Committee regrets that the proceedings relative to the homicide of Manuel Antonio and Jos Antonio Carrillo Vzquez and of Santiago Hernndez have failed to identify those responsible for the crime, and that they have been dropped.(b) The Committee requests the Government to take steps with a view to the opening of an investigation into the alleged homicide of Toms Rosales, Jos Santos Tiznado and Pedro Gonzlez, in respect of whom there is no record of proceedings having been opened. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments concerning the disappearance of the trade union leader Rafael Hernndez Olivo, as well as of the final outcome of the proceedings concerning the wilful homicide of the trade unionists Rodolfo Viera, Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer, indicating whether the investigation has been able to establish who instigated the crime committed by the two defendants.Case No. (a) The Committee regrets that the trade unionist Marta Imelda Dimas remained in prison for over two months.(b) The Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that the detention of trade unionists for trade union activities or membership is contrary to the principles of freedom of association.Case No. (a) The Committee requests the Government to undertake an investigation to determine the whereabouts of the trade union leaders Elsy Mrquez and Jos Snchez Gallegos, and to keep it informed thereof.(b) The Committee notes that some of the trade unionists mentioned by the complainants are free, and awaits the information promised by the Government concerning another  trade unionists whose arrest has been alleged and whose names are listed in the conclusions (concerning these  trade unionists, the Government reported that none of the persons listed is at present imprisoned in any of the detention centres in the country, but that further investigations will be carried out to determine whether they had been imprisoned at some stage in police centres).Case No. (a) As regards the murder of trade union leader Juan Pablo Meja Rodriguez, the Committee notes that proceedings have reached the stage of examination of witnesses, and that no one has yet been arrested. The Committee deeply regrets the murder of this trade union leader and requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in the proceedings.(b) While noting that all of the trade union leaders whose detention had been alleged in connection with this case are now free, the Committee none the less recalls that some of them were detained for trade union activities, and draws the Government's attention to the fact that the detention of trade union leaders or members for reasons connected with their activities in defence of the interests of workers constitutes serious interference with civil liberties in general and with trade union rights in particular.Case No. (a) The Committee points to the principle that all workers' organisations have the right to affiliate with international organisations of workers implies the right of national and international trade union organisations",2,1980,El Salvador
311,"to maintain contact with one another, without interference by the public authorities.(b) While noting that the judicial authority dropped the charges against Modesto Rodriguez and Elsy Esperanza Alvarenga, the Committee deplores their detention and draws the Government's attention to the fact that the detention of trade union leaders and members against whom no specific charges are retained restricts the exercise of trade union rights, and that such measures can give rise to a climate of intimidation and fear prejudicial to the normal exercise of trade union activities.Case No. (a) The Committee observes that the Government has not sent observations on the alleged murder of the trade union leader Marco Antonio Orantes. Faced with this very serious situation and while deeply regretting the murder of this trade union leader, the Committee requests the Government to send its observations on this matter, indicating in particular whether any proceedings have been instituted and if so, their current status.(b) The Committee concludes that the judicial decision declaring the strike in the Salvadorian Social Security Institute illegal and ordering the removal of those occupying its premises does not constitute a violation of the principles of freedom of association, inasmuch as the Institute is engaged in medical and health-care services. The Committee regrets the death of several members of the public security forces and some insured persons, and notes that, according to the Government and contrary to what the complainants maintain, none of the dead or wounded were members of the trade union organisations involved.(c) The Committee notes that the judicial authority dropped the charges against four of the trade union leaders whose detention had been alleged, but regrets their detention and draws the Government's attention to the fact that the detention of trade union leaders and members against whom no specific charges are retained restricts the exercise of trade union rights and that such measures can give rise to a climate of intimidation and fear prejudicial to the normal exercise of trade union activities.Case No. (a) The Committee requests the Government to take conciliatory measures with a view to promoting a climate of reconciliation and understanding between the Servipronto S.A. undertaking and its trade union enabling the resolution of current problems concerning the guarantees for the exercise of trade union rights, and an examination of the possibility of reinstating the trade union leader Israel Snchez Cruz, a measure that would undoubtedly contribute to more harmonious labour relations.(b) The Committee wishes to point out in general that in the event of a strike the authorities should resort to the use of force only when law and order are seriously threatened.
.The complaint presented by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) on  July  is concerned mainly with the death on  June  of Toms Rosales, a leader of the workers' union Granja Santa Ins, and the wounding of four other trade unionists during clashes with the armed forces which occurred in connection with a peaceful strike called by them in support of a number of wage claims.
.From the outset the Government, although it transmitted no comments on this case, refuted none of these allegations and on  September  furnished information to the effect that Carlos Hernndez, another trade union leader, had been arrested on  June , the day of the strike, for disturbing the peace and threatening to damage the installations of the undertaking and had been released on  June .
.Thereafter, in other communications, the Government never denied the facts alleged by the complainant organisation but did not transmit, as requested by the Committee, its observations concerning the death of Toms Rosales and the wounds inflicted on four other trade unionists on  June  during a peaceful strike at the Granja Santa Ins.
.The Committee observes, however, that in its communication of  January  the Government denies any knowledge of the facts alleged, according to a report of the Ministry of Defence and Public Safety contained in Note No.  dated  June .
.The Committee keenly regrets that the Government has not supplied specific information on this case, which has been requested several times and it recalls that a free and independent trade union movement can develop only where fundamental human rights are respected. It can only deplore the existence of situations in which trade unionists are killed or wounded in the performance of their trade union functions and in particular when engaged in peaceful strikes. It draws the Government's attention to the urgent need to take active measures to prevent in the future any loss of human life in similar situations.
.The complaint of the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) concerned the murder of trade union leaders. In a communication of  April  the WCL reported that Jos Santos Tiznado and Pedro Gonzlez, the leaders of the Salvadorian Peasants' Central, had been murdered by uniformed members of the National Guard in the Jess Suburb of San Ramn, Department of Cuscatln, at midnight on  May . In addition Manuel Antonio Carillo and Jos Antonio Carillo, former leaders of the Salvadorian Peasants' Central and members of the El Rosario Agricultural and Consumers Limited, had been murdered by agents of repressive forces on  June ; this, said the complainant organisation, was proved by the calibre of the bullets found near their bodies. In addition, Rafael Hernndez Olivo, Secretary-General of the Irrigation and Drainage Section of the National Association of Workers in the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry (ANTMAG), had been taken to Metapn Hospital after being injured in an accident, had subsequently been arrested by the rural police and had since disappeared.
.Successive items of information transmitted by the Government showed that investigations were being made into the murder of these four peasants and the disappearance of the Secretary-General of ANTMAG. The Government had never denied the facts but had not supplied specific information on the circumstances surrounding the death of Jos Santos Tiznado, Pedro Gonzlez, Manuel Antonio Carillo or Jos Antonio Carillo or the disappearance of Rafael Hernndez Olivo. In May  the Committee urged the Government to supply such information without delay. In addition it drew attention to the importance it attached to the holding of an independent judicial inquiry when there was loss of human life.
.As in the previous case, the Committee notes that the Government, in its communication of  January last, declares that the Ministry of Defence and Public Safety knows nothing whatsoever about the death of these persons and that Rafael Hernndez is not, to its knowledge, detained by any unit of the forces of public safety according to information received in Note No.  of  February  which contains a report from the Ministry in question.
.The Committee draws attention to the contradiction between the earlier information and this last communication, inasmuch as it was stated previously that investigations into these murders were under way. The Committee again emphasises the need to ensure that justice punishes the guilty parties and for the Government to keep it informed of the results of the investigation and any penalties imposed. In addition it urges the Government to supply precise information on these events and, in particular, on the fate of Rafael Hernndez Olivo.
.In this case, on  January  the ICFTU denounced the assassination on  January , of Rodolfo Viera, Secretary-General of the Salvadorian Communal Union, and of two American trade unionists, Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer, representatives of the AFL-CIO in El Salvador, while staying at the Hotel Sheraton in San Salvador where they were working on an agrarian reform programme to improve living and working conditions in rural areas.
.In June , the Government stated that a trial was being held in the Fifth Criminal Court of San Salvador and that the accused, Ernesto Sol Meza, had been released by order of the Supreme Court after submitting an appeal, and that the other accused, Hans Krist, had been acquitted. The Committee therefore urged the Government to pursue actively its investigations into the case and to send it the text of any judgment handed down.
.The Government, in its communication of  March , repeated the same information but added that judgment had been delivered in the proceedings against other accused persons who were deemed to have been material perpetrators of the crime, but that the parties had lodged appeals.
.The Government states in its communication of  January  that the Second Criminal Chamber of the First Section of the Central Court delivered on appeal a ruling dated  April  pursuant to sections  and  of the Code of Criminal Procedure of which the Government supplies an extract. This ruling upholds the dismissal, by order of the Supreme Court dated  December , of the charges against Ernesto Sol Meza and Hans Krist after they had lodged their application therefore; it confirms the judgment delivered against the accused Jos Dimas Valle Acevedo and Santiago Gmez Gonzlez, from which they had appealed, and stays execution with a reservation in favour of Lieutenant Lpez Sibrian;",0,1980,El Salvador
312,"it vacates the order for the detention of Hans Krist and Lpez Sibrian for lack of grounds; it orders that the statement made by the Prosecutor of the Chamber in his reply to the accusations concerning the accused Lpez Sibrian should be reported to the Supreme Court.
.The Committee takes note of this information and notes in particular that a sentence has been handed down against the persons deemed to have been material perpetrators of the crime, namely Jos Dimas Valle Acevedo and Santiago Gmez Gonzlez. It requests the Government to continue to send it information on the final outcome of this case and to inform it in particular whether the investigation has managed to identify the instigator or instigators of the crime.
.The Trade Unions International of Transport Workers, in its communication of  August , alleged that several trade union activists including Alejandro Martinez Alvarado had been wrongfully arrested by the police at the premises of the""Transport Workers' Trade Union on  August . After the Committee had examined the case in November , the question of the detention of Mr. Martinez Alvarado remained pending; the Government stated that he had been arrested by the police on  August  and detained at ""La Esperanza"" Penitentiary Centre in the Canton of San Luis Mariona. The Government later indicated that this trade unionist had been in custody at the Central Penitentiary by order of the military examining magistrate since  August  and had been prosecuted under Decree No. , which contains provisions concerning procedure in case of offences against the peace and independence of the State and against international law.
.In a communication of  April  the complainant organisation supplied additional allegations concerning Marta Imelda Dimas, the secretary of the trade union, who had also been in prison since  October , and further alleged that the Government had arrested Jorge Benjamin Rodriguez, Disputes Secretary of the same trade union, on  February .
.At its previous examination of the case, in May-June , the Committee noted with grave concern that Alejandro Martinez Alvarado had been in custody without trial since August . The Committee also observed that, according to the Government, this trade unionist was being prosecuted for offences against the peace and independence of the State and against international law but that the Government had communicated no information about the specific acts of which he was accused; according to the complainants, on the other hand, the person in question had been arrested without justification - along with others who had since been released - by the police at the premises of the Transport Workers' Trade Union.
.The Committee also noted that the trade unionists Marta Imelda Dimas and Jorge Benjamin Rodriguez were reported to have been in prison since October  and February  respectively, and the Committee requested the Government to communicate its observations in this regard.
.In its telegram of  June  the Government mentions that Alejandro Martinez Alvarado has been released under a Legislative Decree of amnesty. It repeats this information in its telegram of  June and adds that Jorge Benjamin Rodriguez has also been released under the same law. In its communication of  January last, the Government explains that Alejandro Martinez Alvarado was released under the amnesty law adopted by the Government of El Salvador on  May .
.The Committee, while noting the release of the two above-mentioned trade unionists under the amnesty law of  May , observes that the Government supplies no information concerning Marta Imelda Dimas, the union secretary, who according to the complainant organisation has been in prison since  October .
.Consequently, the Committee urges the Government to supply precise information concerning the detention in which this trade unionist has been held for many months and to state the specific acts with which she is charged. The Committee requests that this person be released or tried as soon as possible by an impartial and independent judicial authority, and asks the Government to keep it informed of developments in the situation.
.In this case the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) reported on  October  that the following trade union leaders had been arrested or had disappeared during October : Silvestre Ortz, treasurer of a sugar refinery trade union, arrested on  October; Daniel Avalos, leader of the trade union of a dairy products undertaking, and Pablo Ramrez Cornejo, leader of the Industrial Workers' Trade Union, both arrested on  October; Ral Antonio Castro Palomares, secretary of the Federation of the Unions of Workers in the Food, Clothing, Textile and Allied Industries arrested at his home on  October; Hctor Hernndez, second secretary of SETRAS, imprisoned by the rural police; and Berta Alicia Cosme of the FENASTRAS trade union, who had disappeared on  October. In a supplementary letter dated  May , the WFTU also referred to many other arrests and disappearances of persons, a list of whom is supplied as an annex to this case.
.With its letter of  March  the Government transmitted a photocopy of a note from the Ministry of Defence and Public Safety (Note No.  of  February  signed by Colonel Ren E. Auerbach) in which this officer admitted that Daniel de Jess Avalos de Paz, Pablo Cornejo Ramirez and Ral Antonio Castro Palomares had been arrested by the police, the first two on  October and the third on  October. These three persons were being detained by order of the competent court, Ral Antonio Castro Palomares being at the Mariona Penal Centre.
.In a communication of  March  the Government stated further that Berta Alicia Cosme, known as Berta, had been arrested in October  with other persons who, like her, were accused of being members or leaders of organisations engaged in terrorist activities, and that they were being held by order of the judge because the proceedings against them were at the preliminary investigation stage.
.The Committee, while expressing its concern at the length of time for which these trade unionists had been kept in detention pending trial, considered in May-June  that the Government ought to take steps to ensure that the persons mentioned in the complainants' communications of  October  and  May  be released or, if charges were being preferred against them, brought before the courts. The Committee further requested the Government to supply detailed information concerning the fate of those persons.
.By a telegram of  June  the Government reported that Ral Antonio Castro Palomares, Pablo Cornejo Ramrez, Alicia Cosme, known as Berta, and Pedro Ramirez Esquivel had been released under the Legislative Decree of amnesty of  May . This information was enlarged upon in the communication of  January , in which the Government states that, according to the report of the Ministry of Defence and Public Safety, Ral Antonio Castro Palomares had indeed been amnestied on  May , Pablo Cornejo Ramirez on  May , Berta Alicia Cosme on  May  and Antonio Campos Mendoza on  August , and that Daniel de Jess Avalos de Paz had been released under a ruling of the Supreme Court of Justice on  May .
.The Committee, while taking note of this information, observes with deep concern that in this case most of the persons mentioned by the complainants remain in custody since October , or are still missing, and that no explanation of their fate has been provided by the Government. The Government stated in its telegram of  June  that, generally speaking, the annexed list was made up of trade unionists detained for criminal offences and awaiting trial for acts carrying penalties of more than four years' imprisonment. The Government states that it respects fully human rights but that persons involved in activities running counter to the rights and freedoms of the people of El Salvador as recognised in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights could not be exonerated under the basic domestic legislation.
.In these circumstances the Committee urges the Government to keep it informed in detail on the situation of all these trade unionists; to communicate to the Committee its observations on the specific acts with which these persons are charged and the text of the judgments concerning them; and to provide details as to the fate of those who are missing.
.The Committee keenly deplores the fact that, in all the cases examined above, a very violent situation has resulted in the death, wounding or arrest of trade unionists in circumstances which, in the absence of specific and detailed information, are difficult for it to assess. The Committee emphasises that such a climate of violence is unpropitious for the development not only of industrial relations but also of a free and independent trade union movement inasmuch as, for such a movement to develop, fundamental human rights must be respected.
.The Committee points out that, when cases of this nature - namely, of detention under emergency regulations - have been referred to it, it has always [see, for",-1,1980,El Salvador
313,"example, Fourth Report, Case No.  (United Kingdom/Malaya), para.  stressed the importance which it attaches to all detained persons receiving a fair trial at the earliest possible moment. The Committee considers that measures of preventive detention should be limited to very short periods intended solely to facilitate the course of a judicial inquiry. [See rd Report, Case No.  (Argentina), para. .]
.The Committee has examined these cases on several occasions, most recently at its November  meeting when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body. Subsequently, the Government sent further information in a communication dated  March .
.El Salvador has not ratified either the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complaint presented by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) on  July  is concerned mainly with the death on  June  of Toms Rosales, a leader of the workers' union Granja Santa Ins, and the wounding of four other trade unionists during clashes with the armed forces which occurred in connection with a peaceful strike called by them in support of a number of wage claims.
.Since the Government supplied no information on this aspect of the case in November , the Committee reiterated its request that the Government communicate its observations concerning the alleged killing of Toms Rosales and wounding of four other trade unionists on  June  at the undertaking of El Grarjero S. A.
.In its reply dated  March , the Government does not refute any of these allegations but merely repeats the information submitted on  September , to the effect that, on  June , Carlos Hernndez was arrested for disturbing the peace and threatening to damage the undertaking's property and that he was subsequently released on  June .
.The Committee again notes this information. It observes, however, that the Government does not deny the allegations of the complainant.
.In the circumstances, the Committee can only deplore the alleged violent death of the union leader, Toms Rosales, and the injuries inflicted by the armed forces on other Granja Santa Ins trade unionists on  June  in the course of a labour dispute. Given the fact that an independent and free trade union movement can develop only in a climate of respect for basic human rights, the committee urges the Government to take steps to prevent any loss of human life.
.The complaint presented by the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) refers to the assassination of trade union leaders. According to the WCL in a communication dated  April , Jos Santos Tiznado and Pedro Gonzals, leaders of the Salvadorian Peasants' Central, were assassinated by uniformed members of the National Guard at midnight on  May  in the Jsus suburb of San Ramn in the Department of Cuscatln. The complainant further alleges that Manual Antonio Carrillo and Jos Antonio Carrillo, former leaders o the Salvadorian Peasants' Central and members of the El Rosario Agricultural and Consumers' Co-operative Limited, were assassinated on  June  by members of repressive forces, basing their allegations on the calibre of the bullets found near the dead bodies. It also states that Rafael Hernndez Olivo, Secretary General of the Irrigation and Drainage Section of the National Association of Workers of the-Ministry of Agriculture and Cattle Farming (ANTMAG), who had been transported to the Metapn Hospital after being injured in an accident, was subsequently arrested by the rural police and that his whereabouts were unknown.
.In November , the Committee noted the Government's statement that investigations were being made into the death of the four peasants and the disappearance of the Secretary General of ANTMAG. The Committee emphasised the importance that the guilty parties should be tried and punished and that the Government should keep it informed of the results of the investigation and of the action taken against those responsible.
.In its reply dated  March , the Government states that the information concerning this complaint has been communicated to the relevant bodies to help them in their inquiries.
.The Committee observes that the alleged assassination of the peasant, trade unionists occurred in May and June , since when the Government has not denied the facts and states that investigations are still under way. The Committee deeply regrets that the Government has not yet supplied any specific information on the circumstances surrounding the alleged death of Jos Santos Tiznado, Pedro Gonzals, Marvel Antonio Carrillo and Jos Antonio Carrillo and the disappearance of Rafael Hernndez Olivo. The Committee urges the Government to transmit this information without delay. It must recall the importance in all cases involving the loss of human life of carrying out an independent judicial inquiry. As the Committee has stated in the past,' the atmosphere of confidence essential for social dialogue could be restored more easily once the responsibilities of those concerned have been established and the persons who have abused their powers have been dealt with according to law.
.The complaint presented by the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of Latin American Workers (CPUSTAI) concerns the arrest by the police on  July  of the trade union leaders Tejada, Mendoza, Mrguez, Aguirre, Snchez, Fuentes and Castro, all of whom were arrested during a discussion of a list of grievances in the premises of the undertaking Buses Ruta Urbanos -.
.In a communication dated June , the Government stated, with respect to the arrest of members of the Executive Committee of the National Union of Workers in Transport and Allied industries in the premises of the undertaking Buses Ruta Urbanos , that a trial was under way.
.In its communication dated  March , the Government indicates that information regarding Case No.  will be submitted separately.
.The Committee once again urges the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of this trial and, in particular, to indicate whether the trade unionists Tejada, Mendoza, Mrguez, Aguirre, Snchez, Fuentes and Castro cited by name by the complainants, have been released.
.In this case, the ICFTU denounced the assassination on  January  o Rodolfo Viera, Secretary General of the Salvadorian Communal Union, and the death on  January  of two American trade unionists, Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer, representatives of the AFL-CIO in El Salvador, while staying at the Hotel Sheraton in San Salvador where they were working on an agrarian reform programme to improve living and working conditions in rural areas.
.In June , the Government stated that a trial was being held in the Fifth Criminal Court of San Salvador and that the accused, Ernesto Sol Meza, had been released by order of the Supreme Court after submitting an appeal, and that the other accused, Hans Krist, had been acquitted. The Committee therefore urged the Government to pursue actively its investigations into the case and to send in the text of any judgement handed down.
.In its communication dated  March , the Government repeats its earlier statement that the trial is being held in the Fifth Criminal court, that one of the accused has been released by order of the Supreme Court and that the other has been acquitted. It adds that the judgement concerning other accused persons considered to be the actual perpetrators of the crime was handed down early in December  but that the parties concerned have lodged an appeal.
.The Committee notes the Government's statement and requests it to continue keeping it informed of developments in this case. The Committee feels that it would be of the utmost value for it to have the text of the final judgement that will be handed down.
.In the circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:(a) In general terms, the Committee once again deeply deplores the violent death of several trade union leaders and, given the fact that an independent and free trade union movement car develop only in a climate of respect for basic human rights, urges the Government to take action to prevent any loss of human life. The Committee urges the Government to transmit without delay information on the circumstances in which these trade union leaders lost their lives.(b) In Case No. , the Committee urges the Government to communicate information on the outcome of the trial concerning the arrest o members of the Executive Committee of the National Union of workers in Transport and Allied Industries, which occurred almost three years ago - on  July  - when the trade unionists concerned were discussing a list of wage claims in the premises of the undertaking Buses Ruta Urbanos -. The Committee urges the Government to indicate whether the trade unionists Tejada, Mendoza, Mrguez, Aguirre, Snchez, Fuentes and Castro, cited by name by the complainants, have been released.(c) In Case No. , the Committee notes that the trial of the presumed perpetrators of the assassination of the trade union leader, Rodolfo Viera, and of Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer, two American trade",1,1980,El Salvador
314,"unionists representing the AFI-CIC in El Salvador, is still under way. The Committee once again requests the Government to continue communicating detailed information on the case, including the text of the final judgement once it has been handed down.
.Since  numerous complaints concerning violations of freedom of association in El Salvador have been presented by the following organisations: the United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador (FUSS), the Federation of Unions of Workers in the Food, Clothing, Textile and Allied Industries of El Salvador (FESTIAVTSCES), the Committee for Trade Union Unity of Workers of Central America and Panama (CUSCA), the Trade Unions International of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur Workers, the Trade Unions International of Food, Tobacco, Hotel and Allied Industries Workers, the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the World Federation of Agricultural Workers, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of the Workers of Latin America (CPUSTAL).
.The Committee has already examined most of these cases on several occasions and submitted interim reports to the Governing Body.
.Since then, in the absence of observations from the Government, the Committee adjourned its examination of these cases to February, then May . The Office sent a telegram to the Government on  April  inviting it to submit its observations as soon as possible. In June  the Minister of Labour forwarded additional information.
.El Salvador has not ratified either the freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complaints examined by the Committee were basically of three kinds: first, concerning the violent death and disappearance of trade unionists and former trade unionists; second, arrest of trade union leaders; third, attack on trade union premises and destruction of records.
.At the last examination of the cases in question, in November , the Governing Body, in accordance with the Committee's recommendations, expressed extreme concern at the serious nature of the allegations and observed that various acts had occurred after  October , when the previous Government had been deposed.
.In particular, concerning violent deaths and disappearances, the Governing Body deplored the loss of many human lives and the injuries referred to in the complaints. It noted that investigations had been opened into some of the occurrences and requested the Government to undertake as soon as possible a judicial inquiry into those cases where investigations had not been opened and to inform it of the results.
.In his communication of June , before giving a detailed reply concerning the cases in question, the Minister of Labour stated that, as a human being and as an official, he regretted that in the past acts had occurred in El Salvador which were not perhaps compatible with humane feelings, especially as regards violations of freedom of association such as those denounced to the International Labour Organisation. However, in order to preserve his country's international prestige despite the climate of violence which has prevailed in recent years, resulting in loss of human life and material losses, he stated that he would like to present specific information on the current situation concerning these cases.
.It should therefore be recalled that, in Case No. , the complainants alleged in particular that on  October , workers who were preparing to organise a collection in support of a strike at the El Len factory were attacked by the police, and two of them lost their lives. According to the Government's communication of June , the investigations undertaken and requested from the Ministry of Defence and Public Security confirm that there is no file on events relating to the situation of trade unionists in the El Len factory which occurred under the presidential administration of Colonel Arturo Armando Molina and General Carlos Humberto Romero in  and .
.As regards Case No. , according to a communication of the WCL dated  April , Jos Santos Tiznado and Pedro Gonzlez, leaders of the Salvadorian Peasants' Central, were murdered by uniformed members of the National Guard at midnight, on  May , in the Jsus suburb of the San Ramn municipality in the department of Cuscatln. In addition, Manuel Antonio Carrillo and Jos Antonio Carrillo, former leaders of the Salvadorian Peasants' Central and members of the El Rosario Agricultural and Consumers Co-operative Ltd., were murdered on  June  by members of the forces of repression, as was evident from the calibre of the bullets found near their bodies. As regards Rafael Hernndez Olivo, Secretary General of the Irrigation and Drainage Section of the National Association of workers of the Ministry of Agriculture and Cattle Farming (ANTMAG), who had been transported to the Metapn hospital after being injured in an accident, he had subsequently disappeared, having been arrested by the hacienda police.
.Concerning the homicide of the peasants Jos Santos, Pedro Gonzlez, Manuel Carrillo and Antonio Carrillo, and the disappearance of Rafael Hernndez Olivo, the Government states that the authorities are continuing their investigations.
.In Case No. , the ICFTU alleged, in a communication dated  July , that in a clash with the armed forces on  June , Toms Rosales, a leader of the workers' union of the ""Granja Santa Ins"", had been killed and four other trade unionists had been injured, when the workers at this undertaking had called a peaceful strike in support of a list of wage claims.
.The Government has still not supplied any information on this allegation.
.In Case No. , concerning the murder on  January  of Rodolfo Viera, Secretary General of the Salvadorian Communal Union, and the death of two United States trade unionists Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer, representatives of the AFL-CIO in El Salvador, the Government confirms in its communication of June  that a trial was being held in the fifth criminal court of San Salvador. The accused, Ernesto Sol Meza, has been released on the order of the Supreme Court, after submitting an appeal, and the other accused, Hans Krist, has been acquitted, adds the Government.
.The Committee observes that the Government has supplied certain information on the development of the investigations conducted by the authorities into the death and disappearance of the trade unionists and former trade unionists referred to by the complainants.
.As regards certain events, however, the Committee regrets that despite the time which has elapsed since the complaints were presented, the Government still has not supplied any observations, particularly on the alleged death of Toms Rosales and the injuries inflicted on his fellow workers by the forces of the law on  June  at the Granja Santa Ins. In this respect, the Committee recalls, as it has stated on numerous previous occasions, that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact. It is therefore confident that if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, the latter should recognise the importance for the protection of their own good name of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to the allegations put forward,
.In Case No. , the Committee notes that, according to the Government, an investigation is being made into the homicide of the peasants Jos Santos, Pedro Gonzles, Manuel Carrillo and Antonio Carrillo and the disappearance of Rafael Hernndez Olivo. The Committee again stresses to the Government the need to ensure that the guilty parties are punished and insists that the Government inform it of the results of the current investigations and of the penalties imposed.
.The Committee also notes that in Case No. , the trial in the murder of trade union leader Rodolfo Viera has resulted in the acquittal of one of the accused and that the second has been released pending appeal. In this connection, the Committee must first keenly deplore the murder of these trade unionists. It would also observe that a climate of violence such as that in which the murders were committed constitutes a serious obstacle to the exercise of trade union rights. Consequently, such acts call for effective measures on the part of the authorities. The Committee therefore requests the Government to send it the text of any judgement handed down in this case, and to pursue actively the investigations into these cases.
.During its most recent examination of the substance of these cases, the Committee had also recommended the Governing Body to note that some trade unionists had been released, and had noted that certain arrests were made because of participation in an illegal electricity strike which led to the loss of human lives in hospitals and other welfare centres.
.However, it had also requested the Government to indicate the reasons for and circumstances surrounding the arrests of the leaders Enrique Tejada, Antonio Campos Mendoza, Salomn Snchez Mrquez, Vicente Aguirre, Melitn Snchez, Antonio Fuentes and Maximiliano Castro, and to supply information on their present situation. Recalling that it should be the policy of every government to ensure the right of all detained persons to receive a fair trial at",-1,1980,El Salvador
315,"the earliest possible moment, it pointed out that the arrests of trade unionists against whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found may involve the restriction of trade union rights and a serious interference in trade union activities.
.Lastly, in general terms, it considered that a contribution would be made towards normalising the trade union situation and labour relations - a necessary objective in the context of the full respect of human rights - and the restoration of social harmony if the Government examined the situation of the arrested persons referred to by the complainants, with a view to freeing those arrested for trade union reasons.
.In this connection, the allegations in Case No.  should be recalled. According to CPUSTAL, on  July , trade union leaders Tejada, Mendoza, Mrquez, Aguirre, Snchez, Fuentes and Castro had been arrested by police while discussing a list of claims in the premises of the undertaking Buses Ruta Urbanos -.
.In its communication of June , the Government states, concerning the detention of leaders of the National Union of Workers in the Transport and Allied Industries in the premises of the undertaking Buses Ruta Urbanos -, that a trial is under way.
.The Committee notes that in this case the trade union leaders in question seem to have been in custody for over two years. In this respect, it wishes to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that preventive detention without conviction by a court should not exceed a very brief period and should be intended only to facilitate a judicial inquiry. Holding persons indefinitely in custody without trial is a practice which involves inherent danger of abuse and is for this reason subject to criticism.
.In consequence, the Committee, while noting that a trial is under way, requests the Government to supply the text of the judgement with the grounds therefore, and hopes that, in so far as these trade union leaders have been imprisoned only for legitimate trade union activities, they will be released as soon as possible.""
.The Government was also requested to send its observations on the allegations to which it had not replied, and which, according to the ICFTU in a communication dated  March  relating to Case No. , chiefly concerned an alleged attack by the armed forces on the San Miguel premises of the Federation of Unions of Workers in the Construction, Transport and Allied Industries (FESINCONSTRANS), an organisation affiliated to the ICFTU. During the attack, which is alleged to have taken place on  February  at . p.m., the lives of trade unionists were threatened and trade union records destroyed.
.The Committee regrets, despite the time which has elapsed since the complaint was presented, the absence of the information requested of the Government on this aspect of the case. The Committee notes that this allegation involves principles relating to freedom of association. As it has pointed out before, on receiving an allegation of this kind, the Committee would stress the importance it attaches to certain fundamental principles essential to the exercise of trade union rights, namely that occupation of trade union premises and confiscation of materials and other trade union publications may constitute serious interference by the authorities in trade union affairs. The International Labour Conference, in the Resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties adopted at its th () Session, considered that the right to protection of trade union property is one of the civil liberties which is essential to the normal exercise of trade union rights. Thus, while recognising that neither trade unions nor any other association or individual can be exempt from a search of their premises, the Committee has always considered that, should such action be taken, it should occur only after a warrant has been issued by the ordinary judicial authority, when the latter is satisfied that there are serious grounds for supposing that the necessary evidence for prosecution of a crime will be found, and provided that the search is limited to the purposes for which the warrant was issued. In addition, any authorities who, during a search, exceed the powers conferred on them by law should be punished.
.The Committee therefore urges the Government to forward its observations on the events which occurred on  February  in the San Miguel premises of the trade union federation affiliated to the ICFTU, which according to the complainants was attacked by the armed forces, who also destroyed the trade union records.
.Since , numerous complaints concerning alleged violations of freedom of association in El Salvador have been presented to the Committee by the following organisations: the United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador (FUSS), the Federation of Unions of Workers in the Food, Clothing, Textile and Allied Industries of El Salvador (FESTIAVTSCES), the Committee for Trade Union Unity of Workers of Central America and Panama (CUSCA), the Trade Unions' International of Textile, Clothing and Fur Workers, the Trade Unions' International of Food, Tobacco, Hotel and Allied Industries' Workers, the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the World Federation of Agricultural Workers, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), and the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of Latin American Workers (CPUSTAL).
.The complaints submitted to the Committee include allegations referring to the Assassination, arrest, torture or disappearance of trade union officials and workers, attacks on trade union premises by the armed forces, threats and the destruction of trade union files. The contents of the complaints were successively transmitted to the Government as they were received.
.The Committee has examined Cases Nos. , ,  and  at previous meetings and has presented interim reports to the Governing Body.
.At its session in May , the Committee decided to adjourn its examination of Cases Nos. ,  and  since it had not yet received the detailed information which had been requested from the Government. At its session of November , the Committee once again adjourned its examination of these cases for the same reason and included them in its report under the heading ""Urgent appeals"". At its February  session, the Committee also included Cases Nos. ,  and  under the same heading ""Urgent appeals"" since the Government had failed to provide any detailed information. While noting with concern the troubled situation in El Salvador, the Committee pointed out to the Government that in accordance with the procedural rules currently in force, it could present a report on the substance of the cases pending even if the Government's observations had not been received.
.Given the extremely serious nature of most of the complaints, and since the Government had not provided sufficiently detailed information on the cases pending, the Committee decided at its May  session to apply the procedure contained in paragraphs  and  of its th Report. In accordance with this procedure, the Government was immediately informed that the Chairman of the Committee would make contact, on behalf of the Committee, with representatives of the Government of El Salvador at the th Session of the International Labour Conference in order to draw attention to the various cases in question and discuss the reasons for the delay in the transmission of replies to the allegations contained in these various cases.
.In accordance with the decision adopted by the Committee at its session in May , the Chairman met with the Minister of Labour and Social Security of El Salvador, Mr. Julio Alfredo Samayoa, on  June. The Chairman of the Committee explained the purpose of the meeting. The Minister of Labour stated that his Government's delay in replying to the Committee on the cases pending had been due to the unsettled situation through which his country had been passing for some time and that it was in no way the result of any lack of co-operation by his Government with the ILO and in particular with its supervisory bodies. He then transmitted a communication containing the observations of his Government on these cases, including annexes on Cases Nos.  and . The Minister added that he was prepared to provide any other information which the Committee on Freedom of Association considered necessary.
.Furthermore, the Government had already furnished certain comments on some of the allegations in communications dated , ,  and  May .
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Government states that, the Act which was applied to the case of the ""El Len"" factory (Case No. ) - in which an attack by the police led to the death of two persons - has since been repealed. The Government adds that the investigations which were supposedly ordered by the Government in power at that time did not, for reasons which are unknown, produce any results. The Government states that it considers itself free of any responsibility since the matter concerns acts allegedly committed by the previous Government, with which",-1,1980,El Salvador
316,"it has no link of continuity. However, the Government points out that a new inquiry is now being undertaken to clarify the matter, the results of which will be communicated to the Committee.
.As regards the imprisonment of the trade union leader Francisco Girn Ramos (Case No. ), the Government states that he was indicted on a charge of destroying genuine documents and that there was never any allegation that there had been an infringement of freedom of association. The Government adds that Grancisco Girn has been free since , when the judge ruled that he should be released on bail, although it was not known why a final judgement had not been pronounced at that time. A recommendation has thus been made for a decision be issued as soon as possible and the Committee will be informed accordingly.
.As regards the allegations concerning workers who were killed, wounded and arrested (Case No. ), the Government stated that the acts of violence to which reference had been made probably took place before  October  and that one of the reasons why the previous regime had been deposed was precisely because of the repeated protests against violations of human rights and freedom of association which the Revolutionary Junta was endeavouring to end by all available means. More recently, the Government has declared that a major programme of agrarian reform is currently under way, the socio-economic consequences of which will ensure that the events involved in the present case cannot recur. As regards the death of Trnsito Vsquez, the Government explained that, under a court decision issued on  March , a stay of proceedings was granted concerning the charge relating to wilful homicide and the release was ordered of Mximo Garcia Lpez, Josh Felipe Garcia Vsquez and Sarbelo Garcia Ramirez. The Government adds that the accused had admitted they were members of the Federation of Catholic Peasants of El Salvador (FECCAS) and the Onion of Field Labourers (UTC) and not the Nationalist Democratic Organisation (ORDEN), as had been stated by the complainants.
.As regards the observations made in connection with Case No. , the Government states that, on  June , after a work stoppage had been declared in the ""El Granjero S.A."" undertaking, forces of the Army intervened in order to eject the picketers who had threatened to damage plant equipment. The Government adds that terrorist elements had infiltrated into these groups.
.As regards Case No. , the Government states that it has requested the collaboration of the Ministry of Labour and the Public Prosecutor's Office of the Republic so that appropriate investigations may be made into the events of  December , the results of which will be transmitted in due course. As regards the list supplied by the complainants of workers and peasants who had died, the Government states that their deaths were not the result of repressive action due to their trade union activities and obligations, but rather of the violence which continues to be generated by the extreme left and the extreme right and which, by drawing the armed forces into a purely defensive response, are plunging the country into a bloodbath which has been criticised and deplored by the true citizens of El Salvador.
.With regard to Case No. , in which one of the complainants alleged that five trade unionists had been arrested, the Government states that the events in question were brought about by an illegal strike which bad been declared by the River Lempa Hydroelectric Company Workers' Trade Onion on  and  August . The Government adds that the instigators of the strike violated the provisions of the Constitution by not following the procedure set forth in the Labour Code when they cut off without any advance notice the electricity service throughout the country, which seriously damaged the national economy (with losses exceeding  million colones) and caused the irreparable loss of human lives in hospitals and other medical centres. According to the Government, when the situation reached the point of posing a threat to the national security, since the service involved was one which was indispensable to the community, and as a result of the public outcry, the armed forces intervened in the plant without bloodshed and proceeded to arrest the principal leaders of the strike who - with the exception of those who were not considered to be responsible and who were subsequently released - are now being held in prison, where they are being treated correctly. The Government states that the prisoners are subject to the jurisdiction of military courts, which are now investigating their case in collaboration with their defence counsel.
.With regard to the assassination of Rodolfo Viera, Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer (Case No. ), the Government stated that it had ordered the arrest of the wealthy right-wing businessmen Ricardo Sol Meza and Hans Christ; the latter is currently in Miami and proceedings are at present under way to seek his extradition. The Government adds that the Public Prosecutor has been especially instructed to appoint, on behalf of the State, representatives to take part in the trial being heard by the Fifth Criminal Court and these representatives have already participated in the investigations. The Government points out that Mr Viera was, in addition to being a member of the Salvadorean Communal Onion, a high official of the Government and was looked upon as one of the major proponents of agrarian reform, all of which constituted the motives for his assassination at the wretched hands of the extreme right and extreme left.
.Finally, as regards the allegations concerning the assassination of workers, trade union leaders and school teachers between  October  and  September  (Case No. ) under the presidency of General Carlos Humberto Romero, the Government states that it does not know why the corresponding investigations did not produce any results, if indeed such investigations took place. The Government adds, however, that in order to demonstrate clearly and sincerely that the present rulers of El Salvador are free of any links or compromises with the past, an investigation will be conducted into these deplorable events, the results of which will be transmitted to the Committee as soon as possible.
.Before considering the substance of the various matters raised by the complainants, the Committee would like to express its deep concern at the serious nature of the allegations, most of which refer to the death, assassination, arrest or disappearance of trade unionists and trade union leaders, which have continued to occur even after  October , the date on which the former Government was deposed. While noting the troubled situation which is facing the authorities in El Salvador, the Committee must draw the attention of the Government to the fact that a free and independent trade union movement can develop only in a climate of respect for fundamental human rights, and to the Resolution concerning Trade Onion Rights and their relation to civil liberties adopted by the International Labour Conference in , which states in particular that the concept of trade union rights is totally meaningless in the absence of civil liberties and that the rights conferred on workers' and employers' organisations must be baled on respect for civil liberties.
.The Committee also deplores the fact that in spite of the time which has elapsed, the Government in its observations has still not replied to all the allegations or has done so only incompletely in some of the cases.
.The Committee notes that the Government considers itself free of any responsibility for the events which allegedly occurred before  October . In this connection, the Committee considers, as it already pointed out at its session in February , that there exists a link of continuity between successive governments in the same State and that although a government cannot be held responsible for events which took place under a preceding one, it has a clear responsibility for any consequences which those events might have produced since its accession to power. This principle is particularly applicable as regards the clarification of events which have led to the loss of human lives or the detention of trade unionists who are still being held in prison.
.As regards the allegations concerning the attacks on the lives or persons of trade unionists or trade union leaders, the Committee cannot but deplore the loss of numerous lives and the injuries mentioned in the complaints. The Committee notes the Government's statement that investigations are now under way concerning the events referred to in Cases Nos. ,  and  and, more generally, into the assassinations which allegedly took place between  October  and  December  (Case No. ) concerning which the Government states that an investigation is being ordered, the results of which will be transmitted to the Committee. However, since the Government has not provided information on the death of the trade union leader Tombs Rosales (Case No. ) or the injuries to which reference is made in Cases Nos.  and  and some of the assassinations",-1,1980,El Salvador
317,"referred to in Case No. , the Committee requests the Government to undertake as soon as possible - if it has not already done so - an independent judicial inquiry into these allegations with a view to elucidating the facts in full, determining responsibilities and punishing the guilty parties, and to keep the Committee informed of the results as and when available, of these investigations and those currently under way. The Committee is also of the view that special measures should be taken with a view to guaranteeing the personal security of those persons who are more directly involved in the trade union movement.
.As regards trade union leaders and workers who have been arrested or who have disappeared, the Committee notes that Francisco Girn Ramos has now been set free and that in principle a decision will be issued on his possible guilt on the charge of destroying authentic documents, which will be communicated to the Committee. The Committee also notes that the arrests referred to in Case No.  were the result of an illegal strike in the Rio Lempa Hydroelectric Company which led to the irreparable loss of human lives in hospitals and other medical centres. However, the Committee notes that the Government has not specified the reasons or circumstances which led to the arrest of the trade union leader Rafael Hernndez Olivo, whose present whereabouts are unknown, the arrest of the two members of the National Association of Workers of the Ministry of Agriculture who accompanied Jos Flix Minero on  May  when the latter was assassinated (Case No. ) and that of trade union leaders Enrique Tejada, Antonio Campos Mendoza, Salomn Snchez Mrquez, Vicente Aguirre, Melitn Snchez, Antonio Fuentes and Maximiliano Castro who, according to the complainants, were arrested as they were discussing a list of demands in the premises of the Buses Ruta Urbanos - undertaking and whose present whereabouts are unknown (Case No. ). In this respect, since no information is available on the present situation of the persons mentioned above, and in particular as to whether proceedings have been instigated against them, the Committee cannot but recall that it should be the policy of every government to ensure the right of all detained persons to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment, and point out that the arrest of trade unionists against whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found may involve the restriction of trade union rights and a serious interference with trade union activities. The Committee requests the Government to indicate the motives and circumstances which led to the arrests of the above-mentioned persons and to furnish information on their present situation. More generally, the Committee considers that a contribution would be made towards normalising the trade union situation and labour relations - a necessary objective within the context of the full respect of human rights - and the restoration of social harmony if the Government examined the situation of the arrested persons to whom the complainants refer, with a view to freeing those who may have been arrested for trade union reasons.
.Furthermore, the Committee observes that the Government has not replied to the allegations concerning the threats made against trade unionists and trade union leaders (Cases Nos.  and ), the attack by the armed forces on the premises of FESINCONSTRANS and the destruction of the files of this trade union organisation. The Committee requests the Government to furnish its observations on these matters.
.In a telegram dated  March , the international Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) presented a complaint of infringement of trade union rights in El Salvador. Also, additional information was received from the complainant organisation in two letters dated  March and  July , respectively. These various communications were forwarded to the Government, which supplied observations in a letter dated  September .
.As outlined in paragraphs  and  of this report, numerous other complaints concerning alleged violations of freedom of association have been receives, which are the subject of Cases Nos. , , ,  and  . The complaints mainly concern violent deaths, ill-treatment and arrests of trade union leaders and searches of trade union premises. These complaints have been transmitted to the Government, which has not yet sent its observations. The Committee deplores this situation, and intends to examine these cases at its next session.
.El Salvador has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communications of  and  March , ICFTU alleged that trade union leaders of the Federation of Unions of Workers in the Construction, Transport and Allied Industries (FESINCONSTRANS), which is affiliated to it and represents rural workers among others, were threatened by members of the National Guard of El Salvador on  February  while they were upholding wage claims made by the workers. The complainant organisation specifies that the threats were directed against Jorge Alberto Casillo Muoz, Hector Cncamo Gomez, Juan Pablo Portillo, Jorge Alberto Esquivel and Carlos Antonin Tejada. The complainant organisation also alleges that on  February  the armed forces broke into the premises of FESINCONSTRANS at San Miguel, threatening the trade unionists Zzimo Mercado and Antonio Arias Gonzlez and destroying the trade union files.
.Further allegations were made by ICFTU on  July  to the effect that on  June  armed forces attacked rural workers who had called a peaceful strike to get the management of the undertaking El Granjero SA to accept a number of wage claims under discussion for two months. According to the complainant organisation, Toms Rosales, a leader of the workers' union Granja Santa Ins, affiliated to FESINCONSTRANS, was killed during these clashes and four otter trade unionists wounded.
.ICFTU also alleges teat Carlos Hernndez, a leader of the local trade union mentioned above, was carried off and that the place where he is being held is still unknown despite the approaches which FESINCONSTRANS has made to the authorities, both the Ministry of Defence and the Private Secretariat of the Government Junta, to ascertain his whereabouts.
.In its letter dated  September , the Government explains that a peaceful work stoppage was in fact held on  June  at the undertaking El Granjero SA but the police force had to intervene in order to disperse the strike pickets threatening to damage the undertaking's property, particularly as a number of persons known for their terrorist proclivities had infiltrated their ranks, including Carlos Hernndez who, having incited his companions to disturb the public order, had to be arrested by the military authorities. However, he was released on  June , adds the Government, which has supplied a copy of a statement signed by Mr. Hernandez at the time of his release recognising that he had incited his companions to carry out a work stoppage constituting a disturbance of public order.
.The Committee notes that in the present case the issues raised relate, on the one hand, to the occupation of trade union premises, the destruction of files and threats directed against trade union leaders upholding the wage claims of rural workers and, on the other, to the intervention of the armed forces to break a peaceful strike, the death of a trade unionist and the wounding of several others during clashes with the military forces, as well as the arrest of a trade union leader.
.Regarding the occupation of trade union premises, the destruction of files and threats against trade union leaders, the Committee notes that the Government has not yet supplied any observations.
.Regarding the intervention by the armed forces to break a strike in the undertaking El Granjero SA and the arrest of a trade union leader during the dispute, the Committee takes note of the explanations supplied by the Government to the effect that persons known for their terrorist proclivities had infiltrated among the strikers, including Carlos Hernndez who was arrested on  June and released on  June . It emerges from the information supplied by the Government, however, that Mr. Hernandez was arrested only for having incited the workers to strike, and that the work stoppage had a peaceful character.
.First of all, as regards the complaint relating to the events at the undertaking El Granjero SA, the Committee observes that the Government has made no comment about the death of a trade union leader and the wounding of several others resulting from clashes with the armed forces when the latter intervened to put an end to the strike.
.In this connection, the Committee must however recall that in cases where the dispersal of demonstrations has resulted in loss of human life and injury, it has always' attached special importance to the need to proceed immediately to an impartial and full inquiry to determine responsibility for the action.
.Further, as regards the intervention of the armed forces to put an end to the strike, the Committee wishes first of all to stress the importance it attaches",-1,1980,El Salvador
318,"to the principle that the right to strike must be regarded as one of the essential means available to workers and their organisations for protecting their economic and, social interests. The Committee has also implied on several occasions that it regards the use of police for strike-breaking purposes as an infringement of trade union rights, adding that the intervention of the police should be limited to the maintenance of public order.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) regarding the intervention of the armed forces during the strike at the undertaking El Granjero SA:(i) to draw the attention of the Government to the considerations set forth in the above paragraph, especially the fact that use of police for breaking a strike constitutes an infringement of trade union rights and that the intervention of the police should be limited to the maintenance of public order;(ii) to invite the Government in connection with the allegations relating to the death of Toms Rosales and the wounding of four other trade unionists to state whether a judicial inquiry has been carried out to determine responsibility for the action and to supply its results as soon as they are available;(iii) to note that the trade union leader Carlos Hernndez, arrested during the strike, has been released;(b) to request the Government to supply its observations concerning the allegations relating to the occupation of trade union premises, the destruction of files and threats directed against trade union leaders upholding the wage claims of rural workers;(c) to take note of this interim report.",0,1980,El Salvador
319,".Since  numerous complaints concerning violations of freedom of association in El Salvador have been presented by the following organisations: the United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador (FUSS), the Federation of Unions of Workers in the Food, Clothing, Textile and Allied Industries of El Salvador (FESTIAVTSCES), the Committee for Trade Union Unity of Workers of Central America and Panama (CUSCA), the Trade Unions International of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur Workers, the Trade Unions International of Food, Tobacco, Hotel and Allied Industries Workers, the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the World Federation of Agricultural Workers, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of the Workers of Latin America (CPUSTAL).
.The Committee has already examined most of these cases on several occasions and submitted interim reports to the Governing Body.
.Since then, in the absence of observations from the Government, the Committee adjourned its examination of these cases to February, then May . The Office sent a telegram to the Government on  April  inviting it to submit its observations as soon as possible. In June  the Minister of Labour forwarded additional information.
.El Salvador has not ratified either the freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complaints examined by the Committee were basically of three kinds: first, concerning the violent death and disappearance of trade unionists and former trade unionists; second, arrest of trade union leaders; third, attack on trade union premises and destruction of records.
.At the last examination of the cases in question, in November , the Governing Body, in accordance with the Committee's recommendations, expressed extreme concern at the serious nature of the allegations and observed that various acts had occurred after  October , when the previous Government had been deposed.
.In particular, concerning violent deaths and disappearances, the Governing Body deplored the loss of many human lives and the injuries referred to in the complaints. It noted that investigations had been opened into some of the occurrences and requested the Government to undertake as soon as possible a judicial inquiry into those cases where investigations had not been opened and to inform it of the results.
.In his communication of June , before giving a detailed reply concerning the cases in question, the Minister of Labour stated that, as a human being and as an official, he regretted that in the past acts had occurred in El Salvador which were not perhaps compatible with humane feelings, especially as regards violations of freedom of association such as those denounced to the International Labour Organisation. However, in order to preserve his country's international prestige despite the climate of violence which has prevailed in recent years, resulting in loss of human life and material losses, he stated that he would like to present specific information on the current situation concerning these cases.
.It should therefore be recalled that, in Case No. , the complainants alleged in particular that on  October , workers who were preparing to organise a collection in support of a strike at the El Len factory were attacked by the police, and two of them lost their lives. According to the Government's communication of June , the investigations undertaken and requested from the Ministry of Defence and Public Security confirm that there is no file on events relating to the situation of trade unionists in the El Len factory which occurred under the presidential administration of Colonel Arturo Armando Molina and General Carlos Humberto Romero in  and .
.As regards Case No. , according to a communication of the WCL dated  April , Jos Santos Tiznado and Pedro Gonzlez, leaders of the Salvadorian Peasants' Central, were murdered by uniformed members of the National Guard at midnight, on  May , in the Jsus suburb of the San Ramn municipality in the department of Cuscatln. In addition, Manuel Antonio Carrillo and Jos Antonio Carrillo, former leaders of the Salvadorian Peasants' Central and members of the El Rosario Agricultural and Consumers Co-operative Ltd., were murdered on  June  by members of the forces of repression, as was evident from the calibre of the bullets found near their bodies. As regards Rafael Hernndez Olivo, Secretary General of the Irrigation and Drainage Section of the National Association of workers of the Ministry of Agriculture and Cattle Farming (ANTMAG), who had been transported to the Metapn hospital after being injured in an accident, he had subsequently disappeared, having been arrested by the hacienda police.
.Concerning the homicide of the peasants Jos Santos, Pedro Gonzlez, Manuel Carrillo and Antonio Carrillo, and the disappearance of Rafael Hernndez Olivo, the Government states that the authorities are continuing their investigations.
.In Case No. , the ICFTU alleged, in a communication dated  July , that in a clash with the armed forces on  June , Toms Rosales, a leader of the workers' union of the ""Granja Santa Ins"", had been killed and four other trade unionists had been injured, when the workers at this undertaking had called a peaceful strike in support of a list of wage claims.
.The Government has still not supplied any information on this allegation.
.In Case No. , concerning the murder on  January  of Rodolfo Viera, Secretary General of the Salvadorian Communal Union, and the death of two United States trade unionists Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer, representatives of the AFL-CIO in El Salvador, the Government confirms in its communication of June  that a trial was being held in the fifth criminal court of San Salvador. The accused, Ernesto Sol Meza, has been released on the order of the Supreme Court, after submitting an appeal, and the other accused, Hans Krist, has been acquitted, adds the Government.
.The Committee observes that the Government has supplied certain information on the development of the investigations conducted by the authorities into the death and disappearance of the trade unionists and former trade unionists referred to by the complainants.
.As regards certain events, however, the Committee regrets that despite the time which has elapsed since the complaints were presented, the Government still has not supplied any observations, particularly on the alleged death of Toms Rosales and the injuries inflicted on his fellow workers by the forces of the law on  June  at the Granja Santa Ins. In this respect, the Committee recalls, as it has stated on numerous previous occasions, that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact. It is therefore confident that if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, the latter should recognise the importance for the protection of their own good name of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to the allegations put forward,
.In Case No. , the Committee notes that, according to the Government, an investigation is being made into the homicide of the peasants Jos Santos, Pedro Gonzles, Manuel Carrillo and Antonio Carrillo and the disappearance of Rafael Hernndez Olivo. The Committee again stresses to the Government the need to ensure that the guilty parties are punished and insists that the Government inform it of the results of the current investigations and of the penalties imposed.
.The Committee also notes that in Case No. , the trial in the murder of trade union leader Rodolfo Viera has resulted in the acquittal of one of the accused and that the second has been released pending appeal. In this connection, the Committee must first keenly deplore the murder of these trade unionists. It would also observe that a climate of violence such as that in which the murders were committed constitutes a serious obstacle to the exercise of trade union rights. Consequently, such acts call for effective measures on the part of the authorities. The Committee therefore requests the Government to send it the text of any judgement handed down in this case, and to pursue actively the investigations into these cases.
.During its most recent examination of the substance of these cases, the Committee had also recommended the Governing Body to note that some trade unionists had been released, and had noted that certain arrests were made because of participation in an illegal electricity strike which led to the loss of human lives in hospitals and other welfare centres.
.However, it had also requested the Government to indicate the reasons for and circumstances surrounding the arrests of the leaders Enrique Tejada, Antonio Campos Mendoza, Salomn Snchez Mrquez, Vicente Aguirre, Melitn Snchez, Antonio Fuentes and Maximiliano Castro, and to supply information on their present situation. Recalling that it should be the policy of every government to ensure the right of all detained persons to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment, it pointed out that the arrests of trade unionists against whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found may involve the restriction of trade union rights and a serious interference in trade union activities.
.Lastly,",1,1978,El Salvador
320,"in general terms, it considered that a contribution would be made towards normalising the trade union situation and labour relations - a necessary objective in the context of the full respect of human rights - and the restoration of social harmony if the Government examined the situation of the arrested persons referred to by the complainants, with a view to freeing those arrested for trade union reasons.
.In this connection, the allegations in Case No.  should be recalled. According to CPUSTAL, on  July , trade union leaders Tejada, Mendoza, Mrquez, Aguirre, Snchez, Fuentes and Castro had been arrested by police while discussing a list of claims in the premises of the undertaking Buses Ruta Urbanos -.
.In its communication of June , the Government states, concerning the detention of leaders of the National Union of Workers in the Transport and Allied Industries in the premises of the undertaking Buses Ruta Urbanos -, that a trial is under way.
.The Committee notes that in this case the trade union leaders in question seem to have been in custody for over two years. In this respect, it wishes to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that preventive detention without conviction by a court should not exceed a very brief period and should be intended only to facilitate a judicial inquiry. Holding persons indefinitely in custody without trial is a practice which involves inherent danger of abuse and is for this reason subject to criticism.
.In consequence, the Committee, while noting that a trial is under way, requests the Government to supply the text of the judgement with the grounds therefore, and hopes that, in so far as these trade union leaders have been imprisoned only for legitimate trade union activities, they will be released as soon as possible.""
.The Government was also requested to send its observations on the allegations to which it had not replied, and which, according to the ICFTU in a communication dated  March  relating to Case No. , chiefly concerned an alleged attack by the armed forces on the San Miguel premises of the Federation of Unions of Workers in the Construction, Transport and Allied Industries (FESINCONSTRANS), an organisation affiliated to the ICFTU. During the attack, which is alleged to have taken place on  February  at . p.m., the lives of trade unionists were threatened and trade union records destroyed.
.The Committee regrets, despite the time which has elapsed since the complaint was presented, the absence of the information requested of the Government on this aspect of the case. The Committee notes that this allegation involves principles relating to freedom of association. As it has pointed out before, on receiving an allegation of this kind, the Committee would stress the importance it attaches to certain fundamental principles essential to the exercise of trade union rights, namely that occupation of trade union premises and confiscation of materials and other trade union publications may constitute serious interference by the authorities in trade union affairs. The International Labour Conference, in the Resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties adopted at its th () Session, considered that the right to protection of trade union property is one of the civil liberties which is essential to the normal exercise of trade union rights. Thus, while recognising that neither trade unions nor any other association or individual can be exempt from a search of their premises, the Committee has always considered that, should such action be taken, it should occur only after a warrant has been issued by the ordinary judicial authority, when the latter is satisfied that there are serious grounds for supposing that the necessary evidence for prosecution of a crime will be found, and provided that the search is limited to the purposes for which the warrant was issued. In addition, any authorities who, during a search, exceed the powers conferred on them by law should be punished.
.The Committee therefore urges the Government to forward its observations on the events which occurred on  February  in the San Miguel premises of the trade union federation affiliated to the ICFTU, which according to the complainants was attacked by the armed forces, who also destroyed the trade union records.
.Since , numerous complaints concerning alleged violations of freedom of association in El Salvador have been presented to the Committee by the following organisations: the United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador (FUSS), the Federation of Unions of Workers in the Food, Clothing, Textile and Allied Industries of El Salvador (FESTIAVTSCES), the Committee for Trade Union Unity of Workers of Central America and Panama (CUSCA), the Trade Unions' International of Textile, Clothing and Fur Workers, the Trade Unions' International of Food, Tobacco, Hotel and Allied Industries' Workers, the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the World Federation of Agricultural Workers, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), and the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of Latin American Workers (CPUSTAL).
.The complaints submitted to the Committee include allegations referring to the Assassination, arrest, torture or disappearance of trade union officials and workers, attacks on trade union premises by the armed forces, threats and the destruction of trade union files. The contents of the complaints were successively transmitted to the Government as they were received.
.The Committee has examined Cases Nos. , ,  and  at previous meetings and has presented interim reports to the Governing Body.
.At its session in May , the Committee decided to adjourn its examination of Cases Nos. ,  and  since it had not yet received the detailed information which had been requested from the Government. At its session of November , the Committee once again adjourned its examination of these cases for the same reason and included them in its report under the heading ""Urgent appeals"". At its February  session, the Committee also included Cases Nos. ,  and  under the same heading ""Urgent appeals"" since the Government had failed to provide any detailed information. While noting with concern the troubled situation in El Salvador, the Committee pointed out to the Government that in accordance with the procedural rules currently in force, it could present a report on the substance of the cases pending even if the Government's observations had not been received.
.Given the extremely serious nature of most of the complaints, and since the Government had not provided sufficiently detailed information on the cases pending, the Committee decided at its May  session to apply the procedure contained in paragraphs  and  of its th Report. In accordance with this procedure, the Government was immediately informed that the Chairman of the Committee would make contact, on behalf of the Committee, with representatives of the Government of El Salvador at the th Session of the International Labour Conference in order to draw attention to the various cases in question and discuss the reasons for the delay in the transmission of replies to the allegations contained in these various cases.
.In accordance with the decision adopted by the Committee at its session in May , the Chairman met with the Minister of Labour and Social Security of El Salvador, Mr. Julio Alfredo Samayoa, on  June. The Chairman of the Committee explained the purpose of the meeting. The Minister of Labour stated that his Government's delay in replying to the Committee on the cases pending had been due to the unsettled situation through which his country had been passing for some time and that it was in no way the result of any lack of co-operation by his Government with the ILO and in particular with its supervisory bodies. He then transmitted a communication containing the observations of his Government on these cases, including annexes on Cases Nos.  and . The Minister added that he was prepared to provide any other information which the Committee on Freedom of Association considered necessary.
.Furthermore, the Government had already furnished certain comments on some of the allegations in communications dated , ,  and  May .
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Government states that, the Act which was applied to the case of the ""El Len"" factory (Case No. ) - in which an attack by the police led to the death of two persons - has since been repealed. The Government adds that the investigations which were supposedly ordered by the Government in power at that time did not, for reasons which are unknown, produce any results. The Government states that it considers itself free of any responsibility since the matter concerns acts allegedly committed by the previous Government, with which it has no link of continuity. However, the Government points out that a new inquiry is now being undertaken to clarify the matter, the results of which will be communicated to the Committee.
.As regards the imprisonment of the",-1,1978,El Salvador
321,"trade union leader Francisco Girn Ramos (Case No. ), the Government states that he was indicted on a charge of destroying genuine documents and that there was never any allegation that there had been an infringement of freedom of association. The Government adds that Grancisco Girn has been free since , when the judge ruled that he should be released on bail, although it was not known why a final judgement had not been pronounced at that time. A recommendation has thus been made for a decision be issued as soon as possible and the Committee will be informed accordingly.
.As regards the allegations concerning workers who were killed, wounded and arrested (Case No. ), the Government stated that the acts of violence to which reference had been made probably took place before  October  and that one of the reasons why the previous regime had been deposed was precisely because of the repeated protests against violations of human rights and freedom of association which the Revolutionary Junta was endeavouring to end by all available means. More recently, the Government has declared that a major programme of agrarian reform is currently under way, the socio-economic consequences of which will ensure that the events involved in the present case cannot recur. As regards the death of Trnsito Vsquez, the Government explained that, under a court decision issued on  March , a stay of proceedings was granted concerning the charge relating to wilful homicide and the release was ordered of Mximo Garcia Lpez, Josh Felipe Garcia Vsquez and Sarbelo Garcia Ramirez. The Government adds that the accused had admitted they were members of the Federation of Catholic Peasants of El Salvador (FECCAS) and the Onion of Field Labourers (UTC) and not the Nationalist Democratic Organisation (ORDEN), as had been stated by the complainants.
.As regards the observations made in connection with Case No. , the Government states that, on  June , after a work stoppage had been declared in the ""El Granjero S.A."" undertaking, forces of the Army intervened in order to eject the picketers who had threatened to damage plant equipment. The Government adds that terrorist elements had infiltrated into these groups.
.As regards Case No. , the Government states that it has requested the collaboration of the Ministry of Labour and the Public Prosecutor's Office of the Republic so that appropriate investigations may be made into the events of  December , the results of which will be transmitted in due course. As regards the list supplied by the complainants of workers and peasants who had died, the Government states that their deaths were not the result of repressive action due to their trade union activities and obligations, but rather of the violence which continues to be generated by the extreme left and the extreme right and which, by drawing the armed forces into a purely defensive response, are plunging the country into a bloodbath which has been criticised and deplored by the true citizens of El Salvador.
.With regard to Case No. , in which one of the complainants alleged that five trade unionists had been arrested, the Government states that the events in question were brought about by an illegal strike which bad been declared by the River Lempa Hydroelectric Company Workers' Trade Onion on  and  August . The Government adds that the instigators of the strike violated the provisions of the Constitution by not following the procedure set forth in the Labour Code when they cut off without any advance notice the electricity service throughout the country, which seriously damaged the national economy (with losses exceeding  million colones) and caused the irreparable loss of human lives in hospitals and other medical centres. According to the Government, when the situation reached the point of posing a threat to the national security, since the service involved was one which was indispensable to the community, and as a result of the public outcry, the armed forces intervened in the plant without bloodshed and proceeded to arrest the principal leaders of the strike who - with the exception of those who were not considered to be responsible and who were subsequently released - are now being held in prison, where they are being treated correctly. The Government states that the prisoners are subject to the jurisdiction of military courts, which are now investigating their case in collaboration with their defence counsel.
.With regard to the assassination of Rodolfo Viera, Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer (Case No. ), the Government stated that it had ordered the arrest of the wealthy right-wing businessmen Ricardo Sol Meza and Hans Christ; the latter is currently in Miami and proceedings are at present under way to seek his extradition. The Government adds that the Public Prosecutor has been especially instructed to appoint, on behalf of the State, representatives to take part in the trial being heard by the Fifth Criminal Court and these representatives have already participated in the investigations. The Government points out that Mr Viera was, in addition to being a member of the Salvadorean Communal Onion, a high official of the Government and was looked upon as one of the major proponents of agrarian reform, all of which constituted the motives for his assassination at the wretched hands of the extreme right and extreme left.
.Finally, as regards the allegations concerning the assassination of workers, trade union leaders and school teachers between  October  and  September  (Case No. ) under the presidency of General Carlos Humberto Romero, the Government states that it does not know why the corresponding investigations did not produce any results, if indeed such investigations took place. The Government adds, however, that in order to demonstrate clearly and sincerely that the present rulers of El Salvador are free of any links or compromises with the past, an investigation will be conducted into these deplorable events, the results of which will be transmitted to the Committee as soon as possible.
.Before considering the substance of the various matters raised by the complainants, the Committee would like to express its deep concern at the serious nature of the allegations, most of which refer to the death, assassination, arrest or disappearance of trade unionists and trade union leaders, which have continued to occur even after  October , the date on which the former Government was deposed. While noting the troubled situation which is facing the authorities in El Salvador, the Committee must draw the attention of the Government to the fact that a free and independent trade union movement can develop only in a climate of respect for fundamental human rights, and to the Resolution concerning Trade Onion Rights and their relation to civil liberties adopted by the International Labour Conference in , which states in particular that the concept of trade union rights is totally meaningless in the absence of civil liberties and that the rights conferred on workers' and employers' organisations must be baled on respect for civil liberties.
.The Committee also deplores the fact that in spite of the time which has elapsed, the Government in its observations has still not replied to all the allegations or has done so only incompletely in some of the cases.
.The Committee notes that the Government considers itself free of any responsibility for the events which allegedly occurred before  October . In this connection, the Committee considers, as it already pointed out at its session in February , that there exists a link of continuity between successive governments in the same State and that although a government cannot be held responsible for events which took place under a preceding one, it has a clear responsibility for any consequences which those events might have produced since its accession to power. This principle is particularly applicable as regards the clarification of events which have led to the loss of human lives or the detention of trade unionists who are still being held in prison.
.As regards the allegations concerning the attacks on the lives or persons of trade unionists or trade union leaders, the Committee cannot but deplore the loss of numerous lives and the injuries mentioned in the complaints. The Committee notes the Government's statement that investigations are now under way concerning the events referred to in Cases Nos. ,  and  and, more generally, into the assassinations which allegedly took place between  October  and  December  (Case No. ) concerning which the Government states that an investigation is being ordered, the results of which will be transmitted to the Committee. However, since the Government has not provided information on the death of the trade union leader Tombs Rosales (Case No. ) or the injuries to which reference is made in Cases Nos.  and  and some of the assassinations referred to in Case No. , the Committee requests the Government to undertake as soon as possible - if it has not already done so - an independent judicial inquiry into these allegations with a view to elucidating",-1,1978,El Salvador
322,"the facts in full, determining responsibilities and punishing the guilty parties, and to keep the Committee informed of the results as and when available, of these investigations and those currently under way. The Committee is also of the view that special measures should be taken with a view to guaranteeing the personal security of those persons who are more directly involved in the trade union movement.
.As regards trade union leaders and workers who have been arrested or who have disappeared, the Committee notes that Francisco Girn Ramos has now been set free and that in principle a decision will be issued on his possible guilt on the charge of destroying authentic documents, which will be communicated to the Committee. The Committee also notes that the arrests referred to in Case No.  were the result of an illegal strike in the Rio Lempa Hydroelectric Company which led to the irreparable loss of human lives in hospitals and other medical centres. However, the Committee notes that the Government has not specified the reasons or circumstances which led to the arrest of the trade union leader Rafael Hernndez Olivo, whose present whereabouts are unknown, the arrest of the two members of the National Association of Workers of the Ministry of Agriculture who accompanied Jos Flix Minero on  May  when the latter was assassinated (Case No. ) and that of trade union leaders Enrique Tejada, Antonio Campos Mendoza, Salomn Snchez Mrquez, Vicente Aguirre, Melitn Snchez, Antonio Fuentes and Maximiliano Castro who, according to the complainants, were arrested as they were discussing a list of demands in the premises of the Buses Ruta Urbanos - undertaking and whose present whereabouts are unknown (Case No. ). In this respect, since no information is available on the present situation of the persons mentioned above, and in particular as to whether proceedings have been instigated against them, the Committee cannot but recall that it should be the policy of every government to ensure the right of all detained persons to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment, and point out that the arrest of trade unionists against whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found may involve the restriction of trade union rights and a serious interference with trade union activities. The Committee requests the Government to indicate the motives and circumstances which led to the arrests of the above-mentioned persons and to furnish information on their present situation. More generally, the Committee considers that a contribution would be made towards normalising the trade union situation and labour relations - a necessary objective within the context of the full respect of human rights - and the restoration of social harmony if the Government examined the situation of the arrested persons to whom the complainants refer, with a view to freeing those who may have been arrested for trade union reasons.
.Furthermore, the Committee observes that the Government has not replied to the allegations concerning the threats made against trade unionists and trade union leaders (Cases Nos.  and ), the attack by the armed forces on the premises of FESINCONSTRANS and the destruction of the files of this trade union organisation. The Committee requests the Government to furnish its observations on these matters.
.Cases Nos.  and  were examined by the Committee in May and November , on both of which occasions it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body.
.Case No.  was examined by the Committee in November  and May , on both of which occasions it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body.
.Since it last examined these cases the Committee has received communications from the Trade Unions International of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur porkers ( October ), the Latin American Central of Workers ( April  and  August ) and the World Confederation of Labour ( September ). The Government sent two communications dated  and  December .
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining - Convention,  (No. ).
.Case No.  concerns various allegations, one of which refers to incidents which occurred on  October  during a strike at the El Len factory, when workers were attacked by the police and two of them lost their lives. Other allegations relate to the arrest and torture of  workers of the undertaking Quality food de Centro Amrica and the arrest of  workers and disappearance of two trade union officials during an attack on the offices of two trade unions. According to the complainants all these situations fitted into the general pattern since the passage of an ""anti-terrorist Act"" designed to legalise the repression of the workers.
.Case No.  referred to the imprisonment of a peasant militant, Francisco Girn Ramos, who had been charged with slandering the authorities of Rosario de Mora. According to the complainants the real reason for this arrest lay in the trade union activities of Mr. Girn.
.In Case No.  the complainants alleged that the Government had launched a bloodthirsty campaign of persecution against agricultural workers and their organisations, resulting in many deaths, injuries and arrests.
.In connection with the above allegations the Government stated that various self-styled trade union groups were operating unlawfully, propagating anarchist and anti-democratic doctrines prohibited by the Political Constitution, and committing criminal acts. It was members of these groups, continues the Government, who killed Mr. Trnsito Vsquez. The Government professed its respect for freedom, but said that breaches of the law had occurred and that they would be punished by the competent authorities. In connection with the case of Francisco Girn Ramos, the Government said that his release had been ordered and that proceedings had been instituted against him for the destruction of original documents; the text of the judgement would be communicated once it had been handed down.
.At its May-June  Session, in connection with Case No. , the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, requested the Government to communicate the text of the judgement rendered in the case of Francisco Girn Ramos, with the reasons adduced therefore.
.At its November  Session, in connection with cases Nos.  and , the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, requested the Government to send its observations on the situation of various trade unionists named in an annex, and on the other aspects of the case referred to in paragraphs  to  and  of the Committee's th Report, and to communicate the judgement to be pronounced in the case concerning the death of Mr. Trnsito Vsquez, with the reasons adduced therefore. The Committee has so far not received the information requested.
.In a letter of  October  the Trades Onion International of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur Workers alleges that Jos Guillermo Rivas Gonzlez, General Secretary of the Union of workers in the Cotton, Kenaf, Synthetic Fibre and Allied Textile Industries of El Salvador, was murdered on  September , and that Miguel Angel Solis and Orlando Platero, officials of the Union of Textile Industry Workers, were murdered on  September ; the reason for these alleged murders is said to be the trade union activity of the victims it is also alleged that other trade union officials have been imprisoned.
.By a telegram of  April  the Latin American Central of porkers alleges that the workers of the unions of the national undertakings La Peca, La Constancia, Embotelladora Tropical and STECEL were harshly repressed by the Government because they had demanded collective labour contracts; as a result, seven leaders and militants of these unions have been killed and a number injured.
.By letter of  August  the Latin American Central of workers sends a list of  primary-school teachers allegedly murdered with ""the undisguised complicity of the educational authorities of the country"". In addition to mentioning the full names of the teachers, the list indicates their trade union activities or their relationship with the trade union organisations, their place of work, and the date, place and circumstances of their deaths. In the same letter CLAT repeats the need for the urgent dispatch of a special mission to investigate the situation complained of.
.By a communication of  September  the world Confederation of Labour alleges that some  workers of the IMES undertaking (Industrial Manufactureras, S.A.) in the Republic of El Salvador have been deprived of their work for over three months, and that the undertaking has failed to fulfil its legal and contractual obligations; WCL requests that this document should be attached to the complaints against the Government of El Salvador for systematic violation of labour and trade union rights and ""that the authorities should be asked to take the necessary measures to secure respect for the rights of the workers in order to defend them against the manoeuvres of the foreign firm"".
.By letters of  and  December  the Government has replied to the international Labour office in connection with",-1,1978,El Salvador
323,"the complaints. According to it, the Government of the Revolutionary Junta of El Salvador, since its installation on  October , has adopted a policy entirely different from that of earlier regimes, a policy of absolute respect for human rights, including freedom of association; it accepts no responsibility for any violations which may have occurred in the past.
.The Committee notes the statement made in December  by the new Government that it will follow a policy of respect for human rights, including the aspects relating to freedom of association. Nevertheless, the Committee considers that a general statement of this nature does not provide the elements of information necessary for the elucidation of the present cases, since they are part of a well-defined series of circumstances and situations the examination of which requires it to be in possession of the information which the Governing Body has requested of the Government on repeated occasions.
.The Committee recalls that on earlier occasions, when examining allegations relating to the violation of trade union rights by a government, it has emphasised that there exists a link of continuity between successive governments in the same State and that although a government cannot be held responsible for events which took place under a preceding one, it has a clear responsibility for any consequences which those events might have produced since its accession to power. In this sense, the Committee has taken the view that, where a change of regime has taken place in a country, the new government should take all necessary steps to remedy any continuing effects which events complained of as having taken place under its predecessor might have had since its accession to power.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to take note of the statement made in December  of the new Government that it has adopted a policy of respect for human rights, including aspects relating to freedom of association;(b) to request the Government to send:(i) information in connection with paragraphs  and  of the present report, respecting the proceedings against Mr. Francisco Girn Ramos, the present situation of the various trade unionists listed in the annex to this case, the accusations of torture and persecution of trade unionists and trade union organisations, the stage reached in the proceedings in connection with the death of Mr. Trnsito Vsquez, and the incidents which occurred during a strike of workers of the El Len factory;(ii) its observations on the new allegations referred to in paragraphs , ,  and  of the present report, relating to the murder of the workers, trade union officials and primary-school teachers mentioned in the annex to this case, to the repression of workers and trade unions which demanded collective labour agreements, and to the situation of  workers of the IMES undertaking;(c) to take note of the present interim report.
.The Committee last examined these cases in May , when it submitted interim conclusions in paragraphs  to  of its st Report. This report was approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (- June ).
.The complaints were presented by  trade union organisations of El Salvador and by the Trade Unions International of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur Workers, the Trade Unions International of Food, Tobacco, Hotel and Allied Industries Workers, the United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador (FUSS), the Federation of Unions of Workers in the Food, Clothing, Textile and Allied Industries of El Salvador (FESTIAVTSCES) and the Committee for Trade Union Unity of Workers of Central America and Panama (CUSCA), and, with respect to Case No. , the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) and the World Confederation of Agricultural Workers (WCAW). The Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) also presented a complaint relating to the latter case by a communication of  July .
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations outstanding in Case No.  referred firstly to incidents which had occurred during a strike at the El Lon factory. According to the complaint (dated  October ) the workers who had been preparing to organise a collection in support of the strike had been attacked by the police and two of them had lost their lives.
.The complainants further alleged that the following trade union leaders had been tortured during their imprisonment in July : Romeo Soto Crespo, Gilberto Ruiz Ponce, Miguel Rivera Valle, Rufino Gonzlez Avelar, Teresa Francisca Maldonado (who subsequently disappeared) and Ricardo Erazo (arrested in January ). They also mentioned the disappearance, in January , of Rafael Antonio Martinez, a member of the executive of the Leather Workers' Union.
.Other complaints referred to arrests. It was alleged that the firm ""Lcteas Foremost"" had helped to bring about the arrest of the following persons: Jos Napolen Mina, Carlos Humberto Gonzlez, officials of the employees' union of the company, arrested on  March ; Jos Mauricio Gmez, an official of the same union, arrested on  April; Jos Ricardo Martinez Flores, an official of the National Trade Union Federation of the Salvadorian Workers (FENASTRAS), arrested on  March; and Carlos Ernesto Marin Ayala, arrested on  May. Furthermore, Hctor Antonio Acevedo, an official of the union of the ""Cosmos"" undertaking, had been arrested at Santa Ana on  October . According to the complainants the Government had promulgated an ""anti-territorist Act"" designed to legalise the repression of the workers. Thus, on  December ,  workers of the undertaking ""Quality Food de Centro Amrica"" had been arrested and had been released the next day after being tortured. On  December the arrest had taken place of Rodolfo Hernndez Rosales and Miguel Guzmn, officials of the workers' union of the ""Alianza"" undertaking, and Daniel Garca Guevara, an official of the workers' union of the ""Famosa"" undertaking.
.On  November , the complainants alleged, the national guard had raided the premises of the Puerto El Triunfo Fish Industries Employees' Union and had arrested the following militants and officials: Alejandro Molina Lara, Julio C. Salazar, Oscar L. Chaves, Delia Cristina Hernndez and Juan Francisco Alvarenga.
.As regards Case No.  the complainants stated that the Government had launched a campaign of bloody persecution against agricultural workers and their organisations, in particular against the Salvadorian Agricultural Workers' Federation, resulting in more than  killed and many wounded, in the towns of El Rodeo, La Esperanza, Tecoluco and San Pedro Perulupa. According to the complainant many agricultural workers' leaders had been arrested. On  March , continued the complainant, Trnsito Vsquez, a local leader of FECCAS in the town of La Esperanza, had been murdered by members of the Nationalist Democratic Organisation (ORDEN), a paramilitary government organisation. His body had been found the next day, covered with wounds, and there were indications that he had been tortured. According to the complainants all the available information led to the assumption that the large-scale demonstrations by agricultural workers in the towns of Tecoluco, La Esperanza, Tenancingo, El Rodeo and San Pedro Perulupa, which were held in the following days, should be considered as a reaction of indignation at the murder and at the fact that a number of helicopters of the armed forces had fired on the crowd during the funeral of Trnsito Vsquez.
.The Government had not at that time sent its observations on the various allegations.
.In Case No.  certain complainants had pressed for the appointment of a commission or the dispatch of a representative of the Director-General for an on-the-spot study of the allegations made in the complaint. In Case No. , WCL requested that a commission should immediately be sent to examine the allegations, since it was of the opinion that neither fundamental human rights nor trade union rights were respected in El Salvador, where there were persecutions of trade unions in general and agricultural workers' unions in particular. As early as February  the Committee had noted the gravity of the allegations made by the complainants (in Case No. ). Following its recommendation the Governing Body had at that time expressed its deep concern at the acts committed against trade unions or their leaders which remained unexplained and their harmful implications for the functioning of trade union organisations and the development of industrial relations in the country. The subsequent complaint (Case No. ) also contained extremely serious allegations in respect of many workers and trade unionists who were said to have been killed, injured or arrested.
.In these circumstances the Committee considered in May  that resort should be had to the direct contacts procedure, under which a representative of the Director-General would be sent to the country for discussions with the public authorities and contacts with the workers' and employers' organisations, in order to determine the facts and study possible solutions. The representative of the Director-General would then submit his report to the Committee, which would be able to examine the allegations and formulate its own conclusions with better knowledge",1,1978,El Salvador
324,"of the facts.
.On the recommendation of the Committee the Governing Body requested the Government to give its consent to a representative of the Director-General visiting El Salvador at an early date to examine the allegations made within the context of the direct contacts procedure.
.In a Letter of  June  the Government states that self-styled peasant groups, calling themselves the ""Federation of Catholic Peasants of EL Salvador"" (FECCAS) and the ""Union of Field Labourers"" (UTC) have taken advantage of the freedom of expression enjoyed by the population to cake public statements on various occasions - for instance on  May  in the newspaper La Crnica - that they form the basis of a clandestine organisation, the ""People's Revolutionary Bloc"" (BPR), to appeal to all workers to give their ""organised and militant support to the people's cause"" within the Revolutionary Council of Trade Unions (CSR) and to eliminate ""tendencies opposing their class interests which can only mislead the proletariat and confuse their minds ..."". These various groups, adds the Government, operate unlawfully, not only because they have not been granted legal personality by the State but also because they are propagating anarchist and anti-democratic doctrines prohibited by section  of the Constitution.
.In their issues of ,  and  March , continues the Government, national newspapers with wide readership ( a Prensa Grfica, Diario de Hoy, Diario Latino and Diario el Mundo) reported that religious organisations of peasants such as the Bloc, Led by recognised agents of international communism, have progressed from political propaganda to purely criminal acts such as sacking, destroying and burning the humble homes of peasants who are unwilling to abide by their watchwords of hatred, violence and death; the Government is saddened by the pictures of many groups of families who have fled these attacks. Other citizens have been faced with the choice between joining the Bloc or suffering the consequences of its ""militancy"". The victims of such acts include  dead and many wounded; the newspapers have reported a number of atrocities committed by members of FECCAS, UTC and BPR, particularly on Trnsito Vsquez after they had killed him. Members of these groups injure people, tie them up and stone them, and travel around in gangs shouting threats over loud-speakers.
.Following instructions received from abroad, continues the Government, the enemies of El Salvador have set a characteristic pattern for internal strife by highly unconventional means ranging from sedition and subversion to smear campaigns abroad which disguise reality and present a false image of the country to friendly nations. The Government adds that it is not its intention to make a secret of social and economic problems, but that patriotic citizens are convinced that these problems must be solved with the participation of all sectors in the country, in a peaceful and orderly manner and with scrupulous respect for the Law. They oppose the class struggle which is being fomented in some quarters and the violence advocated by others. They are partisans of a humanist and democratic approach affording each individual the opportunity for self-development. The Government believes that the status of an individual is determined by his efforts, his capacities and his conduct and not by noble birth or inherited wealth. It seeks the welfare of all without prejudice to the rights of others, in the conviction that social equilibrium is to be found in mutual understanding of the rights and duties of each citizen. Peace cannot exist without justice, says the Government, but justice cannot exist without the maintenance of the peaceful climate which is a prerequisite for constructive work and without means of defence against subversive conspiracy; security is essential for the promotion of economic development, which brings social progress and justice in its train.
.The Government adds that the acts committed by elements of FECCAS, UTC and BPR are designated as offences within the competence of the penal court by the Act respecting the defence and maintenance of public order. The penal court has examined four files, from which it transpires that:(a) the persons who were prosecuted acted in their capacity as members of FECCAS and UTC, both of which are members of the BPR, and were either the authors of the crimes or accessories thereto;(b) the accused have appointed counsel for the defence, and steps have been taken to enable the counsel to intervene on their behalf;(c) the accused, Mximo Garcia Lpez, Jose Felipe Matas Vsquez and Sarbelio Garcia Ramirez, cite the names of Tranquilino Prez, Faustino Vsquez and Marcelino Prez, all members of the above-mentioned subversive organisations, as being responsible for the death of Trnsito Vsquez, having put him to death because he refused to take part in the crimes committed against the peasants of the townships of EL Rodeo, La Esperanza, Tecoluco and Miraflores in the circumscription of San Pedro Perulupa; these allegations were corroborated by the testimony of other persons who were present when the aforesaid accused made their extra-judicial statements; these witnesses are not members of the security forces and, when they questioned the accused as to whether their statements were spontaneous, they were told that this was the case;(d) the persons involved took part in the attack on the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare in November .The documents of the trial are available for consultation by persons who are duly authorised by the Law..The Government rejects allegations that it persecutes trade union organisations of all kinds. On the contrary, it points out that there are  trade unions with legal personality carrying on their activities in full freedom and quotes many other figures relating to trade union sections, federations and Confederations, collective Labour agreements, etc. The Government also indicates that the unions have been able to elect workers' representatives to the management board of the Social Security Institute of EL Salvador, the National Minimum Wage Council and the Social Housing Fund.

.Finally, the Government reaffirms its respect for individual rights, including freedom of association. It encourages the formation of trade unions and collective bargaining; it protects organisations in the exercise of their functions in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. It does not, however, countenance any violation of the Law which may be under investigation by the competent authorities, since the independence of the authorities of the State in their respective legal capacities is respected in the country and their competence cannot be delegated to other bodies.
.In a telegram of  July  the WCL and the WCAW allege that Pedro Lpez, a member of the executive Committee of the Latin American Peasant Federation, has been arrested at Cojutepeque and that his whereabouts are unknown. CLAT refers to the same facts in its communication of  July , adding that the person concerned is General Secretary of the Peasant Federation of El Salvador and a member of the national executive of the Confederation of Workers of El Salvador. He is said to have been arrested and beaten by the security forces on  July .
.The Government has not yet replied to these various allegations.
.WCL and WCAW recently presented further allegations in a letter dated  October . These allegations, which refer to the break-up of a union in an INCA undertaking, have been transmitted to the Government for observations.
.The Committee will examine at its next session, in the light of the reply received from the Government, the question of establishing direct contacts to clarify the issues raised in the present cases.
.The Committee notes the information communicated by the Government. The latter replies partially to the serious allegations made, giving details only on the legal proceedings taken following the death of Trnsito Vsquez and on the identity of the presumed authors of the homicide. In this connection the Committee notes the contradictions between this information and the content of the complaints. It would like to receive a copy of the judgement to be given in this case and detailed information on all the other aspects of the cases.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note the reply of the Government as regards the trade union situation as a whole and as regards the particular case of Mr. Trnsito Vsquez;(b) to request the Government to send its observations by  January  at the latest on the situation of the trade unionists named in the Annex hereto and on the other aspects of the case referred to in paragraphs  to  and , and to communicate the judgement to be pronounced in the case concerning the death of",1,1978,El Salvador
325,"Mr. Vsquez, with the reasons adduced therefor;(c) to take note of the present interim report.
.The Committee has already examined Case No.  at its sessions in November  and February , when it submitted interim conclusions to the Governing Body in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its st Session (November ), and in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (March ).
.The complaints and additional information were presented by  trade union organisations of El Salvador and by the Trade Unions International of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur Workers, the Trade Unions International of Food, Tobacco, Hotel and Allied Industries Workers, the United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador (FUSS), the Federation of Unions of Workers in the Food, Clothing, Textile and Allied Industries of El Salvador (FESTIAVTSCES) and the Committee for Trade Union Unity of Workers of Central America and Panama (CUSCA). The Government of El Salvador, for its part, sent observations on the various allegations made.
.More recently, the world Confederation of Labour presented a complaint by communication of  April , and sent additional information in a communication of  April . This complaint figured as Case No. .
.The Committee has decided to deal in a single report with the questions still outstanding from Case No.  and the new complaint contained in Case No. .
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In case No.  FUSS and FESTIAVTSCES pressed for the appointment of a commission or the dispatch of a representative of the Director-General for an on-the-spot study of the allegations made in the complaint. At its February  meeting the Committee decided to postpone the examination of this request.
.In Case No.  WCL requests that a commission should immediately be sent to examine the allegations, since it is of the opinion that neither fundamental human rights nor trade union rights are respected in El Salvador, where there are persecutions of trade unions in general and agricultural workers' unions in particular.
.When the Committee examined the complaints in Case No.  at its February  session, it noted the gravity of the allegations made by the complainants. Following the recommendation of the Committee the Governing Body expressed its deep concern at the acts committed against trade unions or their leaders which remained unexplained and their harmful implications for the functioning of trade union organisations and the development of industrial relations in the country.
.The most recent complaint made by WCL in Case No.  also contains extremely serious allegations in respect of many workers and trade unionists who are said to have been killed, injured or arrested.
.In the light of all these circumstances the Committee considers that resort should be had to the direct contacts procedure, under which a representative of the Director-General is sent to the country for discussions with the public authorities and contacts with the workers' and employers' organisations, and to determine the facts and study possible solutions. The representative would then submit his report to the Committee, which would be able to examine the allegations and formulate its own conclusions with better knowledge of the facts.
.In this respect the Committee wishes to stress that the object of the procedure is to guarantee the respect of freedom of association both in law and in fact; it is convinced that this procedure can protect governments against unfounded accusations, provided that they recognise the importance for their own good name of collaborating fully with the Committee to enable it to undertake a thorough examination of the allegations and seek solutions to the problems.",1,1978,El Salvador
326,".Since  numerous complaints concerning violations of freedom of association in El Salvador have been presented by the following organisations: the United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador (FUSS), the Federation of Unions of Workers in the Food, Clothing, Textile and Allied Industries of El Salvador (FESTIAVTSCES), the Committee for Trade Union Unity of Workers of Central America and Panama (CUSCA), the Trade Unions International of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur Workers, the Trade Unions International of Food, Tobacco, Hotel and Allied Industries Workers, the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the World Federation of Agricultural Workers, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of the Workers of Latin America (CPUSTAL).
.The Committee has already examined most of these cases on several occasions and submitted interim reports to the Governing Body.
.Since then, in the absence of observations from the Government, the Committee adjourned its examination of these cases to February, then May . The Office sent a telegram to the Government on  April  inviting it to submit its observations as soon as possible. In June  the Minister of Labour forwarded additional information.
.El Salvador has not ratified either the freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complaints examined by the Committee were basically of three kinds: first, concerning the violent death and disappearance of trade unionists and former trade unionists; second, arrest of trade union leaders; third, attack on trade union premises and destruction of records.
.At the last examination of the cases in question, in November , the Governing Body, in accordance with the Committee's recommendations, expressed extreme concern at the serious nature of the allegations and observed that various acts had occurred after  October , when the previous Government had been deposed.
.In particular, concerning violent deaths and disappearances, the Governing Body deplored the loss of many human lives and the injuries referred to in the complaints. It noted that investigations had been opened into some of the occurrences and requested the Government to undertake as soon as possible a judicial inquiry into those cases where investigations had not been opened and to inform it of the results.
.In his communication of June , before giving a detailed reply concerning the cases in question, the Minister of Labour stated that, as a human being and as an official, he regretted that in the past acts had occurred in El Salvador which were not perhaps compatible with humane feelings, especially as regards violations of freedom of association such as those denounced to the International Labour Organisation. However, in order to preserve his country's international prestige despite the climate of violence which has prevailed in recent years, resulting in loss of human life and material losses, he stated that he would like to present specific information on the current situation concerning these cases.
.It should therefore be recalled that, in Case No. , the complainants alleged in particular that on  October , workers who were preparing to organise a collection in support of a strike at the El Len factory were attacked by the police, and two of them lost their lives. According to the Government's communication of June , the investigations undertaken and requested from the Ministry of Defence and Public Security confirm that there is no file on events relating to the situation of trade unionists in the El Len factory which occurred under the presidential administration of Colonel Arturo Armando Molina and General Carlos Humberto Romero in  and .
.As regards Case No. , according to a communication of the WCL dated  April , Jos Santos Tiznado and Pedro Gonzlez, leaders of the Salvadorian Peasants' Central, were murdered by uniformed members of the National Guard at midnight, on  May , in the Jsus suburb of the San Ramn municipality in the department of Cuscatln. In addition, Manuel Antonio Carrillo and Jos Antonio Carrillo, former leaders of the Salvadorian Peasants' Central and members of the El Rosario Agricultural and Consumers Co-operative Ltd., were murdered on  June  by members of the forces of repression, as was evident from the calibre of the bullets found near their bodies. As regards Rafael Hernndez Olivo, Secretary General of the Irrigation and Drainage Section of the National Association of workers of the Ministry of Agriculture and Cattle Farming (ANTMAG), who had been transported to the Metapn hospital after being injured in an accident, he had subsequently disappeared, having been arrested by the hacienda police.
.Concerning the homicide of the peasants Jos Santos, Pedro Gonzlez, Manuel Carrillo and Antonio Carrillo, and the disappearance of Rafael Hernndez Olivo, the Government states that the authorities are continuing their investigations.
.In Case No. , the ICFTU alleged, in a communication dated  July , that in a clash with the armed forces on  June , Toms Rosales, a leader of the workers' union of the ""Granja Santa Ins"", had been killed and four other trade unionists had been injured, when the workers at this undertaking had called a peaceful strike in support of a list of wage claims.
.The Government has still not supplied any information on this allegation.
.In Case No. , concerning the murder on  January  of Rodolfo Viera, Secretary General of the Salvadorian Communal Union, and the death of two United States trade unionists Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer, representatives of the AFL-CIO in El Salvador, the Government confirms in its communication of June  that a trial was being held in the fifth criminal court of San Salvador. The accused, Ernesto Sol Meza, has been released on the order of the Supreme Court, after submitting an appeal, and the other accused, Hans Krist, has been acquitted, adds the Government.
.The Committee observes that the Government has supplied certain information on the development of the investigations conducted by the authorities into the death and disappearance of the trade unionists and former trade unionists referred to by the complainants.
.As regards certain events, however, the Committee regrets that despite the time which has elapsed since the complaints were presented, the Government still has not supplied any observations, particularly on the alleged death of Toms Rosales and the injuries inflicted on his fellow workers by the forces of the law on  June  at the Granja Santa Ins. In this respect, the Committee recalls, as it has stated on numerous previous occasions, that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact. It is therefore confident that if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, the latter should recognise the importance for the protection of their own good name of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to the allegations put forward,
.In Case No. , the Committee notes that, according to the Government, an investigation is being made into the homicide of the peasants Jos Santos, Pedro Gonzles, Manuel Carrillo and Antonio Carrillo and the disappearance of Rafael Hernndez Olivo. The Committee again stresses to the Government the need to ensure that the guilty parties are punished and insists that the Government inform it of the results of the current investigations and of the penalties imposed.
.The Committee also notes that in Case No. , the trial in the murder of trade union leader Rodolfo Viera has resulted in the acquittal of one of the accused and that the second has been released pending appeal. In this connection, the Committee must first keenly deplore the murder of these trade unionists. It would also observe that a climate of violence such as that in which the murders were committed constitutes a serious obstacle to the exercise of trade union rights. Consequently, such acts call for effective measures on the part of the authorities. The Committee therefore requests the Government to send it the text of any judgement handed down in this case, and to pursue actively the investigations into these cases.
.During its most recent examination of the substance of these cases, the Committee had also recommended the Governing Body to note that some trade unionists had been released, and had noted that certain arrests were made because of participation in an illegal electricity strike which led to the loss of human lives in hospitals and other welfare centres.
.However, it had also requested the Government to indicate the reasons for and circumstances surrounding the arrests of the leaders Enrique Tejada, Antonio Campos Mendoza, Salomn Snchez Mrquez, Vicente Aguirre, Melitn Snchez, Antonio Fuentes and Maximiliano Castro, and to supply information on their present situation. Recalling that it should be the policy of every government to ensure the right of all detained persons to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment, it pointed out that the arrests of trade unionists against whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found may involve the restriction of trade union rights and a serious interference in trade union activities.
.Lastly,",1,1977,El Salvador
327,"in general terms, it considered that a contribution would be made towards normalising the trade union situation and labour relations - a necessary objective in the context of the full respect of human rights - and the restoration of social harmony if the Government examined the situation of the arrested persons referred to by the complainants, with a view to freeing those arrested for trade union reasons.
.In this connection, the allegations in Case No.  should be recalled. According to CPUSTAL, on  July , trade union leaders Tejada, Mendoza, Mrquez, Aguirre, Snchez, Fuentes and Castro had been arrested by police while discussing a list of claims in the premises of the undertaking Buses Ruta Urbanos -.
.In its communication of June , the Government states, concerning the detention of leaders of the National Union of Workers in the Transport and Allied Industries in the premises of the undertaking Buses Ruta Urbanos -, that a trial is under way.
.The Committee notes that in this case the trade union leaders in question seem to have been in custody for over two years. In this respect, it wishes to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that preventive detention without conviction by a court should not exceed a very brief period and should be intended only to facilitate a judicial inquiry. Holding persons indefinitely in custody without trial is a practice which involves inherent danger of abuse and is for this reason subject to criticism.
.In consequence, the Committee, while noting that a trial is under way, requests the Government to supply the text of the judgement with the grounds therefore, and hopes that, in so far as these trade union leaders have been imprisoned only for legitimate trade union activities, they will be released as soon as possible.""
.The Government was also requested to send its observations on the allegations to which it had not replied, and which, according to the ICFTU in a communication dated  March  relating to Case No. , chiefly concerned an alleged attack by the armed forces on the San Miguel premises of the Federation of Unions of Workers in the Construction, Transport and Allied Industries (FESINCONSTRANS), an organisation affiliated to the ICFTU. During the attack, which is alleged to have taken place on  February  at . p.m., the lives of trade unionists were threatened and trade union records destroyed.
.The Committee regrets, despite the time which has elapsed since the complaint was presented, the absence of the information requested of the Government on this aspect of the case. The Committee notes that this allegation involves principles relating to freedom of association. As it has pointed out before, on receiving an allegation of this kind, the Committee would stress the importance it attaches to certain fundamental principles essential to the exercise of trade union rights, namely that occupation of trade union premises and confiscation of materials and other trade union publications may constitute serious interference by the authorities in trade union affairs. The International Labour Conference, in the Resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties adopted at its th () Session, considered that the right to protection of trade union property is one of the civil liberties which is essential to the normal exercise of trade union rights. Thus, while recognising that neither trade unions nor any other association or individual can be exempt from a search of their premises, the Committee has always considered that, should such action be taken, it should occur only after a warrant has been issued by the ordinary judicial authority, when the latter is satisfied that there are serious grounds for supposing that the necessary evidence for prosecution of a crime will be found, and provided that the search is limited to the purposes for which the warrant was issued. In addition, any authorities who, during a search, exceed the powers conferred on them by law should be punished.
.The Committee therefore urges the Government to forward its observations on the events which occurred on  February  in the San Miguel premises of the trade union federation affiliated to the ICFTU, which according to the complainants was attacked by the armed forces, who also destroyed the trade union records.
.Since , numerous complaints concerning alleged violations of freedom of association in El Salvador have been presented to the Committee by the following organisations: the United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador (FUSS), the Federation of Unions of Workers in the Food, Clothing, Textile and Allied Industries of El Salvador (FESTIAVTSCES), the Committee for Trade Union Unity of Workers of Central America and Panama (CUSCA), the Trade Unions' International of Textile, Clothing and Fur Workers, the Trade Unions' International of Food, Tobacco, Hotel and Allied Industries' Workers, the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the World Federation of Agricultural Workers, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), and the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of Latin American Workers (CPUSTAL).
.The complaints submitted to the Committee include allegations referring to the Assassination, arrest, torture or disappearance of trade union officials and workers, attacks on trade union premises by the armed forces, threats and the destruction of trade union files. The contents of the complaints were successively transmitted to the Government as they were received.
.The Committee has examined Cases Nos. , ,  and  at previous meetings and has presented interim reports to the Governing Body.
.At its session in May , the Committee decided to adjourn its examination of Cases Nos. ,  and  since it had not yet received the detailed information which had been requested from the Government. At its session of November , the Committee once again adjourned its examination of these cases for the same reason and included them in its report under the heading ""Urgent appeals"". At its February  session, the Committee also included Cases Nos. ,  and  under the same heading ""Urgent appeals"" since the Government had failed to provide any detailed information. While noting with concern the troubled situation in El Salvador, the Committee pointed out to the Government that in accordance with the procedural rules currently in force, it could present a report on the substance of the cases pending even if the Government's observations had not been received.
.Given the extremely serious nature of most of the complaints, and since the Government had not provided sufficiently detailed information on the cases pending, the Committee decided at its May  session to apply the procedure contained in paragraphs  and  of its th Report. In accordance with this procedure, the Government was immediately informed that the Chairman of the Committee would make contact, on behalf of the Committee, with representatives of the Government of El Salvador at the th Session of the International Labour Conference in order to draw attention to the various cases in question and discuss the reasons for the delay in the transmission of replies to the allegations contained in these various cases.
.In accordance with the decision adopted by the Committee at its session in May , the Chairman met with the Minister of Labour and Social Security of El Salvador, Mr. Julio Alfredo Samayoa, on  June. The Chairman of the Committee explained the purpose of the meeting. The Minister of Labour stated that his Government's delay in replying to the Committee on the cases pending had been due to the unsettled situation through which his country had been passing for some time and that it was in no way the result of any lack of co-operation by his Government with the ILO and in particular with its supervisory bodies. He then transmitted a communication containing the observations of his Government on these cases, including annexes on Cases Nos.  and . The Minister added that he was prepared to provide any other information which the Committee on Freedom of Association considered necessary.
.Furthermore, the Government had already furnished certain comments on some of the allegations in communications dated , ,  and  May .
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Government states that, the Act which was applied to the case of the ""El Len"" factory (Case No. ) - in which an attack by the police led to the death of two persons - has since been repealed. The Government adds that the investigations which were supposedly ordered by the Government in power at that time did not, for reasons which are unknown, produce any results. The Government states that it considers itself free of any responsibility since the matter concerns acts allegedly committed by the previous Government, with which it has no link of continuity. However, the Government points out that a new inquiry is now being undertaken to clarify the matter, the results of which will be communicated to the Committee.
.As regards the imprisonment of the",-1,1977,El Salvador
328,"trade union leader Francisco Girn Ramos (Case No. ), the Government states that he was indicted on a charge of destroying genuine documents and that there was never any allegation that there had been an infringement of freedom of association. The Government adds that Grancisco Girn has been free since , when the judge ruled that he should be released on bail, although it was not known why a final judgement had not been pronounced at that time. A recommendation has thus been made for a decision be issued as soon as possible and the Committee will be informed accordingly.
.As regards the allegations concerning workers who were killed, wounded and arrested (Case No. ), the Government stated that the acts of violence to which reference had been made probably took place before  October  and that one of the reasons why the previous regime had been deposed was precisely because of the repeated protests against violations of human rights and freedom of association which the Revolutionary Junta was endeavouring to end by all available means. More recently, the Government has declared that a major programme of agrarian reform is currently under way, the socio-economic consequences of which will ensure that the events involved in the present case cannot recur. As regards the death of Trnsito Vsquez, the Government explained that, under a court decision issued on  March , a stay of proceedings was granted concerning the charge relating to wilful homicide and the release was ordered of Mximo Garcia Lpez, Josh Felipe Garcia Vsquez and Sarbelo Garcia Ramirez. The Government adds that the accused had admitted they were members of the Federation of Catholic Peasants of El Salvador (FECCAS) and the Onion of Field Labourers (UTC) and not the Nationalist Democratic Organisation (ORDEN), as had been stated by the complainants.
.As regards the observations made in connection with Case No. , the Government states that, on  June , after a work stoppage had been declared in the ""El Granjero S.A."" undertaking, forces of the Army intervened in order to eject the picketers who had threatened to damage plant equipment. The Government adds that terrorist elements had infiltrated into these groups.
.As regards Case No. , the Government states that it has requested the collaboration of the Ministry of Labour and the Public Prosecutor's Office of the Republic so that appropriate investigations may be made into the events of  December , the results of which will be transmitted in due course. As regards the list supplied by the complainants of workers and peasants who had died, the Government states that their deaths were not the result of repressive action due to their trade union activities and obligations, but rather of the violence which continues to be generated by the extreme left and the extreme right and which, by drawing the armed forces into a purely defensive response, are plunging the country into a bloodbath which has been criticised and deplored by the true citizens of El Salvador.
.With regard to Case No. , in which one of the complainants alleged that five trade unionists had been arrested, the Government states that the events in question were brought about by an illegal strike which bad been declared by the River Lempa Hydroelectric Company Workers' Trade Onion on  and  August . The Government adds that the instigators of the strike violated the provisions of the Constitution by not following the procedure set forth in the Labour Code when they cut off without any advance notice the electricity service throughout the country, which seriously damaged the national economy (with losses exceeding  million colones) and caused the irreparable loss of human lives in hospitals and other medical centres. According to the Government, when the situation reached the point of posing a threat to the national security, since the service involved was one which was indispensable to the community, and as a result of the public outcry, the armed forces intervened in the plant without bloodshed and proceeded to arrest the principal leaders of the strike who - with the exception of those who were not considered to be responsible and who were subsequently released - are now being held in prison, where they are being treated correctly. The Government states that the prisoners are subject to the jurisdiction of military courts, which are now investigating their case in collaboration with their defence counsel.
.With regard to the assassination of Rodolfo Viera, Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer (Case No. ), the Government stated that it had ordered the arrest of the wealthy right-wing businessmen Ricardo Sol Meza and Hans Christ; the latter is currently in Miami and proceedings are at present under way to seek his extradition. The Government adds that the Public Prosecutor has been especially instructed to appoint, on behalf of the State, representatives to take part in the trial being heard by the Fifth Criminal Court and these representatives have already participated in the investigations. The Government points out that Mr Viera was, in addition to being a member of the Salvadorean Communal Onion, a high official of the Government and was looked upon as one of the major proponents of agrarian reform, all of which constituted the motives for his assassination at the wretched hands of the extreme right and extreme left.
.Finally, as regards the allegations concerning the assassination of workers, trade union leaders and school teachers between  October  and  September  (Case No. ) under the presidency of General Carlos Humberto Romero, the Government states that it does not know why the corresponding investigations did not produce any results, if indeed such investigations took place. The Government adds, however, that in order to demonstrate clearly and sincerely that the present rulers of El Salvador are free of any links or compromises with the past, an investigation will be conducted into these deplorable events, the results of which will be transmitted to the Committee as soon as possible.
.Before considering the substance of the various matters raised by the complainants, the Committee would like to express its deep concern at the serious nature of the allegations, most of which refer to the death, assassination, arrest or disappearance of trade unionists and trade union leaders, which have continued to occur even after  October , the date on which the former Government was deposed. While noting the troubled situation which is facing the authorities in El Salvador, the Committee must draw the attention of the Government to the fact that a free and independent trade union movement can develop only in a climate of respect for fundamental human rights, and to the Resolution concerning Trade Onion Rights and their relation to civil liberties adopted by the International Labour Conference in , which states in particular that the concept of trade union rights is totally meaningless in the absence of civil liberties and that the rights conferred on workers' and employers' organisations must be baled on respect for civil liberties.
.The Committee also deplores the fact that in spite of the time which has elapsed, the Government in its observations has still not replied to all the allegations or has done so only incompletely in some of the cases.
.The Committee notes that the Government considers itself free of any responsibility for the events which allegedly occurred before  October . In this connection, the Committee considers, as it already pointed out at its session in February , that there exists a link of continuity between successive governments in the same State and that although a government cannot be held responsible for events which took place under a preceding one, it has a clear responsibility for any consequences which those events might have produced since its accession to power. This principle is particularly applicable as regards the clarification of events which have led to the loss of human lives or the detention of trade unionists who are still being held in prison.
.As regards the allegations concerning the attacks on the lives or persons of trade unionists or trade union leaders, the Committee cannot but deplore the loss of numerous lives and the injuries mentioned in the complaints. The Committee notes the Government's statement that investigations are now under way concerning the events referred to in Cases Nos. ,  and  and, more generally, into the assassinations which allegedly took place between  October  and  December  (Case No. ) concerning which the Government states that an investigation is being ordered, the results of which will be transmitted to the Committee. However, since the Government has not provided information on the death of the trade union leader Tombs Rosales (Case No. ) or the injuries to which reference is made in Cases Nos.  and  and some of the assassinations referred to in Case No. , the Committee requests the Government to undertake as soon as possible - if it has not already done so - an independent judicial inquiry into these allegations with a view to elucidating",-1,1977,El Salvador
329,"the facts in full, determining responsibilities and punishing the guilty parties, and to keep the Committee informed of the results as and when available, of these investigations and those currently under way. The Committee is also of the view that special measures should be taken with a view to guaranteeing the personal security of those persons who are more directly involved in the trade union movement.
.As regards trade union leaders and workers who have been arrested or who have disappeared, the Committee notes that Francisco Girn Ramos has now been set free and that in principle a decision will be issued on his possible guilt on the charge of destroying authentic documents, which will be communicated to the Committee. The Committee also notes that the arrests referred to in Case No.  were the result of an illegal strike in the Rio Lempa Hydroelectric Company which led to the irreparable loss of human lives in hospitals and other medical centres. However, the Committee notes that the Government has not specified the reasons or circumstances which led to the arrest of the trade union leader Rafael Hernndez Olivo, whose present whereabouts are unknown, the arrest of the two members of the National Association of Workers of the Ministry of Agriculture who accompanied Jos Flix Minero on  May  when the latter was assassinated (Case No. ) and that of trade union leaders Enrique Tejada, Antonio Campos Mendoza, Salomn Snchez Mrquez, Vicente Aguirre, Melitn Snchez, Antonio Fuentes and Maximiliano Castro who, according to the complainants, were arrested as they were discussing a list of demands in the premises of the Buses Ruta Urbanos - undertaking and whose present whereabouts are unknown (Case No. ). In this respect, since no information is available on the present situation of the persons mentioned above, and in particular as to whether proceedings have been instigated against them, the Committee cannot but recall that it should be the policy of every government to ensure the right of all detained persons to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment, and point out that the arrest of trade unionists against whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found may involve the restriction of trade union rights and a serious interference with trade union activities. The Committee requests the Government to indicate the motives and circumstances which led to the arrests of the above-mentioned persons and to furnish information on their present situation. More generally, the Committee considers that a contribution would be made towards normalising the trade union situation and labour relations - a necessary objective within the context of the full respect of human rights - and the restoration of social harmony if the Government examined the situation of the arrested persons to whom the complainants refer, with a view to freeing those who may have been arrested for trade union reasons.
.Furthermore, the Committee observes that the Government has not replied to the allegations concerning the threats made against trade unionists and trade union leaders (Cases Nos.  and ), the attack by the armed forces on the premises of FESINCONSTRANS and the destruction of the files of this trade union organisation. The Committee requests the Government to furnish its observations on these matters.
.Cases Nos.  and  were examined by the Committee in May and November , on both of which occasions it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body.
.Case No.  was examined by the Committee in November  and May , on both of which occasions it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body.
.Since it last examined these cases the Committee has received communications from the Trade Unions International of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur porkers ( October ), the Latin American Central of Workers ( April  and  August ) and the World Confederation of Labour ( September ). The Government sent two communications dated  and  December .
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining - Convention,  (No. ).
.Case No.  concerns various allegations, one of which refers to incidents which occurred on  October  during a strike at the El Len factory, when workers were attacked by the police and two of them lost their lives. Other allegations relate to the arrest and torture of  workers of the undertaking Quality food de Centro Amrica and the arrest of  workers and disappearance of two trade union officials during an attack on the offices of two trade unions. According to the complainants all these situations fitted into the general pattern since the passage of an ""anti-terrorist Act"" designed to legalise the repression of the workers.
.Case No.  referred to the imprisonment of a peasant militant, Francisco Girn Ramos, who had been charged with slandering the authorities of Rosario de Mora. According to the complainants the real reason for this arrest lay in the trade union activities of Mr. Girn.
.In Case No.  the complainants alleged that the Government had launched a bloodthirsty campaign of persecution against agricultural workers and their organisations, resulting in many deaths, injuries and arrests.
.In connection with the above allegations the Government stated that various self-styled trade union groups were operating unlawfully, propagating anarchist and anti-democratic doctrines prohibited by the Political Constitution, and committing criminal acts. It was members of these groups, continues the Government, who killed Mr. Trnsito Vsquez. The Government professed its respect for freedom, but said that breaches of the law had occurred and that they would be punished by the competent authorities. In connection with the case of Francisco Girn Ramos, the Government said that his release had been ordered and that proceedings had been instituted against him for the destruction of original documents; the text of the judgement would be communicated once it had been handed down.
.At its May-June  Session, in connection with Case No. , the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, requested the Government to communicate the text of the judgement rendered in the case of Francisco Girn Ramos, with the reasons adduced therefore.
.At its November  Session, in connection with cases Nos.  and , the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, requested the Government to send its observations on the situation of various trade unionists named in an annex, and on the other aspects of the case referred to in paragraphs  to  and  of the Committee's th Report, and to communicate the judgement to be pronounced in the case concerning the death of Mr. Trnsito Vsquez, with the reasons adduced therefore. The Committee has so far not received the information requested.
.In a letter of  October  the Trades Onion International of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur Workers alleges that Jos Guillermo Rivas Gonzlez, General Secretary of the Union of workers in the Cotton, Kenaf, Synthetic Fibre and Allied Textile Industries of El Salvador, was murdered on  September , and that Miguel Angel Solis and Orlando Platero, officials of the Union of Textile Industry Workers, were murdered on  September ; the reason for these alleged murders is said to be the trade union activity of the victims it is also alleged that other trade union officials have been imprisoned.
.By a telegram of  April  the Latin American Central of porkers alleges that the workers of the unions of the national undertakings La Peca, La Constancia, Embotelladora Tropical and STECEL were harshly repressed by the Government because they had demanded collective labour contracts; as a result, seven leaders and militants of these unions have been killed and a number injured.
.By letter of  August  the Latin American Central of workers sends a list of  primary-school teachers allegedly murdered with ""the undisguised complicity of the educational authorities of the country"". In addition to mentioning the full names of the teachers, the list indicates their trade union activities or their relationship with the trade union organisations, their place of work, and the date, place and circumstances of their deaths. In the same letter CLAT repeats the need for the urgent dispatch of a special mission to investigate the situation complained of.
.By a communication of  September  the world Confederation of Labour alleges that some  workers of the IMES undertaking (Industrial Manufactureras, S.A.) in the Republic of El Salvador have been deprived of their work for over three months, and that the undertaking has failed to fulfil its legal and contractual obligations; WCL requests that this document should be attached to the complaints against the Government of El Salvador for systematic violation of labour and trade union rights and ""that the authorities should be asked to take the necessary measures to secure respect for the rights of the workers in order to defend them against the manoeuvres of the foreign firm"".
.By letters of  and  December  the Government has replied to the international Labour office in connection with",-1,1977,El Salvador
330,"the complaints. According to it, the Government of the Revolutionary Junta of El Salvador, since its installation on  October , has adopted a policy entirely different from that of earlier regimes, a policy of absolute respect for human rights, including freedom of association; it accepts no responsibility for any violations which may have occurred in the past.
.The Committee notes the statement made in December  by the new Government that it will follow a policy of respect for human rights, including the aspects relating to freedom of association. Nevertheless, the Committee considers that a general statement of this nature does not provide the elements of information necessary for the elucidation of the present cases, since they are part of a well-defined series of circumstances and situations the examination of which requires it to be in possession of the information which the Governing Body has requested of the Government on repeated occasions.
.The Committee recalls that on earlier occasions, when examining allegations relating to the violation of trade union rights by a government, it has emphasised that there exists a link of continuity between successive governments in the same State and that although a government cannot be held responsible for events which took place under a preceding one, it has a clear responsibility for any consequences which those events might have produced since its accession to power. In this sense, the Committee has taken the view that, where a change of regime has taken place in a country, the new government should take all necessary steps to remedy any continuing effects which events complained of as having taken place under its predecessor might have had since its accession to power.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to take note of the statement made in December  of the new Government that it has adopted a policy of respect for human rights, including aspects relating to freedom of association;(b) to request the Government to send:(i) information in connection with paragraphs  and  of the present report, respecting the proceedings against Mr. Francisco Girn Ramos, the present situation of the various trade unionists listed in the annex to this case, the accusations of torture and persecution of trade unionists and trade union organisations, the stage reached in the proceedings in connection with the death of Mr. Trnsito Vsquez, and the incidents which occurred during a strike of workers of the El Len factory;(ii) its observations on the new allegations referred to in paragraphs , ,  and  of the present report, relating to the murder of the workers, trade union officials and primary-school teachers mentioned in the annex to this case, to the repression of workers and trade unions which demanded collective labour agreements, and to the situation of  workers of the IMES undertaking;(c) to take note of the present interim report.
.The Committee already examined this case at its session in November , when it presented interim conclusions in paragraphs  to  of its nd Report. The Governing Body approved this report in November  (th Session).
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), nor the Rural Workers' Organisations Convention,  (No. ).
.The WCL alleged that because of repression by the Salvadorian Government, action by the El Salvador Peasants' Central Union (CCS) in defence of rural workers was becoming increasingly difficult. The complainants added that militants of the organisation had been accused of illegal occupation of land and arrested on  October ; they were being held in the prison of Ilobasco, Cabaas Department. The persons concerned were Gilberto Echeverra Mndez, Julin Pilr Echeverra, Dolores Amadeo Rivas, Jose Santos Aguilar and Alejandro Apolonio Mndez. The WCL stated that the land in question belonged to the CEL autonomous company and not to the two landowners (Gamaliel Menjivar and Elias de Jests Rivas) who had denounced the militants. The complainants saw this as proof that violence had become institutionalised in El Salvador, since persons who did not own the land in question had succeeded, by means of forged documents and false witnesses, in having prison sentences passed on the peasants by the judges.
.The allegations still outstanding also related to the imprisonment of a peasant militant, Francisco Girn Ramos, who according to the WCL had been detained since  January  in the Santa Tecla prison, Department of La Libertad, on charges of slandering the authorities of Rosario de Mora; according to the complainants this accusation was designed to divert attention from the real activities of the person concerned in the field of peasants' trade unionism.
.In its reply the Government explained, as regards the persons accused of illegal occupation of land, that Mr. Elias de Jests Rivas Pea had lodged a complaint on  September  with the judge of first instance of Ilobasco, on the grounds that the persons in question had forced their way on to his property without authorisation, had taken possession of land and had prevented him from exploiting it. They had also destroyed the fences separating Mr. Rivas Pena's property from that of Mr. Jose Antonio Menjivar. According to the Government Mr. Rivas Pea had produced his title deeds before the court. Various witnesses had confirmed that the accused had used violence to gain access to the land and had begun to work on it. The examining magistrate had checked that the illegally occupied land was part of the plaintiff's property, and on  October  the judge of first instance, considering that there was sufficient proof, had ordered the arrest of the persons concerned and decided to bring the case before a court.
.The Government further indicated that Francisco Girn Ramos had been arrested on  January  for being drunk and disorderly, and had been held in the Rosario de Mora municipal prison. According to a witness, he had destroyed identity documents and official gazettes in the town hall. The justice of the peace, continued the Government, had ordered him to be placed under temporary arrest. This measure was confirmed by the penal judge and Mr. Ramos was placed under preventive detention at the Nueva San Salvador prison. He was subsequently released on bail on  March . The proceedings were continuing.
.The Government pointed out that the cases before the Committee had been the subject of judicial investigation; in the course of the trials, neither the accused nor their counsel had alleged that violations of human rights and freedom of association had been committed. The Government added that the El Salvador Peasants' Central Union was not an occupational association organised in conformity with the provisions of the Labour Code, nor had it applied to the authorities for recognition as a special association, as provided for under the civil Code.
.The Committee noted, in November , that in order to enable it to come to a decision on the substance of the case, and in particular to determine whether the proceedings instituted had a bearing on the exercise of trade union rights, it would be most useful for it to have at its disposal the texts of judgements rendered. On the recommendation of the Committee the Governing Body requested the Government to provide these judgements.
.In a letter of  February  the Government states that the proceedings instituted against Francisco Girn Ramos for destruction of original documents are still in progress and that the judgement will be communicated in due course. The Committee takes note of this information.
.The Government also sends a copy of the judgements rendered in respect of the other persons mentioned, from which it transpires that the acts complained of - illegal occupation of land by violent means and damage to the property of Elias de Jests Rivas Pea - occurred on  September . The accused, who had already been freed on bail, were acquitted on  June  by a judgement of a court of first instance; the judgement was upheld following an appeal. The decision became final on expiry of the time limit for lodging an appeal against it.
.The Committee is aware that agricultural workers' unions are confronted with special difficulties in many countries. The International Labour Conference has recently examined problems of rural workers' unions and their role in economic and social development, and adopted a Convention and a Recommendation on the subject in . According to Article  of this Convention, it shall be an objective of national policy concerning rural development to facilitate the establishment and growth, on a voluntary basis, of strong and independent organisations of rural workers as an effective means of ensuring the participation of rural workers, without discrimination, in economic and social development and in the benefits resulting therefore. Paragraph  of the Recommendation adds that such organisations should, as appropriate, be able to involve the various categories of rural workers, according to the interests of each, at all stages of implementation of programmes of agrarian reform, land settlement",1,1977,El Salvador
331,"and land development.
.The Committee has already considered on earlier occasions cases relating in particular to peasants who had occupied land to which they claimed a right, and in such cases it has always considered that the questions raised related to land ownership and tenure governed by specific national legislation having nothing to do with the problems of freedom of association.
.In the present case the Committee notes that the five peasant militants mentioned by the complainants have been released. These persons, as is clear from the texts of the judgements communicated by the Government, were accused of illegal occupation of land by violent means and damage to property. The Committee accordingly considers that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.
.In these circumstances it recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note with interest the release of the five peasant militants mentioned by the complainant and to decide, for the reasons set forth in the previous paragraph, that this aspect of the case calls for no further examination;(b) to request the Government to communicate, as already promised, the text of the judgement rendered in the case of Francisco Girn Ramos, with the reasons adduced therefor;(c) to take note of the present interim report.
.In a communication dated  March , the world Confederation of Labour presented a complaint concerning the alleged violation of trade union rights in El Salvador. The text of this communication was transmitted to the Government, which sent its observations in a communication of  May .
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication, which was also written on behalf of the world Federation of Agricultural Workers (WFAW-CMT), the world Confederation of Labour alleged that one of the main targets for repression by the Salvadorian Government was the El Salvador Peasants' Central Union (CCS), whose function of defending the workers' rural sector was, according to the complainants, becoming increasingly difficult.
.The WCL continued by stating that militants of CCS had been arrested on  October  and were now being held in the prison of Ilobasco, Cabaas Department. The persons concerned were Gilberto Echeverra Mndez, Julin Pilar Echeverra, Dolores Amadeo Rivas, Jos Santos Aguilar and Alejandro Apolonio Mndez. According to the WCL these persons had been accused of illegal occupation of land. The WCL stated that the land in question belonged to the CEL autonomous company and not to the persons who denounced these militants, namely Gamaliel Menjivar and Elias de Jests Rivas, both of whom were landowners. The WCL saw this as proof that violence has become institutionalised in El Salvador, since persons who did not own the land in question had succeeded, by means of forged documents and false witnesses, in having prison sentences passed on the peasants by the judges.
.The WCL added that two peasant militants, Francisco Girn Ramos and Germn Ortiz, had been detained since  January  in the Santa Tecla Prison, Department of La Libertad, on charges of slandering the authorities of Rosario de Mora. According to the complainants this accusation was designed to divert attention from the real activities of these two militants in the field of peasants' trade unionism.
.In its reply the Government explained, as regards the persons accused of illegal occupation of land, that Mr. Elias de Jess Riva Pena had lodged a complaint on  September  with the judge of first instance of Ilobasco. The grounds for the charge were that the persons in question had forced their way onto the property of Mr. Elas de Jests Riva Pea without authorisation and had taken possession of land in such a way as to prevent him from exploiting his property. They had also destroyed the fences separating Mr. Riva Pea's property from that of Mr. Jos Antonio Menjivar. Mr. Riva Pea produced his title deeds before the court. Various witnesses confirmed that the persons mentioned had used violence to gain access to the land and had begun to work on it.
.The examining magistrate had checked that the illegally occupied land was part of the plaintiff's property, and on  October  the judge of first instance, considering that there was sufficient proof, ordered the arrest of the persons concerned and decided to bring the case before the courts. The trial proceedings are at this stage.
.As regards Mr. Francisco Girn Ramos, the Government stated that this person had been arrested on  January  for being drunk and disorderly, and had been held in the Rosario de Mora municipal prison. A witness had stated that the person concerned had destroyed identity documents and official gazettes in the town hall, and the justice of the peace had ordered Mr. Francisco Girn Ramos to be placed under temporary arrest. This measure was confirmed by the penal judge, and Mr. Ramos was placed under preventive detention at the Nueva San Salvador prison. He was subsequently released on bail on  March . The proceedings are continuing until a final decision has been taken.
.In connection with Mr. German Cruz Ortiz, the Government stated that the local commanding officer of Rosario de Mora brought this person before the justice of the peace on  February  for insulting behaviour to the authorities in command of a military convoy. After hearing witnesses, the justice of the peace ordered Mr. Cruz to be placed in temporary custody. On  February  the judge of the criminal court ordered his release for lack of evidence. Mr. German Cruz Ortiz was immediately released.
.In conclusion, the Government pointed out that the cases before the Committee had been the subject of judicial investigation. It added that, in the course of the trials, neither the accused nor their counsel had alleged that violations of human rights and freedom of association had been committed. Finally, the Government observed that the El Salvador Peasants' Central Union was not an occupational association organised in conformity with the provisions of the Labour Code, nor had it applied to the Government for recognition as a special association, as provided for under the Civil Code.
.The Committee notes that the complaint concerns measures of arrest taken against peasants who were supposedly members of a peasant organisation which according to the Government is not an association within the terms of the Labour Code or the civil code. The Committee also notes that the persons in question were accused of illegal occupation of land, drunken and disorderly behaviour, or insulting the authorities. The Committee observes that the persons mentioned by the complainants are being tried before the courts, with the exception of one whose trial did not proceed for lack of evidence. The Committee feels that, in order to enable it to come to a decision on the substance of the case, and in particular to determine whether the proceedings instituted have a bearing on the exercise of trade union rights, it would be most useful for it to have at its disposal the texts of the judgements rendered.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note with interest that Mr. German Cruz Ortiz, one of the persons mentioned by the complainants, has been released;(b) to request the Government to provide the texts of the judgements rendered in respect of the other persons mentioned by the complainants as soon as these are available;(c) to take note of the present interim report.",-1,1977,El Salvador
332,".Since  numerous complaints concerning violations of freedom of association in El Salvador have been presented by the following organisations: the United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador (FUSS), the Federation of Unions of Workers in the Food, Clothing, Textile and Allied Industries of El Salvador (FESTIAVTSCES), the Committee for Trade Union Unity of Workers of Central America and Panama (CUSCA), the Trade Unions International of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur Workers, the Trade Unions International of Food, Tobacco, Hotel and Allied Industries Workers, the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the World Federation of Agricultural Workers, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of the Workers of Latin America (CPUSTAL).
.The Committee has already examined most of these cases on several occasions and submitted interim reports to the Governing Body.
.Since then, in the absence of observations from the Government, the Committee adjourned its examination of these cases to February, then May . The Office sent a telegram to the Government on  April  inviting it to submit its observations as soon as possible. In June  the Minister of Labour forwarded additional information.
.El Salvador has not ratified either the freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complaints examined by the Committee were basically of three kinds: first, concerning the violent death and disappearance of trade unionists and former trade unionists; second, arrest of trade union leaders; third, attack on trade union premises and destruction of records.
.At the last examination of the cases in question, in November , the Governing Body, in accordance with the Committee's recommendations, expressed extreme concern at the serious nature of the allegations and observed that various acts had occurred after  October , when the previous Government had been deposed.
.In particular, concerning violent deaths and disappearances, the Governing Body deplored the loss of many human lives and the injuries referred to in the complaints. It noted that investigations had been opened into some of the occurrences and requested the Government to undertake as soon as possible a judicial inquiry into those cases where investigations had not been opened and to inform it of the results.
.In his communication of June , before giving a detailed reply concerning the cases in question, the Minister of Labour stated that, as a human being and as an official, he regretted that in the past acts had occurred in El Salvador which were not perhaps compatible with humane feelings, especially as regards violations of freedom of association such as those denounced to the International Labour Organisation. However, in order to preserve his country's international prestige despite the climate of violence which has prevailed in recent years, resulting in loss of human life and material losses, he stated that he would like to present specific information on the current situation concerning these cases.
.It should therefore be recalled that, in Case No. , the complainants alleged in particular that on  October , workers who were preparing to organise a collection in support of a strike at the El Len factory were attacked by the police, and two of them lost their lives. According to the Government's communication of June , the investigations undertaken and requested from the Ministry of Defence and Public Security confirm that there is no file on events relating to the situation of trade unionists in the El Len factory which occurred under the presidential administration of Colonel Arturo Armando Molina and General Carlos Humberto Romero in  and .
.As regards Case No. , according to a communication of the WCL dated  April , Jos Santos Tiznado and Pedro Gonzlez, leaders of the Salvadorian Peasants' Central, were murdered by uniformed members of the National Guard at midnight, on  May , in the Jsus suburb of the San Ramn municipality in the department of Cuscatln. In addition, Manuel Antonio Carrillo and Jos Antonio Carrillo, former leaders of the Salvadorian Peasants' Central and members of the El Rosario Agricultural and Consumers Co-operative Ltd., were murdered on  June  by members of the forces of repression, as was evident from the calibre of the bullets found near their bodies. As regards Rafael Hernndez Olivo, Secretary General of the Irrigation and Drainage Section of the National Association of workers of the Ministry of Agriculture and Cattle Farming (ANTMAG), who had been transported to the Metapn hospital after being injured in an accident, he had subsequently disappeared, having been arrested by the hacienda police.
.Concerning the homicide of the peasants Jos Santos, Pedro Gonzlez, Manuel Carrillo and Antonio Carrillo, and the disappearance of Rafael Hernndez Olivo, the Government states that the authorities are continuing their investigations.
.In Case No. , the ICFTU alleged, in a communication dated  July , that in a clash with the armed forces on  June , Toms Rosales, a leader of the workers' union of the ""Granja Santa Ins"", had been killed and four other trade unionists had been injured, when the workers at this undertaking had called a peaceful strike in support of a list of wage claims.
.The Government has still not supplied any information on this allegation.
.In Case No. , concerning the murder on  January  of Rodolfo Viera, Secretary General of the Salvadorian Communal Union, and the death of two United States trade unionists Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer, representatives of the AFL-CIO in El Salvador, the Government confirms in its communication of June  that a trial was being held in the fifth criminal court of San Salvador. The accused, Ernesto Sol Meza, has been released on the order of the Supreme Court, after submitting an appeal, and the other accused, Hans Krist, has been acquitted, adds the Government.
.The Committee observes that the Government has supplied certain information on the development of the investigations conducted by the authorities into the death and disappearance of the trade unionists and former trade unionists referred to by the complainants.
.As regards certain events, however, the Committee regrets that despite the time which has elapsed since the complaints were presented, the Government still has not supplied any observations, particularly on the alleged death of Toms Rosales and the injuries inflicted on his fellow workers by the forces of the law on  June  at the Granja Santa Ins. In this respect, the Committee recalls, as it has stated on numerous previous occasions, that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact. It is therefore confident that if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, the latter should recognise the importance for the protection of their own good name of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to the allegations put forward,
.In Case No. , the Committee notes that, according to the Government, an investigation is being made into the homicide of the peasants Jos Santos, Pedro Gonzles, Manuel Carrillo and Antonio Carrillo and the disappearance of Rafael Hernndez Olivo. The Committee again stresses to the Government the need to ensure that the guilty parties are punished and insists that the Government inform it of the results of the current investigations and of the penalties imposed.
.The Committee also notes that in Case No. , the trial in the murder of trade union leader Rodolfo Viera has resulted in the acquittal of one of the accused and that the second has been released pending appeal. In this connection, the Committee must first keenly deplore the murder of these trade unionists. It would also observe that a climate of violence such as that in which the murders were committed constitutes a serious obstacle to the exercise of trade union rights. Consequently, such acts call for effective measures on the part of the authorities. The Committee therefore requests the Government to send it the text of any judgement handed down in this case, and to pursue actively the investigations into these cases.
.During its most recent examination of the substance of these cases, the Committee had also recommended the Governing Body to note that some trade unionists had been released, and had noted that certain arrests were made because of participation in an illegal electricity strike which led to the loss of human lives in hospitals and other welfare centres.
.However, it had also requested the Government to indicate the reasons for and circumstances surrounding the arrests of the leaders Enrique Tejada, Antonio Campos Mendoza, Salomn Snchez Mrquez, Vicente Aguirre, Melitn Snchez, Antonio Fuentes and Maximiliano Castro, and to supply information on their present situation. Recalling that it should be the policy of every government to ensure the right of all detained persons to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment, it pointed out that the arrests of trade unionists against whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found may involve the restriction of trade union rights and a serious interference in trade union activities.
.Lastly,",-1,1976,El Salvador
333,"in general terms, it considered that a contribution would be made towards normalising the trade union situation and labour relations - a necessary objective in the context of the full respect of human rights - and the restoration of social harmony if the Government examined the situation of the arrested persons referred to by the complainants, with a view to freeing those arrested for trade union reasons.
.In this connection, the allegations in Case No.  should be recalled. According to CPUSTAL, on  July , trade union leaders Tejada, Mendoza, Mrquez, Aguirre, Snchez, Fuentes and Castro had been arrested by police while discussing a list of claims in the premises of the undertaking Buses Ruta Urbanos -.
.In its communication of June , the Government states, concerning the detention of leaders of the National Union of Workers in the Transport and Allied Industries in the premises of the undertaking Buses Ruta Urbanos -, that a trial is under way.
.The Committee notes that in this case the trade union leaders in question seem to have been in custody for over two years. In this respect, it wishes to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that preventive detention without conviction by a court should not exceed a very brief period and should be intended only to facilitate a judicial inquiry. Holding persons indefinitely in custody without trial is a practice which involves inherent danger of abuse and is for this reason subject to criticism.
.In consequence, the Committee, while noting that a trial is under way, requests the Government to supply the text of the judgement with the grounds therefore, and hopes that, in so far as these trade union leaders have been imprisoned only for legitimate trade union activities, they will be released as soon as possible.""
.The Government was also requested to send its observations on the allegations to which it had not replied, and which, according to the ICFTU in a communication dated  March  relating to Case No. , chiefly concerned an alleged attack by the armed forces on the San Miguel premises of the Federation of Unions of Workers in the Construction, Transport and Allied Industries (FESINCONSTRANS), an organisation affiliated to the ICFTU. During the attack, which is alleged to have taken place on  February  at . p.m., the lives of trade unionists were threatened and trade union records destroyed.
.The Committee regrets, despite the time which has elapsed since the complaint was presented, the absence of the information requested of the Government on this aspect of the case. The Committee notes that this allegation involves principles relating to freedom of association. As it has pointed out before, on receiving an allegation of this kind, the Committee would stress the importance it attaches to certain fundamental principles essential to the exercise of trade union rights, namely that occupation of trade union premises and confiscation of materials and other trade union publications may constitute serious interference by the authorities in trade union affairs. The International Labour Conference, in the Resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties adopted at its th () Session, considered that the right to protection of trade union property is one of the civil liberties which is essential to the normal exercise of trade union rights. Thus, while recognising that neither trade unions nor any other association or individual can be exempt from a search of their premises, the Committee has always considered that, should such action be taken, it should occur only after a warrant has been issued by the ordinary judicial authority, when the latter is satisfied that there are serious grounds for supposing that the necessary evidence for prosecution of a crime will be found, and provided that the search is limited to the purposes for which the warrant was issued. In addition, any authorities who, during a search, exceed the powers conferred on them by law should be punished.
.The Committee therefore urges the Government to forward its observations on the events which occurred on  February  in the San Miguel premises of the trade union federation affiliated to the ICFTU, which according to the complainants was attacked by the armed forces, who also destroyed the trade union records.
.Since , numerous complaints concerning alleged violations of freedom of association in El Salvador have been presented to the Committee by the following organisations: the United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador (FUSS), the Federation of Unions of Workers in the Food, Clothing, Textile and Allied Industries of El Salvador (FESTIAVTSCES), the Committee for Trade Union Unity of Workers of Central America and Panama (CUSCA), the Trade Unions' International of Textile, Clothing and Fur Workers, the Trade Unions' International of Food, Tobacco, Hotel and Allied Industries' Workers, the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the World Federation of Agricultural Workers, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), and the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of Latin American Workers (CPUSTAL).
.The complaints submitted to the Committee include allegations referring to the Assassination, arrest, torture or disappearance of trade union officials and workers, attacks on trade union premises by the armed forces, threats and the destruction of trade union files. The contents of the complaints were successively transmitted to the Government as they were received.
.The Committee has examined Cases Nos. , ,  and  at previous meetings and has presented interim reports to the Governing Body.
.At its session in May , the Committee decided to adjourn its examination of Cases Nos. ,  and  since it had not yet received the detailed information which had been requested from the Government. At its session of November , the Committee once again adjourned its examination of these cases for the same reason and included them in its report under the heading ""Urgent appeals"". At its February  session, the Committee also included Cases Nos. ,  and  under the same heading ""Urgent appeals"" since the Government had failed to provide any detailed information. While noting with concern the troubled situation in El Salvador, the Committee pointed out to the Government that in accordance with the procedural rules currently in force, it could present a report on the substance of the cases pending even if the Government's observations had not been received.
.Given the extremely serious nature of most of the complaints, and since the Government had not provided sufficiently detailed information on the cases pending, the Committee decided at its May  session to apply the procedure contained in paragraphs  and  of its th Report. In accordance with this procedure, the Government was immediately informed that the Chairman of the Committee would make contact, on behalf of the Committee, with representatives of the Government of El Salvador at the th Session of the International Labour Conference in order to draw attention to the various cases in question and discuss the reasons for the delay in the transmission of replies to the allegations contained in these various cases.
.In accordance with the decision adopted by the Committee at its session in May , the Chairman met with the Minister of Labour and Social Security of El Salvador, Mr. Julio Alfredo Samayoa, on  June. The Chairman of the Committee explained the purpose of the meeting. The Minister of Labour stated that his Government's delay in replying to the Committee on the cases pending had been due to the unsettled situation through which his country had been passing for some time and that it was in no way the result of any lack of co-operation by his Government with the ILO and in particular with its supervisory bodies. He then transmitted a communication containing the observations of his Government on these cases, including annexes on Cases Nos.  and . The Minister added that he was prepared to provide any other information which the Committee on Freedom of Association considered necessary.
.Furthermore, the Government had already furnished certain comments on some of the allegations in communications dated , ,  and  May .
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Government states that, the Act which was applied to the case of the ""El Len"" factory (Case No. ) - in which an attack by the police led to the death of two persons - has since been repealed. The Government adds that the investigations which were supposedly ordered by the Government in power at that time did not, for reasons which are unknown, produce any results. The Government states that it considers itself free of any responsibility since the matter concerns acts allegedly committed by the previous Government, with which it has no link of continuity. However, the Government points out that a new inquiry is now being undertaken to clarify the matter, the results of which will be communicated to the Committee.
.As regards the imprisonment of the",-1,1976,El Salvador
334,"trade union leader Francisco Girn Ramos (Case No. ), the Government states that he was indicted on a charge of destroying genuine documents and that there was never any allegation that there had been an infringement of freedom of association. The Government adds that Grancisco Girn has been free since , when the judge ruled that he should be released on bail, although it was not known why a final judgement had not been pronounced at that time. A recommendation has thus been made for a decision be issued as soon as possible and the Committee will be informed accordingly.
.As regards the allegations concerning workers who were killed, wounded and arrested (Case No. ), the Government stated that the acts of violence to which reference had been made probably took place before  October  and that one of the reasons why the previous regime had been deposed was precisely because of the repeated protests against violations of human rights and freedom of association which the Revolutionary Junta was endeavouring to end by all available means. More recently, the Government has declared that a major programme of agrarian reform is currently under way, the socio-economic consequences of which will ensure that the events involved in the present case cannot recur. As regards the death of Trnsito Vsquez, the Government explained that, under a court decision issued on  March , a stay of proceedings was granted concerning the charge relating to wilful homicide and the release was ordered of Mximo Garcia Lpez, Josh Felipe Garcia Vsquez and Sarbelo Garcia Ramirez. The Government adds that the accused had admitted they were members of the Federation of Catholic Peasants of El Salvador (FECCAS) and the Onion of Field Labourers (UTC) and not the Nationalist Democratic Organisation (ORDEN), as had been stated by the complainants.
.As regards the observations made in connection with Case No. , the Government states that, on  June , after a work stoppage had been declared in the ""El Granjero S.A."" undertaking, forces of the Army intervened in order to eject the picketers who had threatened to damage plant equipment. The Government adds that terrorist elements had infiltrated into these groups.
.As regards Case No. , the Government states that it has requested the collaboration of the Ministry of Labour and the Public Prosecutor's Office of the Republic so that appropriate investigations may be made into the events of  December , the results of which will be transmitted in due course. As regards the list supplied by the complainants of workers and peasants who had died, the Government states that their deaths were not the result of repressive action due to their trade union activities and obligations, but rather of the violence which continues to be generated by the extreme left and the extreme right and which, by drawing the armed forces into a purely defensive response, are plunging the country into a bloodbath which has been criticised and deplored by the true citizens of El Salvador.
.With regard to Case No. , in which one of the complainants alleged that five trade unionists had been arrested, the Government states that the events in question were brought about by an illegal strike which bad been declared by the River Lempa Hydroelectric Company Workers' Trade Onion on  and  August . The Government adds that the instigators of the strike violated the provisions of the Constitution by not following the procedure set forth in the Labour Code when they cut off without any advance notice the electricity service throughout the country, which seriously damaged the national economy (with losses exceeding  million colones) and caused the irreparable loss of human lives in hospitals and other medical centres. According to the Government, when the situation reached the point of posing a threat to the national security, since the service involved was one which was indispensable to the community, and as a result of the public outcry, the armed forces intervened in the plant without bloodshed and proceeded to arrest the principal leaders of the strike who - with the exception of those who were not considered to be responsible and who were subsequently released - are now being held in prison, where they are being treated correctly. The Government states that the prisoners are subject to the jurisdiction of military courts, which are now investigating their case in collaboration with their defence counsel.
.With regard to the assassination of Rodolfo Viera, Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer (Case No. ), the Government stated that it had ordered the arrest of the wealthy right-wing businessmen Ricardo Sol Meza and Hans Christ; the latter is currently in Miami and proceedings are at present under way to seek his extradition. The Government adds that the Public Prosecutor has been especially instructed to appoint, on behalf of the State, representatives to take part in the trial being heard by the Fifth Criminal Court and these representatives have already participated in the investigations. The Government points out that Mr Viera was, in addition to being a member of the Salvadorean Communal Onion, a high official of the Government and was looked upon as one of the major proponents of agrarian reform, all of which constituted the motives for his assassination at the wretched hands of the extreme right and extreme left.
.Finally, as regards the allegations concerning the assassination of workers, trade union leaders and school teachers between  October  and  September  (Case No. ) under the presidency of General Carlos Humberto Romero, the Government states that it does not know why the corresponding investigations did not produce any results, if indeed such investigations took place. The Government adds, however, that in order to demonstrate clearly and sincerely that the present rulers of El Salvador are free of any links or compromises with the past, an investigation will be conducted into these deplorable events, the results of which will be transmitted to the Committee as soon as possible.
.Before considering the substance of the various matters raised by the complainants, the Committee would like to express its deep concern at the serious nature of the allegations, most of which refer to the death, assassination, arrest or disappearance of trade unionists and trade union leaders, which have continued to occur even after  October , the date on which the former Government was deposed. While noting the troubled situation which is facing the authorities in El Salvador, the Committee must draw the attention of the Government to the fact that a free and independent trade union movement can develop only in a climate of respect for fundamental human rights, and to the Resolution concerning Trade Onion Rights and their relation to civil liberties adopted by the International Labour Conference in , which states in particular that the concept of trade union rights is totally meaningless in the absence of civil liberties and that the rights conferred on workers' and employers' organisations must be baled on respect for civil liberties.
.The Committee also deplores the fact that in spite of the time which has elapsed, the Government in its observations has still not replied to all the allegations or has done so only incompletely in some of the cases.
.The Committee notes that the Government considers itself free of any responsibility for the events which allegedly occurred before  October . In this connection, the Committee considers, as it already pointed out at its session in February , that there exists a link of continuity between successive governments in the same State and that although a government cannot be held responsible for events which took place under a preceding one, it has a clear responsibility for any consequences which those events might have produced since its accession to power. This principle is particularly applicable as regards the clarification of events which have led to the loss of human lives or the detention of trade unionists who are still being held in prison.
.As regards the allegations concerning the attacks on the lives or persons of trade unionists or trade union leaders, the Committee cannot but deplore the loss of numerous lives and the injuries mentioned in the complaints. The Committee notes the Government's statement that investigations are now under way concerning the events referred to in Cases Nos. ,  and  and, more generally, into the assassinations which allegedly took place between  October  and  December  (Case No. ) concerning which the Government states that an investigation is being ordered, the results of which will be transmitted to the Committee. However, since the Government has not provided information on the death of the trade union leader Tombs Rosales (Case No. ) or the injuries to which reference is made in Cases Nos.  and  and some of the assassinations referred to in Case No. , the Committee requests the Government to undertake as soon as possible - if it has not already done so - an independent judicial inquiry into these allegations with a view to elucidating",-1,1976,El Salvador
335,"the facts in full, determining responsibilities and punishing the guilty parties, and to keep the Committee informed of the results as and when available, of these investigations and those currently under way. The Committee is also of the view that special measures should be taken with a view to guaranteeing the personal security of those persons who are more directly involved in the trade union movement.
.As regards trade union leaders and workers who have been arrested or who have disappeared, the Committee notes that Francisco Girn Ramos has now been set free and that in principle a decision will be issued on his possible guilt on the charge of destroying authentic documents, which will be communicated to the Committee. The Committee also notes that the arrests referred to in Case No.  were the result of an illegal strike in the Rio Lempa Hydroelectric Company which led to the irreparable loss of human lives in hospitals and other medical centres. However, the Committee notes that the Government has not specified the reasons or circumstances which led to the arrest of the trade union leader Rafael Hernndez Olivo, whose present whereabouts are unknown, the arrest of the two members of the National Association of Workers of the Ministry of Agriculture who accompanied Jos Flix Minero on  May  when the latter was assassinated (Case No. ) and that of trade union leaders Enrique Tejada, Antonio Campos Mendoza, Salomn Snchez Mrquez, Vicente Aguirre, Melitn Snchez, Antonio Fuentes and Maximiliano Castro who, according to the complainants, were arrested as they were discussing a list of demands in the premises of the Buses Ruta Urbanos - undertaking and whose present whereabouts are unknown (Case No. ). In this respect, since no information is available on the present situation of the persons mentioned above, and in particular as to whether proceedings have been instigated against them, the Committee cannot but recall that it should be the policy of every government to ensure the right of all detained persons to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment, and point out that the arrest of trade unionists against whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found may involve the restriction of trade union rights and a serious interference with trade union activities. The Committee requests the Government to indicate the motives and circumstances which led to the arrests of the above-mentioned persons and to furnish information on their present situation. More generally, the Committee considers that a contribution would be made towards normalising the trade union situation and labour relations - a necessary objective within the context of the full respect of human rights - and the restoration of social harmony if the Government examined the situation of the arrested persons to whom the complainants refer, with a view to freeing those who may have been arrested for trade union reasons.
.Furthermore, the Committee observes that the Government has not replied to the allegations concerning the threats made against trade unionists and trade union leaders (Cases Nos.  and ), the attack by the armed forces on the premises of FESINCONSTRANS and the destruction of the files of this trade union organisation. The Committee requests the Government to furnish its observations on these matters.
.Cases Nos.  and  were examined by the Committee in May and November , on both of which occasions it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body.
.Case No.  was examined by the Committee in November  and May , on both of which occasions it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body.
.Since it last examined these cases the Committee has received communications from the Trade Unions International of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur porkers ( October ), the Latin American Central of Workers ( April  and  August ) and the World Confederation of Labour ( September ). The Government sent two communications dated  and  December .
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining - Convention,  (No. ).
.Case No.  concerns various allegations, one of which refers to incidents which occurred on  October  during a strike at the El Len factory, when workers were attacked by the police and two of them lost their lives. Other allegations relate to the arrest and torture of  workers of the undertaking Quality food de Centro Amrica and the arrest of  workers and disappearance of two trade union officials during an attack on the offices of two trade unions. According to the complainants all these situations fitted into the general pattern since the passage of an ""anti-terrorist Act"" designed to legalise the repression of the workers.
.Case No.  referred to the imprisonment of a peasant militant, Francisco Girn Ramos, who had been charged with slandering the authorities of Rosario de Mora. According to the complainants the real reason for this arrest lay in the trade union activities of Mr. Girn.
.In Case No.  the complainants alleged that the Government had launched a bloodthirsty campaign of persecution against agricultural workers and their organisations, resulting in many deaths, injuries and arrests.
.In connection with the above allegations the Government stated that various self-styled trade union groups were operating unlawfully, propagating anarchist and anti-democratic doctrines prohibited by the Political Constitution, and committing criminal acts. It was members of these groups, continues the Government, who killed Mr. Trnsito Vsquez. The Government professed its respect for freedom, but said that breaches of the law had occurred and that they would be punished by the competent authorities. In connection with the case of Francisco Girn Ramos, the Government said that his release had been ordered and that proceedings had been instituted against him for the destruction of original documents; the text of the judgement would be communicated once it had been handed down.
.At its May-June  Session, in connection with Case No. , the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, requested the Government to communicate the text of the judgement rendered in the case of Francisco Girn Ramos, with the reasons adduced therefore.
.At its November  Session, in connection with cases Nos.  and , the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, requested the Government to send its observations on the situation of various trade unionists named in an annex, and on the other aspects of the case referred to in paragraphs  to  and  of the Committee's th Report, and to communicate the judgement to be pronounced in the case concerning the death of Mr. Trnsito Vsquez, with the reasons adduced therefore. The Committee has so far not received the information requested.
.In a letter of  October  the Trades Onion International of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur Workers alleges that Jos Guillermo Rivas Gonzlez, General Secretary of the Union of workers in the Cotton, Kenaf, Synthetic Fibre and Allied Textile Industries of El Salvador, was murdered on  September , and that Miguel Angel Solis and Orlando Platero, officials of the Union of Textile Industry Workers, were murdered on  September ; the reason for these alleged murders is said to be the trade union activity of the victims it is also alleged that other trade union officials have been imprisoned.
.By a telegram of  April  the Latin American Central of porkers alleges that the workers of the unions of the national undertakings La Peca, La Constancia, Embotelladora Tropical and STECEL were harshly repressed by the Government because they had demanded collective labour contracts; as a result, seven leaders and militants of these unions have been killed and a number injured.
.By letter of  August  the Latin American Central of workers sends a list of  primary-school teachers allegedly murdered with ""the undisguised complicity of the educational authorities of the country"". In addition to mentioning the full names of the teachers, the list indicates their trade union activities or their relationship with the trade union organisations, their place of work, and the date, place and circumstances of their deaths. In the same letter CLAT repeats the need for the urgent dispatch of a special mission to investigate the situation complained of.
.By a communication of  September  the world Confederation of Labour alleges that some  workers of the IMES undertaking (Industrial Manufactureras, S.A.) in the Republic of El Salvador have been deprived of their work for over three months, and that the undertaking has failed to fulfil its legal and contractual obligations; WCL requests that this document should be attached to the complaints against the Government of El Salvador for systematic violation of labour and trade union rights and ""that the authorities should be asked to take the necessary measures to secure respect for the rights of the workers in order to defend them against the manoeuvres of the foreign firm"".
.By letters of  and  December  the Government has replied to the international Labour office in connection with",-1,1976,El Salvador
336,"the complaints. According to it, the Government of the Revolutionary Junta of El Salvador, since its installation on  October , has adopted a policy entirely different from that of earlier regimes, a policy of absolute respect for human rights, including freedom of association; it accepts no responsibility for any violations which may have occurred in the past.
.The Committee notes the statement made in December  by the new Government that it will follow a policy of respect for human rights, including the aspects relating to freedom of association. Nevertheless, the Committee considers that a general statement of this nature does not provide the elements of information necessary for the elucidation of the present cases, since they are part of a well-defined series of circumstances and situations the examination of which requires it to be in possession of the information which the Governing Body has requested of the Government on repeated occasions.
.The Committee recalls that on earlier occasions, when examining allegations relating to the violation of trade union rights by a government, it has emphasised that there exists a link of continuity between successive governments in the same State and that although a government cannot be held responsible for events which took place under a preceding one, it has a clear responsibility for any consequences which those events might have produced since its accession to power. In this sense, the Committee has taken the view that, where a change of regime has taken place in a country, the new government should take all necessary steps to remedy any continuing effects which events complained of as having taken place under its predecessor might have had since its accession to power.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to take note of the statement made in December  of the new Government that it has adopted a policy of respect for human rights, including aspects relating to freedom of association;(b) to request the Government to send:(i) information in connection with paragraphs  and  of the present report, respecting the proceedings against Mr. Francisco Girn Ramos, the present situation of the various trade unionists listed in the annex to this case, the accusations of torture and persecution of trade unionists and trade union organisations, the stage reached in the proceedings in connection with the death of Mr. Trnsito Vsquez, and the incidents which occurred during a strike of workers of the El Len factory;(ii) its observations on the new allegations referred to in paragraphs , ,  and  of the present report, relating to the murder of the workers, trade union officials and primary-school teachers mentioned in the annex to this case, to the repression of workers and trade unions which demanded collective labour agreements, and to the situation of  workers of the IMES undertaking;(c) to take note of the present interim report.
.The Committee last examined these cases in May , when it submitted interim conclusions in paragraphs  to  of its st Report. This report was approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (- June ).
.The complaints were presented by  trade union organisations of El Salvador and by the Trade Unions International of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur Workers, the Trade Unions International of Food, Tobacco, Hotel and Allied Industries Workers, the United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador (FUSS), the Federation of Unions of Workers in the Food, Clothing, Textile and Allied Industries of El Salvador (FESTIAVTSCES) and the Committee for Trade Union Unity of Workers of Central America and Panama (CUSCA), and, with respect to Case No. , the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) and the World Confederation of Agricultural Workers (WCAW). The Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) also presented a complaint relating to the latter case by a communication of  July .
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations outstanding in Case No.  referred firstly to incidents which had occurred during a strike at the El Lon factory. According to the complaint (dated  October ) the workers who had been preparing to organise a collection in support of the strike had been attacked by the police and two of them had lost their lives.
.The complainants further alleged that the following trade union leaders had been tortured during their imprisonment in July : Romeo Soto Crespo, Gilberto Ruiz Ponce, Miguel Rivera Valle, Rufino Gonzlez Avelar, Teresa Francisca Maldonado (who subsequently disappeared) and Ricardo Erazo (arrested in January ). They also mentioned the disappearance, in January , of Rafael Antonio Martinez, a member of the executive of the Leather Workers' Union.
.Other complaints referred to arrests. It was alleged that the firm ""Lcteas Foremost"" had helped to bring about the arrest of the following persons: Jos Napolen Mina, Carlos Humberto Gonzlez, officials of the employees' union of the company, arrested on  March ; Jos Mauricio Gmez, an official of the same union, arrested on  April; Jos Ricardo Martinez Flores, an official of the National Trade Union Federation of the Salvadorian Workers (FENASTRAS), arrested on  March; and Carlos Ernesto Marin Ayala, arrested on  May. Furthermore, Hctor Antonio Acevedo, an official of the union of the ""Cosmos"" undertaking, had been arrested at Santa Ana on  October . According to the complainants the Government had promulgated an ""anti-territorist Act"" designed to legalise the repression of the workers. Thus, on  December ,  workers of the undertaking ""Quality Food de Centro Amrica"" had been arrested and had been released the next day after being tortured. On  December the arrest had taken place of Rodolfo Hernndez Rosales and Miguel Guzmn, officials of the workers' union of the ""Alianza"" undertaking, and Daniel Garca Guevara, an official of the workers' union of the ""Famosa"" undertaking.
.On  November , the complainants alleged, the national guard had raided the premises of the Puerto El Triunfo Fish Industries Employees' Union and had arrested the following militants and officials: Alejandro Molina Lara, Julio C. Salazar, Oscar L. Chaves, Delia Cristina Hernndez and Juan Francisco Alvarenga.
.As regards Case No.  the complainants stated that the Government had launched a campaign of bloody persecution against agricultural workers and their organisations, in particular against the Salvadorian Agricultural Workers' Federation, resulting in more than  killed and many wounded, in the towns of El Rodeo, La Esperanza, Tecoluco and San Pedro Perulupa. According to the complainant many agricultural workers' leaders had been arrested. On  March , continued the complainant, Trnsito Vsquez, a local leader of FECCAS in the town of La Esperanza, had been murdered by members of the Nationalist Democratic Organisation (ORDEN), a paramilitary government organisation. His body had been found the next day, covered with wounds, and there were indications that he had been tortured. According to the complainants all the available information led to the assumption that the large-scale demonstrations by agricultural workers in the towns of Tecoluco, La Esperanza, Tenancingo, El Rodeo and San Pedro Perulupa, which were held in the following days, should be considered as a reaction of indignation at the murder and at the fact that a number of helicopters of the armed forces had fired on the crowd during the funeral of Trnsito Vsquez.
.The Government had not at that time sent its observations on the various allegations.
.In Case No.  certain complainants had pressed for the appointment of a commission or the dispatch of a representative of the Director-General for an on-the-spot study of the allegations made in the complaint. In Case No. , WCL requested that a commission should immediately be sent to examine the allegations, since it was of the opinion that neither fundamental human rights nor trade union rights were respected in El Salvador, where there were persecutions of trade unions in general and agricultural workers' unions in particular. As early as February  the Committee had noted the gravity of the allegations made by the complainants (in Case No. ). Following its recommendation the Governing Body had at that time expressed its deep concern at the acts committed against trade unions or their leaders which remained unexplained and their harmful implications for the functioning of trade union organisations and the development of industrial relations in the country. The subsequent complaint (Case No. ) also contained extremely serious allegations in respect of many workers and trade unionists who were said to have been killed, injured or arrested.
.In these circumstances the Committee considered in May  that resort should be had to the direct contacts procedure, under which a representative of the Director-General would be sent to the country for discussions with the public authorities and contacts with the workers' and employers' organisations, in order to determine the facts and study possible solutions. The representative of the Director-General would then submit his report to the Committee, which would be able to examine the allegations and formulate its own conclusions with better knowledge",1,1976,El Salvador
337,"of the facts.
.On the recommendation of the Committee the Governing Body requested the Government to give its consent to a representative of the Director-General visiting El Salvador at an early date to examine the allegations made within the context of the direct contacts procedure.
.In a Letter of  June  the Government states that self-styled peasant groups, calling themselves the ""Federation of Catholic Peasants of EL Salvador"" (FECCAS) and the ""Union of Field Labourers"" (UTC) have taken advantage of the freedom of expression enjoyed by the population to cake public statements on various occasions - for instance on  May  in the newspaper La Crnica - that they form the basis of a clandestine organisation, the ""People's Revolutionary Bloc"" (BPR), to appeal to all workers to give their ""organised and militant support to the people's cause"" within the Revolutionary Council of Trade Unions (CSR) and to eliminate ""tendencies opposing their class interests which can only mislead the proletariat and confuse their minds ..."". These various groups, adds the Government, operate unlawfully, not only because they have not been granted legal personality by the State but also because they are propagating anarchist and anti-democratic doctrines prohibited by section  of the Constitution.
.In their issues of ,  and  March , continues the Government, national newspapers with wide readership ( a Prensa Grfica, Diario de Hoy, Diario Latino and Diario el Mundo) reported that religious organisations of peasants such as the Bloc, Led by recognised agents of international communism, have progressed from political propaganda to purely criminal acts such as sacking, destroying and burning the humble homes of peasants who are unwilling to abide by their watchwords of hatred, violence and death; the Government is saddened by the pictures of many groups of families who have fled these attacks. Other citizens have been faced with the choice between joining the Bloc or suffering the consequences of its ""militancy"". The victims of such acts include  dead and many wounded; the newspapers have reported a number of atrocities committed by members of FECCAS, UTC and BPR, particularly on Trnsito Vsquez after they had killed him. Members of these groups injure people, tie them up and stone them, and travel around in gangs shouting threats over loud-speakers.
.Following instructions received from abroad, continues the Government, the enemies of El Salvador have set a characteristic pattern for internal strife by highly unconventional means ranging from sedition and subversion to smear campaigns abroad which disguise reality and present a false image of the country to friendly nations. The Government adds that it is not its intention to make a secret of social and economic problems, but that patriotic citizens are convinced that these problems must be solved with the participation of all sectors in the country, in a peaceful and orderly manner and with scrupulous respect for the Law. They oppose the class struggle which is being fomented in some quarters and the violence advocated by others. They are partisans of a humanist and democratic approach affording each individual the opportunity for self-development. The Government believes that the status of an individual is determined by his efforts, his capacities and his conduct and not by noble birth or inherited wealth. It seeks the welfare of all without prejudice to the rights of others, in the conviction that social equilibrium is to be found in mutual understanding of the rights and duties of each citizen. Peace cannot exist without justice, says the Government, but justice cannot exist without the maintenance of the peaceful climate which is a prerequisite for constructive work and without means of defence against subversive conspiracy; security is essential for the promotion of economic development, which brings social progress and justice in its train.
.The Government adds that the acts committed by elements of FECCAS, UTC and BPR are designated as offences within the competence of the penal court by the Act respecting the defence and maintenance of public order. The penal court has examined four files, from which it transpires that:(a) the persons who were prosecuted acted in their capacity as members of FECCAS and UTC, both of which are members of the BPR, and were either the authors of the crimes or accessories thereto;(b) the accused have appointed counsel for the defence, and steps have been taken to enable the counsel to intervene on their behalf;(c) the accused, Mximo Garcia Lpez, Jose Felipe Matas Vsquez and Sarbelio Garcia Ramirez, cite the names of Tranquilino Prez, Faustino Vsquez and Marcelino Prez, all members of the above-mentioned subversive organisations, as being responsible for the death of Trnsito Vsquez, having put him to death because he refused to take part in the crimes committed against the peasants of the townships of EL Rodeo, La Esperanza, Tecoluco and Miraflores in the circumscription of San Pedro Perulupa; these allegations were corroborated by the testimony of other persons who were present when the aforesaid accused made their extra-judicial statements; these witnesses are not members of the security forces and, when they questioned the accused as to whether their statements were spontaneous, they were told that this was the case;(d) the persons involved took part in the attack on the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare in November .The documents of the trial are available for consultation by persons who are duly authorised by the Law..The Government rejects allegations that it persecutes trade union organisations of all kinds. On the contrary, it points out that there are  trade unions with legal personality carrying on their activities in full freedom and quotes many other figures relating to trade union sections, federations and Confederations, collective Labour agreements, etc. The Government also indicates that the unions have been able to elect workers' representatives to the management board of the Social Security Institute of EL Salvador, the National Minimum Wage Council and the Social Housing Fund.

.Finally, the Government reaffirms its respect for individual rights, including freedom of association. It encourages the formation of trade unions and collective bargaining; it protects organisations in the exercise of their functions in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. It does not, however, countenance any violation of the Law which may be under investigation by the competent authorities, since the independence of the authorities of the State in their respective legal capacities is respected in the country and their competence cannot be delegated to other bodies.
.In a telegram of  July  the WCL and the WCAW allege that Pedro Lpez, a member of the executive Committee of the Latin American Peasant Federation, has been arrested at Cojutepeque and that his whereabouts are unknown. CLAT refers to the same facts in its communication of  July , adding that the person concerned is General Secretary of the Peasant Federation of El Salvador and a member of the national executive of the Confederation of Workers of El Salvador. He is said to have been arrested and beaten by the security forces on  July .
.The Government has not yet replied to these various allegations.
.WCL and WCAW recently presented further allegations in a letter dated  October . These allegations, which refer to the break-up of a union in an INCA undertaking, have been transmitted to the Government for observations.
.The Committee will examine at its next session, in the light of the reply received from the Government, the question of establishing direct contacts to clarify the issues raised in the present cases.
.The Committee notes the information communicated by the Government. The latter replies partially to the serious allegations made, giving details only on the legal proceedings taken following the death of Trnsito Vsquez and on the identity of the presumed authors of the homicide. In this connection the Committee notes the contradictions between this information and the content of the complaints. It would like to receive a copy of the judgement to be given in this case and detailed information on all the other aspects of the cases.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note the reply of the Government as regards the trade union situation as a whole and as regards the particular case of Mr. Trnsito Vsquez;(b) to request the Government to send its observations by  January  at the latest on the situation of the trade unionists named in the Annex hereto and on the other aspects of the case referred to in paragraphs  to  and , and to communicate the judgement to be pronounced in the case concerning the death of",1,1976,El Salvador
338,"Mr. Vsquez, with the reasons adduced therefor;(c) to take note of the present interim report.
.The Committee has already examined Case No.  at its sessions in November  and February , when it submitted interim conclusions to the Governing Body in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its st Session (November ), and in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (March ).
.The complaints and additional information were presented by  trade union organisations of El Salvador and by the Trade Unions International of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur Workers, the Trade Unions International of Food, Tobacco, Hotel and Allied Industries Workers, the United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador (FUSS), the Federation of Unions of Workers in the Food, Clothing, Textile and Allied Industries of El Salvador (FESTIAVTSCES) and the Committee for Trade Union Unity of Workers of Central America and Panama (CUSCA). The Government of El Salvador, for its part, sent observations on the various allegations made.
.More recently, the world Confederation of Labour presented a complaint by communication of  April , and sent additional information in a communication of  April . This complaint figured as Case No. .
.The Committee has decided to deal in a single report with the questions still outstanding from Case No.  and the new complaint contained in Case No. .
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In case No.  FUSS and FESTIAVTSCES pressed for the appointment of a commission or the dispatch of a representative of the Director-General for an on-the-spot study of the allegations made in the complaint. At its February  meeting the Committee decided to postpone the examination of this request.
.In Case No.  WCL requests that a commission should immediately be sent to examine the allegations, since it is of the opinion that neither fundamental human rights nor trade union rights are respected in El Salvador, where there are persecutions of trade unions in general and agricultural workers' unions in particular.
.When the Committee examined the complaints in Case No.  at its February  session, it noted the gravity of the allegations made by the complainants. Following the recommendation of the Committee the Governing Body expressed its deep concern at the acts committed against trade unions or their leaders which remained unexplained and their harmful implications for the functioning of trade union organisations and the development of industrial relations in the country.
.The most recent complaint made by WCL in Case No.  also contains extremely serious allegations in respect of many workers and trade unionists who are said to have been killed, injured or arrested.
.In the light of all these circumstances the Committee considers that resort should be had to the direct contacts procedure, under which a representative of the Director-General is sent to the country for discussions with the public authorities and contacts with the workers' and employers' organisations, and to determine the facts and study possible solutions. The representative would then submit his report to the Committee, which would be able to examine the allegations and formulate its own conclusions with better knowledge of the facts.
.In this respect the Committee wishes to stress that the object of the procedure is to guarantee the respect of freedom of association both in law and in fact; it is convinced that this procedure can protect governments against unfounded accusations, provided that they recognise the importance for their own good name of collaborating fully with the Committee to enable it to undertake a thorough examination of the allegations and seek solutions to the problems.
.The Committee has already examined this case in November , and at that session it submitted interim conclusions to the Governing Body in paragraphs  to  of its th Report. This report was approved by the Governing Body at its st Session (November ).
.Since then, the following organisations have sent communications on the dates indicated: Trade Unions International of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur workers ( May ); Trade Unions International of Food, Tobacco, Hotel and Allied Industries' Workers ( June and  August ); United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador and Federation of Unions of Workers in the Food, Clothing, Textile and Allied Industries of El Salvador ( July ); Committee for Trade Union Unity of Workers of Central America and Panama ( October,  November and  December ). The Government, for its part, provided information on  March and  December .
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body;(a) to express its deep concern at the acts committed against trade unions or their leaders which remain unexplained and their harmful implications for the functioning of trade union; organisations and the development of industrial relations;(b) to note with interest that some of the trade unionists arrested have been released;(c) to express, nevertheless, its regret that the Government has not yet forwarded its observations with respect to the allegations relating to the death of two workers during a strike at the undertaking El Len (paragraph  above), the torture of certain trade unionists (paragraph  above), the disappearance of Rafael Antonio Martinez (paragraph  above) and the arrest of numerous trade union officials employed by the undertakings Lcteas Foremost SA, Cosmos, Puerto El Triunfo Fish Industries, Quality Food de Centro Amrica, Alianza and Famosa (paragraphs , ,  and  above), and to request the Government to transmit its comments on these matters as speedily as possible;(d) to draw the Government's attention to the principles set forth in paragraph  above with respect to protection against acts of anti-union discrimination;(e) to note that the Committee has decided to adjourn its examination of the request made by the complainants for an on-the-spot inquiry into this case;(f) to take note of the present interim report.
.In a communication addressed to the United Nations on  February , a number of Salvadorian trade unions presented a complaint of alleged violations of trade union rights in El Salvador. The complaint was signed by representatives of the following organisations: Union of Workers in the Printing and Allied Industries of El Salvador; Union of the Furniture and Allied Industries; Union of the Central American Cardboard Undertaking; Union of Workers in the Poultry-Rearing, Egg and Allied Industries of El Salvador; Union of the Association of Private Employees; Anion of Workers in the Engineering and Basic Metallurgic Industries; National Union of Tailors; General Union of Dressmakers; Union of workers in the Cotton, Hemp, Synthetic Fibre and other related industries; Union of Workers in the Dry-cleaning Industry; Union of the Steelworkers' Undertaking; General Union of Workers in the Building and Allied Industries; Union of the Textile Industries; Works Union of ANDA; Union of Independent Electricians of El Salvador; Union of Workers in the Soft Drinks, Beer, Ice, Drinking Water and Similar Industries; Works Union of the El Salvador Sugar Refinery; Union of the Cement Industry of El Salvador; Union of Workers of the Agricultural Implements Undertaking; Union of Workers in the Leather, Shoe and Allied Industries; INCALSA Works Union; Union of Workers of the Cosmos Undertaking.
.The text of the communication was transmitted to the Government, which sent its observations in a letter dated  October .
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communication the  complainant organisations expressed their concern at the systematic repression of trade union leaders and militants who, they alleged, were kept under constant watch by the police and subjected to political persecution, arrest, illegal restraint and torture. The complainant organisations described the social situation in El Salvador as precarious and stated that even the most elementary human rights were being violated.
.In support of their statement the complainants referred to a number of specific cases, certain of which related to the death of trade union leaders. They mentioned the case of Rafael Aguiada Carranza, Deputy in the National Legislative General Assembly and General Secretary of the United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador (FUSS), killed on  September . The following day, Jesus Miguel Angel Hernndez Rogel, former General Secretary of the Union of the Furniture and Allied Industries (SIMAS), was arrested as he was leaving the premises of the FUSS, and his body was subsequently found at Chinamequita (Department of San Salvador). On  November  Feliciano Snchez Prez, a leader of the Union of the Furniture and Allied Industries (SIMAS), was found murdered at a tourist centre, ""La Puerta del Diablo"".
.Other union leaders were said to have been arrested, and the complainants mentioned the names of Romeo",1,1976,El Salvador
339,"Soto Crespo, Gilberto Ruiz Ponce, Miguel Rivera Valle, Rufino Gonzalo Avelar, Teresa Francisca Maldonado and Remberto Sosa Hernndez, all leaders of SIMAS. These persons were alleged to have been imprisoned between  June and  July  and to have been tortured. Furthermore, Remberto Sosa Hernndez is said to have disappeared, although he had previously been seen by his fellow prisoners.
.Jos Ernesto Sorto Argueta, General Secretary of the Federation of Unions of Workers in the Food, Clothing, Textile and Allied Industries (FESTIAVTSCES) and workers' representative on the National Minimum wage Council, was arrested on  October . This arrest, stated the complainants, took place as Mr. Sorto Argueta was leaving his workplace, the Granja Montserrat Company. The complainants stated that they had learnt from an unofficial source that Jos Ernesto Sorto Argueta was imprisoned in the security corps barracks of the National Guard of El Salvador.
.On  January , at Sonsonate, the National Guard arrested Ricardo Erazo, Second Disputes Secretary of the National Trade Union Federation of Salvadorian Workers (FENASTRAS), who was found in the prison at Sonsonate bearing signs of torture, although his arrest had been denied by the police. Mr. Erazo was released on  January .
.Certain of the allegations refer to attacks on trade union premises. On  October  the headquarters of the Federation of Unions of the Building, Transport and Allied Industries was totally destroyed by a fire which had been started deliberately. On  November  the premises of a number of federations suffered material damage as a result of a bomb explosion.
.Finally, the complainants maintained that the Government was not applying the provisions of Conventions Nos.  and  and requested the setting up of a commission to carry out an inquiry on the spot.
.In its reply the Government stated that the activities, statements and publications of the complainant unions showed them to be leftist organisations militating in favour of structural changes with a view to establishing a revolutionary socialist state.
.The Government stated that it had no official knowledge of the persons named in the complaint as having been arrested or killed by members of the police security corps. The Government observed that no evidence had been produced in support of these allegations and therefore categorically denied the facts related by the complainants.
.The Government pointed out that Rafael Aguiada Carranza had lost his life as a result of a crime committed on  September  in a street in San Salvador while he was driving the car of another opposition deputy. The criminal courts were at present conducting investigations but they had not yet discovered either the motives for the crime or its authors. The Government rejected all responsibility for the incidents.
.The disappearance of Jos Ernesto Sorto Argueta, stated the Government, was a well-known fact, since he had not attended the National Minimum Wage council since October . The Government added that the reasons for his absence were unknown and denied all, involvement in the affair.
.The Government recalled that, while it had not ratified Conventions Nos.  and , most of the rights guaranteed by these instruments were protected by the national legislation. The Government stated that there were in the country  unions forming  federations and  Confederation. Furthermore,  collective agreements were in force. According to the Government no discrimination existed against the workers and their organisations, as was evidenced by the fact that a number of the complainants held important posts on official bodies such as the National Minimum Wage Council and the Board of Management of the Social Housing Fund Finally, the Government mentioned its achievements in the social field.
.The Committee notes that the allegations before it refer to the death, arrest or disappearance of union leaders and to the torture to which a number of them are alleged to have been subjected. Other allegations refer to attacks on trade union premises. The Committee also notes that the Government denies the facts reported by the complainants.
.Before dealing individually with the questions raised by the complainants, the Committee wishes to express its concern at the gravity of certain of the allegations and in general to recall that a genuinely free and independent trade union movement can only develop when basic human rights are respected.
.As regards the allegations relating to the death of trade unionists, the Committee recalls that, in cases involving loss of life, it has invariably stressed the desirability of the Government instituting an immediate and impartial inquiry in order to elucidate the facts and to determine responsibilities.
.In the present case the Government refers merely to the case of Rafael Aguiada Carranza, which is at present under investigation, but supplies no information on the allegations relating to Jests Miguel Angel Hernndez Rogel and Feliciano Snchez Prez.
.As regards the allegations concerning the arrest and disappearance of union leaders, the Committee observes that the statements of the complainants and those of the Government are in many respects contradictory, the latter denying the responsibility of the police for the alleged incidents. In this respect the Committee notes that, according to the complainants, Ricardo Erazo was found in a public prison after his arrest had been denied by the authorities. In general, the Committee wishes to stress that a climate of violence and uncertainty may represent a serious impediment to the exercise of union rights and that such situations call for strict measures on the part of the authorities in order to redress the situation. In the present case the Committee considers that the Government should conduct an investigation into the situation of the persons mentioned in the complaint.
.With reference to the damage caused to trade union premises, the Committee likewise takes the view that, in such cases, an independent inquiry would be useful with a view to determining responsibilities.
.In the circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body.(a) to express its concern at the gravity of certain of the allegations;(b) to recall that, in general, a genuinely free and independent trade union movement can only develop where human rights are respected;(c) to draw the attention of the Government to the principles set forth in paragraph  above, to request it to transmit the results of the inquiry into the death of Rafael Aguiada Carranza when they are known, to indicate whether similar inquiries have been undertaken in the two other cases of death mentioned in the complaint and, if so, to communicate the results;(d) to draw the attention of the Government to the principles and considerations set forth in paragraph  above, and to stress the desirability of conducting investigations into the situation of the persons mentioned in the complaint and of making an inquiry into the damage caused to the premises of a number of federations;(e) to request the complainants to communicate their observations on the Government's reply, and in particular to supply details concerning the allegations of arrests of trade union leaders, on the understanding that the observations so transmitted will be communicated to the Government for its observations;(f) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report when the information requested above has been obtained.",0,1976,El Salvador
340,".The complaint from the world Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) is contained in a communication dated  April . Despite repeated requests from the Committee, the Government had not offered any specific comments on the allegations made by the complainants and the Committee therefore forwarded an urgent appeal to the Government in February  to provide the information requested. The Government then transmitted its observations by two communications received on  and  April .
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The WFTU states that the Government unleashed a wave of repression against the trade unions of that country, and in particular against the United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador (FUSS), which is affiliated to it. It is claimed that on  February , the police entered the premises of the headquarters of the FUSS in San Salvador without being in possession of a warrant issued by the judicial authority for such entry, arrested two of its leaders, Jos Antonio Romn Mendoza and Rafael Aguinana Carranza, and refused to give any information as to where they were detained. Furthermore, hundreds of persons were arrested, most of them active trade unionists. The Congress of El Salvador adopted a new Penal Code forbidding meetings, demonstrations, strikes, protests against political arrests, the publication of opinions contrary to those of the Government, appeals to invalidate ballot papers, the dissemination of avant-garde ideas, etc.
.In its reply, the Government states that it is unable to make specific observations on the police action in the premises of the FUSS until the complainants provide more complete information on the matter. It states that Jos Antonio Romn Mendoza and Rafael Aguinana Carranza have never been detained. The latter had been elected a member of the Legislative Assembly and in that capacity enjoyed all the prerogatives associated with that position. The new Penal Code, which had come into force on  June , contained no provision conflicting with freedom of association.
.The Committee notes the information communicated by the Government and, in particular, that relating to Jos Antonio Romn Mendoza and Rafael Aguinana Carranza. The Government has nevertheless not provided information on the police action concerning the premises of the FUSS, although the complainants indicated the date and place of the alleged action. In this connection, the Committee has emphasised on various occasions that although trade unions, like other associations or persons, cannot claim immunity from search of their premises, searches should only be made following the issue of a warrant by the ordinary judicial authority after that authority has been satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for supposing that evidence exists on the said premises for charges in respect of an offence against the law and provided that the search is restricted to the purposes for which the warrant was issued.
.Moreover, the new Penal Code contains provisions punishing, for example, rebellion, sedition and uprisings (sections  et seg.) and participation in subversive associations, particularly those having as an aim the teaching, dissemination or propagation of anarchist or undemocratic theories (sections  et seg.). The Penal Code also lays down penalties for mass stoppage of work by civil servants and employees in the public sector (section ). It also provides penalties for the instigators and leaders of illegal strikes (section ). In the present case, the complainants do not provide proof that these provisions are applied in such a manner as to violate freedom of association.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note that, according to the Government, Jos Antonio Romn Mendoza and Rafael Aguinana Carranza have never been detained; and(b) to draw the attention of the Government, in connection with police intervention in the premises of the FUSS, to the principle stated in paragraph  above.",1,1973,El Salvador
341,".The complaint is contained in two letters addressed direct to the Director-General of the ILO by the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions (CLASC) and the International Federation of Trade Unions of Transport Workers, dated  November  and  December  respectively.
.Both of these communications were forwarded to the Government of El Salvador, which sent its observations thereon in a letter dated  May .
.El Salvador has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their letter dated  November , the complainants (CLASC) state that the Government was attempting to destroy the National Union of the Transport Industry and the Trade Union Council of El Salvador (CONSISAL). In particular, state the complainants, in October  the Government, "" with the complicity of a transport undertaking whose support it enjoys "", fabricated a charge of blackmail against two of the principal leaders of the Union and members of CONSISAL, Mr. Ren Barrios Amaya and Mr. Pompilio Martinez, General Secretary and Disputes Secretary respectively of the National Union. This charge, the complainants continue, was sustained by the Attorney-General of the Republic and the case was brought before the Penal Court. When the attorney of the trade union presented himself to be informed of the charge, further proceedings had been instituted on the grounds of "" creating anti-democratic anarchic situations "", an offence for which bail is not granted and for which the penalty, according to the law of El Salvador, is three to five years' imprisonment.
.The complainants further contend that the attorney submitted a written statement to the effect that there had been no such offence. The judge granted bail but the prosecution, on being apprised of the judge's decision, refused to endorse it without, however, explaining the legal grounds for this refusal. The complainants add that this took place prior to the Union's annual meeting and publicity was given to it so as to prevent Mr. Barrios and Mr. Martinez from being re-elected. In fact, state the complainants, both were re-elected.
.The most serious aspect of the case, continue the complainants, is that the warrant for the arrest of the two leaders is still in force and seven more trade unionists have been charged in a similar manner. By intimidation and even the threat of death, the comrades of the two leaders were being prevented from giving them any support.
.The International Federation of Trade Unions of Transport Workers, in its communication dated  December , stated that it supported the above complaint and added that, for many years, the Government had been placing more and more obstacles in the way of the trade union activities of the National Union of the Transport Industry of El Salvador. This Union, and the two leaders in question, were being subjected to systematic persecution, this being an infringement of the right to organise.
.In its reply to the foregoing allegations, the Government states that a complaint of blackmail was made by the representatives of the COTSA Transport Company against Mr. Ren Barrios Amaya and Mr. Pompilio Martinez Larin on the grounds that they had obtained the sum of , colones from the transport company, having threatened to declare a strike if their demands were not met. This complaint was investigated by the Public Prosecutor of the Republic.
.This case, adds the Government, was considered in December  by the Penal Court of El Salvador, which decided that the offence complained of had indeed been committed but since, in accordance with the Penal Code, blackmail cannot be committed against a body corporate-in this case the transport company-the case was dismissed and the accused permitted to remain at liberty, bail not being necessary since no detention order had been issued against them. The Government encloses copies of the judgements of the court in this connection.
.From the information supplied by the complainants and that supplied by the Government in reply to the allegations made, it would appear to the Committee that the two trade union leaders concerned were charged with blackmail or extortion. They were subsequently tried under normal judicial procedure in connection with this charge. From the judgements supplied by the Government, the Committee observes that the case against the two persons concerned was dismissed and they were permitted to remain at liberty.
.In the opinion of the Committee, no information has been supplied by the complainants in support of their allegations and in particular the allegation that the charge brought against Mr. Barrios Amaya and Mr. Martinez Larin was fabricated by the authorities with the complicity of the transport company in question; nor does the judgement of the court refer to any charge that these persons had "" created anti-democratic situations "", as stated by the complainants. From the aforementioned judgement it is also clear that no warrant for the arrest of the two trade unionists is in force, as alleged by the complainants.",1,1970,El Salvador
342,".The complaint of the Latin American Federation of Workers of the Construction and Wood Industry was contained in a communication dated  November  addressed to the Director-General of the ILO. The complaint was communicated to the Government for observations on  December  and when the case first came before the Committee at its session in February , the Committee decided to adjourn its examination of the case since the Government's observations had not been received. The Government's observations were received in the form of a letter dated  March  addressed to the Director-General of the ILO.
.El Salvador has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complaint was signed by Mr. Marcelo Luvecce, General Secretary of the Latin American Federation of Workers of the Construction and Wood Industry, who, the complaint states, on  October , in his official capacity, was on mission in accordance with a plan of technical assistance for the member organisations of the Federation. This mission began in Guatemala, from where Mr. Luvecce proceeded to Honduras, where he stayed until  October . On that day, the complaint continues, Mr. Luvecce flew to Ilopango airport in El Salvador, where, upon showing his passport, he was told that the Government had issued instructions not to permit him to enter the country. The complaint adds that his travel ticket was taken from him and he was deported to Costa Rica, the nearest country he could enter without a visa. The complaint points out that Mr. Luvecce, being a Chilean citizen, had no need of a visa to enter El Salvador, which he had visited on two previous occasions.
.The complaint explains that the purpose of Mr. Luvecce's visit to El Salvador was connected with technical assistance to the two member organisations of the Federation which had invited him. Furthermore, as Secretary of Workers' Action of the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions, he was to visit and make contact with comrades from the national organisation affiliated to this federation.
.The complaint continues that Mr. Luvecce protested to officials at the airport and pointed out that their action constituted an infringement of freedom of association. In addition to being mistreated, Mr. Luvecce's technical assistance plans were upset as a result of his arrival in other countries being advanced.
.The Government, in its reply, states that the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare was informed of this complaint and a detailed inquiry was subsequently carried out. As a result of this inquiry the Government states that it views with great concern the incident reported on behalf of Mr. Luvecce. The Government admits that Mr. Luvecce may indeed have been mistreated as alleged but that the matter must have arisen solely in connection with immigration formalities. The Government deplores and regrets that such an incident should have been interpreted as an interference in the exercise of freedom of association, a principle which, the Government states, it has accepted as one of the bases of its policy of peace and social harmony.
.The Committee notes the Government's statement that Mr. Luvecce's inability to enter El Salvador must have arisen solely in connection with immigration formalities. The Committee also notes, however, that no explanation is given by the Government in reply to the statement that Mr. Luvecce was informed that the Government had issued instructions not to permit him to enter the country. Nor does the Government specify the immigration formalities with which Mr. Luvecce seems to have failed to comply.
.The present case concerns an official of an international trade union organisation who apparently wished to make contact with two affiliated national member organisations. In previous cases of this kind, the Committee has applied the principle that the right of national workers' organisations to affiliate with international organisations-a right embodied in Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. )-carries with it the right of national unions to make contact with the international organisations with which they are affiliated and to take part in the work of such organisations. The right of affiliation is not, in the present case, in question. The Committee has, in the past, considered that it was not competent to deal with measures deriving from national legislation on aliens unless these measures had direct repercussions on the exercise of trade union rights. The measures taken by the authorities in this case could, in the opinion of the Committee, indeed have repercussions on the exercise of trade union rights. The Committee considers that in order to avoid the danger of these rights being restricted the authorities should check up on each specific case as quickly as possible and should aim-on the basis of objective criteria-at ascertaining whether or not there exist facts which might have a real effect on public order and security.
.Accordingly, the Committee recommends the Governing Body, as it has done on previous occasions, to draw the Government's attention to the fact that it would be desirable, in situations of this kind, to seek an agreement through appropriate discussions, in which the authorities as well as the leaders and organisations may clarify their position.",1,1970,El Salvador
343,".The complaint of the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions (I.F.C.T.U.) is contained in a communication dated  October . It was transmitted to the Government of El Salvador, which forwarded its observations on  September .
.El Salvador has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The I.F.C.T.U's communication was in the form of a cable in which it requested urgent I.L.O. intervention with the Government of El Salvador to secure the release of automobile transport workers who had been arrested and to put a stop to the alleged use of violence against them by the police. Upon receipt of this communication the complaining organisation's attention was drawn to its right to submit further information in substantiation of its complaint within one month, and since the allegations-although couched in vague terms-concerned the detention of workers, the Government was asked to send its observations on the matter.
.In its communication the Government states that it deplores the accusation made by the I.F.C.T.U, which calls in question the Government's respect for human rights as regards the exercise of freedom of association in El Salvador. The Government points out that the accusation is vague and imprecise and that it has no knowledge of the events in question, and would need further information from the complainants before being able to comment upon the matter.
.The Committee observes that, despite the length of time which has elapsed, the complainants have failed to supply further information in substantiation of their complaint, and hence have failed to furnish sufficient proof that there has been, as they allege, violation of trade union rights.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that the case does not call for further examination.",1,1967,El Salvador
344,".In a communication dated  March  addressed to the Secretary-General of the United Nations and transmitted by him to the I.L.O, the World Federation of Trade Unions presented a complaint alleging infringements of freedom of association in El Salvador, which, in its view, constitute a violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ).
.More specifically, the complainant alleges that on  November  Mr. Cayetano Carpio, a leader of the Union of Bakery Workers of El Salvador and a member of the El Salvador Trade Union Reorganisation Committee, was arrested in San Salvador. It is alleged that the examining magistrate concerned considered that the charge brought against Mr. Cayetano Carpio was unfounded and that, consequently, he had been wrongfully arrested. Further, it is contended that the authorities have denied that the person in question was detained from September  to November , although this in fact was the case. Finally, the World Federation of Trade Unions demands the immediate liberation of the person concerned.
.In accordance with the procedure in force the Director-General, in a letter dated  June , informed the complaining organisation that any further information which it might wish to furnish in substantiation of its complaint should be forwarded to him within a period of one month. In a communication dated  July  the World Federation of Trade Unions stated in reply that the information contained in its complaint constituted sufficient proof of the violations alleged and that it had, therefore, nothing to add to its original communication.
.The Director-General communicated the complaint of the World Federation of Trade Unions to the Government of El Salvador by a letter dated  June , requesting the Government to forward any observations which it might wish to make.
.At its th, th, th, th and th Sessions, the Committee, having received no observations from the Government, adjourned its examination of the case. Letters of reminder were sent to the Government on  December ,  March ,  June ,  November  and  July .ANALYSIS OF THE REPLY
.The Government of El Salvador presented its observations on the complaint of the World Federation of Trade Unions in a communication dated  August .
.In its reply the Government begins by stating that the reason why it refrained in the first place from making any observations on the complaint was the fact that it regards the complaint as being completely without foundation. The Government then states that, contrary to what the complainant appears to allege, the Government of El Salvador has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) ; it adds that, as El Salvador was not even represented at the session of the Conference at which that Convention was adopted, it cannot in any way be bound by an instrument in the approval of which it took no part.
.Recalling that the policy followed by the Government of El Salvador is characterised by the democratic spirit by which it is inspired and by social tolerance, the Government makes the following comments in its reply on the facts in issue. On  December  Mr. Cayetano Carpio was proceeded against in the Criminal Court of Second Instance on a charge of having disseminated subversive propaganda. On  December  the Court ordered the preventive detention of the accused; on  April , having decided that the facts alleged against the person concerned did not constitute a penal offence, the Court dismissed the case. An appeal was lodged against this decision and was dismissed by the Supreme Criminal Court of Appeal on  June . Consequently, on the same date, Mr. Carpio was again set free.
.According to the Government, these facts show that there has been no violation of freedom of association. The competent authorities did no more than their duty in instituting proceedings which they considered to be justifiable and the fact that the person against whom proceedings were taken was a trade union leader was quite independent of the measures taken. Further, adds the Government, the status of a trade union leader which a person may enjoy cannot absolve him from having to observe the law or shelter him from proceedings to which he may render himself liable by infringing the law.
.The World Federation of Trade Unions alleges that Mr. Cayetano Carpio, a leader of the Union of Bakery Workers of El Salvador, was arrested on the pretext of having disseminated subversive propaganda and implies that the trade union status of the person concerned was the real reason for the measures which were taken against him. The complainant adds that the Government's attitude in the case is all the more serious when it is remembered that the Government has approved the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ).
.The Government states that his status as a trade unionist had no connection with the measures taken against the person concerned and adds further that, the facts alleged against Mr. Carpio having been adjudged not to constitute an offence, he was released from custody. The Government then points out that it has neither ratified nor approved the above-mentioned Convention and that, in consequence, that instrument imposes no obligation upon it.
.With respect to the last point raised in the Government's reply and having regard to the fact that one of the reasons given by the Government for its delay in replying to the accusations made against it appears to have lain in the fact that, in its view, non-ratification of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, , made it unnecessary for it to furnish any such reply, the Committee recalls' that, in discharging the responsibility which has been entrusted to it to promote the application of the principles contained in the Declaration of Philadelphia-which now constitutes an integral part of the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation-it should be guided in its task, among other things, by the provisions relating thereto approved by the Conference and embodied in the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), which afford a standard of comparison when examining particular allegations, more particularly as Members of the Organisation have an obligation under article  () (e) of the Constitution to report to the Director-General of the International Labour Office, at appropriate intervals as requested by the Governing Body, the position of their law and practice in regard to the matters dealt with in unratified Conventions, showing the extent to which effect has been given, or is proposed to be given, to any of the provisions of the Conventions and stating the difficulties which prevent or delay the ratification of such Conventions.
.In these circumstances, while recognising that the provisions of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) are not binding upon El Salvador, the Committee considers that it should examine the allegations made in the present case and report thereon to the Governing Body and notes with satisfaction that the Government of El Salvador has seen fit to furnish observations on the substance of the complaint.
.With regard to the specific allegation made by the complainant, the Committee recalls that, in several earlier cases in which it has had to examine allegations relating to the prosecution and arrest of trade union leaders, it has taken the view that the only question which arose was to know what was the true reason for the measures complained against and that only in the event of such measures being taken in consequence of genuinely trade union activities could there be an infringement of freedom of association.
.In the present case the complainant simply lets it be understood that the measures taken against Mr. Carpio had their origin in his status as a trade union leader. The Government, on the other hand, affirms that there was no connection between those measures and the trade union activities or affiliation of the person concerned, who was prosecuted on a charge of having disseminated subversive propaganda. The Government adds, further, that when the charge had been dismissed Mr. Carpio was liberated immediately.
.Having regard to the imprecise nature of the allegations made by the complainant and to the statement of the Government that there was no relationship of cause and effect between the trade union status of Mr. Carpio and the measures taken against him and, especially, to the fact that Mr. Carpio was liberated as soon as the court had found that the facts alleged in the charges against him did not constitute an offence, the Committee, while drawing the attention of the Government to the importance which it attaches to the principle that it should be the policy of every government to ensure the right of a detained person to receive a fair",1,1954,El Salvador
345,"trial at the earliest possible moment, considers that the complainant has not offered sufficient proof to show that trade union rights were infringed in the present case.
.In these circumstances, for the reasons indicated in paragraphs  to  above and subject to the observations contained in those paragraphs, the Committee, while regretting that the Government replied only after considerable delay and repeated reminders, recommends the Governing Body to decide that the case does not call for further examination.",0,1954,El Salvador
