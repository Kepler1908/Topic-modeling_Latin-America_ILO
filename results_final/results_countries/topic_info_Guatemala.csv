Federation of Guatemala (FASGUA) and his wife were murdered on  April , together with Maximo Velsquez Melgar, Secretary of the Trade Union of the Hemp Sack Factory, who was treacherously murdered as he was leaving work on  March . CPUSTAL added that on  May  the bodies of Ricardo Garcia and Arnulfo Gmez, leaders of the Coca-Cola Workers' Union who had been kidnapped on  May, were found. The complainant also referred to the kidnapping, death and subsequent discovery of the corpses of peasants and workers, some of whom it mentioned by name, and to the murder of  workers on  May, among whom were Judith Gonzlez, Edgar Gonzlez Garcia and Manuel de Jess Flores.\n.CPUSTAL also alleged that Guillermo Hernndez - Secretary of the Union of Central American Sanitation Workers (INCESA) -, Hugo Rolando Tello Gonzlez and Guillermo Hernndez Gmez - trade union leaders whose whereabouts are unknown - and Efraim Njera and Margarito Tzul - both workers - were all under arrest.\n.The complainant added that on  April  the army brutally repressed the meeting of Coca-Cola workers who were discussing a problem of wages. Twenty-seven workers subsequently disappeared, although the Government denied that they were under arrest. Furthermore, according to CPUSTAL on  April  a group of  armed persons attacked, sacked and destroyed the premises of the CNT in Guatemala City, abducting  workers and beating up the watchman of the premises, Miguel Angel Olayo.\n.CPUSTAL also alleged that a large number of written threats were received by  major trade union leaders, warning them to leave the country within  days, and stating that they would be killed if they did not do so.\n.Finally, the complainant stated that on  March  the headquarters of the FASGUA trade union organisation in Escuintla was attacked with machine-gun fire.\n.In a communication dated  June  the Government stated that on the day when the General Secretary of FASGUA was murdered by persons unknown, the Government issued precise instructions to the Detective Section of the National Police to investigate the case.

The Committee likewise notes with interest the establishment of new labour courts, as recommended by the direct contacts mission that visited the country in February . The Committee expresses the sincere hope that civil peace marks the beginning of a new stage in industrial relations.\n.Nevertheless, the Committee emphasizes that the return to normality in industrial relations must go hand in hand with the elucidation of all acts of violence against trade unionists as alleged in the cases currently under consideration by means of the initiation of judicial inquiries so that responsibilities can be determined and the guilty parties punished. The complainant organizations also have a collaborating role to play in this task, and in this connection the Committee regrets that they have not sent the information it had requested of them.\n.The Committee notes the decision of the Tripartite Committee for International Affairs to set up a working party to investigate the allegations. It hopes that the working party will be able to respond to all the allegations, and counts on the collaboration of the trade unions. The Committee notes the readiness of the authorities to try to elucidate the allegations, although, according to the Government, many of the events occurred a number of years ago; in some cases the complainants have provided very little information, and in others they have made denunciations to the national authorities.\n.More specifically, the Committee notes the initiation or continuation of judicial inquiries into the death of the trade unionists Petrolino Hernndez Vasilio (proceedings halted for lack of evidence), Eric Osberto Berganza Pacheco, Alexnder Giovanni Gmez Virula, Adrin Miranda Prez and Belisario Lpez Rojas, the disappearance of Gustavo Rosalio Vzquez, the abduction of and attacks against Edi Antonio Conde Lu, and the abduction of Ivo Adilio Garca Rivera and Crisanto Garca Alonzo. The Committee observes that, according to the information sent by the Government, the death of Nstor Ren Osorio is not linked to causes of a trade union nature (but to civil problems related to land tenure), and neither is the arrest and prosecution of Otto Ivn Rodrguez Venegas (car theft), nor the alleged attacks against Mr. Ernesto Bol (he was knocked over in a state of drunkenness by a vehicle), nor the arrest of Mr. Cndido Luis Toj (he took part in the lynching of a foreman at the Nueva California farm, who was assassinated). With respect to the imprisonment of Mr. Rubn Terry Amzquita, according to the Government he left the country and went into exile. The Committee requests the complainant organizations to provide more details on the allegation relating to the death of Edwin Giovanni Hidalgo (according to the Government he was neither a worker nor a trade union leader at the National Electrification Institute, and therefore additional information is required to confirm his death) as well as on other, too general allegations indicated in the annex to this report.\n.The Committee regrets that the Government has not provided information on the remaining allegations of acts of violence against the trade unionists (see the annexed list of pending allegations) and requests it to do so urgently, making sure that judicial inquiries have been initiated, and to keep it informed in this connection.\n.The Committee observes furthermore that the judicial proceedings brought in relation to acts of violence against trade unionists, to which the Government has referred, do not seem in general to have been concluded nor to have allowed the guilty parties to be identified and punished. In this connection, the Committee stresses that the absence of sentences against the guilty parties involves a de facto impunity which aggravates the climate of violence and insecurity, and that this is extremely detrimental to the exercise of trade union activities. The Committee expresses the hope that the judicial inquiries under way and those that are to be initiated will put an end to the situation of impunity which has existed up until now.\n.The Committee also requests the Government to send observations on the allegations of the ICFTU ( June ) and of the CLAT ( October ) concerning the assassination of Luis Armando Bravo Prez, General Secretary of the Trade Union of Customs Workers, the attempted assassination of Sixto Prez Coche, Financial Secretary of the Trade Union of Workers of the La Patria Farm and the following of the trade union leader Jos Antonio Garca by an armed individual. Furthermore, the Committee repeats its request for information on developments in the inquiries relating to the death of the trade unionists Juan Tarax, Lilian Elizabeth Jurez Escobar, Camilo Ajqui, to the arrest of trade unionists Silvio Pastor, Pablo Itzel, Teodoro Pastor, Roland Pastor and Francisco Pastor, and to the abduction of Walter Njera Molina, who was released.\n.As regards the pending allegations concerning acts of trade union discrimination, the Committee notes that the judicial authorities denied the request for the reinstatement of a number of members of the Trade Union of the Nueva California farm but that in the case of El Estor the dismissed persons were reinstated in their jobs. The Committee regrets that, according to the Government, the unions at the Medelln, El Trapichito and El Naranjo farms either do not exist or have been inactive for a considerable amount of time and that at present neither the Trade Union of Bakers of Chiquimula nor the Trade Union of Shipping Workers of the Santo Toms de Castilla Port are operating. Bearing in mind the Government\'s statements and the fact that the acts of discrimination in the cases under consideration occurred a number of years ago, the Committee notes that it will be difficult to reinstate all the dismissed workers. The Committee brings to the Government\'s attention, however, the principle that ""no person should be dismissed or prejudiced in his or her employment by reason of trade union membership or legitimate activities, and it is important to forbid or penalize in practice all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of employment"" (see Digest, op. cit., para. ).\n.The Committee regrets that the Government has not sent its observations on the dismissals and other acts of anti-union discrimination that occurred at the International Textile Corporation S.A., El Salto farm, La Mariposa bottling enterprise and the Municipality of Coban, and that it has not provided information on developments in the legal proceedings concerning the dismissal of several trade union leaders of the Workers\' Union of the San Juan de Dios Hospital. The Committee requests the Government to send information in this connection. The Committee also requests the Government to send its observations on the allegations of anti-union dismissals, violations of the right to collective bargaining and acts of reprisal against unionized workers at the Las Delicias farm. Lastly, the Committee once again appeals to the Government for information on the inquiry which the Office of the Attorney-General was asked to carry out into the alleged surveillance of the IUF premises by persons unknown on  August .\n.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) It is with satisfaction that the Committee has learned of the peace agreements and, in particular, of the agreement on the definitive cease-fire ( December ), of the global agreement on human rights and of the agreement concerning socio-economic aspects and agriculture, which establishes the principles of freedom of association, social dialogue, negotiation and consultation. The Committee is certain that civil peace marks the beginning of a new stage in industrial relations.

The Committee observes that, according to the information sent by the Government, the death of Nstor Ren Osorio is not linked to causes of a trade union nature (but to civil problems related to land tenure), and neither is the arrest and prosecution of Otto Ivn Rodrguez Venegas (car theft), nor the alleged attacks against Mr. Ernesto Bol (he was knocked over in a state of drunkenness by a vehicle), nor the arrest of Mr. Cndido Luis Toj (he took part in the lynching of a foreman at the Nueva California farm, who was assassinated). With respect to the imprisonment of Mr. Rubn Terry Amzquita, according to the Government he left the country and went into exile. The Committee requests the complainant organizations to provide more details on the allegation relating to the death of Edwin Giovanni Hidalgo (according to the Government he was neither a worker nor a trade union leader at the National Electrification Institute, and therefore additional information is required to confirm his death) as well as on other, too general allegations indicated in the annex to this report.\n.The Committee regrets that the Government has not provided information on the remaining allegations of acts of violence against the trade unionists (see the annexed list of pending allegations) and requests it to do so urgently, making sure that judicial inquiries have been initiated, and to keep it informed in this connection.\n.The Committee observes furthermore that the judicial proceedings brought in relation to acts of violence against trade unionists, to which the Government has referred, do not seem in general to have been concluded nor to have allowed the guilty parties to be identified and punished. In this connection, the Committee stresses that the absence of sentences against the guilty parties involves a de facto impunity which aggravates the climate of violence and insecurity, and that this is extremely detrimental to the exercise of trade union activities. The Committee expresses the hope that the judicial inquiries under way and those that are to be initiated will put an end to the situation of impunity which has existed up until now.\n.The Committee also requests the Government to send observations on the allegations of the ICFTU ( June ) and of the CLAT ( October ) concerning the assassination of Luis Armando Bravo Prez, General Secretary of the Trade Union of Customs Workers, the attempted assassination of Sixto Prez Coche, Financial Secretary of the Trade Union of Workers of the La Patria Farm and the following of the trade union leader Jos Antonio Garca by an armed individual. Furthermore, the Committee repeats its request for information on developments in the inquiries relating to the death of the trade unionists Juan Tarax, Lilian Elizabeth Jurez Escobar, Camilo Ajqui, to the arrest of trade unionists Silvio Pastor, Pablo Itzel, Teodoro Pastor, Roland Pastor and Francisco Pastor, and to the abduction of Walter Njera Molina, who was released.\n.As regards the pending allegations concerning acts of trade union discrimination, the Committee notes that the judicial authorities denied the request for the reinstatement of a number of members of the Trade Union of the Nueva California farm but that in the case of El Estor the dismissed persons were reinstated in their jobs. The Committee regrets that, according to the Government, the unions at the Medelln, El Trapichito and El Naranjo farms either do not exist or have been inactive for a considerable amount of time and that at present neither the Trade Union of Bakers of Chiquimula nor the Trade Union of Shipping Workers of the Santo Toms de Castilla Port are operating. Bearing in mind the Government\'s statements and the fact that the acts of discrimination in the cases under consideration occurred a number of years ago, the Committee notes that it will be difficult to reinstate all the dismissed workers. The Committee brings to the Government\'s attention, however, the principle that ""no person should be dismissed or prejudiced in his or her employment by reason of trade union membership or legitimate activities, and it is important to forbid or penalize in practice all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of employment"" (see Digest, op. cit., para. ).\n.The Committee regrets that the Government has not sent its observations on the dismissals and other acts of anti-union discrimination that occurred at the International Textile Corporation S.A., El Salto farm, La Mariposa bottling enterprise and the Municipality of Coban, and that it has not provided information on developments in the legal proceedings concerning the dismissal of several trade union leaders of the Workers\' Union of the San Juan de Dios Hospital. The Committee requests the Government to send information in this connection. The Committee also requests the Government to send its observations on the allegations of anti-union dismissals, violations of the right to collective bargaining and acts of reprisal against unionized workers at the Las Delicias farm. Lastly, the Committee once again appeals to the Government for information on the inquiry which the Office of the Attorney-General was asked to carry out into the alleged surveillance of the IUF premises by persons unknown on  August .\n.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) It is with satisfaction that the Committee has learned of the peace agreements and, in particular, of the agreement on the definitive cease-fire ( December ), of the global agreement on human rights and of the agreement concerning socio-economic aspects and agriculture, which establishes the principles of freedom of association, social dialogue, negotiation and consultation. The Committee is certain that civil peace marks the beginning of a new stage in industrial relations. However, the Committee emphasizes that the return to normality in industrial relations must go hand in hand with the elucidation of all the alleged acts of violence against trade unionists in the cases under consideration by means of the initiation of judicial inquiries so that responsibilities can be determined and the guilty parties punished.(b) The Committee takes note of the decision of the Tripartite Committee for International Affairs to establish a working party to investigate the allegations and hopes that the working party will', 'of various trade union members who had been dismissed. The socio-economic collective dispute is currently under examination at the Sixth Labour and Social Insurance Court;- El Estor farm: the dismissed persons were reinstated; a collective agreement is currently under negotiation;- Medelln farm: there is no trade union organization; the farm only contracts temporary staff;- El Salto farm: the trade union has been granted legal personality;- El Trapichito farm and El Naranjo farm: the trade unions have been inactive since  because they have not fulfilled the legal requirement of electing the members of their respective executive committees;- the Trade Union of Bakers of Chiquimula and the Trade Union of Shipping Workers of the Port of Santo Toms de Castilla: no trade union organizations exist at present.\n.It is with satisfaction that the Committee learned of the peace agreements and, in particular, of the agreement on the definitive cease-fire ( December ), of the global agreement on human rights and of the agreement concerning socio-economic aspects and agriculture which establishes the principles of freedom of association, social dialogue, negotiation and consultation. The Committee likewise notes with interest the establishment of new labour courts, as recommended by the direct contacts mission that visited the country in February . The Committee expresses the sincere hope that civil peace marks the beginning of a new stage in industrial relations.\n.Nevertheless, the Committee emphasizes that the return to normality in industrial relations must go hand in hand with the elucidation of all acts of violence against trade unionists as alleged in the cases currently under consideration by means of the initiation of judicial inquiries so that responsibilities can be determined and the guilty parties punished. The complainant organizations also have a collaborating role to play in this task, and in this connection the Committee regrets that they have not sent the information it had requested of them.\n.The Committee notes the decision of the Tripartite Committee for International Affairs to set up a working party to investigate the allegations. It hopes that the working party will be able to respond to all the allegations, and counts on the collaboration of the trade unions.

The Government points out in general terms in that connection that employers\' and workers\' organisations are required to respect the law of the land as provided by Article  of Convention No. .\n.The Government adds that the Constitution of Guatemala which entered into force in  guarantees the application of the rights and freedoms defined in Conventions Nos.  and ; that workers and employers have the right to exercise them in defence of their economic and social interests; and that the authorities, including the competent courts, are performing their constitutional duties within the framework of a State based on law. According to the Government all persons, including organisations covered by Conventions Nos.  and , can exercise their constitutional rights in conformity with the Constitution and the laws of the Republic.\n.In conclusion the Government states that it would be grateful if the Committee would include the foregoing observations in its final conclusions.\n.In Case No.  ICFTU alleges in a telegram of  March  the death of Manuel de Jess Lpez Morales of the Electricity and Energy Trade Union, whose body had been found mutilated and covered with obvious marks of torture. The victim had been kidnapped a few days earlier by persons unknown. In addition, the trade unionists Jlio Martnez and Ricardo Bonilla of the Unified Trade Union Confederation of Guatemala (CUSG), affiliated to ICFTU, were said to have received death threats.\n.In its communication of  March ICFTU furnishes detailed information on the foregoing allegations, indicating that the murders of certain trade union leaders were brought to its knowledge on  November . Specifically ICFTU claims that the facts are as follows:- on  June  Benjamn Borja Leonardo, a welder aged  years, is said to have disappeared while he was organising a trade union in Hoppy S.A., a banana company owned by Gustavo Anzueto Willman, a retired colonel;- on  June  Gerardo Asaor Letona, a gardener in the Service Department of the Faculty of Science of the National and Autonomous University of San Carlos, is said to have been detained; his fate remains unknown;- in October  Emilio Bentez, leader of the Welders\' Trade Union, is said to have been pursued by paramilitary groups who broke into his home and, not finding him there, expressed the intention to murder him;- in rural areas armed civilian groups are said to continue terrorising the peasants on the pretext that they are suspected of opposition sympathies; the victims and their families are said not to be making this public for fear of reprisals.\n.Furthermore  trade unions organised by an organisation affiliated to ICFTU are said to be waiting to receive legal personality from the Directorate-General of Labour.\n.In addition the Guatemalan Institute of Social Studies and Training is said to be recruiting , educators for organising and educational duties among the workers of town and countryside; their wages are to be paid by the Ministry of Urban and Rural Development. The purpose of this measure is said to be to recruit state-paid educators in order to establish an official trade union confederation, as is said to be proved by an unsigned memorandum circulated to Christian Democrat deputies on  June .\n.Again: at the Guatemalan undertaking GUATEL, Mario Lpez Estrada, the manager, is said to support a body called the "" February Committee"" led by Ral Rodrguez, a member of the above-mentioned Institute. This committee is said to be a parallel organisation to the lawful trade union already present in the undertaking.\n.In other instances, workers are said to have been subjected to measures of intimidation. Thus Pascual Ruch Hernndez, general secretary of the Trade Union of Workers of San Jos Nacahuil, is said to have been taken in for questioning by uniformed police without a warrant on three occasions. Luis Antonio Morn, general secretary of the Bran Canhuaco Rural Trade Union, is said to have been brutally beaten by a person in plain clothes during a union meeting and the complaint filed with the authorities against the attacker, who was identified, is said to have produced no result. The workers of ""Los Diamantes"" ranch in the Department of Escuintla are said to have reported threats uttered by the manager, who is said to be preventing them from establishing a trade union.\n.Lastly four persons are said to have been murdered: Edgar de la Paz, aged  years, a railway employee and a member of the Railway Trade Union, kidnapped by a group of civilians who are said to have tied him to a tree, sprinkled petrol over him and burned him; Mara Luisa Recinos Satoj, a teacher aged  years, found dead after a week in captivity on a ranch at Siquinala, Department of Escuintla; an unidentified woman whose body is said to have been found bound hand and foot and bearing signs of torture and mutilation and who according to witnesses had been a manual worker; and a member of the Central Trade Union of Municipal Workers who died after being savagely beaten by persons unknown.\n.In its reply of  April  the Government categorically denies the existence of armed civilian groups threatening the peasants in rural areas. It states that no official complaints have been made to that effect. The Government affirms in the democratic process now under way, no one is subjected to persecution, and especially not sympathisers of opposition political groups.\n.More specifically it states with regard to Emilio Bentez, leader of the Welders\' Trade Union, who according to the complainants had been persecuted by paramilitary groups, that in the absence of a definite date and of a complaint it can institute no inquiries.\n.With regard to the charges of denial of legal personality to certain trade unions, the Government transmits a list of the unions which have been recognised in  and of those awaiting the signature of the Office of the President of the Republic. It adds that it will transmit as soon as possible a list of the associations in process of approval and an indication of the statutory conditions which they have not yet met.\n.With regard to the charge concerning the alleged establishment of an official trade union confederation on the pretext of organising and educating the workers of town and countryside, the Government expresses concern at such misinformation and at the bad faith of the informants of international organisations. It explains that in reality the Ministry of Development has indeed recruited , rural and urban educators belonging to a community development association, a non-profit, non-governmental organisation specialising in vocational training and in the endeavour to attain even levels of development. The aim of the educators in question, however, according to the Government, is to support communal organisation in order to establish local development boards as part of the new structure at regional and local level. These local development boards are to work directly in agreement with the National Board of Urban and Rural Development, which will bring together those who function as decision-makers at the local level. It is therefore absurd to imagine that the human resources in question, for whose training the Ministry of Devlopment is responsible, are intended to set up an ""official trade union confederation"". The Government asks the Committee not to let itself be misled by the information given in the memorandum, which has nothing genuine about it.\n.As to the charge concerning the alleged parallel trade union set up in the GUATEL undertaking, the Government states that ICFTU has submitted no evidence to warrant the assertion that the manager of GUATEL has supported the establishment of a committee parallel to the lawful trade union of the undertaking.\n.With regard to the alleged measures of intimidation to which workers are said to have been subjected in the pursuit of their trade union activities, the Government states that, in the absence of exact dates for the alleged events, it is practically impossible for it to pin down the information covered by the complaints.\n.Lastly, with regard to the alleged murders of trade unionists, the Government communicates the following information:- Edgar de la Paz, who according to the complainants was  years old and a railway employee, is said to be in reality Edgar Paz Tello, a worker in the area of the Permanent Way, and to belong in reality to the Rural Workers\' Union. According to the Government, the man himself stated in the national press that on the morning of  November, when he was drunk and had fallen asleep on the public highway, thieves robbed him of a cheque for  quetzales and his driving licence. They then sprinkled petrol over him and set fire to him. In a fainting condition, he claims, he was taken by several persons to the Guatemalan Institute of Social Security, where he was given treatment and', 'of elections for new trade union leaders, and it was a matter of public knowledge at the date of the Government\'s reply that that trade union organisation had been left without legal representatives and that its activities had been suspended.

The Government affirms in the democratic process now under way, no one is subjected to persecution, and especially not sympathisers of opposition political groups.\n.More specifically it states with regard to Emilio Bentez, leader of the Welders\' Trade Union, who according to the complainants had been persecuted by paramilitary groups, that in the absence of a definite date and of a complaint it can institute no inquiries.\n.With regard to the charges of denial of legal personality to certain trade unions, the Government transmits a list of the unions which have been recognised in  and of those awaiting the signature of the Office of the President of the Republic. It adds that it will transmit as soon as possible a list of the associations in process of approval and an indication of the statutory conditions which they have not yet met.\n.With regard to the charge concerning the alleged establishment of an official trade union confederation on the pretext of organising and educating the workers of town and countryside, the Government expresses concern at such misinformation and at the bad faith of the informants of international organisations. It explains that in reality the Ministry of Development has indeed recruited , rural and urban educators belonging to a community development association, a non-profit, non-governmental organisation specialising in vocational training and in the endeavour to attain even levels of development. The aim of the educators in question, however, according to the Government, is to support communal organisation in order to establish local development boards as part of the new structure at regional and local level. These local development boards are to work directly in agreement with the National Board of Urban and Rural Development, which will bring together those who function as decision-makers at the local level. It is therefore absurd to imagine that the human resources in question, for whose training the Ministry of Devlopment is responsible, are intended to set up an ""official trade union confederation"". The Government asks the Committee not to let itself be misled by the information given in the memorandum, which has nothing genuine about it.\n.As to the charge concerning the alleged parallel trade union set up in the GUATEL undertaking, the Government states that ICFTU has submitted no evidence to warrant the assertion that the manager of GUATEL has supported the establishment of a committee parallel to the lawful trade union of the undertaking.\n.With regard to the alleged measures of intimidation to which workers are said to have been subjected in the pursuit of their trade union activities, the Government states that, in the absence of exact dates for the alleged events, it is practically impossible for it to pin down the information covered by the complaints.\n.Lastly, with regard to the alleged murders of trade unionists, the Government communicates the following information:- Edgar de la Paz, who according to the complainants was  years old and a railway employee, is said to be in reality Edgar Paz Tello, a worker in the area of the Permanent Way, and to belong in reality to the Rural Workers\' Union. According to the Government, the man himself stated in the national press that on the morning of  November, when he was drunk and had fallen asleep on the public highway, thieves robbed him of a cheque for  quetzales and his driving licence. They then sprinkled petrol over him and set fire to him. In a fainting condition, he claims, he was taken by several persons to the Guatemalan Institute of Social Security, where he was given treatment and']"
