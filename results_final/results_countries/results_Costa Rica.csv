0,".The complaint is contained in a communication dated  March  from the Workers' Union of the Atlantic Coast Port Administration and Economic Development Board (JAPDEVA) (SINTRAJAP) and the Confederation of Workers Rerum Novarum (CTRN).
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  December  and  June .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communication dated  March , SINTRAJAP and the CTRN state that the public port enterprise the Atlantic Coast Port Administration and Economic Development Board (JAPDEVA) (hereinafter  the enterprise'  signed a collective agreement with SINTRAJAP for the period '  and allege that agreement remains in force given that article  of the agreement provides for its automatic extension until such time as a new agreement has been negotiated.
.The complainants allege that in  the enterprise granted a concession to administer and operate the construction of port works to the transnational company APM Terminals (hereinafter  the transnational company' , transferring to it the entirety of its container loading operation. The complainants allege that act violated article  of the collective agreement, which provides as follows:Article . se of JAPDEVA equipmentJAPDEVA guarantees that no equipment or staff belonging to a private company or other institution shall be used to replace its workers or to erode their right to work and the provisions of this collective agreement. Where JAPDEVA does not possess the necessary equipment and must use equipment belonging to companies outside the institution, that equipment must be operated by JAPDEVA staff, unless, owing to its nature, there is insufficient supply of the required equipment on the market and/or the owner requires that its own staff remain responsible for the equipment owing to the need for it to be operated by specialists, in which case SINTRAJAP states explicitly that said staff shall be able to operate the equipment continuously and without hindrance, in accordance with the provisions of this article.It is understood that JAPDEVA shall take all the necessary steps to acquire the appropriate resources to carry out its functions and to provide adequate training to the staff required owing to the modernization of port equipment.Should the port and development operations be wholly or partially handed over to another State or private entity, the workers covered by this agreement shall continue to enjoy all the rights set out herein, in accordance with the provisions of article  of the Labour Code. These rights must be respected and guaranteed by the new employer in a document that it shall sign with SINTRAJAP prior to the change of owner with effect from its entry into force.Should the institution intend, at any point, to transfer services that it currently provides to private enterprise and to other Government departments, it shall notify the trade union in advance and shall negotiate each specific case or project with SINTRAJAP, in accordance with article  of this agreement.
.The complainants allege that there was a deliberate non-observance of article , despite the calls and action taken by SINTRAJAP to ensure respect for the collective agreement, because the enterprise transferred the aforementioned services to the transnational company without having involved SINTRAJAP in determining the fate of the jobs as set out in the aforementioned article, instead adopting unilateral measures that entail dismissals, employment freezes, restructuring and arbitrary transfers, with the total exclusion of the trade union from the process. The complainants state that SINTRAJAP lodged a judicial complaint in this regard. According to the documents submitted by the complainants, on  August , as part of file No. ---LA, the Labour Court of the First Judicial Circuit of the Atlantic Zone granted the injunctive relief requested by the trade union and ordered the immediate suspension of all dismissals while the proceedings were ongoing.
.In its communications dated  December  and  June , the Government transmits its observations, as well as those of the enterprise, which was established in  as an autonomous State body responsible for the construction, administration, maintenance and operation of the port of Limn and other sea and river ports on the Atlantic coast. The enterprise states that (i) in , the Office of the Comptroller-General of the Republic authorized the contracting of an international consultant to draw up a master plan for the Limn-Mon port complex and an evaluation of the dredging of channels in the north and the dredging equipment necessary for the maintenance of the navigation channels; (ii) in  the consultant submitted the final report on the master plan which recommended several measures, such as an increase to infrastructure capacity and preparations for the concession and construction of a new container port terminal and the transfer of container loading and unloading port services to a private concession-holder; and (iii) in  an international public tender notice was published, and on  March , based on the General Act on the Concession of Public Works with Public Services, the executive authority, comprising the President of the Republic, the Minister of Public Works and Transport and the Minister of Finance, awarded the concession to fund, design, construct, operate and maintain a new container terminal at Mon for a period of  years (agreement No.  MOPT-H).
.In relation to the alleged violation of article  of the agreement, the enterprise states that (i) the '  collective agreement remains in force; (ii) although the agreement has the force of law for the parties to it and imposes obligations on the enterprise when it acts unilaterally, that is, when its decisions and actions are within its exclusive competence, the movement of port freight, in this case as part of a concession, is an administrative matter that is not within the exclusive competence of the enterprise, but falls under the authority of central Government, which cannot be limited by the provisions of an agreement; (iii) there is a distinction between the body that signed the collective agreement (the enterprise) and those that make up the authority that granted the concession: the executive authority (the President of the Republic, the Minister of Public Works and Transport and the Minister of Finance), the National Concessions Council and the enterprise; and (iv) the collective agreement is subject to the provisions of laws on public order, particularly in relation to the supreme power of the State and property in the public domain, which is subject to the principles of legal reservation.
.The enterprise states that there are three court cases before the Labour Court of the First Judicial Circuit of the Atlantic Zone that aim to rule on the violation of article  of the collective agreement, the invalidity of the public work concession contract and, if that contract is not annulled, on compensation for the damages occasioned to the workers (case Nos. ---CA, ---LA and ---LA).
.In that regard, the Government transmits the following information that it received from the Supreme Court of Justice: (i) case No. ---CA: administrative proceedings brought by SINTRAJAP against the transnational company in which it was argued that the concession would affect more than , jobs in the enterprise and a request was made for the concession contract to be ruled invalid; (ii) case No. ---LA: complaint of the non-observance of article  of the collective agreement submitted on  May ; that case was underway and the assessor would be appointed; and (iii) case No. ---LA: ordinary labour proceedings brought by SINTRAJAP against the enterprise on  July . On  February  that body was deemed incompetent to rule on the case and it was ordered that the case be referred to the Court of Appeal for Administrative and Civil Property Cases of the Second Judicial Circuit of San Jos. However, that decision was appealed and the case was sent to the Civil and Labour Court of Appeal of the Atlantic Zone. On  July  the Labour Court of Limn referred the case to the First Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice to rule on which court was competent to hear the case.
.With regard to the alleged restructuring, dismissals and arbitrary and unilateral transfers, the Government considers it important to highlight the effort made with the primary objective of protecting the labour rights of the enterprise s workers. The Government states that prior to the presentation to the legislative authorities of bill no.  on the transformation of the enterprise and the protection of its workers, which today is known as Act No.  of  October , the Government held negotiations with SINTRAJAP which led to the concluding of agreements that benefited both the enterprise and the workers. The Government states that there was an understanding between the parties that the process would be undertaken in a climate of industrial peace and openness in order to reach an agreement that benefited the enterprise s workers and notes that those negotiations began in . There was therefore no unilateral decision-making on",0,2019,Costa Rica
1,"the part of the Government; on the contrary, the sectors involved participated actively throughout the process.
.The Government states that, as provided for in article  of Act No. , the enterprise was required to execute its administrative, financial and operational reorganization to ensure its financial equilibrium and sustainability and that its objectives were met. The Act empowers the enterprise to determine the administrative and operational structure that best enables it to operate correctly and to undertake technical studies and the necessary actions to retain only those workers that it requires to ensure its short- and long-term continuation and financial equilibrium.
.The Government states that the measures provided for in the Act include the transfer of employees to other State bodies, the granting of incentives in addition to payment for services to the enterprise s workers who accept voluntary redundancy, and a special early retirement scheme. Workers had one month from the publication of the Act to select and formally request one of the aforementioned options. Once that period had expired, the enterprise was required to commence the staff dismissals necessary to reach financial equilibrium.
.The Government states that the bill that became Act No.  was reviewed by the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice via Vote No. -, issued on  September , by virtue of a discretionary legislative consultation. It states that, on the two matters consulted, the Court ruled that the bill did not contain unconstitutional flaws. The Government highlights that it prioritized the protection of the labour rights of the enterprise s workers and that those rights were upheld within the legal framework in force.
.For its part, the enterprise highlights that throughout its transformation process there was a process of dialogue that involved the Government authorities, including the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, and the workers' representatives, which include SINTRAJAP. The enterprise states that over the last  years, it has undertaken four studies and proposals to amend its organizational structure. It notes that the latest reorganization programme was presented in March , prior to the financial crisis that it is currently facing. The enterprise states that work on that reorganization proposal was undertaken with representatives of its different departments using inputs from previous studies. It adds that the reorganization proposal was shared with SINTRAJAP through official communication No. PE-- of  July . It also states that the enterprise s directors met with SINTRAJAP on various occasions to discuss the transformation process, and that the enterprise received observations from the trade union representatives, which were addressed.
.The enterprise states that, in accordance with the provisions of Act No. , and recognizing the importance of information, and the workers' right to that information, during its transformation process, a number of communication channels were established through which information was provided on the process and the questions posed by the workers and their representatives to the administration were answered, thereby rendering the process entirely transparent and clear. The enterprise highlights that meetings were held with the trade union representatives, who continually submitted queries on the legislation to the management, and that meetings were held between SINTRAJAP, the management of the enterprise and representatives of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security so that their questions on points of interpretation or differences of opinion between the parties could be addressed. It also highlights the high value of inter-agency coordination during this stage, and that, additionally, several informative guides were distributed that detailed the different steps that would be taken in the enterprise s transformation process.
.The Committee observes that the case concerns the alleged non-observance of a collective agreement by a public enterprise in the port sector. The Committee takes note of the complainants' allegations that (i) the enterprise granted a concession to construct, administer and operate a new port terminal to the transnational company, transferring to it the entirety of its container loading operation, and (ii) that act was undertaken in violation of article  of the collective agreement because the enterprise did not involve SINTRAJAP in resolving the fate of the jobs as set out in that article, adopting measures that entailed dismissals, restructuring and arbitrary transfers.
.The Committee notes that, in that regard, the enterprise states that although the '  collective agreement is in force and imposes obligations on the enterprise when its decisions and actions are within its exclusive competence, it is not true that it was the enterprise that granted the concession, but the awarding authority comprising the executive authority (the President of the Republic, the Minister of Public Works and Transport and the Minister of Finance), the National Concessions Council and the enterprise. The Committee also notes that the Government and the enterprise state that (i) in , the Office of the Comptroller-General of the Republic authorized the contracting of a consultancy to draw up a master plan for the port complex; (ii) in  an international consultant recommended that the enterprise adopt measures including the construction of a new container terminal and the transfer of container loading and unloading port services to a private concession-holder; (iii) in  a public tender notice was published, and in  the executive authority awarded the concession to design, fund, construct, operate and maintain the Mon container terminal to the transnational company for  years; (iv) in  Act No.  on the transformation of the enterprise and the protection of its workers was adopted and, prior to the presentation of the bill, the Government held negotiations with SINTRAJAP and reached agreements that benefited both the enterprise and the workers, and there was an understanding to undertake the process in a climate of industrial peace (the Government states that those negotiations began in ); and (v) during the transformation process, meetings were held between the enterprise, Government authorities and workers' representatives, including SINTRAJAP, to which the reorganization programme was communicated in advance.
.The Committee observes that in the concession contract signed in , it was agreed that the transnational company would construct a new container terminal and that the entirety of the container loading and unloading port services would be transferred to it. The Committee understands, according to publicly available information, that the construction of the container terminal began in  and that the terminal has been operational since February . The Committee observes that the complainants allege that the enterprise failed to observe the collective agreement because it did not inform, or consult with, SINTRAJAP with regard to the fate of the jobs that would be affected by the operationalization of the terminal. The Committee understands that the operationalization of the terminal and the transfer of the entirety of the container loading and unloading services to the transnational company would lead to the transformation and restructuring of the enterprise.
.The Committee notes that under the provisions of the collective agreement, the enterprise was required to notify and negotiate with SINTRAJAP should it decide to transfer the services that it provided to a private enterprise, which is what occurred with the concession in question. While recalling that agreements should be binding on the parties and that mutual respect for the commitment undertaken in collective agreements is an important element of the right to bargain collectively and should be upheld in order to establish labour relations on stable and firm ground [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , paras  and ], the Committee observes that the documentation provided appears to indicate that there were instances of dialogue with SINTRAJAP with regard to the fate of the jobs and the restructuring of the enterprise: (i) a bulletin that SINTRAJAP shared with its members dated  August  (No. -) states that on  July that year the trade union had its first meeting with the enterprise to begin analysis of the issues relating to the restructuring; (ii) in another bulletin dated  August  (No. -) SINTRAJAP informs its members that it has met with the Minister of Labour and that round tables have been established to capture the interests of the workers who wish to transfer to other public institutions voluntarily; (iii) through official communication No. PE-- of  July , the enterprise shared with SINTRAJAP a document entitled  Institutional Reorganization Programme'  (iv) the directors of the enterprise met with SINTRAJAP on  July  and reiterated the importance of reviewing the document that had been communicated; (v) on  October  the programme was discussed with the trade union; and (vi) the enterprise also maintains that it received observations from SINTRAJAP which were addressed at meetings of the commission tasked with implementing the restructuring; that there is a commitment to holding follow-up meetings and that, in the interim, the office of the enterprise s chairperson has also received groups of workers, accompanied by SINTRAJAP, to hear their queries and contributions to the process.
.The Committee observes that six months after the complaint was lodged, Act No.  on the transformation of the enterprise was adopted. The Committee observes that, according",1,2019,Costa Rica
2,"to the website of the Costa Rican judiciary, on  November  SINTRAJAP filed legal action challenging the constitutionality of Act No.  which was rejected by the Constitutional Chamber in a resolution dated  January  that ruled that the dismissals provided for in the Act were not automatic and that they were based on the enterprise s need to adopt measures to ensure financial equilibrium given the economic problems that it was facing. According to publicly available information, after the adoption of Act No. , there were around  dismissals.
.The Committee notes that the complainants, the Government and the enterprise all mention three legal proceedings brought by SINTRAJAP in relation to the issues that are the subject of this complaint. The Committee observes that, although reference is made to the injunctive relief granted in favour of SINTRAJAP as part of one of the proceedings, copies of the rulings issued in relation to the proceedings have not been provided. Observing that, according to the website of the Costa Rican judiciary, those proceedings are still under way, the Committee trusts that the rulings will be issued as soon as possible.
.Lastly, observing that, according to publicly available information, in  the enterprise and SINTRAJAP held meetings aiming to renegotiate the collective agreement, the Committee encourages the parties to continue that dialogue and to endeavour to reach agreement on the renegotiation of the collective agreement.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee encourages the parties to continue their dialogue and to endeavour to reach agreement on the renegotiation of the collective agreement.(b)	The Committee considers that this case closed does not call for further examination and is closed.",0,2019,Costa Rica
3,".The complaint is contained in a joint communication from the Confederation of Workers Rerum Novarum (CTRN), the National Federation of Agro-industry, Hotel and Catering and Allied Workers (FENTRAGH) and the International Union of Food, Agricultural, Hotel, Restaurant, Catering, Tourism, Tobacco and Allied Workers' Associations (IUF/UITA) , dated  March .
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  December  and  October .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ) and the Workers' Representatives Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communication dated  March , the complainants allege that the changes that have taken place since  March , with the opening of the new container terminal in Mon, in the province of Limn, operated under a concession by a multinational port company, have led to two multinational enterprises in the agro-industrial sector (Standard Fruit Company de Costa Rica, S.A). (hereinafter enterprise A) and Chiquita Brands Costa Rica S.R.L. (hereinafter enterprise B) carrying out mass, illegal dismissals of workers. The complainants allege, more specifically, that these enterprises abruptly closed port operation work sites located in the province of Limn, leading to the dismissal of workers and union representatives of the following unions: the Free Industrial Union of Banana and Allied Workers of Costa Rica (SINTRACOBAL); the Industrial Union of Agricultural and Allied Workers (SINTRAGA); and the Industrial Union of Agricultural, Agricultural Transport and Allied Workers of Costa Rica (SINTRASTAFCOR). These are affiliated to the complainant organizations CTRN and FENTRAGH, which are themselves affiliated to the IUF/UITA.
.Regarding enterprise A, the complainants allege that: (i) on  March , the enterprise abruptly closed the work site located in the province of Limn without prior notice, which had an impact on the employment of  workers; and (ii) the enterprise revoked the collective agreement signed with SINTRASTAFCOR and dismissed SINTRAGA and SINTRASTAFCOR union representatives without following legal procedures or respecting their trade union immunity. They also allege that the Ministry of Labour and Social Security (hereinafter MTSS) failed to guarantee the protection of trade union immunity and the collective agreement; rather, through an agreement, it endorsed the authorization of the illegal closure of the work site and, as a result the dismissals.
.Regarding enterprise B, the complainants allege that: (i) on  March , the enterprise abruptly, and using violence, closed the work site located in the province of Limn, which had an impact on the employment of  workers, including SINTRACOBAL union leaders; and (ii) the enterprise revoked the collective labour agreement signed with the trade union and deprived it of the union premises located inside the enterprise, denying it access to the building to which it has a right under article  of the above-mentioned collective agreement. The complainants state that inside the union premises there is a training room and offices with furniture and fittings, documents, office equipment, computers, a camera, video projectors, a television screen, records and accounts and other property and documents, and allege that to date the enterprise has failed to provide any information on their whereabouts. They also allege that vehicle BDB-, which belongs to SINTRACOBAL, was still inside the enterprise s facilities and that, following a complaint filed by SINTRACOBAL with the MTSS, labour inspectors visited the work site and issued an official report.
.The complainants consider that no provision is made in the Labour Code for any mechanisms, other than illegal work stoppages, to oppose mass dismissals, and allege that protection through the MTSS system to monitor unfair labour practices is slow, bureaucratic and does not act ex officio. The complainants state that complaints were filed with the Limn Labour Court regarding the closure of both work sites and point out that, in the case of enterprise A, the court rejected the complaint and indicated that it was not appropriate to process a socio-economic collective dispute, as the dismissals had already been carried out and there was no longer any dispute to prevent. The complainants consider that the court completely failed to take into account the fact that the union leaders had been dismissed without following the relevant procedure and that a collective agreement had been revoked (File No. ---LA). With regard to enterprise B, they state that the Limn Labour Court also rejected the claim for the closure to be classified as an illegal lockout, which is being processed under File No.  --LA, and that an appeal against the ruling has been filed by the trade union.
.The complainants allege that the purpose of the mass dismissals was to outsource work to contractors where freedom of association is not observed and consider that this is all happening with complete impunity and without any significant action being taken by the MTSS. They also highlight that, according to the  report issued by the National Statistics and Census Institute, the province concerned has the lowest Human Development Index in the country and that  per cent of the population is excluded from formal employment. They indicate that illiteracy and poverty rates are also high, and that the actions of these enterprises are therefore exacerbating the current situation.
.In its communications of  December  and  October , the Government sent its observations (which include reports from the Office of the Deputy Minister of Labour and Social Security for the Labour Sector, the Directorate of Labour Affairs and the National Directorate and General Labour Inspectorate, as well as from the judiciary), and the responses of the enterprises concerned.
.Regarding enterprise A, the enterprise indicates that: (i) on  January , it informed the workers of the imminent closure of the work sites located in the province of Limn; (ii) the closure was due to the services carried out at that work site being taken over by a multinational port company that had the public works concession for the container terminal; (iii) on  and  January the enterprise held conciliation meetings at the MTSS regional headquarters in Limn with SINTRASTAFCOR (with which it had signed a collective agreement), the CTRN, FENTRAGH, the minister, deputy ministers and head of coordination of the Alternative Dispute Resolution Unit at the MTSS Limn headquarters; (iv) on  January, the parties reached an agreement in which the enterprise undertook to take steps that were not only financial in nature but that would also have a far-reaching social scope: agreement on total settlement payments, together with three months of additional wages for each worker; recognition of school scholarships for the  academic year and the issuance of school supply kits; and payment of dues so as to ensure pensions for workers who were due to retire in . In addition, workers were encouraged to form a productive organization, which was set up on  March  with the support of the MTSS under the cooperative system, called COOPESITRACO RL. Some  former workers of the enterprise took part in the meeting to establish the cooperative, which was registered on  April . The enterprise undertook to provide free workshop and office facilities free of charge to a state institution to enable COOPESITRACO RL to provide services such as maintenance and repair of containers to various enterprises in the area; and (v) all the commitments were satisfactorily met for all the former workers, including for the SINTRASTAFCOR and SINTRAGA union leaders, who were also paid seven additional months of wages, which made a total settlement payment of ten months of additional wages.
.Enterprise A states that the former workers referred a socio-economic collective dispute to the Labour Court of the First Circuit of the Atlantic Region, Limn, on  January  (File No. ---LA), under the agreements reached on  January, (paragraphs  and  of the special minutes). However, the workers' representatives who represented the workers in question at the conciliation meeting agreed to withdraw the proceedings because a settlement had been reached. The enterprise also states that SINTRASTAFCOR and COOPESITRACO RL expressed their uneasiness over, and disagreement with, the filing of this complaint.
.For its part, the Government reports that, on  January , the above-mentioned court flatly rejected the socio-economic collective dispute, as it involved a complete closure of the work site and not an employer s work stoppage or lockout. The Government also indicates that the National Directorate and General Labour Inspectorate have no record of any complaint against enterprise A. The Government gives details of the conciliation hearings that took place on  and  January  at the offices of the Alternative Dispute Resolution Unit in Limn and mentions each of the points of the agreement reached by the parties on  January, highlighting that: (i) the enterprise, the workers and the ministry undertook to issue a press release, indicating that an agreement satisfactory to both parties had been reached, which was indeed issued; (ii) the union accepted and acknowledged that the agreement was binding for the enterprise s unions and workers, including SINTRASTAFCOR union leaders; (iii) the union undertook",0,2019,Costa Rica
4,"to withdraw the collective dispute proceedings brought before the courts; and (iv) the union would inform workers and former workers of the agreement in order to ensure social peace between the parties, and the Ministry of Labour agreed to keep channels of communication and dialogue open on employment-related matters in the Limn area, and to set up a social dialogue table for the private sector in order to promote employability initiatives.
.Regarding the collective agreement signed between enterprise A and SINTRASTAFCOR, the Government indicates that, according to File No.  held by the Department of Labour Relations, this was approved by Decision No. DAL-DRT-OF-- of  October  and there is no document indicating that the collective agreement has been revoked. The Government also indicates that on  August , an ex officio investigation was carried out in order to determine whether the company had dismissed workers protected by trade union immunity without having previously requested authorization. The Government indicates that this investigation could not be carried out because the work site was closed and that in any case there had been a tripartite negotiation between the union, the company and the Ministry, which resulted in the signing of the agreement of  January .
.Regarding enterprise B, the enterprise indicates that: (i) the closure of operations was conducted in compliance with a public works concession contract involving logistics operations nationally; (ii) the dismissal of workers was for objective reasons, given that there had been a complete closure of operations; (iii) on  March , all workers and SINTRACOBAL were notified of the regrettable closure of operations as of  March, which led to the dismissal of  workers (not  workers as claimed by the complainants); (iv) the dismissal only became effective on  March because union representatives had filed a socio-economic collective dispute with the MTSS, which had the immediate effect of suspending labour relations; and (v) the enterprise and the Government indicate that, although a series of conciliation hearings were held on , ,  and  March, at which the conciliation tribunal put forward proposals with a view to the parties reaching satisfactory agreements by mutual consent, the parties were unable to reach agreement and conciliation efforts were therefore terminated on  March , with the dismissals taking place as of that date.
.The enterprise denies outsourcing all the services provided at the site and emphasizes that it was public knowledge that the services previously provided at the site had been taken over by the multinational port company that has the public works concession for the design, financing, construction, operation and maintenance of the container terminal in Mon, Limn province. The enterprise claims to have complied with all of its obligations, including the payment of the compensation referred to in article  of the collective agreement (an article that provided for the possible complete closure of operations, as well as compensation in addition to that provided for in the Labour Code). Regarding access to the union office, the enterprise indicates that it had informed the workers and SINTRACOBAL that, if they needed to enter the facilities, for security reasons they should coordinate with human resources staff. It notes that, in any case, union representatives entered the offices on  May and removed the property, including the vehicle that was still there.
.The Government indicates that, on  March , SINTRACOBAL applied to the Labour Court of the First Judicial Circuit of the Atlantic Zone, Limn, for the lockout imposed by enterprise B to be declared illegal (File No. ---LA). The Government indicates that the ruling determined that it was a complete closure of the work site and not a temporary closure or lockout. It further indicates that, on  March , an appeal was filed against the ruling and that the Civil and Labour Court of Appeal of the Atlantic Zone, Limn branch, upheld the first-instance ruling through ruling No. - of  May .
.Regarding the collective agreement signed between the enterprise and SINTRACOBAL, the Government indicates that it was approved by Decision No. DAL DRT OF-- of  October  and that there is no record of any document showing that the collective agreement has been revoked. The Government also indicates that three administrative proceedings involving the enterprise are pending with the Office of the Labour Inspectorate of Limn: (i) a complaint filed on  March  by SINTRACOBAL for alleged unfair labour practices and trade union persecution, as a result of which a labour inspection was carried out immediately at the work site, which confirmed that the work site was closed; on  September , it was noted that an appeal for review filed by the enterprise in April  against the inspection report had not been resolved and, therefore, the inspector in charge decided that the appeal would be resolved as soon as it would be possible to enter the work site, (ii) a complaint filed on  April  relating to the illegal dismissal of a pregnant worker. Although the court of first instance ordered the enterprise to revoke the dismissal of the worker, an application for judicial review was filed and, in the labour inspector s report dated  May , it was concluded that there had been no discriminatory dismissal on the grounds of pregnancy given that all staff at the work site had been dismissed due to the enterprise s financial situation (the Government indicates that on  November , the file was ordered to be definitively closed); and (iii) a letter submitted on  April  to the Inspection Department of the Limn office, in which the enterprise notified the dismissals carried out on  March, which included persons protected by special immunity. Regarding the latter, the Government indicates that an investigation was opened, which found that the enterprise had not followed the procedure for authorizing the dismissal of workers protected by trade union immunity provided for in the Labour Code and the Labour Inspectorate s manual of legal procedures. Therefore, on  August , the inspectors were instructed to verify whether the employer s action had been based on an objective decision (definitive closure of the work site) and whether there were any discriminatory motives. The Government indicates that on  September  a visit to the work site was carried out and it was corroborated that it had been closed since  March .The Government emphasizes that the actions of the MTSS have always been in strict compliance with the legal framework and that the ministry did not authorize any of the dismissals of the workers protected by trade union immunity.
.The Committee notes that, in the present case, the complainants allege that in early  enterprises A and B closed the port operation work sites located in the province of Limn and that in this context the mass dismissals of workers and trade union representatives were carried out without following established procedures, and that the collective agreements in force at these work sites were revoked. They also allege that the MTSS has had a lax approach to the above-mentioned facts.
.The Committee notes from the documents attached by the complainants and from the Government s reply that the closure of enterprise A s work site took place on  January . Furthermore, the Committee regrets to note that, according to the allegations and the enterprises' responses, the closure of both work sites took place without giving prior notice to the workers and/or the trade unions: enterprise A closed the work site on  January and notified it on the same day, and enterprise B closed the work site on  March and notified it the day before.
.The Committee notes that the complainants and the enterprises agree that there was a complete closure of both work sites, affecting all workers; in other words, not only union members. They also seem to agree that the closure of the work sites was related to the opening of the new container terminal in Mon, in the province of Limn, operated by a multinational port company with the public works concession for the design, financing, construction, operation and maintenance of the terminal. While the complainants also allege that the purpose of the closure of the work sites and the dismissals was to outsource the work, the Committee notes that, according to enterprise B, it was public knowledge that the services previously carried out there had been taken over by the multinational port company mentioned above.
.The Committee notes that both the complainants and the Government indicate that: (i) the former workers of both work sites applied to the courts for the lockout imposed by the enterprise to be declared illegal (the complainants consider that no provision is made in the Labour Code for any mechanisms, other than illegal work stoppages, to oppose mass dismissals); and (ii) both proceedings were rejected in both first and second instance on the grounds that what had occurred was a complete closure of the work sites, the termination of the employment contract",1,2019,Costa Rica
5,"by the employer and not a temporary closure or stoppage of work.
.The Committee also notes that the Government provides detailed information concerning conciliation meetings that allegedly took place after the closure of both work sites. In the case of enterprise A, the Government indicates that, on  and  January , conciliation meetings were held at the regional headquarters of the MTSS in Limn between the enterprise, SINTRASTAFCOR, CTRN and FENTRAGH and that on the  January they reached an agreement in which the enterprise undertook to take steps not only of a financial nature, such as providing compensation and benefits, but that would also have a far-reaching social scope, such as the establishment of a cooperative, formed with  of the former workers, providing services at the container terminal. The Government also indicates that the parties agreed that the union would inform the former workers of the agreement in order to ensure social peace; that the union undertook to withdraw the court proceedings; and that the union and the MTSS undertook to maintain channels of communication and dialogue open on employment-related matters in the Limn area, and to set up a dialogue table for the private sector in order to promote employability initiatives. The Committee also notes that, according to the Government, SINTRASTAFCOR and the cooperative expressed their uneasiness over, and disagreement with, the filing of the present complaint.
.With regard to enterprise B, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, although conciliation hearings were held on , ,  and  March and the MTSS had sought the best channels of dialogue between the parties, the conciliation was terminated on  March . The Committee also notes that the Government indicates that: (i) the dismissals, carried out on  March, were notified by the enterprise to the Limn Inspection Department on  April ; (ii) given that the dismissals included members of the trade union s executive committee and representatives, an investigation was ordered; and (iii) the inspection report concluded that the enterprise had not followed the procedure for authorizing the dismissal of the workers provided for in the Labour Code and the Labour Inspectorate s manual of legal procedures, and on  August  the inspectors were instructed to verify whether the employer s action had been based on an objective decision (definitive closure of the work site) and whether there were any discriminatory motives. The Committee notes that, as indicated by the Government, on  September  a visit to the work site was carried out and it was corroborated that it had been closed since  March . The Commitee also notes that the above-mentioned court proceedings found that it was a complete closure of the work site.
.Regarding the allegation that enterprise B did not allow the trade union access to its premises, where it had furniture and fittings, documents and a vehicle belonging to it, the Committee notes that, according to the enterprise, it had informed SINTRACOBAL that access to the premises had to be coordinated with the human resources staff and that, in any case, on  May union representatives entered the offices and removed the property, including the vehicle they were keeping there.
.With regard to the allegation that both enterprises revoked the collective agreements signed with the respective trade unions, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, there is no indication in any document that the collective agreements have been revoked. It also notes that, according to enterprise B, it has complied with all its obligations, including the payment of the compensation referred to in article  of the collective agreement (an article which provided for the possible complete closure of the work site, as well as compensation in addition to that provided for in the Labour Code).
.Recalling the importance that the Committee attaches to the promotion of dialogue and consultations on matters of mutual interest between the public authorities and the most representative occupational organizations of the sector involved, and to governments consulting with trade union organizations to discuss the consequences of restructuring programmes on the employment and working conditions of employees [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , paras  and ], the Committee trusts that the dialogue table to be set up under the above-mentioned conciliation agreement of  January  will finally be established and that it will help to keep the channels of communication and dialogue open between all parties concerned on employment-related matters in the Limn area.
.Trusting that the aforementioned dialogue table is set up, and in light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to decide that this case does not require any further examination.",1,2019,Costa Rica
6,".The complaint is contained in two communications from the Association of Secondary School Teachers (APSE) dated  June  and  February .
.The Government sent its observations in communications of  April  and  January .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communications dated  June  and  February , the APSE, which was established in  as a civil association and became an industry trade union in , states that it has a membership of approximately , workers from the different occupational and professional categories of the Ministry of Public Education (MEP) (teachers, educators, technical and administrative staff and interdisciplinary professionals).
.The complainant organization states that, in , the MEP, together with the Costa Rican Education Workers' Union (SEC) and the Union of School Cafeteria and Other Related Workers (SITRACOME), signed the first collective labour agreement (CLA) for public employees in the education sector working for the MEP. The complainant organization states that the CLA was valid for three years and that, on  April , both unions denounced it with a view to negotiating the second CLA. The complainant organization states that the negotiation process for the second CLA was undertaken by a union coalition comprising the two aforementioned unions, as well as the APSE and the National Association of Teachers (ANDE). The complainant organization alleges that, when the negotiations for the second CLA were completed and that all that remained was for the agreement to be signed, the Minister for Education unilaterally and arbitrarily excluded the APSE and concluded the CLA with the other three unions. The complainant organization claims that not only had the APSE actively participated in the process of negotiating the CLA, but that it is also the most representative union of the MEP as it is the one to which the majority of unionized workers from the different categories of public employees who provide their services in the Ministry belong. According to the complainant organization, the Minister s action constitutes a typical act of reprisal and anti-union discrimination against the APSE for having opposed several bills, in relation to which the APSE had called a strike.
.The complainant organization adds that, on  June , the MEP signed the second CLA with the other three unions. It also states that this CLA had a period of validity of one year and that, one month before its expiry, the APSE asked the Minister to start the negotiation process for the next CLA. According to the complainant organization, in order to prevent the APSE from negotiating the next CLA, the Minister decided to extend the second CLA for a period of three years, once again excluding the APSE from the CLA.
.The complainant organization further alleges that, despite the efforts made to open forums for dialogue and to acknowledge the participation of the APSE, in some of the joint bodies under the CLA, such as the Joint Labour Relations Board, this has been impossible. The complainant organization states that the Board is a joint body established under the agreement, composed of representatives of the MEP and representatives of the unions that signed the CLA, and it has broad negotiating powers. The complainant organization alleges that, having been arbitrarily excluded from the CLA and from participating in the Board, the APSE has essentially been denied access to any collective bargaining forums.
.The complainant organization states that, under the legal system, the entitlement to negotiate a CLA rests with the majority union. In the public sector, in accordance with section (b) of the Labour Code, if several enterprise unions or unions for a branch of activity each present their own proposal for a CLA, the management shall ask them to present a joint proposal, and in the absence of a response or if there is any opposition, the CLA shall be negotiated with the majority union, without prejudice to negotiations with the other unions, with which any agreements reached will apply only to the members of the union in question. The complainant organization maintains that, in the light of the above, it is incumbent on the APSE to negotiate the CLA that covers all MEP workers, as it is the union to which the majority of workers directly affected by the CLA belong.
.The complainant organization adds that, at the same time as the aforementioned events, the APSE asked the Director of Human Resources of the MEP to attest to how many workers were members of the SEC, SITRACOME and the ANDE unions (the signatories to the CLA), but that this information was denied. According to the complainant organization, the refusal to provide this information is part of the institutional, systematic, discriminatory and anti-union targeting of the APSE, which, as a whole, causes it serious and irreversible damage that threatens its normal functioning, substantially restricting the performance of the union role and threatening the very existence of the union.
.In its communication of  April , the Government states that, on  April , the MEP, with the SEC and SITRACOME unions, signed the first CLA governing labour relations for workers in the public education system whose sole employer is the MEP (approximately , workers). This CLA was approved on  May  and entered into force a day later, with a period of validity of three years, that is to say until  May . According to the Government, the negotiations for this CLA led two long-standing associations in the field of Costa Rican education, the APSE and the ANDE, which were established in  and  as civil associations, to become trade union organizations, in order to participate in collective bargaining in the education sector.
.The Government states that, on  April , the SEC and SITRACOME unions gave notice of the termination of the CLA, and informed the MEP that a broader union coalition had been formed and that the ANDE and the APSE unions would also participate in the negotiations for the new CLA. The Government states that, although the negotiations for the second CLA took place quickly and in a positive way, the discussion within the Legislative Branch of a bill (Act No.  on arrangements for additional remuneration beyond the base salary of the public sector) had divided the activities of the unions that were in the process of negotiating the second CLA: while the SEC, SITRACOME and the ANDE stayed at the negotiating table for the CLA, the APSE left the coalition and unilaterally abandoned the negotiation process, calling a general strike to be held on  June  in protest against the bill. The Government states that the actions of the APSE forced the MEP to continue the process of dialogue towards the second CLA only with the organizations that decided to remain at the negotiating table. The Government denies the allegation that the MEP excluded the APSE from the negotiations in an act of anti-union reprisal and maintains that the APSE, in disagreement with the rest of the coalition of teachers' unions with regard to strategy for mounting a campaign, withdrew itself from the negotiating table.
.The Government states that, on  June , the MEP and the unions that stayed at the negotiating table (the SEC, SITRACOME and the ANDE) signed the second CLA. It was approved on  June , entered into force the day after its approval ( June ) and was valid for one year from that date, that is to say until  June . The Government states that, on  May , as the expiry date of the second CLA approached, the APSE requested the MEP to begin the process of negotiating the third CLA, for which it submitted a draft for negotiation. The Government states that the APSE had informed the MEP of several attempts to ensure that the third CLA could be negotiated and signed jointly with the SEC, SITRACOME and the ANDE, but that its direct efforts had not met with success, so it requested the Minister of Labour to convene all union organizations so that they could reach an understanding and jointly negotiate the next CLA. The Government has sent a copy of a letter that the APSE sent to the Minister for Public Education on  May , in which the APSE acknowledges the efforts made by the Minister for Labour in having invited all the union organizations to a meeting to be held on  May , so that they could reach an understanding and jointly negotiate the draft version of the next collective agreement. In this letter, the APSE confirms that the SEC, SITRACOME and the ANDE did not attend that meeting and that, when the Minister for Labour insisted on holding another meeting on  May , the organizations stated that they could not attend that one either, thereby demonstrating a lack of interest in the joint negotiation process. The Government states that the MEP",0,2018,Costa Rica
7,"has always been in favour of the participation of the APSE in the negotiations for the third CLA and stresses that, although it made efforts to help the unions overcome their differences and participate in collective bargaining as a united group, it did not achieve its goal of reconciling them.
.The Government states that, in view of the clear inter-union dispute, the MEP refused the request of the APSE to negotiate a new CLA, because the organization was not part of the union coalition representing workers' interests in the second CLA. According to the Government, the MEP informed the APSE that: (i) it could not engage in negotiations with the APSE, which until then had not demonstrated through the appropriate mechanisms that it was more entitled than the group in question to represent the collective labour interests of the workers of the MEP; and (ii) it was prevented, as an employer, from intervening in the internal affairs of the unions and was prohibited from taking unilateral decisions with respect to the union representation of the workers. The Government further states that the membership that the APSE claims to have from among the public employees of the MEP is not correct because the number it cites includes retirees who are no longer actively working in the education sector. The Government states that neither is it correct to say that it is the majority union across all the occupational and professional categories of the MEP, as the coalition of the SEC, SITRACOME and the ANDE has more members than the APSE and includes workers from all of the categories.
.The Government states that the MEP and the coalition unions (the SEC, SITRACOME and the ANDE) agreed, for reasons of convenience and opportunity, not to denounce the second CLA and that, under article  of that agreement, the second CLA was automatically extended for three years as from  June , that is to say it would be valid until  June .
.The Government states that: (i) on  September , the president of the APSE petitioned the Ministry of Labour and Social Security (MTSS) to declare invalid the ministerial decision that approved the aforementioned extension (this is because the CLA was valid for one year and it could not be automatically extended for a period of three years); (ii) the MTSS ordered the Directorate of Legal Affairs of the MTSS to conduct a legal study in this regard; (iii) the Directorate of Legal Affairs of the MTSS ruled that the wording  This agreement may be automatically extended for three-year periods' contained in article  of the agreement was invalid, as it extended the agreement for three years, whereas the previous period had been only one year, and it recommended that the Minister for Labour should request the invalidity of this wording, without entailing changes to the act of approval or to the rest of the content of the CLA; (iv) in order to correct the point referred to by the Directorate of Legal Affairs of the MTSS, the main parties to the CLA agreed to amend the period of validity of the CLA, specifying that it was to be valid for three years from the first annual extension that had already put into effect, that is to say from  June  to  June , maintaining the possibility that, in the event of an automatic extension, the CLA should be extended for an equal period (of three years); and (v) this amendment to the CLA was made on  July .
.The Government states that the MEP holds regular meetings with the leadership of the APSE to discuss matters of interest to its members and that all of the union s officials enjoy trade union immunity, are granted trade union leave and benefit from facilities in the exercise of their duties. The Government also states that, although the APSE does not participate in the Joint Labour Relations Board, because the Board is a body under the agreement and the APSE is not a party thereto, it participates in the negotiations to reform the public employment system and in specific committees, such as the committee to review the amendment of incentive pay.
.As for the information concerning the membership of the other unions that the APSE allegedly requested from the MEP, the Government states that the information was never denied to the APSE, but that the Director of Human Resources of the MEP informed it that this information should be requested from the competent agency, in this case, the National Treasury.
.The Government considers that the dispute raised by the APSE is rather a dispute of an inter-union nature, in which it cannot intervene on pain of violating the freedom of association enshrined in international conventions and constitutional jurisprudence, in particular Vote No. - of the Constitutional Chamber, all of which oblige the employer and the State not to intervene in the internal decisions of unions, to guarantee their independence to negotiate and not to change unilaterally the worker representation in an existing CLA. The Government states that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the recently enacted legislation (sections  and  of the Labour Code) establishes the procedure to be followed in the event that the unions do not agree before entering into negotiations for a CLA. In particular, section  provides that:  When there are several trade union organizations at the negotiating table and each of them has submitted its own draft collective agreement, they will be asked to prepare a single draft before the negotiations begin. If they have not complied with this requirement within one calendar month from the date on which they were informed of it by the management of the institution or enterprise concerned, the draft that will be the subject of the negotiations will be, if a single company or negotiation is concerned, the one submitted by the majority union, or, if a sectoral negotiation is concerned, the one that is supported by the majority of union representatives.' ,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:
.In its communication of  January , the Government states that the second CLA, signed on  June  between the MEP and the ANDE, SITRACOME and SEC unions, was terminated on  May . It also states that the third CLA was signed between the MEP and the ANDE, SITRACOME, SEC and APSE unions on  December . The Government further states that the CLA is currently being reviewed by the MTSS under file No. . In view of the above, the Government considers that the demand set out in the complaint filed by the APSE has been met in full, as the APSE participated in the negotiation and signed the third CLA with the MEP.
.The Committee notes that, in the present complaint, the APSE, which is a trade union of workers in the education sector, alleges that the MEP has excluded it from the collective bargaining process, despite its representative nature, causing it serious and irreversible damage that threatens its normal functioning and the very existence of the union.
.The Committee notes that the complainant organization and the Government agree that: (i) on  April , the MEP signed a CLA with the SEC and SITRACOME trade unions, which remained valid until  May ; (ii) in , the APSE and the ANDE, which were established in  and  as civil associations, became trade union organizations; and (iii) on  April , the SEC and SITRACOME gave notice of the termination of the CLA and informed the MEP that the process of negotiating the second CLA would be taken over by a trade union coalition comprising these unions as well as the APSE and the ANDE.
.The Committee notes that the accounts given by the complainant organization and by the Government as to the manner in which the second CLA was signed differ. On the one hand, the complainant organization claims that: (i) when all that remained was for the second agreement to be signed, the Minister for Education decided arbitrarily to exclude the APSE and concluded the CLA with the other three unions; (ii) the Minister acted in reprisal because the APSE had called a strike in relation to a public policy bill; and (iii) it is incumbent on the MEP to negotiate with the APSE because it is the most representative union of the MEP, with a membership of almost , people comprising the largest number of MEP workers.
.For its part, the Government maintains that: (i) it was not the MEP that excluded the APSE from signing but rather it was the APSE that left the trade union coalition and abandoned the process of negotiating the second CLA to call a general strike on  June  in protest against the bill; (ii) the membership that the APSE claims to have is not correct, because the number it cites includes retirees who are no longer actively working in the education sector; and (iii) neither is it correct to say that it is the majority union across all the occupational",1,2018,Costa Rica
8,"and professional categories of the MEP, as the coalition of the SEC, SITRACOME and the ANDE has more members than the APSE and includes workers from all of the categories.
.The Committee notes that both the complainant organization and the Government state that, on  June , the MEP signed with the SEC, SITRACOME and the ANDE the second CLA with a period of validity of one year.
.The Committee notes that, according to the complainant organization, in order to prevent the APSE from participating in the negotiations for the third CLA, the MEP extended the second CLA for a period of three years. The Committee notes that the Government denies this allegation and points out that the MEP has always been in favour of the participation of the APSE in the negotiations for the third CLA and even convened two meetings for all the trade unions so that they could reach an understanding and jointly negotiate the draft of the next collective agreement (which has been acknowledged by the APSE in a letter sent to the MEP and included as an annex by the Government). According to the Government, there was a dispute between the unions, in which it could not intervene, for which reason the MEP and the coalition unions (the SEC, SITRACOME and the ANDE) agreed, for reasons of convenience and opportunity, not to denounce the second CLA, and instead to extend it for three years from  June . The Committee also notes that, according to the Government, the APSE requested that the ministerial decision approving the aforementioned extension be declared invalid (because the CLA was valid for one year and it could not be automatically extended for a period of three years) and, as a result, by order of the Directorate of Legal Affairs of the MTSS, on  July  it was specified that the CLA was to be valid for three years, from the first annual extension that had already put into effect, that is to say from  June  to  June .
.The Committee also notes that, with regard to the allegation that it has been impossible for the APSE to participate in the joint bodies under the CLA, mainly the Joint Labour Relations Board, the Government states that this is because the Board is a body under the agreement and the APSE is not a party thereto, but that the APSE nevertheless participates in the negotiations to reform the public employment system, has regular meetings with the MEP, and its officials enjoy trade union immunity, are granted trade union leave, and benefit from facilities in the exercise of their duties. Furthermore, the Committee notes that the Government denies the allegation that the Director of Human Resources of the MEP refused to give the APSE information on the number of members of the SEC, SITRACOME and the ANDE, and claims instead that the APSE was informed that this information should be requested from the National Treasury.
.The Committee notes that, according to national legislation, if there are several trade unions at the negotiating table and they cannot agree on a single draft for negotiation, the draft submitted by the majority trade union must be taken as the one to be negotiated. In the light of the above, the Committee regrets to note that, in view of the disputes concerning participation in the negotiations which are the subject of this complaint, including the differing accounts by the complainant organization and by the Government regarding the degree of representativeness of the trade unions in question, everything seems to indicate that such representativeness was not verified, so that to date there is no clear and objective information as to the number of members of each of these unions and therefore their capacity to negotiate with the MEP.
.In this regard, the Committee recalls that the competent authorities should, in all cases, have the power to proceed to an objective verification of any claim by a union that it represents the majority of the workers in an undertaking, provided that such a claim appears to be plausible. If the union concerned is found to be the majority union, the authorities should take appropriate conciliatory measures to obtain the employer s recognition of that union for collective bargaining purposes [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , para. ].
.The Committee notes that, in its most recent communication, the Government states that the second CLA, signed on  June  between the MEP and the SEC, ANDE and SITRACOME unions, was terminated on  May . It also states that the APSE participated together with the aforementioned unions in the negotiation of the third CLA, which was signed on  December  by the Government and the SEC-ANDE-SITRACOME-APSE trade union coalition. According to the Government, that CLA is currently (January ) being reviewed by the MTSS for approval under file No. .
.In the light of the above and having received no further information from the complainant organization, the Committee understands that the subject of the present complaint has been resolved through the inclusion of the APSE in the third CLA. Noting, however, that the approval of the third CLA is still pending, the Committee expects the Government to take the necessary measures to bring the agreement into force as soon as possible and trusts that this will contribute to the harmonious development of collective relations in the MEP.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, which do not call for further examination, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:",1,2018,Costa Rica
9,".The complaint is contained in a communication dated  June  from the Confederation of University Workers in the Americas (CONTUA) and the Union of Employees of the University of Costa Rica (SINDEU).
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  February .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  June , CONTUA and SINDEU allege non-compliance by the University of Costa Rica (the public university) with the collective labour agreement signed with SINDEU in  and in force at the date of filing of the complaint. They allege specifically that the University granted a different salary adjustment in January  and  than that provided for in article  of the agreement and that it reduced the percentage of the annuity incentive contrary to what is provided in the agreement (the annuity incentive is paid by the University for each year worked in recognition of work experience). The complainant organizations also allege that the University did not comply with the recommendation of the Committee on Freedom of Association concerning Case No. .
.The complainant organizations indicate that article  of the collective labour agreement, which establishes the salary adjustment system, contains specific paragraphs and subparagraphs that SINDEU and the University apply as negotiations progress until a final agreement on the adjustment is reached. The complainant organizations note that subparagraphs (c) and (e) of article  stipulate as follows:(c)	as a basis for negotiation, it is agreed to use the percentage increase (P) allocated to the Special Fund for Higher Education for the current year;(e)	from January of each year, a salary adjustment will be granted for half of the percentage determined in (c), in other words, P/.
.The complainant organizations indicate that: (i) on  and  September , SINDEU met with the University authorities and submitted its salary adjustment proposal for ; (ii) since no agreement was reached at those meetings, as had been the practice for many years, SINDEU and the University decided to delegate to the University Council a decision on the issue of salary adjustment; and (iii) on  November , the University Council received the parties and listened to their proposals and on  December  decided, for the first time, that the issue of salary adjustment was not within its competence but that it was the responsibility of the parties to reach agreement on it.
.The complainant organizations indicate that, following the decision of the University Council, the Rector of the University summoned SINDEU and informed it that it was the office of the Rector that should decide the issue of salary adjustment. According to the complainant organizations, on  December , the office of the Rector issued decision No. R--, in which it unilaterally decided the salary adjustment, thereby breaching the collective labour agreement and the previously established collective bargaining process. The complainant organizations indicate that, while it is true that the Organic Statute of the University does not include among the functions of the University Council the jurisdiction it has been given for years on the salary adjustment, it is also not indicated in the agreement that the Rector should unilaterally take a decision on it.
.The complainant organizations indicate that, according to data provided by the University to SINDEU, in  the Special Fund for Higher Education grew by . per cent, so that, in accordance with article  of the collective labour agreement, the minimum percentage salary increase that should be awarded was . per cent as of January . The complainant organizations indicate, however, that the University awarded an increase of  per cent for , in other words less than the applicable . per cent. Furthermore, the complainant organizations indicate that, for the January  salary negotiation, SINDEU met with the University on three occasions at which no agreement on the salary adjustment was reached and that, despite SINDEU s willingness to negotiate, the Rector again unilaterally decided the salary adjustment.
.The complainant organizations also allege that the University has reduced the percentage of the annuity incentive payment contrary to what is provided in the collective labour agreement. Specifically, they indicate that: (i) on  September , the University Council decided that, starting from January , the annuity incentive would change from  per cent (as provided by the agreement) to . per cent for all university workers; (ii) on  August , members of the University Council received a document signed by the Rector and five members of the University Council, in which they proposed to repeal what had been agreed on  September  and instead award the  per cent annuity incentive established in the agreement; (iii) article (ch) of the agreement provides that the Labour Relations Board should rule on the violation, interpretation or misapplication of the agreement; (iv) SINDEU therefore requested the Rector to consult the Labour Relations Board on the matter, a request which was not accepted by the Rector, and although SINDEU applied to the Labour Relations Board on  November , the Rector had not appointed one of its representatives and the Board could not therefore be consulted; and (v) on  April , the University Council decided that, starting from  January , the percentage of the annuity payment would be that set out in the agreement, that is,  per cent.
.The complainant organizations further indicate that article  of the collective labour agreement provides that provisions, contracts and customs that exceed the benefits established by the agreement or are not explicitly covered by it must remain in force. The complainant organizations further consider that what was agreed on  September  by the University Council is an acquired right and that, in any event, it was for the office of the Rector and SINDEU to review the percentage of the annuity incentive. They also indicate that the University repealed the agreement on  November  and that two drafting proposals have been under negotiation since then, one prepared by the University and one prepared by SINDEU, and they also indicate that the issue of annuity is covered in the proposals.
.Finally, the complainant organizations allege that the University has not complied with the Committee s recommendation in Report No.  of June  on Case No.  concerning the improper dismissal of three trade union leaders. The complainant organizations recall that in that case, the Committee had requested the Government to ensure that the collective labour agreement is fully respected and they allege that, as of today, the University has not reinstated the three dismissed union leaders, thereby breaching article  of the agreement, which provides that members of the trade union s Executive Board may only be dismissed for the reasons stipulated in article  of the Labour Code if they are proven before the Labour Relations Board and the Arbitration Tribunal, and that their right of tenure protects them up to one year after termination of their union duties.
.In its communication of  February , the Government sent its observations and those of the University (transmitted to the Government on  November ). The Government indicates that the University is an entity governed by public law and that, in accordance with article (m) of its Organic Statute, it is for the Rector of the University to make the final decision on any matter of employment regulation. The Government indicates that, as a public institution subject to a budget, the University plans the use and disbursal of its economic and financial resources in a timely manner, seeking a distribution that best suits the purposes required by the State. It also indicates that in , the University and SINDEU repealed the collective labour agreement and that during the same year they met regularly to negotiate a new collective agreement, which was done in a climate of broad and participatory social dialogue. For its part, the University indicates that it has decided to negotiate a new agreement with SINDEU, even though it does not have the minimum number of affiliates required by the Labour Code.
.The University asserts that it has not committed any violation of the collective labour agreement and that the salary adjustments were made in accordance with the agreement. It also indicates that on  April , SINDEU filed a lawsuit with the Labour Court of the Second Circuit in San Jos concerning the interpretation and application of article  of the agreement, in which it presented the same arguments as that of the present complaint. The University states that the trial is dealt with under court file No. ---LA-, that it has already responded to that lawsuit and that it is awaiting the delivery of the judgment. For its part, the Government indicates that it has consulted the National Directorate of Labour Inspection and the Directorate of Labour Affairs of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, which indicated that they had no knowledge of",-1,2017,Costa Rica
10,"any complaints submitted by SINDEU against the University.
.The University indicates that SINDEU uses the concepts of  salary adjustment' and  salary negotiation' interchangeably, as if they were equivalent, when in fact they are not. According to the University: (i) article  of the collective labour agreement does not establish the obligation that the salary adjustment should be the product of negotiation but that it should be calculated on the basis of the increase in the cost of living or inflation and the projected inflation for the following year; and (ii) such a system contains a margin of flexibility because inflation is calculated in advance, that is, it is projected on the basis of Central Bank calculations for the following year, so that if at the end of the year inflation is higher than anticipated at the start of the year, the University budgets for an increase that is paid in the following January, a payment that is made retroactively for the unanticipated inflation of the previous year.
.The University acknowledges that before the  salary adjustment was implemented, the University Administration and SINDEU reached out to each other and that the representatives of the University Administration explained to SINDEU its proposal and justified why the  salary adjustment could not be higher. The University indicates that SINDEU did not accept its proposal and that, in the absence of an agreement, the matter was brought to the attention of the University Council, which is a high-level deliberative body of the University that nonetheless has no legal competence in matters of staff administration or salary-setting, but rather has historically acted as a mediation body. The University states that the University Council is also not a hierarchical body superior to the Rector, but that each of the two has different competences.
.The University indicates that the University Council declined to assume the competence to resolve the salary adjustment, on the basis of the legal opinion delivered on  October  by the Director of the University s Legal Office. The University notes that, in accordance with that opinion and the University s Organic Statute, it is the Rector and not the University Council that should make a final decision on the salary adjustment, in the event that there is no agreement with the union. The University asserts that the Rector s salary-setting competence is a public legal competence that cannot be waived or delegated to any other body and that, had the salary increase not been decreed in December , University employees would have started  without any salary adjustment.
.The University states that on  December , when it was about to conclude its operations for that year, SINDEU again changed its original proposal and requested the Administration to recognize an overall  per cent increase to the base salary of all employees, as of January , while also requesting an additional . per cent for the construction of a solidarity economy clinic and further requesting an additional . per cent for the construction of a new building for the union (in its first proposal, SINDEU, without any factual or legal basis, had requested an overall base salary increase of  per cent). The University states that that proposal was unacceptable, not only because it sought to maintain a policy of salary increases well in excess of inflation, which is not covered by article  of the collective labour agreement and would jeopardize the economic stability of the institution, but also because article  does not in any case provide that cost-of-living increases should include other items.
.The University indicates that, in view of all of the above, the office of the Rector issued decision No. R-- of  December  and ordered a  per cent increase of the base salary of employees, calculated as of  December  and payable as of  January , as well as an overall  per cent increase of the base salary of employees as of  July . The same agreement provided that, should inflation exceed  per cent at the end of , the University would recognize the corresponding difference, once the corresponding budgets of both the Government and the University had been approved.
.The University emphasizes that, for the purposes of both the lawsuit and the complaint, SINDEU selected a portion of the text of article  of the collective labour agreement (ignoring the rest of the article) with the aim of obliging the University to calculate salary settings using a parameter different from the cost of living and the following year s inflation projections. SINDEU claims that the adjustments should be made on the basis of the increase designated in the State budget for higher education, through the Special Fund for Higher Education. However, article  of the agreement does not indicate in any of its clauses that the parameter or criterion for setting salary increases should be the Special Fund increase. Moreover, with regard to setting the salary increase for , the University notes that, although three meetings were held, SINDEU had already filed a lawsuit against the University.
.With regard to the allegation concerning the payment of the annuity incentive, the University states that the repeal of the agreement by the University Council at its meeting on  September , in favour of a new agreement dated  April , deserves a contextual explanation. First of all, the University indicates that the annuity payment constitutes an increase in annual salary, which in the case of the University (unlike most other entities of the public administration) is calculated on the basis of the total salary of the previous year and not only on the base salary. That increase is added to the cost-of-living increase, as provided in article  of the collective labour agreement, and is also added on top of other bonuses, such as overtime pay, the exclusive employment benefit and other supplementary bonuses. The annuity payment is distinguished from the base salary payment, in the sense that the latter is a payment that is made on the basis of the category and functions of the worker, whereas the percentage of the annuity payment is a fixed and automatic percentage for all workers employed by the University, which is theoretically linked to performance evaluations but in practice has resulted in an automatic salary increase.
.The University explains that, in , following several judgments of the Second Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice, the University was obliged to recognize, for a group of officials in the field of the medical sciences, a . per cent annuity for medical seniority. That outcome was based on a judicial interpretation of the scope of the so-called Medical Science Professionals Incentives Act, which is a law of general scope for all medical science workers. The University indicates that, in order not to disadvantage other employees, the University Council decided to grant the . per cent annuity to all employees. That was put into effect by increasing the  per cent annuity paid under the collective labour agreement to . per cent. The University indicates, however, that, a few years later, the jurisprudence of the Second Chamber changed, giving the University the discretion, as an employer, to set the percentage of the annuity incentive payment for employees in the field of medical sciences.
.The University indicates that in  and given the change in the Court s jurisprudence, a committee of experts was appointed to conduct a study of the economic and financial effects on the University of the increased annuity as a general policy, as well as to present a number of alternatives. The University asserts that it has respected the acquired rights of employees, in the sense of respecting all the annuities that they had already accumulated, with the percentages prevalent while those rights were in force. On the other hand, the University considers that it was neither prudent nor appropriate for the matter to be referred to the Labour Relations Board for the following reasons: (i) the issue had already been dealt with directly between the Rector and SINDEU and, considering that the Labour Relations Board represented the same parties, it was unproductive to merely continue to discuss the same issue in a different venue; and (ii) the decisions of the Labour Relations Board, under article  of the collective labour agreement, are not binding. Moreover, the University indicates that, in any case, article  of the agreement adopted in  refers to provisions, contracts and customs prior to the negotiation of that agreement.
.Finally, with regard to the alleged non-compliance with the recommendation contained in Report No.  of  on Case No. , the University indicates that the recommendation focuses on the application of article  of the collective labour agreement, which covers workers on the Executive Board, union officials and trade union delegates, in the case of disciplinary dismissals or dismissals that do not originate in a legal case. The University indicates that the three individuals were employees who were performing a job under an",-1,2017,Costa Rica
11,"agreement that the University had with the Costa Rican Social Security Fund and that, when the agreement between those two entities expired, the University found itself in the situation of lacking the funds to be able to maintain employment, which is provided for in article  of the Political Constitution. Moreover, a dismissal in such circumstances is also not prohibited by the collective labour agreement in article , since it is neither a dismissal for disciplinary reasons nor does it lack a valid legal cause. The University indicates that it had made a commitment to SINDEU to continue to employ the dismissed workers if they met the University s entry requirements and participated in several competitions, without being favoured for not having achieved the necessary score.
.The Committee observes that, in the present complaint, the complainant organizations allege failure by the University of Costa Rica to comply with the collective labour agreement signed with the Union of Employees of the University of Costa Rica (SINDEU) in , in as much as the University allegedly granted a salary adjustment in January  and  that was different from that foreseen in the agreement and reduced the percentage of the annuity incentive contrary to what is provided in the agreement. They also allege that the University did not comply with the Committee s recommendation in Case No. .
.The Committee notes that, as claimed by the complainant organizations: (i) in September  and after not reaching agreement with the University authorities regarding the  salary adjustment, the University and SINDEU decided, as had been the practice for many years, that the University Council should resolve the issue; (ii) on  December , the Council decided, for the first time, that the salary adjustment was not within its competence and as a result, on  December , the Rector, under article  of the University s Organic Statute, unilaterally decided the salary adjustment, thereby breaching article  of the collective labour agreement, which indicates that there must be agreement between the University and SINDEU; and (iii) the parties also failed to agree on the  salary adjustment and the Rector again unilaterally decided the adjustment.
.In that regard, the Committee notes that the Government and the University indicate that (i) the University has not failed to comply with the collective labour agreement because article  of the agreement does not provide that the salary adjustment must be the product of an agreement but rather that it should be determined on the basis of the increase in the cost of living or inflation and the projected inflation for the following year; the University also states that SINDEU refers to the concepts of  salary adjustment' and  salary negotiation' as if they were equivalent, when in fact they are not; (ii) the University met with SINDEU and explained why the adjustment could not be greater and, since no agreement was reached, requested the University Council to determine the salary adjustment; (iii) that Council declined to assume competence, on the basis of the opinion of the University s Legal Office of  October , according to which, in accordance with article  of the University s Organic Statute, it was for the Rector and not the Council to make a final decision on the salary adjustment; and (iv) despite the University s meeting with SINDEU on the  salary adjustment, by that time, more precisely on  April , SINDEU had already filed a lawsuit against the University in relation to the interpretation and application of article  of the agreement and was awaiting the judgment.
.The Committee notes that the complainant organizations also allege that the University has reduced the percentage of the annuity incentive payment contrary to what is provided in the collective labour agreement and more specifically that: (i) in , the University Council increased the annuity incentive from  to . per cent; (ii) in , the Rector and others proposed to the University Council to repeal the  agreement and implement the  per cent annuity established in the agreement; (iii) the increase that had been granted since  is an acquired right (under article  of the agreement, the provisions, contracts and customs that exceed the benefits established therein must remain in force) and SINDEU therefore requested the Rector to consult the Labour Relations Board, since, under article (ch) of the agreement, it is for the Labour Relations Board to rule on issues of interpretation; and (iv) the Rector did not accept that request and in April , the University Council decided that, starting from , the annuity established in the agreement would be paid.
.In that regard, the Committee notes that the Government and the University indicate that: (i) in  and following a number of Supreme Court rulings, the University was obliged to recognize an annuity of . per cent for a group of officials; (ii) in order not to disadvantage its other employees, the University Council decided to grant a . per cent annuity to all employees; (iii) a few years later, the Court s jurisprudence changed, giving the University the discretion to set the percentage of the annuity; (iv) following the above, in  the University commissioned a study on the economic and financial effects of the increased annuity as a general policy in order to consider possible alternatives in view of the change in Court jurisprudence; and (v) the University considered that it was neither prudent nor appropriate to refer the matter to the Labour Relations Board because the issue had already been dealt with directly between the Rector and SINDEU and because the decisions of the Labour Relations Board, under article  of the collective labour agreement, are not binding; and in any case, for the University, article  of the agreement, adopted in , refers to provisions, contracts and customs prior to the negotiation of the agreement.
.In the light of the above, the Committee observes that the present complaint concerns a conflict of interpretation between SINDEU and the University in relation to a number of articles of the collective labour agreement. The Committee observes that the conflict of interpretation concerning article  of the collective labour agreement with regard to salary adjustment was brought before the courts by SINDEU. According to public information, the application was dismissed by a judgment delivered on  January . The Committee notes that, in that judgment, the court noted that: (i) the agreement failed to specify who should resolve a dispute in the event that agreement could not be reached on the adjustment of salaries, and that article  of the agreement did not provide that in the event that agreement could not be reached the Labour Relations Board should be consulted; and (ii) in view of the possibility that the parties might never reach agreement, the rules of the University s Statute had been applied. The Committee is not aware whether or not SINDEU appealed the above-mentioned judgment.
.Furthermore, with regard to the conflict of interpretation of the annuity incentive, the Committee notes that, while SINDEU indicates that it had requested the Rector to consult the Labour Relations Board since, under the collective labour agreement, it was for the Labour Relations Board to rule on questions of interpretation, the University indicates that it considered that it was neither prudent nor appropriate for the Labour Relations Board to consider the matter because the issue had already been dealt with directly between the Rector and SINDEU and because the decisions of the Labour Relations Board were not binding. In that regard, the Committee recalls that it has emphasized the importance of resolving conflicts of interpretation of a collective agreement through the mechanisms provided for that purpose by the agreement itself or, in any event, by an impartial mechanism that should be accessible to the parties to the agreement, such as an independent judicial body (see Report , Case No. , paragraph , and Report , Case No. , paragraph ; both cases concern Costa Rica). Recalling also that mutual respect for the commitments undertaken in collective labour agreements is an important element of the right to bargain collectively and should be upheld in order to establish labour relations on stable and firm ground [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , para. ], the Committee is confident that, in the event of further conflicts of interpretation in relation to the collective labour agreement, these will be resolved in accordance with the provisions of the agreement.
.The Committee observes that, in any event, according to information published by both SINDEU and the University on their respective websites, the above issues would have been rendered moot since on  March , SINDEU and the University signed a new collective labour agreement that has been in force since  June . The Committee notes that: (i) article  provides for a detailed calculation mechanism for the salary adjustment to be granted in January and July of each year; that article does",-1,2017,Costa Rica
12,"not indicate that the salary adjustment should be agreed between SINDEU and the University; (ii) article  provides that the University shall pay University staff an annuity of . per cent; and (iii) article  provides that it is for the Labour Relations Board to take up the claims brought by workers concerning the rights stipulated in the collective agreement and other related labour rights. The Committee notes that the Labour Relations Board, composed of members appointed by the University and SINDEU, has functional autonomy, the duty of impartiality in the exercise of its functions, is budgetarily attached to the Office of Human Resources and must produce a recommendation within one month of receipt of an application.
.Finally, with regard to the allegation that the University has not reinstated three dismissed trade union leaders and by so doing would not have implemented the recommendation made in Case No. , the Committee recalls that, in that case, it had noted that the Government had not provided information regarding the procedures provided for in the collective labour agreement in the event of dismissal of trade union leaders, and had therefore requested the Government to ensure that the clauses of the agreement were respected. In that regard, the Committee notes that, according to the University, it had made a commitment to SINDEU that, if they met the entry requirements, it would keep the dismissed workers, who, after participating in several competitions, did not achieve the necessary score. The Committee understands that participation in the competitions was made on equal terms for all participants, including trade unionists.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to decide that this case does not require further examination.",-1,2017,Costa Rica
13,".The Committee last examined this case concerning alleged anti-union dismissals at its June  session [see th Report, paras ' ]. On that occasion, the Committee once again requested the Government to provide information on the developments in the judicial proceedings concerning the dismissal of trade union leaders which were still pending and expressed the firm hope that these cases would be resolved as soon as possible.
.By communications dated  September ,  October  and  November , the Government transmitted the information provided by the Supreme Court of Justice concerning the six pending cases of dismissal of trade union leaders, indicating the following:(i) In relation to the cases of Messrs Rigoberto Cruz Vsquez, Jos Andrs Chevez Luna and Wagner Cubillo Palacios, the Second Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice, confirmed the first instance judgement in favour of the said persons on  January  and on  July  ordered the definitive archiving of the proceedings since there were no pending matters to be dealt with or sums to be settled.(ii) With regard to the case concerning Mr Vladimir Torres Montiel, the proceedings have been closed as the parties reached conciliatory agreements. The case of Mr Carlos Jos Padilla has been closed at the request of the parties and the corresponding payments have been made to him. Finally, as regards Ms Graciela Reyes Umaa, in one proceeding the applicant withdrew her application (decision of  March ). The Government informs that one proceeding is still pending and that it is awaiting further details from the Supreme Court of Justice.
.The Committee notes that five of the six pending judicial proceedings have been resolved, with three court decisions in favour of the trade union leaders and two cases in respect of which conciliatory agreements have been reached between the parties and the corresponding payments have been made. With regard to the case of Ms Graciela Reyes Umaa, the Committee takes note, on the one hand, of the withdrawal of the claim in one of the  judicial proceedings and, on the other hand, of the Government s indication that it is still awaiting information from the Supreme Court of Justice regarding another pending judicial proceeding. The Committee also notes that the complainant organizations have not sent any additional information regarding this particular case since the complaint was lodged with the Committee in December . Taking into consideration that five of the six pending cases have been resolved as described above, the Committee trusts that the case of Ms Reyes Umaa will be resolved as soon as possible and taking into account the considerations that the Committee has expressed in its previous conclusions and recommendations in this regard. In view of the foregoing, the Committee considers that this case is closed and will not pursue its examination.
.The Committee last examined this case, referring to alleged anti-union dismissals (including the dismissal of trade union leaders) and anti-union persecution in the private security sector, at its March  meeting. On that occasion, the Committee made the following recommendations [see th Report, paragraph ]:(a)	The Committee requests the Government to provide information on developments in the cases that are pending (judicial proceedings relating to the dismissal of trade union leaders) and also those on which information is not available, and expects that those cases will be addressed in the near future, in accordance with the Committee s decisions in the above conclusions.(b)	With regard to the alleged anti-union dismissals of the members of the executive committee of the Union of Workers of the G Four Group (SINTRAGFOUR) and  of its members, which is alleged to have taken place following its establishment, the Committee requests the Government to conduct a comprehensive investigation with respect to those dismissals and to keep it informed of the outcomes.(c)	The Committee requests the complainants to provide further information on the alleged anti-union dismissal of  members of SINTRAGFOUR.
.In a communication dated  March , the Government forwarded the information provided by the National Directorate of Labour Inspection (DNI), which is the administrative authority responsible for monitoring compliance with trade union rights. That body states that:(i)	as indicated previously, in  a complaint was processed for alleged persecution and unfair labour practices by the enterprise, which had been lodged by the National Federation of Industrial Workers (FENATI), to which the complainant organization, the Trade Union of Workers of the G Four Group (SINTRAGFOUR), is affiliated; and, in February , the representative of FENATI withdrew the complaint and stated his intention to have recourse to the courts, which is why the process was not pursued;(ii)	it has no knowledge of other cases brought against the enterprise in respect of the subject matter of this complaint;(iii)	it has no further information on developments in the cases, as the only case processed has already been concluded; and(iv)	for the above reasons, it is not possible to conduct a comprehensive investigation into the dismissal of  workers; there is absolutely no information that would allow them to be identified and their location is unknown.
.Regarding recommendation (a), the Committee notes that, while the Government indicates that there are no cases pending at the administrative level, it does not provide any information regarding developments in the cases pending before the courts. The Committee recalls in this respect that the pending judicial proceedings were as follows: (i) judicial proceedings relating to three trade union leaders (Mr Rigoberto Cruz Vsquez, Mr Jos Andrs Chevez Luna and Mr Wagner Cubillo Palacios) who had obtained a favourable judgment in the first instance, which was appealed by the enterprise, with that appeal still pending before the courts; and (ii) judicial proceedings relating to three trade union leaders (Ms Graciela Reyes Umaa, Mr Vladimir Torres Montiel and Mr Carlos Jos Padilla Aviles), about whom there was no concrete information. The Committee once again requests the Government to provide information on developments in the cases that are pending before the courts and expects them to be addressed in the near future.
.Regarding recommendations (b) and (c), on the one hand the Committee notes the Government s indication that it is not possible to conduct a comprehensive investigation into the alleged anti union dismissal of the members of the executive committee of SINTRAGFOUR and of  of its members given that there are no cases pending at the administrative level and that it has absolutely no information that would allow the  workers in question to be identified. On the other hand, the Committee observes that, despite the fact that it requested the complainant organizations (SINTRAGFOUR and the Costa Rican Confederation of Democratic Workers) to provide information on the alleged anti-union dismissal of  members of SINTRAGFOUR, to date the complainant organizations have not provided that information. In these circumstances, the Committee will not pursue its examination of these allegations.
.The complaint is contained in communications from the Trade Union of Workers of the G Four Group (SINTRAGFOUR) and the Costa Rican Confederation of Democratic Workers (CCTD) dated  June and  December .
.The Government sent its reply in a communication dated  October .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  June , SINTRAGFOUR alleges that several members of its executive committee and  of its members were subject to anti-union dismissals and anti union discrimination on behalf of the company GFOURS SA (hereinafter the private security firm). Furthermore, in a communication dated  December , the CCTD adds that more than  members have been subject to anti-union dismissal since the establishment of SINTRAGFOUR, and that the real reason for these dismissals was their trade union membership and not disciplinary offences, which had been fabricated by the firm.
.The complainant organizations indicate that the trade union SINTRAGFOUR was established on  August , and on  December  it sent a letter to the legal representative of the firm with the aim of informing the firm of: (i) the establishment of the trade union; (ii) the workers who were members of the executive committee; and (iii) the deduction of trade union dues. Following this communication, the employment relationship between representatives of the firm and members of SINTRAGFOUR changed, and anti union harassment of the members of the executive committee began, in which they were implicated in arbitrary disciplinary offences that led to the dismissal of the majority of the members of the executive committee.
.The complainant organizations state that all of the members of the SINTRAGFOUR executive committee were dismissed as a result of anti-union discrimination and without recognition of their trade union immunity. After having sought recourse to the administrative authority of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security to no avail, they initiated legal action. The trade union leaders included: () Ms Graciela Reyes Umaa, who served as legal counsel, dismissed without employer liability on  August ; () Mr Vladimir Torres Montiel, general secretary, dismissed without employer liability on  April",1,2016,Costa Rica
14,"; () Mr Jeffrey Duran Mora, finance secretary, dismissed in November ; () Mr Rigoberto Cruz Vsquez, treasurer, dismissed with employer liability on  January ; () Mr Jos Andrs Chevez Luna, training secretary, dismissed with employer liability on  February ; () Mr Wagner Cubillo Palacios, secretary, dismissed with employer liability on  February ; () Mr Flix Andino Mungua, records secretary, dismissed with employer liability on  March ; () Mr Carlos Jos Padilla Aviles, records secretary, dismissed with employer liability on  July ; and () Mr Jons Arias Molina, president, also dismissed with employer liability on  July .
.The trade union organizations emphasize that four members of the executive committee were able to prove in court the existence of anti-union harassment. The complainant organizations also indicate that, on three occasions, the defendant suspended the hearing in the labour tribunal, with the sole aim of delaying the proceedings. The case is now in the appeals phase, as the defendant brought an appeal against the judgment of the San Jos Labour Tribunal.
.The complainant organizations allege that the members of the executive committee who were subject to anti-union dismissals have not been able to find new jobs because they have been blacklisted. They state that a clear example is the case of Mr Carlos Jos Padilla Aviles, records secretary, who was dismissed with employer liability on  July , but who, due to the nature of the events, cannot prove that this was the case.
.Lastly, the trade union organizations assert that the specific events reported in this case are a manifestation of the prevailing anti-union policies in both the public and private sectors in Costa Rica, which take the form of anti-union dismissals and a lack of will among the competent authorities, particularly the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, to expedite the procedures available to workers.
.In its communication dated  October , the Government refers first of all to the report of the private security firm, which indicates that: (i) the dismissals are not attributable to workplace harassment, but to the closure of several large contracts, which led to the loss of  positions between  and ; (ii) the firm s business is private security services and the majority of its workers provide services in its clients' facilities in different areas of the country; (iii) workers were designated for dismissal not owing to trade union membership, but to the type of contract to which they were assigned and the possibility of transferring them; (iv) the firm cannot be accused of unfair labour practices, given that, since , it has permitted the existence of several trade unions and, at the time of the presentation of the communication, the following were present in the firm: the Union of Public and Private Enterprise Workers (SITEPP) with  members, SINTRAP with  members, the National Association of Public and Private Employees (ANEP) with  members, and SINTRAGFOUR with  members; and (v) there were justifiable grounds for the dismissals and, in many cases, conciliation was reached with the workers concerned.
.Regarding the anti-union dismissals of the members of the executive committee of SINTRAGFOUR of which it is accused, the private security firm indicates that: (i) Ms Graciela Reyes Umaa, Mr Rigoberto Cruz Vsquez, Mr Jos Andrs Chevez Luna and Mr Wagner Cubillo Palacios were dismissed with employer liability as a result of necessary restructuring processes following the closure of several large contracts; and (ii) Mr Vladimir Torres Montiel was dismissed without employer liability for repeatedly abandoning his post. The worker filed a claim, but an agreement was subsequently reached between the parties, thus ending the proceedings.
.Furthermore, the firm indicates that the real problem between the parties was the fact that the representatives of SINTRAGFOUR did not participate in the Labour Relations Board, a body established by collective agreement that has the authority to decide on all matters of dismissal without employer liability. In this regard, the security firm states that the Labour Relations Board is currently comprised of two trade union representatives from SITEPP and two employer representatives, and that it does not oppose members of the other trade unions participating in the Labour Relations Board, but that this must be agreed upon by the trade unions and not imposed by the firm. The security firm also indicates that an agreement is still in force that was concluded in  with SITEPP, a trade union that is more strongly represented in the firm. The agreement was concluded before the conciliation tribunal established by the Labour Court and was in force until  November . The private security firm adds that, in a decision of  July , the Labour Court urged SINTRAGFOUR to negotiate before the Ministry of Labour and Social Security the possibility of SITEPP sharing its participation in the Labour Relations Board. The firm also indicates that it repeatedly attended hearings convened by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, as recorded in the minutes provided by the complainant, with the aim of reaching an agreement with the trade unions, but the unions were not able to reach an agreement, and SINTRAGFOUR took this opportunity to accuse the firm of anti-union dismissals. Lastly, the firm states that, based on the foregoing, any accusation of anti-union harassment made against it must be disregarded, and that it remains open to dialogue and finding solutions that allow the firm and the trade unions to coexist harmoniously.
.The Government goes on to provide its own observations and begins by indicating that the National Directorate of Labour Inspection (DNI), which is the administrative authority responsible for monitoring compliance with trade union rights, indicates that: (i) it was aware of complaint No. SJ-PL-- of  regarding harassment and unfair labour practices, lodged by the National Federation of Industrial Workers (FENATI), to which SINTRAGFOUR is affiliated; (ii) on that occasion, it reviewed the dismissals without employer liability of Mr Vladimir Torres Montiel and Ms Graciela Reyes Umaa, both trade union leaders of SINTRAGFOUR and, in February , Mr Vladimir Torres Montiel stated his intention to have recourse to the courts, in the absence of an agreement with the firm before the DNI; and (iii) the DNI was not aware of any other complaints related to the other anti-union dismissals alleged in this case. The Government then indicates that the Directorate General of Labour Affairs, the body responsible for amicable intervention in labour disputes, reported that, between  and , a series of hearings were held in relation to alleged cases of anti-union harassment involving the union representatives of SINTRAGFOUR and the defendant firm.
.With regard to the allegations made by the CCTD in relation to the anti-union policies applied in Costa Rica, the Government responded that the allegations were unfounded, given that the Act on labour procedure reform came into force on  July , and that this Act has, inter alia, streamlined judicial proceedings, reduced delays and strengthened protections for workers who enjoy special immunities and freedom from discrimination. Moreover, this Act allows for, by means of a summary procedure known as a labour safeguard, the issuance of a pre-sentence decision, which suspends the effects of the proceedings and orders the interim reinstatement of the worker concerned in his or her post. Lastly, this Act will allow, in cases in which the employment relationship is terminated, the worker to obtain a settlement of the sums owed more quickly than is currently possible, through the arbitration and conflict resolution services of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security.
.The Committee notes that, in the present complaint, the complainant organizations allege that, as a result of the establishment of the trade union SINTRAGFOUR in August , all of the members of the executive committee of this company union and a large number of its members were subject to anti-union dismissals and anti-union harassment on behalf of a private security firm.
.With regard to the alleged anti-union dismissals and the anti-union harassment, the Committee notes the complainant organizations' allegations that, following the establishment of the trade union, all the members of the executive committee: Ms Graciela Reyes Umaa, Mr Vladimir Torres Montiel, Mr Jeffrey Duran Mora, Mr Rigoberto Cruz Vsquez, Mr Jos Andrs Chevez Luna, Mr Wagner Cubillo Palacios, Mr Flix Andino Mungua, Mr Carlos Jos Padilla Aviles and Mr Jons Arias Molina, were dismissed with no respect for their trade union immunity. In the absence of an agreement before the administrative authority of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, the union leaders filed complaints with the courts and four of them were able to prove the existence of anti union harassment. In addition,  members were allegedly dismissed for anti-union reasons since its establishment.
.The Committee also notes the firm s indication that there were sound reasons for the dismissals, more specifically, that they were the result of the closure of several large contracts and, furthermore, in many cases conciliation was reached with those concerned. The firm also indicates that the real issue lies in the absence of SINTRAGFOUR representatives on the",1,2016,Costa Rica
15,"Labour Relations Board, the body that examines and takes decisions regarding all dismissals without employer liability, and adds that it does not oppose representatives of other trade unions sitting on this board, but that this must be agreed upon by the trade unions. The Committee also notes that the Government s indication in its response that two cases of harassment and unfair labour practices were heard before the DNI and that a series of hearings in relation to alleged cases of anti-union harassment were held in the Directorate General of Labour Affairs, the body responsible for amicable intervention in labour disputes.
.The Committee notes all these factors and observes that the complaint refers, on the one hand, to the dismissal of nine SINTRAGFOUR union leaders and, on the other, to the alleged dismissal of a large number of its members.
.With regard to the dismissal of the nine union leaders, while noting the complainants' affirmation that four union leaders could prove the anti-union nature of their dismissal before judicial authorities, the Committee observes that the information included in the annexes provided by the complainant organizations shows that: (i) three trade union leaders, Mr Rigoberto Cruz Vsquez, Mr Jos Andrs Chevez Luna and Mr Wagner Cubillo Palacios, obtained a favourable judgment in the first instance, which was appealed by the firm and, at the time of the presentation of the communication, was still in the appeals process; (ii) the employment relationships of three trade union leaders were terminated by mutual agreement, Mr Jeffrey Duran Mora, Mr Flix Andino Mungua and Mr Jons Arias Molina; and (iii) specific information was not provided with regard to the other trade union leaders.
.The Committee recalls that, in cases of the dismissal of trade unionists on the grounds of their trade union membership or activities, the Committee has requested the Government to take the necessary measures to enable trade union leaders and members who had been dismissed due to their legitimate trade union activities to secure reinstatement in their jobs and to ensure the application against the enterprises concerned of the corresponding legal sanctions. The Committee also recalls that if the judicial authority ' or an independent competent body ' determines that reinstatement of trade union members is not possible for objective and compelling reasons, adequate compensation should be awarded to remedy all damages suffered and prevent any repetition of such acts in the future, so as to constitute a sufficiently dissuasive sanction against acts of anti-union discrimination [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , paras  and ]. On this basis, the Committee requests the Government to provide information on developments in the pending cases and also those on which information is not available, and expects that these cases will be addressed in the near future.
.Regarding the alleged  anti-union dismissals of workers affiliated to SINTRAGFOUR, the Committee observes in the first place that the complainants allege that those dismissals took place following the dismissal of all the members of the executive committee of the trade union and that the true reason behind these dismissals was the union affiliation of its members. The Committee also notes that the complainants provide an incomplete list of the  dismissed workers affiliated to the union in the annexes to the complaint. Secondly, the Committee observes that the company informs it that those dismissals were based on objective grounds, as a result of the closure of several large contracts and, in many cases, conciliation was reached with the workers concerned. The company indicates that the real problem is that, unlike the most representative union, SINTRAGFOUR does not participate in the Labour Relations Board of the company, an internal body established by collective agreement that examines and takes decisions regarding dismissals without employer liability. The company indicates that this problem should be resolved by the unions concerned. Lastly, the Committee observes that besides the judicial proceedings concerning anti-union dismissals referred to previously, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security indicates that it has received several reports of anti-union dismissals that are being treated either by the National Directorate of Labour Inspection or by the General Directorate of Labour Affairs.
.Faced with divergent versions regarding the reasons for the dismissals and recalling that in cases involving a large number of dismissals of trade union leaders and other trade unionists, the Committee considered that it would be particularly desirable for the Government to carry out an inquiry in order to establish the true reasons for the measures taken [see Compilation, op. cit., para. ], the Committee requests the Government to conduct a comprehensive investigation of the alleged dismissals and to keep it informed of the outcomes. The Committee also requests the complainants to provide further information on the alleged anti-union dismissal of  members of SINTRAGFOUR.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee requests the Government to provide information on developments in the cases that are pending and also those on which information is not available, and expects that those cases will be addressed in the near future, in accordance with the Committee s decisions in the above conclusions.(b)	With regard to the alleged anti-union dismissals of the members of the executive committee of the Union of Workers of the G Four Group (SINTRAGFOUR) and  of its members, which is alleged to have taken place following its establishment, the Committee requests the Government to conduct a comprehensive investigation with respect to those dismissals and to keep it informed of the outcomes.(c)	The Committee requests the complainants to provide further information on the alleged anti-union dismissal of  members of SINTRAGFOUR.",1,2016,Costa Rica

.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their respective communications of  October , the complainant organizations allege that, by means of Vote No.  of  August , the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court unilaterally amended the scope of article  of the fourth collective agreement of Banco Popular y de Desarrollo Comunal (hereafter  the Bank'  in relation to severance pay for the Bank s employees. The complainants specifically allege that: (i) for decades, industrial relations between the Bank and its employees have been governed by the collective labour agreement, which under article  of the Costa Rican Constitution, has force of law in the country; (ii) following an irregular practice adopted by public authorities in recent years, the Office of the Comptroller General of the Republic filed an application for constitutional review of article  of the Bank s collective agreement, requesting its partial annulment; (iii) article  of the agreement establishes that the Bank shall provide severance pay to its employees for the years worked when they retire, resign or are dismissed with or without employer liability; (iv) article  also provides that severance pay shall amount to a month s wages for each year worked prior to  March , while the calculation for the years worked after that date shall be based on the formula set forth in the Labour Code; (v) the application for constitutional review filed by the Office of the Comptroller alleges that this article is excessive and contrary to the principles of equality, reasonableness and efficient use of public funds; and (vi) although, in the above-mentioned vote, the Constitutional Chamber declared that the application was unfounded and that, therefore, the relevant clause of the collective agreement was not unconstitutional, it ruled that, for the clause to be considered constitutional, the number of years used for the calculation of severance pay must not exceed .
.The complainant organizations allege that this judgment of the Constitutional Chamber is incoherent and contradictory, totally lacks legal basis, is the result of political pressure and interests, and clearly violates the principle of free negotiations between the parties, as well as the principle of legal certainty. The complainants state in this respect that: (i) all the arguments put forward by the Office of the Comptroller in its application for constitutional review were rejected by the Court, as article  of the collective agreement does not foster discrimination, violate any fundamental right or undermine the principles of proportionality and reasonableness; (ii) there are no grounds whatsoever for limiting the number of years used to calculate severance pay to  years of work; and (iii) by imposing this limit that unilaterally amends the relevant clause of the collective agreement and thus distorts it, the Court is overstepping its mandate, violating the principle of free collective bargaining and disregarding the specific procedure, which respects due process, laid down in the Public Administration Act for the suppression of rights acquired under a collective agreement.
.In their respective communications of  December , the complainant organizations add that: (i) the Bank s employees are public, non-government employees governed by the private employment regime and that, under article  of its constitution, the Bank operates with full administrative and functional autonomy, with its own assets, and is not safeguarded by the Government; (ii) as part of the application for constitutional review, the Office of the Attorney-General of the Republic is requesting that the application be declared as founded and that a limit of  years be established for severance purposes; and (iii) the judgment also undermines the approval process for the Bank s fifth collective agreement, since on  December , the Industrial Relations Department of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security asked SIBANPO for clarification about the scope of the clause in the new agreement in relation to severance pay. Lastly, the complainants state that the Court s judgment is a legal contradiction, since it cannot declare the application for constitutional review of the collective agreement clause to be unfounded and, at the same time, unilaterally amend the same clause.
.In communications dated  and  April , the complainant organizations refer to a second judgment from the Supreme Court regarding another provision of the Bank s collective agreement, a judgment that, according to their allegations, also violates the right to free collective bargaining. The organizations specifically state that: (i) the current article  of the Bank s fourth collective agreement refers to the formula for payment of the Bank s employees' wages and states that  Wages are weekly. Any economic benefit affecting wages shall be calculated on the basis of the weekly wage ' that is, the monthly amount divided by four over  weeks'  (ii) although this article has formed part of the Bank s collective agreement for over  years, the Bank has decided to use a different formula from the standard one and has been dividing by ., which means that the workers' wages are lower than the agreed wages; (iii) SIBANPO submitted the matter for judicial review, and while the findings were not in its favour at first instance, the first-instance judgments were fully revoked by  second-instance judgments issued between  February and  June , when the Court of Appeal found that the Bank had strayed from the collective agreement; and (iv) the Bank applied to the Labour Chamber of the Supreme Court, which revoked the above-mentioned second-instance decisions by means of  decisions issued between  and  August , finding, without evidence, that the payment formulas would have been included in the salary scales and that the employer had complied with the relevant clause of the collective agreement.
.With regard to the above-mentioned  decisions of the Second Chamber of the Supreme Court, the complainant organizations state that they remove a standard benefit obtained through perfectly legal collective bargaining and therefore run counter to the principles of free and voluntary collective bargaining with legal certainty. They add that, under Convention No. , parties may freely determine which matters are subject to negotiation and which may result in improvements for workers in relation to the legislation. The fact that the collective agreement establishes a payment formula that is favourable to the formula provided for in the legislation is therefore perfectly valid.
.In a communication dated  October , the Government sent its reply to the complainant organizations' second allegation, which relates to the alleged violation, by the Second Chamber of the Supreme Court, of article  of the Bank s collective agreement in relation to the weekly payment formula for the Bank s employees. The Government states in this respect that: (i) the Second Chamber of the Supreme Court, which is the highest labour court in the country, revoked the second-instance judgments that found that the Bank had strayed from the terms of the collective agreement; (ii) considering that the Second Chamber had not made adequate use of the evidence at its disposal (the Bank s salary scales), SIBANPO contested the Second Chamber s judgments before the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court by means of an application for constitutional review; (iii) in a judgment dated  May , the Constitutional Chamber declared the application to be unfounded, as applications for constitutional review are not to be used in cases of mere interpretation of laws or other legal provisions, but only to address matters of constitutional relevance, which was not the case in this instance; and (iv) at the request of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, with a view to the preparation of the Government s reply to the Committee, the Second Chamber clarified that its judgments were not based on asset-related consequences or discretionary criteria, but on an objective interpretation of the agreement under examination.
.In the light of the above, after recalling the case law of the Second Chamber with regard to recognition of the right to collective bargaining in the public sector, the Government states that the actions of the judicial officials have fully adhered to the principles of the ILO.
.In a communication dated  September , the Government sent its reply to the complainant organizations' first allegation concerning the unilateral amendment, by the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court, of the scope of article  of a public bank s collective labour agreement, which establishes severance pay for the Bank s employees. The Government states that, by majority, the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court considered that the contested clause was not unconstitutional, provided that the number of years used for the calculation of severance pay did not exceed .",0,2016,Costa Rica
17,"Referring to the relevant extracts of the judgment, the Government indicates that the Constitutional Chamber: (i) recognized, on the basis of article () of the Constitutional Jurisdiction Act, the authority of the Office of the Comptroller General of the Republic to file such an application for constitutional review, as it seeks to safeguard public funds; (ii) in a majority vote, recognized the possibility of challenging, through an application for constitutional review, a collective agreement, given that  the obligations assumed by public institutions and their employees may be subject to an assessment of reasonableness, economy and efficiency, either to prevent the rights of the workers themselves from being restricted or undermined through a collective agreement or to prevent excessive use of public funds'  (iii) with regard to higher benefits concerning severance pay in clauses of collective agreements, recalled that it had accepted the setting of higher limits through collective agreements, as the Labour Code establishes minimum standards that may be exceeded, provided that the gains remain within the parameters of reasonableness and proportionality. The Chamber has thus accepted the existence of severance pay limits that exceed eight years, but not ; and (iv) the final decision of the Court, which declared the clause to be constitutional provided that it did not exceed a maximum limit, sought to prevent the misuse of public funds, to the detriment of the public services that the Bank is required to provide, and also noted that there were no valid grounds for giving the employees of the Bank in question special treatment.
.The Committee observes that the present case refers to the alleged violation of two provisions of a public bank s collective agreement by the country s Supreme Court. The Committee notes that the complainant organizations refer, first, to the alleged violation of article  of the collective agreement, which establishes that the Bank shall provide severance pay to its employees for the years worked when they retire, resign or are dismissed and alleges in this regard that: (i) this article, which has been included in successive versions of the collective agreement for decades, provides that severance pay shall amount to a month s wages for each year worked prior to  March , while the calculation for the years worked after that date shall be based on the formula set forth in the Labour Code (section  of the Labour Code provides for compensation of between . and  days' wages per year worked, depending on length of service, and limits the years used to calculate severance pay to the last eight years worked); (ii) the Office of the Comptroller General of the Republic filed an application for constitutional review of this clause, arguing that it is excessive and contrary to the principles of equality, reasonableness and efficient use of public funds; (iii) although, in its judgment of August , the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court declared that the application for constitutional review was unfounded and that, therefore, the relevant clause of the collective agreement was not unconstitutional, it ruled that, for the clause to be considered constitutional, the number of years used for the calculation of severance pay must not exceed ; (iv) this judgment is legally incoherent, as it rejects the arguments regarding unconstitutionality put forward by the Office of the Comptroller while unilaterally amending the terms agreed upon by the signatories of the agreement; (v) the establishment of a limit for the calculation of severance pay is not based on any legal argument and is the result of political pressure; (vi) it must be taken into consideration that the Bank in question enjoys full budgetary autonomy, that its employees are governed by the private employment regime and that, therefore, the amount of severance pay has no bearing; (vii) there is a specific mechanism, which respects due process, established in the Public Administration Act for the suppression of rights acquired under a collective agreement; and (viii) in the light of the foregoing, the judgment in question is in clear violation of Convention No. , ratified by Costa Rica, and the right of social partners to freely negotiate working conditions and to improve the benefits provided for in the legislation.
.The Committee notes the Government s reply, which refers to the content of the judgment of the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court dated  August . The Committee observes from the judgment of  August  that: (i) the application for the constitutional review filed by the Office of the Comptroller General of the Republic, requesting annulment of article  of the collective agreement relating to severance pay, was based on the amount of severance pay as well as the circumstances envisaged for such payments (any type of termination of the employment relationship and not simply dismissal without just cause); (ii) the Constitutional Chamber found that industrial relations between the Bank and its employees is not governed exclusively by private law; (iii) the Constitutional Chamber recognized the authority of the Office of the Comptroller General of the Republic to file such applications for constitutional review, as it seeks to safeguard public funds; (iv) by means of a majority vote, the Constitutional Chamber considered that  the obligations assumed by public institutions and their employees may be subject to an assessment of reasonableness, economy and efficiency, either to prevent the rights of the workers themselves from being restricted or undermined through a collective agreement or to prevent excessive use of public funds'  (v) while it recognized the constitutional nature of the relevant clause of the Bank s collective agreement, the Constitutional Chamber nevertheless ruled that, for the clause to be considered constitutional, the number of years used for the calculation of severance pay must not exceed ; (vi) the Chamber found that although it is constitutional to establish, through collective bargaining, benefits that exceed the minimum benefits provided for in the Labour Code, the Chamber is responsible for ensuring that parameters of reasonableness and proportionality are respected to prevent the excessive use of public funds; and (vii) the Constitutional Chamber applied the same solution that it had applied to another public institution in a previous judgment dated  May  (Judgment No. -) to the Bank.
.Recalling that agreements should be binding on the parties [see Compilation, op. cit., para. ], the Committee considers that the application for constitutional review of article  of the Bank s collective agreement filed by the Office of the Comptroller General of the Republic runs the risk of undermining the confidence of the parties in the existing collective bargaining mechanisms in the country s public sector or in the usefulness of such mechanisms in finding consensual resolutions to collective disputes. In the light of the foregoing, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps, including legislative measures if necessary, so that the authorities give preference as far as possible to collective bargaining mechanisms in assessing matters of public interest in relation to economic benefits in clauses of public sector collective agreements. Where serious economic concerns may arise calling for the modification of public sector collective agreement provisions, these situations should be handled with preference within the framework of social dialogue. ,. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.Recalling that it has examined allegations of frequent recourse to the Constitutional court to challenge the validity of public sector collective agreement provisions in the past and noting from the information available on the Supreme Court website that article  of the Bank s collective agreement is the subject of further applications for constitutional review, the Committee observes that systematic recourse to the courts to invalidate collective agreement provisions may undermine the confidence of the parties in the collective bargaining mechanisms in the public sector. In this regard, the Committee recalls that a fair and reasonable compromise should be sought between the need to preserve as far as possible the autonomy of the bargaining parties, on the one hand, and measures which must be taken by governments to overcome their budgetary difficulties, on the other [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , para. ] .
.The Committee notes that the complainant organizations also allege that, by means of  judgments issued between February and August , the Second Chamber of the Supreme Court upheld the violation by the Bank of article  of its collective agreement relating to the weekly payment of the Bank s employees. The Committee notes that the complainants' allege in this respect that: (i) for  years, the successive collective agreements of the Bank have provided that  Wages are weekly. Any economic benefit affecting wages shall be calculated on the basis of the weekly wage ' that is, the monthly amount divided by four over  weeks'  (ii) the Bank has decided to use a different formula from the standard one and has been dividing the monthly wage by ., which means that the workers' wages are lower than the",1,2016,Costa Rica
18,"agreed wages; (iii) SIBANPO submitted the matter for judicial review and obtained, at second instance,  favourable judgments that were issued between  February and  June ; and (iv) the Second Chamber of the Supreme Court nevertheless revoked the above-mentioned second-instance judgments, finding, without evidence, that the employer had complied with the relevant clause of the collective agreement. The complainant alleges that the judgments of the Second Chamber of the Supreme Court disregard the improvements that were freely agreed by the parties to the collective agreement and are therefore in clear violation of Convention No. .
.The Committee notes that, after recalling the case law of the Second Chamber of the Supreme Court, which has upheld the right to collective bargaining in the public sector, the Government states that the actions of the judicial officials in the present case have fully adhered to the principles of the ILO. The Government adds that the right to access to justice exercised by SIBANPO entails accepting the decisions of the judicial bodies, even when those decisions are not in their favour. The Committee notes that the Government specifically states that: (i) SIBANPO contested the judgments of the Second Chamber of the Supreme Court before the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court by means of an application for constitutional review, on the grounds that the Second Chamber had misused the evidence; (ii) in a judgment dated  May , the Constitutional Chamber declared the application to be unfounded, as applications for constitutional review are not to be used in cases of mere interpretation of laws or other legal provisions; and (iii) at the request of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, with a view to the preparation of the Government s reply to the Committee, the Second Chamber clarified that its judgments were not based on asset-related consequences or discretionary criteria, but on an objective interpretation of the agreement under examination.
.The Committee notes the information provided both by the complainant organizations and by the Government and observes that, according to the relevant judgments of the Second Chamber of the Supreme Court, the Court considered that: (i) the content of the current article  of the Bank s collective agreement dates back to , when it was decided that, as from , the Bank s salary scales would be prepared on the basis of a weekly wage; (ii) this clause of the collective agreement enabled the Bank at the time to move from monthly wages to weekly wages, by dividing the former by four (and not by .); (iii) this method of calculation established by the collective agreement was immediately put into practice and was incorporated into the Bank s general salary scale; and (iv) therefore, the Bank s salary scale and the monthly averages based on the scale already reflect the change arising from the agreement.
.The Committee observes that the foregoing shows that the debate surrounding article  of the Bank s collective agreement that has been brought before the courts stems from the interpretation of the scope and methods for applying the weekly payment formula contained in this article. Recalling that it has emphasized the importance of settling differences of interpretation of collective agreements by the mechanisms provided for such purpose in the agreement itself, or in any event by an impartial mechanism which should be accessible to both parties signatory to the agreement, such as an independent judicial body [see nd Report, Case No. , para. ], and observing that the difference of interpretation surrounding article  of the Bank s collective agreement has been examined by four successive judicial bodies, the Committee will not pursue its examination of this allegation.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps, including legislative measures if necessary, to ensure that the authorities give preference as far as possible to collective bargaining mechanisms in assessing matters of public interest in relation to economic benefits in clauses of public sector collective agreements. Where serious economic concerns may arise calling for the modification of public sector collective agreement provisions, these situations should be handled with preference within the framework of social dialogue. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.",1,2016,Costa Rica
19,".The complaint is submitted in communications sent by the Juanito Mora Trade Union Confederation (CSJMP), the Rerum Novarum Confederation of Workers (CTRN), the Costa Rican Workers' Movement Confederation (CMTC) and the Unitary Confederation of Workers (CUT) dated  March and  April .
.The Government provided its observations in communications dated  November ,  August , as well as  January and  September .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communications of  March and  April , the CSJMP, the CTRN, the CMTC and the CUT state that there are public enterprises and institutions in the country providing paying services regulated by the Public Service Regulatory Authority (ARESEP). Those include: the Atlantic Coast Port Administration and Economic Development Board (hereafter the  Port Services Enterprise' ; the Costa Rican Oil Refinery (hereafter the  Refinery' ; and the National Power and Light Company (hereafter the  Electrical Enterprise' . The complainant organizations state that those enterprises, which operate on the basis of approved tariffs paid by consumers and fixed by ARESEP, have concluded collective agreements respectively with the Workers' Union of the Atlantic Coast Port Administration and Economic Development Board (SITRAJAP), the Oil, Chemical and Allied Industries Workers' Union (SITRAPEQUIA) and the Electrical and Telecommunications Workers' Union (SITET), agreements which accord economic benefits covered by the tariffs charged.
.The complainants state that on  October , following a tariff adjustment requested by the port services enterprise, ARESEP issued resolution No. , which ruled that certain costs payable under the collective agreement signed with SINTRAJAP, including the payment of leave of absence, were contrary to the principle of paying services and had no direct relation to the provision of service, and could not therefore be covered by the tariffs. The complainants state that the enterprise initiated administrative proceedings against the ARESEP resolution, but that that action was overruled on the basis of Law No.  (the law establishing ARESEP), which provides that ARESEP may exclude costs contrary to the principle of a paying service, which have no direct relation with the provision of service, or which are disproportionate and excessive. The complainants included a copy of a letter sent on  January  by the Executive Director of the enterprise to the President of SINTRAJAP, stating that by virtue of the above ruling and of ARESEP resolution No. , payment of the leave of absence envisaged under the collective agreement was not possible.
.The complainants indicate that although the Port Services Enterprise s previous history had given rise to considerable concern because of the negative impact it could have on the right to bargain collectively, the country s union movement had taken it to be an isolated event. So much so that, in all years between  and , ARESEP issued no further resolution when making adjustments to tariffs that would imply a failure to recognize costs arising from collective agreements in force in regulated enterprises or institutions. The complainants state that up until , ARESEP covered all costs payable under the collective labour agreements without hesitation, thus recognizing that such costs were part of the production costs of enterprises and institutions providing paying services.
.However, the complainants state that in , following a tariff adjustment requested by the Refinery and the Electrical Enterprise, ARESEP issued a series of resolutions ruling that the costs arising from collective agreements could no longer be covered by tariffs paid by consumers (resolution No.  of  August  in respect of the Refinery and resolutions Nos ,  and  of  November  in respect of the Electrical Enterprise). The complainants indicate that ARESEP cites Law No.  in the resolutions, which provides that it may exclude costs that are contrary to the principle of a paying service, which have no direct relation with the provision of service, or which are disproportionate and excessive; and that although collective agreements are legally valid texts, the collective agreements in question contain clauses that are clearly contrary to the principle of a paying service and to the principle of financial equilibrium as understood in the cited law. The complainants indicate that because ARESEP s tariff resolutions are binding, the enterprises were no longer able to honour their obligations under the collective agreements, thus removing all economic content from the agreements. The complainants state that the enterprises cannot legally generate profits through their business activities and that the only means available to them to cover the costs of collective agreements is through the tariffs that they charge, which are fixed by ARESEP.
.The complainants allege that ARESEP s intervention amounts to interference in exercising the right to bargain collectively. They further state that, as a result of the ARESEP resolutions, the Office of the Comptroller-General of the Republic had not approved the budget lines relating to the recognition and payment of economic rights under collective agreements, thus rendering it legally impossible for public enterprises to include budget lines required for compliance with collective agreements. The complainants explain that the SITET filed for the protection of their constitutional rights (filed an amparo appeal) before the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice against ARESEP resolutions Nos ,  and  of  in respect of the electrical Enterprise, on the grounds that they were in breach of article  of the Constitution (under which collective agreements have force of law) and of Convention No. . According to the complainants, the Constitutional Chamber rejected the appeal on the grounds that it concerned questions that should be dealt with in an administrative or common law court, and not by a constitutional court.
.The complainants claim that the ARESEP authorities have announced that the decision to exclude costs arising from collective agreements from adjustments to tariffs will apply to all future tariff requests, and as such form part of an institutional policy designed to promote the principle of a  paying service'  The complainants maintain that would imply that the policy of ARESEP, a state institution, is not aimed solely at the organizations mentioned above, but at all other enterprises in which collective agreements have been concluded and whose tariffs for the sale of services are subject to ARESEP approval.
.In its communication of  November , the Government notes that the issues raised in the present complaint also feature in a representation submitted by the same complainants under article  of the Constitution of the ILO (that representation has not yet been examined and contains additional allegations). The Government therefore requests that the allegations made in respect of ARESEP in this complaint be considered as a single case.
.In its communications of  November ,  August  and  January and  September , the Government transmits its own observations, those of ARESEP and of the enterprises concerned. ARESEP indicates that Law No.  provides that it may exclude costs contrary to the principle of a paying service which have no direct relation to the provision of the service and that one of the criteria that ARESEP is obliged to take into consideration when fixing prices, tariffs or rates, was economic efficiency (article ). Article (b) and (c) explicitly sets out that the following cannot be accepted as costs of regulated enterprises:  expenditures that are unnecessary for, or unconnected to, the provision of a public Service' and  contributions, costs, investments and debts incurred for activities unconnected to the administration, operation or maintenance of the regulated activity'  By virtue of the above, ARESEP maintains that benefits which have no direct relation to the provision of a public service cannot be covered by tariffs and ultimately passed on to users.
.The Port Services Enterprise indicates, on the basis of a detailed technical analysis, that ARESEP reconsidered its position with regard to the expenses included under the collective agreement and, via resolution No.  of , had approved inclusion within the tariffs of a range of expenses listed in the collective agreement.
.For its part, the Refinery states that ARESEP resolution No.  created an internal problem in the enterprise, as it made it impossible to honour the payment of certain benefits acquired under the collective agreement. The Refinery indicates that: (i) it filed an appeal against resolution No.  before ARESEP s Executive Board and that on  August  a group of lawyers from the Refinery, acting in a personal capacity, filed amparo proceedings before the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice; and (ii) on  June  the Constitutional Chamber upheld the amparo appeal by Vote No. - and declared null the content of resolution No.  with respect to the exclusion from the calculation of tariffs of the costs arising from the benefits provided by the collective agreement. The Government stresses that Constitutional Chamber Vote No. - had again shown that the institution of collective bargaining in the country was protected under the",0,2016,Costa Rica
20,"law and by the authorities who safeguard the fundamental rights of workers.
.The Refinery also states that: (i) with regard to the appeal it had filed with the ARESEP Executive Board, on  June  the board had issued resolution No.  indicating that it was awaiting judgments on two actions challenging the constitutionality of the collective agreement filed on  June  by Mr Otto Guevara Guth, Member of Parliament, and by Mr Enrique Egloff, representative of the Chamber of Industries; and (ii) with regard to compliance with Constitutional Chamber Vote No. -, on  October , ARESEP had informed the Refinery by letter that it was still reviewing the information received from the Refinery regarding the inclusion in its accounting of costs arising from the collective agreement that needed to be added to the tariffs.
.The Electrical Enterprise states that as a result of ARESEP s action, it was unable to comply with its obligations under the agreement, and consequently all economic content in the collective agreement was lost.
.The Committee notes that in this case the complainants allege interference by the Public Service Regulatory Authority (ARESEP) in the application of collective agreements concluded by public enterprises. Specifically, the complainants refer to resolutions issued by ARESEP in  and , which do not authorize three public enterprises to include as part of their production costs, and thus in the final tariffs that they charge for the services they provide, costs which ARESEP considers unrelated to the provision of a public service, including the costs arising from fulfilling the obligations of collective agreements.
.The Committee takes note of the complainants' allegations that (i) ARESEP, in a resolution issued in , excluded from the Port Service Enterprise s requested tariff adjustment costs related to various benefits granted by the collective agreement concluded with SINTRAJAP; (ii) in , ARESEP issued a series of resolutions which excluded from the Refinery s and from the Electrical Enterprise s requested tariff adjustments costs related to collective agreements concluded with SITRAPEQUIA and SITET respectively; (iii) in those resolutions, ARESEP indicated that the law provides for the exclusion of costs contrary to the principle of a paying service, which have no direct relation to the provision of the service, or which are disproportionate and excessive; (iv) as a result of the ARESEP resolutions, the Office of the Comptroller-General of the Republic had not approved the budget lines relating to the recognition and payment of economic rights under collective agreements; and (v) The Electrical Enterprise initiated administrative proceedings against ARESEP resolution No.  of  but the action was rejected (the administrative tribunal considered that the law allowed ARESEP to exclude costs which had no direct relation with the provision of service) and SITET lodged an amparo appeal against ARESEP resolutions Nos ,  and  of , which was also rejected (the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice ruled that the issues raised should be dealt with by an administrative or common law court, and not under an amparo procedure).
.The Committee further notes that: (i) ARESEP states that Law No.  provides that it may exclude costs contrary to the principle of a paying service which have no direct relation to the provision of the service; (ii) the Port Services Enterprise indicates that ARESEP reconsidered its position with regard to expenses related to the collective agreement and that, in resolution No.  of , ARESEP accepted the inclusion within tariffs of a number of expenses arising from the collective agreement; (iii) the Refinery and the Electrical Enterprise indicate that the ARESEP resolutions create internal problems as they prevent them from complying with the collective agreements; (iv) the Refinery lodged an appeal with the ARESEP Executive Board against ARESEP resolution No.  of ; and a group of lawyers from the Refinery, acting in a personal capacity, filed an amparo appeal in respect of that resolution before the Constitutional Chamber; (v) the amparo appeal was upheld by Vote No. - and as a result ARESEP resolution  of  was nullified; (vi) some days after the amparo appeal had been upheld, a Member of Parliament and representative of the Chamber of Industries filed two actions challenging the constitutionality of the refinery s collective agreement; and (vii) the ARESEP Executive Board decided to await judgment on the two actions challenging constitutionality before ruling on the appeal that had been lodged by the Refinery against resolution No.  of .
.The Committee observes that appeals were filed against the ARESEP resolutions by the public enterprises and/or by trade union organizations. As regards the Port Services Enterprise, the information provided shows that: (i) the administrative proceedings initiated by the enterprise against resolution No.  of  were rejected; and (ii) although ARESEP agreed in  to include coverage of various expenses arising from collective agreement within the tariffs, certain other expenses, such as leave of absence, were still excluded.
.As regards the Electrical Enterprise, the Committee observes that the amparo appeal lodged by SITET against resolutions Nos ,  and  of  was rejected by the Constitutional Chamber on the grounds that the issues raised should be dealt with by the administrative courts or judiciary and not via an amparo appeal. The Committee has no further information in that connection.
.On the other hand, the Committee observes that, according to the Government and to the Refinery, the amparo appeal against ARESEP resolution No.  of , lodged by a group of lawyers from the enterprise, had been upheld by Vote No. - and the ARESEP resolution nullified. The committee notes that in that decision, the Constitutional Chamber indicates that ARESEP had exceeded its mandate and functions in refusing to recognize a collective agreement in force and registered by the Ministry of Labour. The Constitutional Chamber also stressed that the benefits accorded under the collective agreement had been excluded by ARESEP on the basis of a tariff analysis, rather than a budgetary analysis, and that ARESEP had ignored the fact that the excluded costs were written into a collective agreement which, under the Constitution, had force of law.
.From information made available on the web portal of the Supreme Court, the Committee observes that: (i) in a resolution of  December , the Constitutional Chamber ruled that ARESEP postpone implementation of Vote No. - until judgment had been handed down in respect of the actions challenging the constitutionality of the Refinery s collective agreement; (ii) on  May , the Constitutional Chamber issued Vote No. - in respect of those actions, thereby cancelling eleven clauses from the Refinery collective agreement ' , on grounds of their unconstitutionality; and (iii) the benefits declared unconstitutional include food and transport allowances as well as dental care for the worker s immediate family. The Committee notes that in decision -, the Constitutional Chamber indicates that the abovementioned benefits are contrary to the principles of reasonableness, equality, legality and austerity in the use of public funds. The Constitutional Chamber also indicates that certain of the benefits that had been declared unconstitutional had already been removed from the collective agreement when it was renegotiated for ' .
.The Committee recalls that it is acceptable that in the bargaining process the employer side representing the public administration seek the opinion of the Ministry of Finances or an economic and financial body that verifies the financial impact of draft collective agreements.. The Committee has also considered that the exercise of financial powers by the public authorities in a manner that prevents or limits compliance with collective agreements already entered into by public bodies is not consistent with the principle of free collective bargaining. [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , paras  and ].
.It would appear from the above that while the Constitutional Chamber upheld the amparo appeal filed by the Refinery lawyers and annulled ARESEP resolution No.  of , a number of articles of the collective agreement were cancelled by the Constitutional Chamber as a result of the two actions challenging constitutionality. On that basis, the Committee again requests the Government, as it did recently in Case No. , examined in October  [see report No. , paras ' ], to take the necessary steps, including legislative measures if necessary, to ensure that in the future the authorities give preference as far as possible to collective bargaining mechanisms in assessing matters of public interest in relation to economic benefits in clauses of public sector collective agreements.
.The Committee draws the Government s attention to the availability of the technical assistance of the Office in this respect should it so desire.
.In light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee again requests the Government to take the necessary steps, including legislative measures if necessary, to ensure that in the future the authorities give preference as far as possible to collective bargaining mechanisms in assessing matters of public interest in relation to economic benefits in clauses of public sector collective agreements.",1,2016,Costa Rica
21,The Committee draws the Government s attention to the availability of the technical assistance of the Office in this respect should it so desire.,1,2016,Costa Rica
22,".The Committee examined this case, in which the complainant alleged that, in compliance with a ruling by the Office of the Comptroller General of the Republic, a state-owned bank amended a provision in a collective agreement signed with the Labour Union of the National Bank of Costa Rica (SEBANA), at its meeting of June  (see Report No. , paragraphs ' ). On that occasion, emphasizing the importance of settling differences of interpretation of collective agreements by the mechanisms provided for such purpose in the agreement itself or, in any event, by an impartial mechanism which should be accessible to both parties signatory to the agreement, such as a judicial body, the Committee requested the Government and the complainant to keep it informed of the outcome of the judicial proceedings under examination.
.In its communications dated  July  and  July , the Government provides information relating to four judicial proceedings and indicates that two of them (cases Nos ---LA and ---CA), instituted by SEBANA in relation to the Bank s action in compliance with the ruling of the Comptroller General of the Republic, had concluded with decisions in favour of the Bank, and that the other two proceedings (cases Nos ---LA and ---LA) had not yet been concluded.
.The Committee notes the information provided by the Government. Trusting that the two judicial proceedings that remain under examination will be resolved as soon as possible and observing that no information has been received from the complainant in this regard, the Committee considers that this case is closed and will not pursue its examination.
.The complaint is contained in a communication dated  August  from the Costa Rican Confederation of Democratic Workers (CCTD).
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  September and  December .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  August , the CCTD states that on  April , the National Bank of Costa Rica (the Bank) and the Labour Union of the National Bank of Costa Rica (SEBANA), signed their seventh collective bargaining agreement, applicable for a three-year period. The complainant alleges that, in compliance with a ruling issued on  January  by the Office of the Comptroller General of the Republic (CGR), the Bank amended article  of the collective agreement.
.The complainant states that article  governs payment of an incentive bonus known as the  performance appraisal and staff incentive scheme (SEDI)'  which seeks to promote staff development and well-being. Article  states that the Bank s staff are entitled to a financial incentive geared to an overall performance rating achieved for each period, and that the payment must be equivalent to  per cent of the net profits made by the Bank and its subsidiaries in the previous year plus any reserves and provisions additional to the regulations of the Financial Institutions Supervisory Body (SUGEF) which are posted in the year-end accounts, but that the  per cent will be reduced by the taxes and contributions which the Bank is required to pay by law.
.The complainant states that, as part of an audit conducted to evaluate the Bank s performance, the CGR issued report No. DFOE-EC-IF--, annexed to the complaint, in which it concludes:Although the collective agreement states that the Bank must allocate  per cent of its profits to pay for the incentive bonus, the Bank in fact incurs other costs relating directly to this payment, namely employer contributions, bonuses, the  salario escolar' [an additional allowance for public sector workers], the labour capitalization fund, reserve fund contributions and solidarity fund contributions, as well as those incurred under article  of the agreement; together these constituted an average of  per cent of the SEDI performance incentive payment over the period examined (' ). It follows that the overall cost of the incentive to the Bank should include not only the payment itself but also the additional expenses that the Bank has to meet and which increase the burden on overall operating costs and on the institution s available profits.
.According to the complainant, it is blatantly unlawful for the CGR to have instructed the Bank to pay the SEDI by treating the  per cent of profits as a ceiling and including in that percentage all the associated costs, namely the taxes and contributions for which the employer is responsible. The complainant emphasizes that payment made under article  of the collective agreement is by nature salary-related and that the inclusion of what the CGR calls associated costs (taxes and contributions payable by the Bank) greatly reduces the amount of money to be shared among entitled employees of the institution, and is thus seriously detrimental to all employees of the Bank. According to the complainant, the CGR is de facto interpreting and amending the collective agreement, which constitutes state interference that violates the principles governing all collective bargaining.
.The complainant states that the Bank lodged a rescindment appeal against the CGR s ruling, which the latter rejected. According to the complainant, this constitutes a new kind of violation of collective agreements by the State: whereas, previously, unconstitutional proceedings were instituted against the provisions of collective agreements, now an administrative body such as the CGR produces an interpretation, without being competent to do so, and amends collective agreements.
.The complainant also states that SEBANA turned to the courts in an effort to have the content of the collective agreement upheld, but that the Employment Court of the Second Judicial Circuit of San Jos closed the case, ruling that trade unions are not competent to use the courts of law to enforce the contents of a collective agreement and arguing that SEBANA must be granted special powers by its members allowing it to represent them in a judicial process. The complainant attached to its complaint a copy of the appeal submitted to the Higher Employment Tribunal on  August . In that appeal, the trade union emphasized that the case is not concerned with the personal interests of the Bank s employees, but is rather a matter relating to a collective agreement signed by the trade union.
.In its communications of  September and  December , the Government transmits its observations together with a report prepared by the Bank s general management. The Government explains that the Bank is an independent public law institution owned by the State and that its organic law obliges it to carry out binding instructions from the CGR. The Government adds that the Bank is also obliged to correct errors or actions that are harmful to the public purse and have generated additional outlay without appropriate legal justification.
.The Government indicates that the CGR, as the body which controls public finances, is responsible for examining the accounts of state institutions and public officials. In this context, the Office of the Comptroller produced the  Special audit report on performance assessment in state-owned banks: the National Bank of Costa Rica'  on  January . In this study the CGR evaluated the soundness of the Bank s policies and the total cost to the Bank of maintaining the SEDI it has applied since .
.The report concludes that, although article  of the existing collective agreement states that the Bank should pay a productivity incentive equivalent to  per cent of consolidated profits, nevertheless over the period under review (' ), the amounts distributed by the Bank under the productivity incentive exceeded  per cent of its profits, because the Bank s administration did not include the costs associated with the incentive, including employers' contributions, within the  per cent ceiling established in the collective agreement.
.The Government states that the senior management of the Bank submitted an appeal for rescindment of the report which was rejected by the Economic Services Audit Area of the CGR s Division for Performance Evaluation Audit. Its decision, issued on  February , states the following:
.The Government states that, after the Bank s rescindment appeal was rejected, it corrected the procedure used in paying the incentive, in accordance with instructions and recommendations issued by the CGR. A report written by the Bank s management, which the Government encloses, argues that although the Bank, motivated by error, acted incorrectly in the past on the basis of an interpretation that differed from the wording of the collective agreement, this does not entitle the workers to perpetuate the error. According to its management, the Bank s decision does not disregard the spirit and historical context of the agreement; on the contrary, it enables correct application of the agreement as consented to by the parties and in accordance with the law. According to the Bank s management, the CGR at no time instructed it not to apply the provision in the agreement, but instead drew the Bank s attention to its true scope, which in the past was not being observed.
.Lastly, the Government points out",0,2015,Costa Rica
23,"that there are currently four judicial proceedings awaiting decision in connection with the Bank s actions relating to the ruling of the CGR.
.The Committee observes that the present case refers to the allegation by the CCTD that, in compliance with a ruling of the CGR, the Bank amended a provision in a collective agreement signed with SEBANA.
.The Committee notes that the complainant and the Government state that: (i) since , the Bank has implemented the performance appraisal and staff incentive scheme (SEDI), which aims to promote staff development and well-being; (ii) on  April , the Bank and SEBANA signed their seventh collective agreement for a three-year period, article  of which states that: (a) the Bank s employees are entitled to a performance-related incentive geared to an overall rating achieved for each period; and (b) the bonus is equivalent to  per cent of the net profits made by the Bank and its subsidiaries in the previous year plus any reserves and provisions additional to the regulations of the Financial Institutions Supervisory Body (SUGEF) which are posted in the year-end accounts, but that the  per cent will be reduced by the taxes and contributions which the Bank is required to pay by law; (iii) on  January , the CGR issued an audit report in which it stated that, during the period under examination (' ), the real cost of the SEDI to the Bank represented an average of  per cent of the Bank s net profits and not the  per cent stipulated in the collective agreement, because the costs incurred by the Bank in paying the SEDI were not included within the established ceiling; (iv) these  associated costs' to the SEDI are social charges that the Bank must pay which are inherent in every salary-related payment, examples being employer contributions, bonuses, the so-called  salario escolar' [an additional allowance for public sector workers] and the labour capitalization fund; and (v) in its report, the CGR recommended that the Bank s governing board should ensure that SEDI payment conforms to the parameter laid down in the existing regulations, so that the  associated costs' are incorporated within the maximum limit of  per cent stipulated in the collective agreement.
.The Committee also notes the allegation by the complainant that the  associated costs' referred to by the CGR in its report are charges and taxes that an employer is legally required to pay, and that it is blatantly unlawful to deduct such costs from a salary-related incentive such as that provided for in article  of the collective agreement. The Committee further notes that the complainant states that deduction of the  associated costs' from the incentive payment greatly reduces the amount of money available for distribution among entitled employees of the institution, and is thus seriously detrimental to all the Bank s employees. According to the complainant, whereas, in the past, the State violated collective agreements through unconstitutional actions, now, through the CGR, it is de facto interpreting and amending collective agreements.
.In this respect, the Committee notes the Government s statements that: (i) the Bank is an independent public law institution which must comply with the CGR s rulings; (ii) the percentage to which the Bank is committed in its collective agreement is  per cent of its profits less the taxes and contributions for which it is liable in law; (iii) the fact that the Bank s administration has been implementing an arrangement that contravenes the provisions of the agreement, by not subtracting taxes and contributions from the distributable amount and thus granting greater benefits to its employees (incentives exceeding  per cent of net profits) does not entitle those employees to continue benefiting from the error; and (iv) although, as a first resort, the Bank lodged a rescindment appeal (which was rejected by the CGR in a decision issued on  February ), the management of the Bank has stated that the CGR at no time instructed it not to apply the provision in the agreement, but instead drew the Bank s attention to its true scope, which in the past was not being observed by the Bank.
.In the light of the above, the Committee observes that the present complaint concerns a conflict in the interpretation of a clause of a collective agreement that applies within a state-owned bank. The Committee notes in this regard the complainant s allegation that the CGR imposed an interpretation of the clause relating to payment of an incentive bonus known as the SEDI without having competence to do so and that, furthermore, the judicial proceeding brought by the union to challenge that interpretation was declared inadmissible by the Employment Court of the Second Judicial Circuit of San Jos (Case No. ---LA) (the complainant has not enclosed a copy of this judgment). According to the complainant, the Court ordered the case to be closed, finding that the unions do not have competence to bring cases to trial for the purposes of enforcing the contents of a collective agreement, and that they must obtain special powers from their members before representing them in judicial proceedings. The Committee notes that the complainant has attached to its complaint a copy of an appeal submitted to the Higher Employment Tribunal on  August , on which no ruling has yet been made. The Committee observes that in its appeal the union emphasized that the case concerns not the individual interests of Bank employees but a collective agreement signed by the union. The Committee also notes that the Government refers to the existence of four judicial proceedings relating to the Bank s actions taken in response to the ruling of the CGR, which are awaiting settlement.
.In this regard, the Committee recalls paragraph  of the Collective Agreements Recommendation,  (No. ), which states that disputes arising from interpretation of a collective agreement should be submitted to an appropriate procedure for settlement established either by agreement between the parties or by laws or regulations as may be appropriate under national conditions. Accordingly, the Committee considers that this difference in interpretation of article  of the collective agreement should be resolved by the mechanisms provided for such purpose in the agreement itself, or in any event by an impartial mechanism which should be accessible to both parties signatory to the agreement, such as an independent judicial body. On the basis of the foregoing, the Committee requests the Government and the complainant to keep it informed of the outcome of the ongoing judicial proceedings.
.In light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:Emphasizing the importance of settling differences of interpretation of collective agreements by the mechanisms provided for such purpose in the agreement itself, or in any event by an impartial mechanism which should be accessible to both parties signatory to the agreement, such as an independent judicial body, the Committee requests the Government and the complainant to keep it informed of the outcome of the ongoing judicial proceedings.",1,2015,Costa Rica
24,".The complaint is contained in a communication of  February , signed by the National Educators' Association (ANDE), the Secondary School Teachers' Association (APSE), the National Federation of Employees of the Social Security System and Fund (UNDECA), the Independent Union of Public Sector Workers (SITECO) and the General Confederation of Workers (CGT).
.The Government sent its observations in a communication of  November .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communication of  February , the complainant organizations denounce the authorities' refusal to grant their request for the temporary suspension of the session of the Public Sector Salary Negotiation Committee in order to allow for consultations. They allege that this led to the imposition of a decision without consideration for representativeness, and that, consequently, faith in negotiation procedures has been lost.
.The complainant organizations indicate that, starting in January , they attended various meetings of the Public Sector Salary Negotiation Committee (which is responsible for the review and negotiation of public sector salaries and includes representatives of each of the trade union confederations, a representative of ANDE, a representative of APSE and a representative elected by the five most representative public sector workers' organizations not incorporated into federations) in order to discuss the salary adjustment for the first half of the year. They indicate that the purpose of their participation was to obtain a salary adjustment that reflected the increase in the cost of living, but that from the beginning of the series of meetings the Government was determined not to increase salaries by more than . per cent (the inflation accumulated over the previous six months). As a counterproposal, the complainant organizations called for a . per cent increase for professionals (. per cent to account for inflation plus  per cent, equal to half the inflation forecast for the first half of ), and an extraordinary adjustment of . per cent for non-professionals, whose salary increment would increase to  per cent, with a view to reducing the gap between the salaries of the two categories (in both cases it was necessary to add the . per cent due as a result of the salary negotiations of the second half of ). Weeks after the complainant organizations made public their rejection of the Government s proposal and presented this counterproposal, the Government convened another meeting of the Public Sector Salary Negotiation Committee, for  February.
.The complainant organizations indicate that at the meeting of  February: (i) the Government presented a proposed adjustment that maintained the . per cent increase, with the only addition being a . per cent increase for non-professional posts, to be granted gradually and in phases (it did not provide the details of this additional adjustment curve); (ii) the complainant organizations requested a suspension of the session for a few days, to allow their respective boards of directors time to familiarize themselves with the expanded proposal, and with a technical report with details of the proposed additional . per cent adjustment curve (the fact that the Government s new proposal did not contain any additional increase for professionals was a sensitive issue for some of the complainants, such as ANDE and APSE ' the largest Costa Rican public sector trade unions, and therefore the only ones with seats in their names on the Public Sector Salary Negotiation Committee, and the majority of whose members are professional educators); (iii) in response to the request for a suspension of the session, the other group of trade union organizations, comprising various confederations and federations, indicated their intention to proceed with the session, with the Government; (iv) the Government representatives took a unilateral decision not to suspend the session, without a vote or consideration of the criterion concerning the most representative organizations, thus denying the complainants the opportunity to hold the necessary internal consultations and failing to enable genuine negotiations which might lead to an increase for the professional category; (v) as a result of the Government s authoritative stance and its failure to recognize the complainants' legitimate position as the most representative organizations, the complainants withdrew from the session, expressly indicating that they would wait until the next meeting when they would have a clear position on the proposal; and (vi) in spite of this, the Government continued the meeting with the other organizations and proceeded, with them, to sign a salary adjustment agreement that maintained only a . per cent increase for the professional category (as well as the pending . per cent owed) and established an additional increase of up to . per cent for non-professionals (the complainants consider that there was consequently no substantial improvement made to the Government s initial proposal that would justify the new agreement concluded with certain trade unions).
.The complainant organizations allege that the Conventions ratified by Costa Rica demand transparency and good faith in negotiations, as well as a need to establish objective criteria for joint decision-making. The complainants consider that, by unilaterally refusing the request of the various most representative organizations to suspend discussions for a few days for internal consultation purposes, the Government denied them their right to collective bargaining and trade union representation, which precluded their participation in the negotiation of the salary adjustment agreement.
.In its communication of  November , the Government indicates that the actions its representatives were in conformity with Costa Rican law, and the principles of good faith and free and voluntary negotiation promoted by the ILO, and therefore requests that the complaint be dismissed.
.The Government indicates that three meetings of the Public Sector Salary Negotiation Committee were held (on  and  January and  February ), and that at the last meeting, on  February: (i) the Government presented its salary proposal and discussions began; (ii) subsequently, the complainant organizations proposed suspending the session with a view to submitting the initiative to their executive bodies for consideration; (iii) the other trade union organizations present, which represent the trade union confederations (except for the CGT) agreed to continue negotiating; (iv) to respect the wishes of the trade union delegations which wanted to proceed with the session, the Government representatives decided to keep the space open for dialogue and the session therefore continued; and (v) at the close of the meeting the Government and trade union representatives who were present agreed on a salary adjustment proposal for the first half of , which improved on the Government s initial proposal, with the proposed . per cent increasing to . per cent for the first-level salary group.
.The Government regrets that, despite its willingness and that of the other trade unions, the complainant organizations left the session of the Public Sector Salary Negotiation Committee. While it recognizes that these situations can occur in forums for dialogue, the Government indicates that it always maintains the hope that there will be a willingness to conclude negotiations, in order to find common ground which may support the executive in its decision-making. The Government emphasizes that it never intended to exclude any trade union representatives from the salary discussion; on the contrary, it responded to the willingness to negotiate of the trade union representatives who remained for the entire session. The Government recalls that social dialogue must be voluntary and that representatives cannot be prevented from leaving or obligated to take part in a discussion, and that, when no agreement is reached or there are delays in reaching agreement it is not appropriate to speak of a failure of social dialogue. The Government states that since  a total of  salary adjustments have been made and that agreement between trade unions and the Government was possible on only three occasions ( per cent).
.The Government recalls that setting the policy on public sector salaries is a constitutional responsibility of the executive and that, as the Constitutional Chamber has ruled, the Public Sector Salary Negotiation Committee, as a joint body, is consultative in nature and is a forum for dialogue that is not authorized to set salary increases definitively. However, the Government emphasizes that this body provides a space for social dialogue in which the representatives of public sector workers can debate, exchange ideas on and analyse matters of salary adjustments.
.The Committee observes that the complaint concerns the refusal of the authorities to suspend a session of the Public Sector Salary Negotiation Committee for some days to allow the complainant organizations ' which include a trade union confederation and the only two trade unions to hold their own seats on the Committee, owing to their significant public sector representativeness ' to hold internal consultations. In response to the salary adjustment proposal presented by the Government at the meeting of  February , the complainant organizations requested that the session be suspended to allow them to consult their respective boards of directors, in the light of an additional technical report requested from the Government. The other organizations present",0,2015,Costa Rica
25,"' comprising various federations and confederations ' indicated that they preferred to continue with the meeting. In these circumstances, the Government did not agree to the request for suspension, the complainant organizations withdrew from the meeting (indicating that they would await a future meeting, to which they would come prepared with a clear position), and the other organizations present and the Government continued with the meeting and reached agreement on a salary adjustment without the participation of the complainant organizations.
.In the context of voluntary collective bargaining and a spirit of good faith, the Committee does not consider unreasonable the complainant organizations' request to suspend the work of the Public Sector Salary Negotiation Committee for some days, to allow for internal consultations on a proposal which the Government submitted during that meeting and about which ' according to the complainants, and not denied by the Government ' further technical details were needed. As the Government did not indicate why it was not possible or advisable to agree to this request for a brief suspension of the proceedings of the Public Sector Salary Negotiation Committee (beyond the alleged willingness of the other organizations present to continue with the meeting), the Committee encourages the Government and the social partners to take appropriate measures in the future to foster the continued participation in the work of the Public Sector Salary Negotiation Committee of the different organizations which comprise it, with a view to promoting, to the extent possible, social dialogue and agreements supported by all the organizations concerned.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee encourages the Government and the social partners to take appropriate measures in the future to foster the continued participation in the work of the Public Sector Salary Negotiation Committee of the different organizations which comprise it, with a view to promoting, to the extent possible, social dialogue and agreements supported by all the organizations concerned.",-1,2015,Costa Rica
26,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the Union of Employees of the University of Costa Rica (SINDEU) dated  June . The union submitted additional information in a communication dated  August .
.The Government sent further observations in a communication dated  January .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Workers' Representatives Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  June , SINDEU alleges that the University of Costa Rica (UCR), a public university, signed an agreement with the Costa Rican Social Security Fund (CCSS) in , which was renewed on various occasions between January  and  February  and covered the administration of the basic integrated health-care teams (EBAIS), which had as beneficiaries various communities across the country, initially through the University of Costa Rica Research Foundation (FUNDEVI) ' a private organization from the same university ' and then directly through the University of Costa Rica. On the final day,  February , the university discontinued its administration of the Comprehensive Health-Care Programme (PAIS), resulting in the dismissal of  workers, including three members of the executive board of SINDEU, Mr Ricardo Peralta Rivera (doctor), Ms Ana Luca Sols Lpez (assistant nurse) and Ms Dania Snchez Rojas (pharmacy technician), who were employees on the PAIS programme and had been elected to the board on  July .
.According to the allegations, these officials had been elected by the members of the union not to be union leaders of the PAIS programme, but union leaders of SINDEU. As such, they are due to perform their institutional union work ' and not only work on the PAIS programme ' until  June . Accordingly, as stated by the complainant, although the PAIS programme finished on  February , the university continues as an active institution and remains their employer and, pursuant to clause  of the collective labour agreement signed on  March  regarding immunity from dismissal, they are granted trade union immunity until  one year after their trade union duties end'  This clause establishes immunity from dismissal for workers on the executive board, who  may be dismissed only if proof is provided before the Industrial Relations Board and the Arbitration Tribunal of any of the grounds set forth in article  of the Labour Code'  The immunity from dismissal applies for  up to one year after the day on which their [trade union] duties end' 
.The complainant trade union states that the protection of union leaders started in  from the moment that they ran for election to the SINDEU executive board, a process which began on  April .
.The complainant trade union indicates that the employer s meeting with the trade union representatives on  May  was, regrettably, only held after a ruling by the university legal office that there was no need to resolve the three union leaders' situation.
.During the meeting, the trade union representatives pointed out to the Rector that the ruling had not taken into account the lack of consultations with the Ministry of Labour and Social Security and the priority in recruitment that should be given to the trade union leaders. The complainant trade union emphasizes that Costa Rica has ratified the Workers' Representatives Convention,  (No. ), which stipulates that:  workers' representatives in the undertaking shall enjoy effective protection against any act prejudicial to them, including dismissal, based on their status or activities as a workers' representative or on union membership or participation in union activities, in so far as they act in conformity with existing laws or collective agreements or other jointly agreed arrangements'  In addition, the Workers' Representatives Recommendation,  (No. ), in support of this Convention, includes among the measures to protect trade union leaders, the  requirement of consultation with, an advisory opinion from, or agreement of an independent body, public or private, or a joint body, before the dismissal of a workers' representative becomes final' and,  recognition of a priority to be given to workers' representatives with regard to their retention in employment in case of reduction of the workforce'  The protection of the workers' representatives  should also apply to workers who are candidates, or have been nominated as candidates through such appropriate procedures as may exist, for election or appointment as workers' representatives' 
.The complainant trade union alleges that the leaders Mr Ricardo Peralta Rivera, Ms Ana Luca Sols Lpez and Ms Dania Snchez Rojas took part, in vain, respectively in ,  and  recruitment exercises or competitions but were unsuccessful because of the employer s lack of goodwill and because the employer did not give them priority at the time of the recruitment. The complainant trade union points out that the employer has the option of giving direct contracts for six months or less, as set out in paragraphs (a) and (c) of article  of the current collective labour agreement, but the employer did not pursue these options.
.In its communication dated  August , the complainant trade union attached a communication from the Rector s office of the University dated  June , repeatedly stating that the reason for terminating the labour relations of the three trade union leaders was the closure of the PAIS programme and recalling that the necessary actions had been taken to allow the officials of the PAIS programme to take part in the university competitions and that, the communication continues, to date they had not been selected for various reasons, such as failure to meet the requirements.
.In its communication dated  January , the Government indicates that, in its complaint, SINDEU alleges that three trade union leaders had been dismissed following the expiry of the agreement between the UCR and the CCSS on the administration of EBAIS. The agreement had been effective between January  and  February .
.The Government summarizes the position of the Rector s office, explaining that the main points contained in the agreement mentioned above may be set out as follows: the principal aim of the employment was for the provision, administration and management of comprehensive health-care services for the communities of Montes de Oca, Curridabat and San Juan, San Diego, Concepcin and San Ramn de Tres Ros. The UCR was required to ensure the organization, provision and quality of the services, as defined by the CCSS in various technical documents, in order to ensure better coverage, efficiency and effectiveness.
.The UCR had the role of carrying out health promotion, prevention, treatment and rehabilitation activities under the basic package for primary level health care, including medical services, and laboratory work in clinical, pharmaceutical and dental fields under the proposed conditions. It was agreed to limit the instrument in time to a five-year period.
.As stated by the complainant trade union, the UCR finished managing the PAIS programme in February . As a consequence of the termination of the aforementioned agreement, the staff contracted by the university under the PAIS programme ended their duties. As, however, the workers themselves were not responsible for this termination, the UCR agreed that all appropriate compensation should be paid to them. In view of the above, the UCR considers that the dismissals do not contravene national and international regulations and did not in any way relate to the positions held by the abovementioned officials as union leaders, but are exclusively a consequence of the termination of the contract and the final closure of the PAIS programme. Accordingly, this was not a matter of the UCR taking a decision to close the PAIS programme without considering the rights of the unionized workers, but rather that the closure affected all employees on the programme in equal measure and they were, furthermore, compensated for all labour-related requirements.
.Regarding the legality of dismissing workers, including trade union leaders, the Second Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice indicated that ' ..their inclusion in this group of dismissals is justifiable provided that there exists, as mentioned, an objective reason for it (articles  and  of the General Public Administration Law)' 
.The employer s representative of the UCR states in report No. R-- that the trade union was aware, since , of the date on which the programme was ending. In this regard, the extensions granted to this contract were aimed at transferring the EBAIS programmes administered by the UCR-PAIS programme to the CCSS or to the body which the university assigned to do the recruitment. The intention of the trade union leaders involved to join together, from the point of view of the employer s representative, is a way of making the university retain them in their posts despite the closure, by invoking the special protection that they enjoy under their trade union immunity.
.The Government points out that the university has emphasized that, since the announcement of the final closure of the PAIS programme and until the handover was",-1,2014,Costa Rica
27,"complete, it had held regular meetings with SINDEU, as well as negotiations on the matter. The trade union nevertheless called a strike on the grounds, in particular, of the following points: () opposition to the termination of the CCSS-UCR-PAIS contract; () the degradation in the quality of life of the users in the communities served following the closure of the programme and also the dismissals procedure; () the irregular way in which the CCSS supposedly went about handling the new direct recruitment (CD--); and () the awarding of the contract by the CCSS to the Hospital UNIBE SA for  EBAIS, with the closure of nine EBAIS. On this occasion SINDEU also requested the UCR to guarantee the jobs of the  workers and to cancel the awarding of the contract for the  EBAIS located in the cantons of Curridabat, Montes de Oca and La Unin.
.As expressed in the report of the UCR, the strike movement was formed illegally and without justification. On  November , many workers stopped the provision of health-care services and only nine of the  EBAIS worked on that day. A number of UCR officials conducted an inspection into EBAIS that were not working and discovered that the facilities had been chained and locked up. Moreover, according to the official records of these events, the main entrances had been sealed and so action had to be taken to gain access to these locations.
.Subsequently, SINDEU and UCR representatives held a meeting on  November , in which the trade union agreed to call off the strike and for the workers to return to work at the various EBAIS, although the trade union failed to comply with the agreement.
.The Rector of the UCR states that the university endeavoured to act in a responsible manner at all times, respecting each of the agreements which it had made with the complainant trade union, and at no time restricted the union rights of the members of the SINDEU executive board or the special status which these rights entailed.
.In its resolution No. -, the Employment Tribunal of the Second Judicial Circuit of San Jos upheld the ruling that the strike was illegal and confirmed the judgement of the Labour Court of  November , which it had handed down in the EBAIS of Tirrases, Curridabat, Cipreses and Guayabos, Granadilla de Curridabat, San Rafael, Mercedes, Vargas Araya, Lourdes and San Pedro.
.Moreover, when the CCSS filed a request for an interim measure to compel the UCR to continue offering the services, the Administrative Disputes Tribunal handed down judgement No. --T of  March , declaring as follows:... It therefore appears at the very least unreasonable and even rash, in the view of this judge, that the Fund [CCSS] is seeking an interim measure to constrain the University of Costa Rica to continue offering an essential public service owned by the CCSS and not the university when it has known for at least one year of the university s intentions and financial reasons and also that it should insist on the service being provided by the UCR on terms and conditions that the CCSS deems fit, even though it is aware that the costs recorded by the university services are accurate and considerably higher and recognized as such by the CCSS. On the grounds of the effects on the health of the insured parties (...), it appears that the CCSS, in the view of this judge and based on an analysis of the evidence submitted, is aiming to constrain the UCR to provide a service on loss-making conditions, outside the framework of the agreements signed between the parties themselves, and despite recognizing that the costs are real, in an attempt to make up for its administrative inactivity over the course of at least one year and its failure to plan ahead, so as to guarantee the provision of health services which are the obligation of the CCSS and not of the UCR...
.The above shows that the institutional decision of the UCR was never intended to discriminate against the trade union representatives and that this was not a discriminatory dismissal on the basis of their status.
.In this context, since it was not a matter of reorganizing the PAIS programme ' in which case an assessment could have been made of which people to keep on and under which circumstances preference could have been given to the union leaders if possible ' the closure involved all staff.
.The trade union is therefore not correct in claiming breach of the protection afforded under trade union immunity to Mr Ricardo Peralta Rivera, Ms Ana Luca Sols Lpez and Ms Dania Snchez Rojas, who had been elected to the executive board of SINDEU (no longer in the PAIS programme), precisely because the dismissals did not represent a decision by the higher authorities of the UCR but occurred when the programme in question definitively closed, a situation which affected all workers, including those appointed as union leaders.
.Nevertheless, the fact that the officials in question were members of the SINDEU executive board was taken into consideration in the agreement made around the negotiating table between the UCR and SINDEU to call off the strike movement of the employees on the PAIS programme, and a provisional article was subsequently included enabling these officials to take part in various internal competitions under conditions identical to those of the other university officials and for a specific time period (from  February  to  February ).
.It should be clarified, however, that none of the university s higher administrative offices interfere in the internal competitions of the various sections, which select their own officials in accordance with the criteria set out in relevant regulations, or in the consideration of the suitability of the candidates being assessed.
.The above demonstrates the willingness of the university authorities to promote opportunities and reduce the harm that may have been caused to the officials in question, obviously within the limits of independence and impartiality which university offices must respect when recruiting staff for the university.
.Seen from this perspective, this case demonstrates the good faith of the university authorities and the efforts being made in the country to keep spaces of dialogue with the trade unions open and to ensure that, in their day-to-day activities, institutions keep in line with the provisions of the ILO international conventions ratified by Costa Rica.
.Based on the arguments of fact and law set out, the Government of Costa Rica requests the Committee on Freedom of Association to set aside the complaint lodged in all its aspects.
.The Committee observes that, in the present complaint, the complainant, SINDEU, claims that ILO Convention No. , ratified by Costa Rica, and the current collective agreement were violated through the dismissal of three members of its executive board, and that the PAIS programme in which the three worked as doctor, assistant nurse and pharmacy technician was terminated following successive renewals of an agreement between the university and the CCSS (which led to the PAIS health-care programme for various communities in the country). Although the three persons in question had the opportunity to enter competitions, they were unsuccessful, according to the complainant, because of the employer s lack of goodwill. The complainant trade union alleges that the employer procrastinated when the trade union requested consideration of the case.
.The Committee notes the Government s statements to the effect that: () the university discontinued the PAIS programme in February  and as a consequence of the final closure of the programme (and the termination of the agreement, between the university and the partner, the CCSS, which had initiated the programme), all the employees (including the three union leaders mentioned by the complainant trade union), had completed their activities and that, consequently, this does not constitute anti-union discrimination and the termination of the work of the three individuals in question was not occasioned by their status as leaders; () as the workers themselves were not responsible for this termination, the UCR went ahead and paid all appropriate compensation; () the complainant trade union was aware since  of the date on which the programme was ending; the extensions that were signed thereafter aimed to transfer the administrative services to the CCSS or to the body assigned by the university to carry out the recruitment; () the intention of the trade union leaders involved to join together, from the point of view of the employer s representative, is a way of making the university retain them in their posts despite the closure; () in response to the allegation of delays in the dialogue, the university indicates that, since the announcement of the final closure of the PAIS programme and until the handover was complete, it held regular meetings with SINDEU, as well as negotiations on the matter; the trade union nevertheless called a strike in  opposing the handover of the services, and this was declared illegal by the judicial authorities; () after the strike, the university respected each of the agreements which it had",-1,2014,Costa Rica
28,"made with the complainant trade union; and () the fact that the officials in question (the three union leaders) were members of the SINDEU executive board was taken into consideration in the agreement made around the negotiating table between the university and SINDEU to call off the strike movement, and a provisional article was subsequently included, enabling these officials to take part in various internal competitions under conditions identical to those of the other university officials and for a specific time period (from  February  to  February ); however, faced with the allegation of a lack of good will by the rector s office to resolve the problem through the competitions, the university states that its higher administrative offices do not interfere in the internal competitions of the various sections, which select their own officials in accordance with the criteria set out in relevant regulations.
.The Committee observes that, in the current case, the dismissal of the three union leaders of the complainant trade union was not motivated by their status as union leaders or their trade union activities, but observes that the complainant trade union also defends its application for the three leaders to be reinstated by invoking clause  of the current collective agreement which covers the immunity of the university union leaders.
.In this regard, the Committee observes that clause  of the current collective agreement (reproduced in the complainant s allegations) stipulates that members of the trade union s executive board may only be dismissed for reasons covered in article  of the Labour Code if proof is provided before the Industrial Relations Board and the Arbitration Tribunal, and that their immunity from dismissal protects them for up to one year after the day on which their trade union duties end. On these points, the Committee observes that the Government did not communicate that this procedure has been followed in the present case or how long the immunity lasts. In light of the above, the Committee requests the Government to ensure that the provisions contained in the collective agreement and the November  agreement are fully respected.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee requests the Government to ensure that the collective agreement and the November  agreement are fully respected.",-1,2014,Costa Rica
29,".The Committee last examined this case at its March  meeting [see st Report, paras ' ]. The Committee recalls that on that occasion it asked the Government: (i) to send its observations on the allegation that disciplinary proceedings had been instituted against thousands of union members who had participated in the national congress of the Secondary School Teachers' Association (APSE) and had only provided proof of their attendance in the form of a record containing signatures that were scanned; and (ii) to keep the Committee informed of any decision taken in that regard.
.In a communication dated  March , the Government indicates that the Ministry of Public Education informed the trade union organization representatives in good time of the requirements that needed to be fulfilled by officials attending the trade union congress who wished to take paid leave. The Government indicates that attendance at the congress was authorized subject to the condition that the officials submitted the original proof of attendance provided by the APSE during the week following the event. The Government alleges that the failure to fulfil this requirement was what gave rise to the disciplinary proceedings and that the suspension without pay applied in only  cases, emphasizing that it guaranteed due process and the right to a defence in all the proceedings. The Government explains that it never had the intention of prohibiting the participation of union members in the congress but that it was a question of ensuring compliance with the obligation to prove attendance at the APSE national congress by means of a valid formal instrument.
.The Committee notes this information and will not pursue its examination of the case.
.The complaint is contained in a communication of the Asociacin de Profesores de Segunda Enseanza (APSE), dated  October .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  August .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In a communication dated  October , the APSE alleges that the Government, in particular the Ministry of Public Education, has refused to undertake dialogue and regular consultations with teachers' trade union organizations, grouped together in  Teachers in Action'  especially the APSE, and has refused to meet these organizations. The complainant attributes this attitude to its denunciation of assumed irregularities committed by the public education authorities and the call for the Minister s resignation.
.Furthermore, the complainant points out that, in accordance with the Act on Associations and its own statutes, the APSE issued invitations to an annual national congress on ,  and  August . In this regard, it states that, on  June , the public education authorities authorized the participation of the complainant s members in the th National Congress. The members provided proof of their attendance at the event in question to their immediate supervisors, and within the prescribed timeframe, by means of a supporting document issued by the complainant; the APSE states that, for practical purposes, in view of the very large number of participants, it provided proof with the scanned signature of the Secretary-General and the organization s official seal. As of  October , the Department of Human Resources of the Ministry of Public Education objected to the presentation of scanned signatures and began to notify a large number of members who had attended the Congress that disciplinary proceedings had been initiated against them, as they had not provided proof of their attendance at the th Congress in the form of an original participation certificate.
.In its communication of  August , the Government rejects the claim that anti-union acts have been committed and states that the APSE is not a trade union, nor is it registered as such or have the functions of a union, but it is rather an association of persons entered in the Register of Associations; the Government therefore requests the Committee to assess whether, within the framework of the proceedings, this association is actually legitimate and has the capacity to present complaints to the Committee.
.The Government states that at no time has the Ministry of Public Education restricted or limited union rights and also that it has even signed the first collective agreement with the two main trade unions in the education sector, which will benefit more than , employees.
.The Government adds that the APSE is part, although not as a trade union, of the analysis and discussion forum known as  Teachers in Action' and it is not certain either that the Ministry in question has an obstructive attitude towards  Teachers in Action' or against the APSE, or that it refused meetings or appointments requested by the APSE; by contrast, it responded to all the communications from this association, in particular to those where  paid leave' is requested so that its members may participate in ordinary general assemblies (the Government attaches the corresponding documents). The Government specifies, however, that officials who attend the assemblies must submit to their supervisors the original proof of attendance provided by the APSE, for which reason a document submitted with the scanned signature does not meet this requirement, the aim of this requirement being to avoid abuses.
.The Committee notes that the Government states that the complainant association is not a trade union organization and requests the Committee to examine whether it has the capacity to present complaints.
.The Committee observes that, although the APSE is not included in the Register of Associations, it does participate in social dialogue forums in the education sector and obtains permission from the authorities for its members to participate in general assemblies.
.The Committee notes that this case refers to allegations of: () the refusal to meet the APSE representatives and to launch a social dialogue, owing to public denunciations by the trade union of significant irregularities on the part of the public education authorities; and () the institution of disciplinary proceedings against thousands of members who participated in the trade union congress and who provided proof of their attendance only in the form of a record on which the signature was scanned.
.The Committee takes note of the Government s observations denying the refusal to meet or to conduct a dialogue with representatives of the APSE and that it submits proof in this regard. The Committee notes that the requirement of proof of participation of members in the APSE congress in the form of original proof of attendance provided by the APSE (whereby a scanned signature is not sufficient) is justified by the Government on the basis that paid leave is granted to such employees and for the purpose of avoiding abuses.
.As regards the alleged institution of disciplinary proceedings against the APSE members, whose attendance at the annual trade union congress was authorized by the authorities and proven by the complainant with scanned signatures, but not with handwritten signatures (as asserted by the Government), the Committee notes that the Government has not responded to this allegation and that, by contrast, the complainant has enclosed a request by the Administrative Vice-Minister of the Ministry of Education of  September , for the institution of disciplinary proceedings against numerous officials identified by name. The Committee requests the Government to respond to these allegations and to keep it informed of any decision taken.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee requests the Government to submit its observations on the allegations referring to the institution of disciplinary proceedings against numerous officials relating to the proof of their attendance at the th APSE National Congress and to keep it informed of any decision taken in that regard.",1,2012,Costa Rica
30,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the National Union of Professional Traffic Technicians (UNATEPROT) dated  July .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  June .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  July , the UNATEPROT alleges that, in the context of negotiation of a collective agreement for traffic police, on  May  two officials of the Traffic Unit of the Judicial Investigation Department illegally detained Mr Joselito Urea Vargas, General Secretary of UNATEPROT, in his office, without showing an arrest warrant or informing him of the charges against him, following a complaint filed against him for allegedly threatening a young person. The complainant states that the union official had already gone to the Public Prosecutor s Office to give an account of the facts, and that the judicial authority had issued a restraining order to stay away from the Canton of Desamparados. He was detained in the presence of press and television reporters, who reported on the following day that the union official had been detained for threatening a witness and tampering with the scene of an accident in which a -year-old man died.
.In its communication dated  June , the Government cites the report from the Office of the Prosecutor General of the Attorney-General s Office on the events referred to in the complaint, from which it appears that: () the charges against the traffic officer and trade union official Mr Joselito Urea Vargas stem from a complaint filed by individuals accusing him of the offences of tampering with evidence, abuse of authority and dereliction of duty in responding to a traffic accident in his capacity as a public servant (following manslaughter committed by another person); () Mr Joselito Urea Vargas s trade union office has no bearing whatsoever on the criminal investigation under way; () the fact that Mr Joselito Urea Vargas threatened several witnesses (including minors), and even drove his car up to one of them in order to intimidate him, was corroborated; () Mr Joselito Urea Vargas s detention on the order of the Attorney-General s Office was based on the urgent need to bring him before the competent judge in order to safeguard the outcome of the investigation. This necessary intervention was not in violation of the union s property; and () the judicial authority rejected the prosecutor s request for preventive custody, but ordered precautionary measures (barring him from the Canton of Desamparados, following evidence that the accused had committed the offence under investigation and that there was a risk of obstruction of justice).
.The Committee notes that, in this complaint, the complainant alleges the illegal detention, without showing an arrest warrant, of a union official and traffic police officer, in his office at the trade union headquarters, as well as criminal prosecution against him, in the context of an ongoing collective bargaining process.
.The Committee notes that the Government denies the anti-union nature of the union official s arrest and states that it took place following a complaint filed by individuals and at the request of the Attorney-General s Office, and the arrest was not upheld by the judicial authority, which, however, instituted criminal proceedings and ordered provisional measures against him. The Committee observes that the report from the Attorney-General s Office forwarded by the Government (and provided by the complainant) clearly indicates that the allegations refer to possible criminal misconduct by a traffic officer in his capacity as a public servant (tampering with a crime scene, threats, etc., following manslaughter committed by another person, who was driving a motorcycle).
.In these circumstances, the Committee concludes that this case does not raise the issues of freedom of association and considers that it does not call for further examination.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.",0,2011,Costa Rica
31,".In the previous examination of the case at its meeting in June , the Committee requested the Government to inform it of the outcome of the administrative inquiry being conducted in the Dr Carlos Durn Martn Clinic concerning alleged restrictions on communication between trade union leaders and workers [see nd Report, para. ].
.In its communication dated  October , the Government submitted the report by the medical officials of the Costa Rican Social Security Fund, indicating that a preliminary inquiry had been conducted to determine whether the alleged facts were true. The Social Security Fund stated that the commission of inquiry set up for this purpose concluded, on  August , that there was insufficient information to launch administrative proceedings, since there was no proof of the existence of anti-union practices, nor of errors committed by the officials involved in the facts. On that basis: (i) the South Central Regional Health Services Department dismissed the union complaint on  September ; (ii) on  November  the appeal to reverse judgment lodged by the complainant was rejected; (iii) on  December , the appeal filed by the complainant was declared irreceivable; and (iv) on  December , the South Central Regional Health Services Department closed the case.
.In several communications sent between  October  and  March , the Government reports that, after it was established that Sintralaydo had the majority needed to engage in collective bargaining, a bargaining process was initiated which concluded on  March  with the signature of a collective agreement. The Government further indicates that the disputes between the food company and Sintralaydo are a thing of the past and that the relations between the enterprise and the trade union are very good.
.The Committee examined this case at its March  meeting and submitted an interim report to the Governing Body [see th Report, paras ' , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (March )].
.The Government sent new observations in communications dated  October  and  March .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Workers' Representatives Convention,  (No. ).
.In its previous examination of the case in March , the Committee made the following recommendations on the issues that remained pending [see th Report, para. ]:The Committee notes the allegations of the complainant organization regarding restrictions on communication between trade union leaders and workers at the Dr Carlos Durn Martn clinic and, in particular, the intervention of private security officers to remove four UNDECA leaders and two delegates from the clinic. The Committee notes that the complainant also reports that, on  June , the Director-General of the San Francisco de Ass Hospital ordered disciplinary proceedings to be brought against union delegate Ms Maria Luz Alfaro Barrantes in relation to her participation in a demonstration against the cost-cutting measures applied by the hospital. The Committee observes that these allegations were submitted in subsequent communications to the first complaint, notes that the Government indicates that a reply is being prepared and hopes that this will be submitted without delay.
.In its communications dated  October  and  March , the Government states in relation to the allegations concerning Ms Mara Luz Alfaro Barrantes that an administrative proceeding was commenced against her in conformity with due process in connection with certain violent acts (entering the San Francisco de Ass Hospital by force, and chaining the doors of the administrative offices and the office of the Directorate-General in order to prevent officials and the Director-General from entering). The action was led by Ms Alfaro Barrantes, and disrupted the hospital s normal activity and caused indiscipline and disorder. The Government denies having restricted the union leader s trade union rights, and adds in connection with the administrative proceeding brought against her, that Ms Alfaro Barrantes pled the statute of limitations and the case was closed on  August .
.The Government also states that it rejects the complainants' allegations that communication was restricted between four union leaders and two delegates and the workers of the Dr Carlos Durn Martn Clinic. The Government states that their trade union rights were not restricted; instead, trade union organizations and associations were urged to comply with the provisions of Title VII of the Labour Relations Regulation in the discharge of their duties, with a view to preventing any deficiencies in patient care and services. The clinic s authorities receive regular visits from union representatives in the sector, but the National Union of Social Security Fund Employees (UNDECA) (the complainant in this case) is the only trade union organization which does not comply with the procedure established in the Labour Relations Regulation, of which it is fully aware in view of the fact that the organization participated in the drafting, negotiation and approval of those provisions. Moreover, it is worth noting that UNDECA secretaries filed a complaint on the same subject as the complaint presented to the Committee. As a result, a preliminary inquiry was ordered and assigned to Dr Armando Villalobos Castaeda, who is currently performing these proceedings.
.The Government adds that the San Francisco de Ass Hospital has endeavoured to create regulations which guarantee access to medical centres, and to establish clear forms of communication with both union members and non-members; the right to hold meetings; leave to attend assemblies and the means of requesting such leave. The trade union organizations are fully aware of these measures and cannot attempt to circumvent them in actions such as those which have given rise to the present communication. The Government states that the complainant organizations have not submitted complaints to the national authorities on this subject.
.Lastly, the Government rejects all of the outstanding allegations, arguing that they are incorrect and lacking any legal basis.
.Regarding the alleged expulsion of four union leaders and two delegates of UNDECA from the Dr Carlos Durn Martn Clinic in connection with communication activities with union members, the Committee notes that the Government rejects the allegations and states that: () the UNDECA representatives were in breach of the Labour Relations Regulation, which was negotiated with the organization s participation; and () that UNDECA has filed an administrative complaint which is under examination. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the outcome of the administrative inquiry resulting from UNDECA s complaint.
.Regarding the allegations pertaining to the administrative proceeding brought against trade union delegate Ms Mara Luz Alfaro Barrantes in relation to her participation in a demonstration against the cost-cutting measures applied by the San Francisco de Ass Hospital, the Committee notes that the Government states that: () her union rights have not been restricted and that an administrative proceeding was brought against her in conformity with due process in connection with certain violent acts (entering the San Francisco de Ass Hospital by force, chaining the doors of the administrative offices and the office of the Directorate-General in order to prevent officials and the Director-General from entering); () that action was led by Ms Alfaro Barrantes and that it disrupted the normal activity of the hospital and caused indiscipline and disorder; and () in the administrative proceeding brought against Ms Alfaro Barrantes, she pled the statute of limitations and the case was closed on  August . Under such circumstances, the Committee will not pursue its examination of this allegation.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the outcome of the administrative inquiry being conducted in the Dr Carlos Durn Martn Clinic as a result of a complaint filed by UNDECA alleging restrictions on communication between trade union leaders and workers.
.The complaint is contained in communications from the National Union of Social Security Fund Employees (UNDECA) dated  February and  May . This organization submitted additional information and new allegations in communications dated  and  July . The World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) supported the complaint in communications dated  and  March .
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  October and  November .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communications dated  February and  May , UNDECA reports that in November , an occupational group of anaesthetists, who work for the Costa Rican Social Security (CCSS) Fund, went on strike. The general aim of this strike was to obtain certain occupational health benefits and better physical working conditions, which would also bring about a substantial improvement in the services provided. They had no alternative but to resort to strike action given the refusal by the CCSS Fund to engage in negotiations on their justified demands. UNDECA adds that two users, to whom attention could not be given, filed amparo proceedings against the",0,2012,Costa Rica
32,"authorities of two centres (Mxico Hospital and San Vicente De Pal Hospital); these proceedings were upheld by the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court under Ruling Nos - and - of  December , although the unions concerned were not allowed to take part in the proceedings; moreover, the Constitutional Chamber overstepped its powers by prohibiting the right to strike in essential services, and in hospital services in particular.
.UNDECA indicates that the first ruling established the following:In witness whereof, the proceeding is upheld. Donald Fernndez Morales, as acting Director-General of Mexico Hospital, or whoever occupies the position in his place, is ordered to make the arrangements within his powers to ensure that the plaintiff is admitted into hospital for the surgical treatment of the diagnosed papillary carcinoma within thirty days of the notification of this ruling, under the full responsibility of the treating doctor. The authority in question is warned that, under article  of the Constitutional Jurisdiction Act, persons that fail to comply or ensure compliance with a mandatory order handed down in amparo proceedings are liable to imprisonment for three months to two years, or to a fine of twenty to sixty days, provided that the offence is not subject to a higher sanction. The Costa Rican Social Security Fund is ordered to pay the costs and damages caused by the events in question, to be settled in accordance with the administrative ruling. This ruling is to be communicated in person to Donald Fernndez Morales, as acting Director-General of Mxico Hospital, or to whoever occupies that office in his place.
.UNDECA adds that the second ruling, No. -, handed down a similar sentence to the CCSS Fund, with the same notification orders. One judge dissented, disallowing the amparo proceedings on the grounds that the right to strike in hospital services should not be prohibited through that channel, particularly in view of the lack of legislation on labour dispute resolution.
.Alongside these rulings, the Justice Department Press Office published the following Constitutional Chamber press release:Under Ruling Nos - of . and - of ., of  December , the Constitutional Chamber stressed that while the right to strike is a direct consequence of the exercise of freedom of association, article  of the Constitution states that the right to strike is subject to limitations in public services, which are to be determined by law. Consequently, article , paragraph (d) prohibits strike action in public services that cause serious or immediate prejudice to health, as in the case of clinics and hospitals. Likewise, the Committee on Freedom of Association and experts of the ILO have indicated that strike action may be prohibited in essential public services, in other words, in those services whose interruption would endanger the life, personal safety or health of the population. These criteria were endorsed by a majority in the Chamber, receiving the votes of judges Mr Ginesta Lobo, Mr Cruz Castro, Mr Castillo Vquez, Mr Rueda Leal and Mr Salazar Cambronera, who considered that strike action is prohibited in hospital services, as an essential public service and in view of the protection of the constitutional rights to health and life of the population. In addition, the Chamber indicated that public sector conciliation, arbitration and direct bargaining procedures cannot be governed by common labour laws and regulations, which vary significantly from the public employment system, where the flexibility of principles such as free will and minimum rights does not apply, where the administration is subject to a whole block of regulations and where decisions based on conscience or juries without legal training are not admissible. Breaching this gap through legislative development is not incumbent upon the Constitutional Chamber but on the legislative branch, under the principle that the constitutional judge should not be judge and party to the same cause. Currently, the Legislative Assembly is discussing a draft labour procedure reform aiming to regulate this matter.
.The press release adds:Nevertheless, until this time, the parties to the dispute, the Costa Rican Social Security Fund and public servants, must attempt to resolve their labour disputes in a way that does not disrupt the continuity of hospital services, which are essential, since their suspension violates fundamental constitutional rights of the highest order, relating to the preservation of that which is most important to humans: life and health. In the cases examined, as a result of the anaesthetists' strike, the treatment of the two plaintiffs, who suffer from cancer, was suspended and they were not admitted into hospital or operated on on the previously scheduled dates. One judge endorses the majority vote on the grounds that the plaintiffs' right to health was violated, but she has not made any statement on the legality of strike action in essential public services arguing that this is not the appropriate channel for a ruling on strike action in essential services. One judge dissented, disallowing the amparo proceedings on the grounds that a sentence resulting from amparo proceedings cannot prohibit the right to strike in hospital services, in particular, and as recognized in the resolution, since the legal regulations on alternative means to resolve labour disputes, like this one, are insufficient. Another judge filed an observation.
.UNDECA indicates that, on the basis of both rulings, the individual amparo proceedings filed by the patients were upheld and, at the same time, a majority vote in the Constitutional Chamber prohibited strike action in essential services and in particular in hospital services.
.UNDECA provides a number of arguments concluding that the Constitutional Chamber has adopted an interpretation that runs counter to the Constitution and to ILO Conventions in particular, considering that there is still no legislation on public sector dispute resolution mechanisms, whereby public servants do not have the right to collective bargaining.
.Regarding the rulings by the Constitutional Chamber, UNDECA indicates that amparo proceedings are not the appropriate channel for the prohibition of strike action, especially where public servants have in the past been banned from using voluntary collective labour dispute resolution mechanisms, including direct bargaining. Under the rules in force, amparo proceedings are intended to protect fundamental rights in the case of any act, provision, agreement, resolution, omission or material act that threatens or violates fundamental rights, except for those protected under habeas corpus. The Constitutional Chamber itself has described it as a  highly summary' informal process, strictly aimed at determining whether specific and subjective actions, generally ordered by the administration, have violated any fundamental human right. Amparo proceedings are not an appropriate means of challenging the constitutional nature of laws or legislative provisions, which is an area that is covered by proceedings on the grounds of unconstitutionality (a distinction that has not been observed in this case). Neither is this type of action appropriate for matters of general legality, and the Chamber cannot determine which regulations are applied to a specific case. The scope of amparo proceedings is limited to determining, on a case-by-case basis, whether a given act or omission has violated a fundamental right.
.The rulings by the Constitutional Chamber, which arbitrarily prohibited the right to strike in essential and hospital services, run counter to article  of the Constitution, article , paragraph (d), of the Labour Code and are in clear violation of ILO Convention No. .
.UNDECA considers that there is no justification, especially in a democratic system, for sacrificing the right to strike of workers providing hospital services, if it is reasonably possible to preserve that right, albeit with some restriction, without undermining the protection of the fundamental rights to health and life, which are fundamental rights and values protected by the Constitution, but which enjoy the same constitutional recognition as the right to strike. An appropriate solution to the conflict of these interests, which are both protected by the Constitution, is reasonably possible without abolishing the right to strike of public servants providing essential services, through the use of minimum services, which the Constitutional Chamber has unfortunately ignored or rejected in the rulings that are challenged here, and which is consistent with the principles of the ILO.
.UNDECA adds that the ruling indicates that the Constitutional Chamber cannot turn a blind eye to the fact that the Committee on Freedom of Association has indicated that the prohibition of strikes in public services must be accompanied by the appropriate guarantees to compensate workers for the restrictions to which they are subject. These guarantees include access to appropriate, impartial and rapid conciliation and arbitration proceedings, in which the interested party may participate at every stage (in a previous ruling (Ruling No. -) the Constitutional Court declared that public servants do not have the right to conduct economically or socially motivated collective dispute resolution proceedings).
.UNDECA adds that following a protest march on  June  organized by the trade unions under the Internal Fund Workers Front (FIT-CAJA), which UNDECA is a part of, which was aimed at defending the institution, the administrative and medical directors of the Costa Rican Social Protection Fund respectively notified workers, in a communication of  June , that immediate salary deductions would be",-1,2012,Costa Rica
33,"carried out in respect of workers participating in strike action or work stoppages, and indicated the procedure that heads of department should follow to make such deductions. This communication authorizes immediate deductions to workers' wages with utter disregard for due process and strike action being previously declared an illegality (contrary to the jurisprudence of the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court regarding the private sector).
.In its communications dated  and  July , UNDECA reports that on the instructions of the Director of the Dr Carlos Durn Martn clinic, an outlying clinic of the CCSS Fund, communication between UNDECA and workers is being restricted, only allowing them to receive flyers and trade union information and banning any other type of contact or communication, with express orders banning the representatives of the complainant organization from talking to the workers. In particular, on two occasions on  and  June , the leaders of UNDECA, Ms Elizabeth Centeno Cascante, Ms Marlen Pena Ortega, Mr Arturo Abarca Durn, Mr Roland Quesada and delegates Ms Guadalupe Murillo Gonzlez and Ms Cinthya Bermdez Rivera, were removed from the clinic by private security officers. It should be noted that these union members have never tried to enter restricted access areas or to disrupt the normal functioning of public services, making the management s instructions seem arbitrary.
.In other workplaces of the CCSS Fund, not only are trade union activities banned, but acts of anti-union persecution are carried out against delegates of various trade union organizations, including UNDECA. In the San Francisco de Ass Hospital, a regional hospital in the city of Grecia, which has unfortunately suffered the full force of the cost-cutting measures imposed by the Board of Directors of the CCSS Fund, UNDECA has played a crucial role in trying to obtain the best possible conditions, with a view to preventing further deterioration in the public services provided. This has not pleased the hospital s Director-General, who in an act of retaliation against legitimate activities, on  June , ordered disciplinary proceedings to be filed against Ms Mara Luz Alfaro Berrantes, UNDECA delegate in that hospital: ' .. for the acts reported to this General Directorate, that were carried out on Monday th May , during a demonstration organized by a group of neighbourhood women from the Grecia community against the cost saving measures applied by this General Directorate, with the participation of public servant Ms Mara Luz Alfaro Barrantes, who is a patient care assistant, as trade union representative.' ,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:
.These proceedings were brought against the delegate in question because she participated in a march organized by community women to oppose the cost-cutting measures that have brought the hospital to the verge of collapse.
.In its communications of  October and  November , the Government refers to the allegations of UNDECA, supported by the WFTU, according to which two Constitutional Chamber rulings on amparo proceedings, filed as a result of the strike carried out by a group of anaesthetists on  November , run counter to ILO Convention No. , in that they arbitrarily restrict the right to strike in essential services, such as hospitals and other health services, and cast doubt as to the regulation of collective bargaining in the public sector. In this regard, the Government indicates that the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice is legally competent to rule on the constitutionality of other regulations and to interpret any matter brought before it in the light of the Constitution, which makes its decisions binding and valid erga omnes, excepting itself.
.The Government indicates that the two matters submitted to the Constitutional Chamber and raised in this complaint were filed by users of the CCSS Fund, who apparently considered that their right to access health services had been violated by the paralysis of the medical services, as a result of a strike by a group of anaesthetists on  November . On that occasion, the Supreme Court upheld the amparo proceedings on the grounds that they protected the constitutional rights to life and health of the persons affected. These rights are non-disposable and cannot be considered to be either economic or waivable rights under article  of the Constitutional Jurisdiction Act. Consequently, the right to life, recognized under article  of the Constitution, provides the basis for all the other fundamental rights of the inhabitants of the Republic. This same article provides the basis for the right to health, since life is inconceivable if humans are not guaranteed the minimum conditions for an adequate and harmonious psychological, physical and environmental balance. In this way, any delay in hospitals, clinics and other health care units of the CCSS Fund could have a negative impact on the preservation of the health and life of its users.
.With regard to the limitations to the right to strike in health services, the Government indicates that in the preamble of Ruling Nos  and  of , on the amparo proceedings that are challenged by the complainant, the Constitutional Chamber established that the restriction of the exercise of the right to strike in hospital services is constitutional, in accordance with the doctrine advocated by the supervisory bodies of the ILO.
.In these circumstances, the Constitutional Chamber interpreted in the abovementioned rulings sections  and  of the Labour Code in the light of article  of the Constitution, which expressly prohibits the exercise of the right to strike in public services, to be determined by law.
.Furthermore, according to the Supreme Court of Justice, in its Report No. Ref. - of  August , a copy of which is attached, the rulings in question include, in the definition of  public services'  the doctrine advocated by the supervisory bodies of the ILO, establishing that:  essential public services in the hospital sector are understood as those services that if interrupted prevent individuals from accessing health services, in such a way as to endanger legally protected rights, which on a scale of values of human rights in international law and in the Constitution of Costa Rica, occupy a position of supremacy, as is the case of the right to health, to life and personal security' 
.Likewise, the ILO s Committee on Freedom of Association has, on a number of occasions, expressed its opinion that hospital services are an essential service. According to the principles that this supervisory body has developed to determine situations in which a strike could be prohibited, the criterion that has to be established is the existence of a clear and impending threat to the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population. In any event, the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), establishes that the plan of action of workers' organizations must respect the law, whereby it would be a reasonable restriction to limit the exercise of the right to strike in those services the interruption of which would endanger the health and life of the population. This concurs with what happened as a result of the doctors' strike mentioned in this complaint, which clearly caused delays in various surgical procedures, seriously violating key fundamental rights of the population. In this light, according to Report No. PR-.- of the Governing Board of the CCSS Fund, the strike in question lasted for  days and led to the suspension of previously planned surgery in the case of , insured patients, as well as generating an average cost for the institution of ,, colons (CRC) a day.
.The Constitutional Chamber has interpreted the restriction in the exercise of the right to strike in public services to imply that the workers' right to defend their interests through strike action must give way when this causes or could cause greater damages than those reported by the strikers in their grievances or demands.
.An example of the above is Ruling No. - issued at . a.m. on  February , whereby the Constitutional Chamber recognized the convergence between the notion of public services under article  of the Constitution and the notion of essential services. In this regard, it stated:It should be recalled that, in the light of the Constitution, there is a difference between freedom of association, understood as the right to form and join trade unions, which applies equally to public servants with both an administrative or statutory relationship with the public services ' and to other workers in an employment relationship '  and the right to strike, which is the extreme expression of trade union activity, and which applies with greater limitations, with a view to maintaining essential community services. Restrictions to the right to strike, as an extreme means of applying pressure to achieve trade union aims, should therefore be nothing more than conditions to prevent the disruption of public services, considered to be essential and which the legislator is competent to identify within reason and proportionality.
.This interpretation is based on articles  and  of the Constitution, which establish a public employment system that",-1,2012,Costa Rica
34,"differs in both its nature and characteristics from the system established by common labour law. The general principles pertaining to this employment system, which are not only different from those found in labour law, but can even run counter to these, have distinct consequences.
.In the abovementioned Ruling No. -, the Constitutional Chamber further argues that the right to strike cannot be seen as an absolute right, as indicated in the following extract:... the right to strike is an indispensable corollary of the right to organize protected by ILO Convention No. . The right to strike cannot be considered to be an absolute right; strike action may be subject to a general ban, not only in exceptional circumstances, but it may also be regulated through provisions that impose modalities in the exercise of that fundamental right or restrictions to its exercise. Strikes are considered as the last resort for workers' organizations in pursuing their labour grievances ' In other words, the right to strike is a right for all workers that may be exercised in any sector, but the legislator must determine the cases in which it must not be exercised, as in the case of public services that, due to their nature and social impact, cannot be suspended, discontinued or paralysed without causing large scale serious and immediate damage.
.Consequently, the allegations presented by the trade union organization in its complaint have no basis in law, since the challenged rulings are in keeping with the Constitution, which indicates that the right to strike is not unlimited, but may be restricted in the case of essential services, when they affect essential legal rights such as the population s right to life and health. This position is endorsed in a number of decisions of the supervisory bodies of the ILO.
.Lastly, the Government states that the allegation by the trade union of a ban on collective bargaining in the public sector is both rash and inaccurate; it underlines that the Fund signed an agreement with two trade unions on the wage issue, which provides that the parties will abide by the decision of the labour court. The Government adds that, as the supervisory bodies of the ILO are aware, the right to collective bargaining in positive law in Costa Rica and in national practice, in addition to being an outstanding collective instrument, benefits from a higher level of protection due to its constitutional status. This collective instrument aims to regulate labour conditions and to determine the competence of trade unions to represent workers in negotiating these. In the public sector, collective bargaining is open to all public servants, except for those participating in public management with executive power, in accordance with article  of the regulations for the negotiation of collective agreements in the public sector. Evidence of the above is that there are currently  collective agreements in force in the public sector according to the dedicated register kept by the Department of Labour Relations of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security.
.In the light of the arguments of fact and law set forth above, the Government requests the Committee to reject this complaint in full.
.The Committee observes that in this complaint the complainant organization, supported by the WFTU, alleges that: () as a result of a strike to demand improved conditions of employment carried out in November  by an occupational group of anaesthetists of the CCSS Fund, following the Fund s refusal to discuss the grievances of these doctors, two patients filed amparo proceedings before the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court against the two hospitals concerned; and () the Constitutional Chamber upheld these proceedings, ordering the Fund (employer) to pay damages and arbitrarily banning, without the consultation of the trade unions, strike action in essential services and hospital services in particular, ignoring that the appropriate solution in line with the principles of the ILO would be to recognize the right to strike while demanding the maintenance of minimum services. The complainant organization further criticizes the interpretation of various constitutional and legal regulations regarding the scope of the rulings of the Constitutional Chamber in cases of amparo proceedings, considering that the Constitutional Chamber has not observed these. In this regard, the Committee would like to recall that it is not responsible for assessing the compliance of judicial rules or decisions with a national Constitution.
.The Committee observes that the complainant organization declares that public servants do not have the right to collective bargaining and that there is currently no regulation of dispute resolution procedures for public servants, in particular conciliation and arbitration proceedings. Lastly, the complainant organization reports that, as a result of a protest march organized by the complainant organization and other trade unions in June , the management of the Fund issued a communication ordering deductions to be made from the wages of workers participating in strike action or work stoppages, regardless of whether the strike had previously been declared illegal.
.The Committee notes the Government s statements to the effect that the rulings by the Constitutional Chamber on the amparo proceedings challenged by the complainant organization were issued in accordance with the mandate of that body and are in keeping with the Constitution and the principles of the Committee and of other ILO supervisory bodies, allowing significant restrictions to or even the prohibition of the right to strike in the health sector. The Committee notes that the Government challenges, on the basis of various sentences by the Supreme Court, the complainant s interpretation of the right to strike in the legislation and in the Constitution, and highlights that the Court indicates that the right to strike is not absolute or unlimited, but that it can be limited in essential services in cases affecting fundamental rights such as the right to life and health of the population and that the restriction of the right to strike in the hospital sector is constitutional. The Committee also notes the Government s statements regarding the consequences of the strike (suspension of surgery for , insured patients, extremely high costs, etc.).
.With regard to the allegations of the non-existence of collective bargaining and the prohibition of the right to strike for public servants, including those in the health sector, under the rulings of the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court, the Committee recalls that it has on many occasions stressed that this right may be restricted or prohibited in the public service only for public servants exercising authority in the name of the State, or in essential services in the strict sense of the term (that is, services the interruption of which would endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population) [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ]. However, the Committee also highlighted that  in cases where restrictions are placed on the right to strike in essential services and the public service, restrictions on the right to strike should be accompanied by adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration proceedings in which the parties concerned can take part at every stage and in which the awards, once made, are fully and promptly implemented' [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. The Committee notes that the Government states that, contrary to the information submitted in the complaint, public servants are entitled to engage in collective bargaining (except for those involved in public administration with executive powers) and points to  collective agreements in the public sector. The Committee observes that both itself and the Committee of Experts have taken note of the applicable national rules and regulations and have found that this right exists.
.The Committee observes, however, that according to this complaint and the rulings mentioned in this case, the development of legislation on dispute resolution mechanisms in the public sector is still pending, and considering the principle indicated in the previous paragraph, it invites the Government, in consultation with the most representative organizations of workers and employers, to present a draft text to the Legislative Assembly.
.With regard to the wage issue, the Committee notes that the Government provides a copy of an agreement between the Fund and two trade unions which includes a provision to the effect that the parties would abide by the decision of the labour court. Lastly, with regard to the communication on the salary deductions in respect of public servants that participate in strikes or demonstrations, the Committee observes that the Government has not replied to this allegation. However, the Committee recalls the principle that  salary deductions for days of strike give rise to no objection from the point of view of freedom of association principles' [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. This principle on salary deductions also applies to time spent in demonstrations during working hours.
.The Committee also notes the allegations made by the complainant regarding the restrictions imposed on communication between trade union leaders and workers at the Dr Carlos Durn Martn clinic and, in particular, the intervention of private security",-1,2012,Costa Rica
35,"to remove four UNDECA leaders and two delegates from the clinic. The Committee notes that the complainant also reports that, on  June , the Director-General of the San Francisco de Ass Hospital ordered that disciplinary proceedings be brought against trade union delegate Ms Maria Luz Alfaro Barrantes in relation to her participation in a demonstration against the cost-cutting measures applied by the hospital. The Committee observes that these allegations were submitted in subsequent communications to the initial complaint, and notes that the Government has indicated that it is preparing its reply and hopes that this will be submitted without delay.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee invites the Government, in consultation with the most representative organizations of workers and employers, to submit a draft text to the Legislative Assembly regarding dispute resolution mechanisms in the public administration.(b)	The Committee notes the allegations of the complainant organization regarding restrictions on communication between trade union leaders and workers at the Dr Carlos Durn Martn clinic and, in particular, the intervention of private security officers to remove four UNDECA leaders and two delegates from the clinic. The Committee notes that the complainant also reports that, on  June , the Director-General of the San Francisco de Ass Hospital ordered disciplinary proceedings to be brought against union delegate Ms Maria Luz Alfaro Barrantes in relation to her participation in a demonstration against the cost-cutting measures applied by the hospital. The Committee observes that these allegations were submitted in subsequent communications to the first complaint, notes that the Government indicates that a reply is being prepared and hopes that this will be submitted without delay.",-1,2012,Costa Rica
36,".The complaint was presented in communications from the Confederation of Workers Rerum Novarum (CCTD-RN), the Federation of Financial, Banking and Insurance Workers of Costa Rica (FEBAS) and the Union of Employees of the National Bank of Costa Rica (SEBANA) dated  May .
.Of the Government sent its observations in communications dated  January,  April and  December  and  February .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communication of  May  the CCTD-RN and the FEBAS allege that the FEBAS Congress met on  December  with the fundamental objective of reactivating the organization to defend the rights of workers in the sector. However, although it met all the requirements set out in the Labour Code for its reactivation and submitted all the requisite documents to the Department of Social Organizations of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, between  December  and  May  (the date of the complaint), the Department failed to accept the request for the Federation s reactivation, approve its by-laws or grant it legal personality, thereby restricting the its ability to engage in trade union action and in collective bargaining. Through the Department of Social Organizations, the Ministry of Labour has resorted to a series of delaying tactics to delay registration (imposition of new requirements months after the request was submitted, requests for corrections in matters of form).
.According to the complainants, the refusal to register the Federation is a violation of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and an act of interference in the life of banking unions designed to prevent wide ranging negotiations in Costa Rica s banking sector. It can also be seen as an indication of working conditions in the country s private banking sector. The complainants therefore request the Committee on Freedom of Association to guarantee the Federation s immediate right to be granted legal personality.
.The complainants also allege that on  July  the Union of Employees of the National Bank of Costa Rica (SEBANA) and the National Bank of Costa Rica denounced the collective labour agreement that was due to end that year and that negotiations, which began on  August  by unilateral decision of the bank, were held up by a series of proposals and measures by the bank and have been at a standstill since February .
.There is a Government policy to replace collective bargaining by  service and employment regulations' issued unilaterally by the institutional authorities, even though this is not backed by any legislation; like other banks, the National Bank is trying to impose service regulations in place of a collective agreement. Another obstacle to collective bargaining is the absence of legal machinery to resolve collective disputes of a social and economic nature ever since public sector arbitration awards, which were normal legal procedure for settling such disputes, were declared unconstitutional in .
.According to the complainants the General Manager of the National Bank has done everything he can to disrupt the negotiations ' postponing meetings, making proposals to abolish the main benefits that the workers had managed to have included in the agreement and through acts of interference in trade union activities. During the negotiations, the National Bank of Costa Rica sought to exclude new officials joining the staff from January  onwards from benefiting from the financial advantages provided for in the collective agreement. The complainants add that the meetings of the Collective Agreement Bargaining Committee have now been suspended, not just because of the time-consuming and cumbersome practice of holding endless consultations on each and every point, but also because of the employer s decision to condition further negotiations on SEBANA s acceptance of a new system of remuneration known as the  single salary'  which entails raising the base salary for newly recruited employees and for any established officials wishing to join the scheme, and aligning their salaries with those on the labour market in the sector. It is the Government s general policy to introduce a single salary for the public sector, which involves the disappearance of benefits obtained through collective bargaining. The current system of remuneration in the National Bank, which is set out in the collective agreement, regulates the various salary components, the payment of overtime, seniority increments and other incentives that have been acquired over the more than  years that the agreement has been in effect. Under this system, the base salary rises with years of service and other incentives which are not contrary to the labour legislation in force and are covered by the collective agreement. Following the administration s proposal, referred to in the previous paragraph, the banking authorities proposed that a single salary be introduced in the National Bank as part of a single salary policy for the public administration as a whole. By way of justification the bank cites the need to introduce competitive market salaries so as to prevent the loss of skilled employees, and thereby boost the bank s profits. More importantly, the single salary would mean a very significant reduction in its administrative and operating costs. Obviously, the fact that the salaries of National Bank employees are lagging behind the market rates is due entirely to the bank administration, which has negotiated salary increases based on the restrictive criteria of the cost of living, and has not conceded real salary increases.
.The complainants state that SEBANA is not completely blind to the reality of the national and international situation, but is simply trying to defend its basic rights and to avoid the creation of two categories of National Bank employees: those paid under the single salary scheme and those who stay with the present system. The administration wants to guarantee the rights embodied in the collective agreement only for  established workers'  and not for newly recruited employees. The proposal to create two categories of employees and a single salary does not bear analysis from the standpoint of protecting the workers' human rights. It implies the total elimination of all financial advantages embodied in the existing collective agreement, both for new employees and for any others who agree to join the new scheme. Moreover, it is proposed that entitlement to redundancy benefits, which under the present collective agreement are payable for  years at a rate of one month for each of the  years of service, be reduced to eight years, or the equivalent of eight months' salary, irrespective of the number of years of service, which is the minimum provided for in the Labour Code.
.The National Bank also wants to eliminate the rights acquired through the collective agreement in other areas, such as holidays, annual bonuses and family entitlements. Thus, the employer s proposal would reduce the  days' leave each year currently set out in the collective agreement; under the single salary, annual holidays would be reduced to  days for all newly recruited employees, as laid down in the Labour Code. Moreover, the proposal would eliminate annual bonuses and financial benefits for children under the age of maturity, and for children with disabilities or students. It is also seeking to eliminate any financial incentives for National Bank employees to pursue further studies. In other words, what the bank wants is to reduce all the improvements in workers' rights embodied in the collective agreement to the minimum requirements of the Labour Code.
.The bank administration s objective is to lower real salaries, eliminating everything agreed to in the collective agreement, which also means abolishing other salary benefits that have been established over the years, such as the payment of performance incentives for workers who qualify under the Performance and Incentive Assessment System (SEDI). The bank is proposing to deduct from its overall profits the contributions that it is required by law to make to other state institutions before paying its employees, which would reduce the total to be distributed. The administration also wants to end the binding nature of the awards of the Labour Relations Board sanctioning workers for professional misconduct, which would make the Board merely an advisory body and transfer the authority to take disciplinary action to the bank s General Manager, with all the attendant negative consequences for its employees. Finally, the bank s proposals would mean that the collective agreement would cease to apply once its present employees have retired and, whenever negotiations are held, they would be for a decreasing number of employers ' until the union disappears.
.The complainants request of the Committee on Freedom of Association, in the name of the ILO, to urge the National Bank of Costa Rica to return to the bargaining table and to conclude the collective agreement through free and voluntary negotiations.
.In its communications dated  January,  April and  December  and  February , the Government states that on  January  the",0,2010,Costa Rica
37,"National Bank of Costa Rica and SEBANA signed the Final Act of the negotiations on the collective labour agreement, to the satisfaction of both parties, which entered into effect on  December  for a period of three years. Consequently, the main allegations of the complainants are now no longer relevant.
.Regarding the alleged delay referred to by FEBAS, the Government states that, when in  the Federation requested the restoration of its legal personality, it requested the Department of Social Organizations of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security to register the organization as if it was a new federation. Consequently, the Department asked it to meet a series of requirements that were essential for it to be registered. This was why it made certain recommendations to Maraelena Rodrguez Samuels, the FEBAS Secretary General, so that it could proceed with the Federation s registration, as stated in its report DOS--S./Constitutiva of  September  and document DOS--S. of  February . When drafting the latter, the Department s officials spoke directly to Rodrguez Samuels, who explained that she had made a mistake, as it had never been her intention to request its registration as a new federation, but only to reactivate its legal personality which had lapsed, as indicated in the communication of  March .
.According to Jos Joaqun Orozco, the head of the Department of Social Organizations, the Federation s legal personality lapsed in , when it became inactive as a result of a break in relations between workers and employers in the banking sector and of a consequent reduction in the Federation s activities until it ceased functioning altogether. This was borne out by the organization s Secretary-General. During its period of inactivity, the representatives of SEBANA and of Banco Crdito Agrcola de Cartago assumed responsibility for the Federation.
.Once the situation had been clarified, the Department of Social Organizations processed FEBAS' request, made the necessary enquiries for the organization s reactivation and, in a communication dated  May , submitted a report to the Minister of Labour and Social Security in favour of the Federation s registration. FEBAS' Secretary-General was duly informed of these developments by letter of  May , since when the Ministry of Labour and Social Security has not heard any further news. The complainants' allegations therefore have no legal substance and no basis in fact, since upon the request of the interested parties the authorities followed normal proceedings in accordance with the law.
.For the factual and legal reasons outlined above, the Government requests that the complaint be set aside, as it has been clearly shown that the public authorities acted in accordance with the law, with the principles of the ILO and with the laws in force.
.Notwithstanding the above, the Government wishes to refer to the situation in general in order to clarify the points raised. For this, it refers to report GG-- which it received from the General Management of the National Bank of Costa Rica.
.To begin with, the trade union claims that both the Government and the higher institutional authorities were intent on undermining the collective agreement and SEBANA s existence as a trade union. Such a claim is very far from the truth, and the fact that the collective agreement is still in force at the bank is evidence of the employer s respect for its employees and invalidates the complainant s argument.
.It goes without saying that the General Management of the National Bank of Costa Rica, given the inherent public nature of the institution, necessarily sets out to negotiate an agreement that is acceptable to the workers and at the same time is reasonable and in conformity with the country s laws and regulations as they relate to the administration of public funds. This in no way inhibits the conduct of equitable and adequate collective bargaining, either for the workers or for the bank. It is important to emphasize that the whole purpose of collective bargaining is to reach a consensus through a meeting of minds, in which each party is prepared to yield some ground to the other in a bid to reach a mid-point that is satisfactory to both. In other words, neither party can expect the other to accept all its proposals; instead, the exercise of social dialogue is conducive to a narrowing of differences and to the attainment of a final position that is positive for all concerned.
.Regarding the allegation that the meetings of the Collective Agreement Bargaining Committee for the public sector were suspended at the request of the employers, the Government states that negotiation of the new collective agreement began in August ; and it is not true that they have been at a standstill since February , as the parties remained in permanent contact. Indeed, the Government continues, it was SEBANA that broke off negotiations until June  in an email from its Secretary-General, which reads:In the light of the recent appointment of the General Manager announced by the bank s Executive Board yesterday, just days after changes in the composition of the Executive Board, we consider it prudent to take a break before continuing with negotiations, so that a satisfactory outcome can be reached as soon as possible in the interests of social peace within the institution and those of the bank s employees. We would be prepared to resume negotiations in June  (signed: Maraelena Rodrguez Samuels, Secretary-General of SEBANA).
.The bank s management states that a bare  days later SEBANA presented its complaint to the ILO in Geneva, Switzerland, alleging inter alia (and untruly) that negotiations had broken down since February , and adding:The meetings of the Collective Agreement Bargaining Committee have now been suspended, not just because of the bank s time-consuming and cumbersome approach of holding endless consultations on each and every point, but also because of the employer s decision to make further negotiations conditional on SEBANA s acceptance of a new system of remuneration known as the  single salary' 
.In other words, instead of waiting for negotiations to resume in June as it had requested, SEBANA decided maliciously to present a complaint claiming that the bank was responsible for suspending the negotiations (which they themselves had suggested). Such an attempt to discredit the bank and the State of Costa Rica in the eyes of the international community is unacceptable.
.It is quite clear that the negotiations on the new collective agreement were suspended at the request of the trade union, as the above email shows, and it is therefore paradoxical that the employer s side alone should be held responsible. In other words, it is not true that the employer sought to prolong the meetings and negotiations on the collective agreement unnecessarily; as it s good faith and readiness to negotiate has been demonstrated, there is a contradiction between what the union asserts in its complaint and what it actually did during the process. Furthermore, at SEBANA s request, the collective bargaining was conducted with the mediation of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security.
.Regarding the allegation that it is state policy to replace collective bargaining by service regulations, the Government states that the suggestion is completely untrue. Costa Rica s Constitution grants the public administration autonomy in administrative affairs, just as the General Public Administration Act confers on it the power to issue regulations. This means that an institution such as the National Bank of Costa Rica, if it deems it desirable, is entitled to issue its own organizational and service regulations whenever it considers it appropriate. That said, it is false to claim that for it to do so it needs the trade union or the collective agreement (which has been in force for decades) to disappear, since they are not mutually exclusive and can perfectly well coexist. Section  of the General Public Administration Act stipulates that  the hierarchically superior body shall, moreover, be the extrajudicial representative of the public administration within its sphere of competence and shall have the necessary authority to issue its own organizational and service regulations within and outside the administration, provided that, in such cases the regulations do not ultimately imply a power of decision over the general public'  As an autonomous state institution, the National Bank is thus empowered to issue general internal regulations in the interests of efficient management.
.Regarding the alleged proposal by the higher institutional authority to introduce the  single salary' system at the National Bank, the Government states that the Comptroller General s Office defines the  single salary' as  the salary to which a worker is entitled in full, including the base salary, supplementary allowances, annual bonuses, benefits, etc. as such; in other words, wages payable under this scheme implicitly include such supplementary allowances as are recognized in the public sector'  On this point, the management of the National Bank observes that  the negotiations began in August , and SEBANA appears not to understand (and says as much) that the collective agreement is a process of negotiation,",0,2010,Costa Rica
38,"of a meeting of minds and interests, in which the bank is obviously not obliged to agree with everything that SEBANA calls  its agreement'  The minutes of the Bargaining Committee show that the administration and the trade union have reached agreement on a very large portion of the issues dealt with in the agreement ' the most critical, or controversial, issue being the administration s proposal to introduce a new system of remuneration for new recruits known as the  total salary'  which will mean a substantial improvement for the bank s new employees in that their salary will be more competitive in market terms without their having to accumulate many years of salary increments. To be quite clear, new employees will lose some of their rights in terms of days of annual leave, and their separation benefits will be reduced to the level stipulated in the Labour Code as well as other similar changes. But the bank s proposal in no way obliges its current employees to switch to the new system of remuneration, nor does it limit their chances of promotion if they stay with the present system. Whether or not they changed their system of remuneration is entirely up to them, and the management of the bank has never had any other ambition than to enter into a process of negotiation in which it is essential to bear in mind the administration s requirements for negotiating a new collective agreement. It is not imposing these requirements. They are simply the conceptual framework in which the bank intends to conduct its labour relations with its new employees, whereas SEBANA s position is obviously that the bank should go along with its determination not to change anything in the present state of affairs, and that otherwise there can be no bargaining whatsoever, which is obviously not the way to proceed. The banking sector is governed by a set of standards and procedures that are designed to ensure that it is managed in a way that is in keeping with its assets and liabilities and with the concept of appropriate risk management. Negotiating a collective agreement is a process in which the parties discuss their positions and the outcome constitutes a meeting of minds. In all the bank s previous negotiations, that outcome has been a marriage of what the administration wants and of what the workers' representatives want, resulting in a collective agreement that is the property of neither the administration or SEBANA, but of the National Bank s employees.
.As already stated, the bank s administration has judged it desirable to introduce a system of remuneration known as the  total salary'  so that it can recruit skilled staff whose salaries reflect the market situation at the time of their recruitment, instead of depending on the accumulation of salary increments over years of service, as is the case at present. Workers currently employed by the bank have the option to join the new system of remuneration if it suits them, or to remain as they are, with all their acquired rights at the time. Employees recruited after the introduction of the  total salary' would inter alia be entitled to different annual leave and separation benefits which, although higher than those stipulated in the country s labour legislation, are indeed lower than those to which the bank s present employees are entitled. The essential point here is that this is all part and parcel of the bargaining process and, if some mid-point between the positions of the respective parties can be found, a new collective agreement will be concluded. But it is clearly unacceptable that the bank should be obliged to sign  SEBANA s agreement' ' to use the union s own words. The bank s proposal would allow it to recruit its new personnel at a salary level more in keeping with average salaries on the market, without new employees having to wait for years to reach that point. Its principal objective is to offer a more attractive salary for newly recruited officials, without in any way modifying the individual conditions of existing officials, who would be entitled to maintain the salary conditions to which they are currently entitled.
.To put it another way, it is the bank s obligation to manage its available resources as efficiently as possible in order to meet its institutional objectives, which are set out by law, without in so doing infringing the labour rights of its labour force. Thus, each worker currently employed by the bank has the option to stay with the system of remuneration that is currently in force. For the bank to seek to regulate the conditions of recruitment of new employees does not violate any human right; it is simply exercising the obligation imposed on the institution s administrators to maintain a system of remuneration that ensures the competitiveness of the salaries it pays in the sector within which it operates. The position adopted by SEBANA towards what it calls an illegal lowering conditions of remuneration is significant, since in the past it has gone along with the need to limit certain rights for new employees, as happened when annual leave was reduced from  to  days with the entry into force of the current collective agreement.
.It is therefore all the more important to stress that as early as  April  SEBANA was informed of the proposal of the Cooperative Directorate for the Management of Resources of the Department of Human Resources that the National Bank would introduce the single salary system. The proposal was justified by the need for the bank to compete with the major international financial groups, which tend to attract the region s better qualified personnel because of the salaries they offer. And experience has shown that Costa Rica s many private and public financial institutions are operating with systems of remuneration based on market conditions (single or global salaries) that give them a competitive edge in attracting the best human resources available.
.The National Bank s present salary structure consists of a base salary plus a series of increments for seniority, merit and the exclusive nature of employment at the bank, along with other financial benefits derived from the collective agreement. This is not an appropriate system for retaining the services of qualified professionals and technicians.
.To take an example, a bank employee has to work on average for over seven years before he or she can earn a competitive salary. But this is a long time for people to be convinced that they should stay where they are because in the medium term they will be earning as much as they can earn in Costa Rica s financial sector from the moment they are recruited.
.It is this kind of situation that is behind the National Bank s proposal for a single salary, backed as it is by Directive No.  published in Official Gazette No.  of  October , which encourages Costa Rica s commercial banks to introduce new salary schemes that simultaneously boost their employees' productivity, make salaries more competitive and reduce the loss of employees to other institutions.
.Finally, other banking institutions have introduced the same system, such as the Central Bank of Costa Rica in  and the Banco Popular y de Desarrollo Comunal in , which applied it to general managers and district headquarters, before gradually extending it to the rest of its staff.
.The Government notes that the new collective agreement contains provisions on salaries. As to the so-called elimination of salary bonuses and the Labour Relations Board (SEBANA alleges in its complaint that the National Bank plans to deduct the contributions that it is required by law to remit to other state institutions from its overall profits before paying its employees, which it claims reduces the total amount to be distributed), the management of the National Bank states that it has no intention of abolishing the Performance and Incentive Assessment System (SEDI), a very dynamic system for assessing and rewarding group and individual performance among the bank s collaborators. On the contrary, that is precisely one of the rights to which employees opting for the total salary will be entitled, as it is a valuable institutional tool for monitoring the performance and management targets of the bank s employees and its various offices. That said, what the National Bank does want is that profit-sharing among its employees should be calculated after deduction of the contributions that the bank is legally bound to make, since it would not be appropriate to calculate the amount to be distributed before the necessary payments required by law have been made. It is simply a matter of avoiding a distortion in the amount allocated to the SEDI.
.As to the allegations that the National Bank intends to change the binding nature of the Labour Relations Board s resolutions so as to make it a strictly advisory body, the Government states that for the bank s general management this is",1,2010,Costa Rica
39,"strictly a legal issue. According to a ruling of the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice, making decisions reached by a labour relations board s binding is unconstitutional (in the public sector), as the exercise of disciplinary powers is an inalienable prerogative of the employer, as stipulated in section () of the Organic Act on the National Banking System. The bank s management adds that, in the course of the negotiations, the parties eventually agreed that the role of the Labour Relations Board did comply with section  et seq. of the Act, under which the Board has the authority to seek an amicable solution to any problems that arises between the bank and its employees. The new collective agreement also empowers the Board to rule on labour issues within its purview. To sum up, what the general management of the National Bank of Costa Rica is seeking is not that the Board should suddenly disappear, but that it should play the advisory role assigned to it by the Constitutional Chamber when the management is called upon to impose disciplinary sanctions.
.The foregoing considerations show clearly that the action taken by the general management and Executive Board of the National Bank of Costa Rica does not in any way stem from anti-union motives. On the contrary, it is designed to improve the bank s internal functioning. Consequently, the Government requests that the complaint to be set aside.
.The Committee observes that the complainants state that the representatives of FEBAS provided the Department of Social Organizations of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security with all the documents needed to reactivate the Federation, approve its statutes and recognize its legal personality on  December , but that up to the date of their complaint the Ministry had resorted to delaying tactics by imposing requirements that were not stipulated in the law and asking for purely formal corrections.
.The Committee takes note that the Government ascribes the alleged delay to a misunderstanding and points out, inter alia, that in  FEBAS requested the Department of Social Organizations of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security to register the organization as if it were a new federation. Consequently, the Government adds, the Department requested the completion of a series of requirements that were indispensable for it to be duly registered. That was why it made certain recommendations to Maraelena Rodrguez Samuels, Secretary-General of FEBAS, so that it could proceed with the Federation s registration. In February , according to the Government, officials of the Department of Social Organizations spoke directly with Rodrguez Samuels, who explained that she had made a mistake, as her intention had never been to request the establishment of the Federation for the first time, but to recover its legal personality, which had lapsed (as stated in the communication of  March ). The Committee takes note of the Government s statement that, once the situation had thus been clarified, the Department of Social Organizations processed the request, conducted the necessary enquiries for the organization s reactivation and, in a communication dated  May , submitted a report to the Minister of Labour and Social Security in favour of the Federation s registration. The Government concludes by noting that Maraelena Rodrguez Samuels was duly informed of developments by letter of  May , since when the Ministry of Labour and Social Security had not heard any further news. The Committee regrets the delay in the procedure for reactivating the Federation s legal personality (requested in December ) and requests that, in cases relating to the legal personality of trade union organizations, the Government ensures that the administrative authorities concerned act swiftly and take proactive steps to facilitate the exercise by workers of their basic rights, including the right to organize. However, noting the Government s suggestion that the trade unions have apparently lost interest in reactivating FEBAS since at least May , the Committee requests the complainant organizations to indicate whether the unions concerned continue to wish for the reactivation of FEBAS. If so, the Committee requests the Government to recognize the Federation s legal personality without delay.
.The Committee observes that, according to the complainants' principal allegations: (a) the State wants to replace collective bargaining by  service and employment regulations' issued unilaterally by the higher institutional authorities; (b) the National Bank s administration has held up the collective bargaining process for months and is trying to eliminate the main benefits that the workers have managed to have included in the agreement; (c) the meetings of the Collective Agreement Bargaining Committee have been held up and are currently suspended as a result of the employer s position; (d) the bank administration s proposal regarding the single salary and annual leave infringes its employees' labour rights and introduces discrimination; (e) the bank wants the decisions of the Labour Relations Board to be no longer binding ; and (f) it wishes to make changes in order to undermine collective bargaining and the trade union until they disappear altogether.
.The Committee takes note that the Government denies that the bank has held up the meetings of the Bargaining Committee (initiated by the Government in ) unnecessarily and claims that SEBANA itself called for their suspension. The Committee observes that the Government denies any anti-union motives, presents the bank s various proposals ( single salary'  annual leave, etc.) in a very different light from the complainants and suggests that negotiations entail concessions by the parties concerned so as to reach a mid-point that is satisfactory to both, whereas the union expected the bank to go along with its position that nothing should change in the present state of affairs. So long as the parties are bargaining in a manner consistent with freedom of association, the Committee wishes to point out in general terms that it is not for it to rule on the parties' specific proposals in the bargaining process.
.The Committee notes with interest the Government s latest replies informing it of the signing of the collective agreement on  January  and, given the parties' different versions of the way the negotiations took place, will not pursue its examination of the allegations. The Committee notes however that if, as the allegations claim, negotiations began in December , then the bargaining process was considerably delayed. The Committee recalls that the ILO s technical assistance is available to accelerate collective bargaining processes.
.As to the alleged absence of any mechanism for resolving disputes, such as arbitration, the Committee takes note that the Government emphasizes that the Ministry of Labour acted as a mediator in the bargaining process.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee requests the complainants to indicate whether the trade unions in the banking sector still wish to reactivate the FEBAS. If so, the Committee requests the Government to recognize the Federation s legal personality without delay.",0,2010,Costa Rica
40,".The complaint was lodged in March  in a communication from the Rerum Novarum Workers' Confederation (CTRN), JAPDEVA Workers' Union (SINTRAJAP), General Confederation of Workers (CGT), Costa Rican Workers' Movement Confederation (CMTC), Costa Rican Confederation of Democratic Workers (CCTD), Juanito Mora Porras Social Confederation (CSJMP) and the Limn Workers Federation (FETRAL).
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  September  and  February .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their March  communication, the CTRN, SINTRAJAP, CGT, CMTC, CCTD, CSJMP and FETRAL allege that the Government of Costa Rica, through the President of the Republic and employers' sector, has launched an anti-union campaign aimed at getting rid of SINTRAJAP, affiliated to the CTRN. SINTRAJAP has long been a fierce defender of the labour rights of its affiliated members, all of whom are currently facing the prospect of dismissal so as to make way for the privatization of the docks. The union has had to contend with the national radio and television channels where it has been attacked by the President of the Republic who demanded that it hold a trade union assembly to inform the workers about the privatization of the docks, when it has already held four such assemblies at which the workers voiced their opposition to privatization, precisely because of the detrimental impact it would have on their social and labour conditions.
.The complainant organizations state that the former President of the Republic went on a national radio and television channel to attack SINTRAJAP and its leadership publicly and in the most disrespectful and insulting terms that could only damage the image of the trade union and its executive board.
.On  February , following the pattern set by the President of the Republic, the then Minister of Public Works and Transport informed the press and television of the Government s position on trade unions, stating:  The Government is declaring war to the trade unions of Limn and invites the private entrepreneurs to close ranks in order to allow the concession of the new Caribbean dock to a private company. In two or three weeks the Government will be putting a new dock in Limn out to tender'  In the words of the Minister of Transport,  this will be the first shot in a battle that is going to last all year and one of whose aims is to get rid of the dockworkers' union in the Caribbean'  The Minister met with representatives of the chamber of employers and told them in the harshest terms that it was a war in which no quarter would be shown. The Government has been working on a plan to put the construction of the new docks out to tender, for a total cost of  million dollars. The existing port facilities will be modernized and, though they will remain in the hands of the State, they will operate under a new system, with no trade unions and with no collective agreements.
.The executive president of JAPDEVA threatened to take the union to court on the grounds that it was preventing the docks from being put out to tender. In order to follow this objective, the executive president plotted with the Ministry of Labour and with a group of pro-Government workers who call themselves the  mediator group'  to which the President referred in his broadcast on national television. The complaint was lodged with the courts through the National Labour Inspectorate which, backed by the Ministry of Labour, accused the union of unfair labour practices ' an offence which does not even exist in the law, except in relation to an employer. The self-styled mediator group was used as a front to lodge a request for court protection (amparo) with the Constitutional Chamber, where it alleged that the union refused to convene an assembly, which, as the Constitutional Chamber recognized when it rejected the request, was quite untrue.
.In the Diario Extra of  January , the President of the Republic published an article in which he stated:  More and more employees are backing the Government s proposal to put the docks out to tender. In exchange for the union backing down and allowing a private company to take over the running of the docks, we have offered them US$ million in compensation, in other words tens of thousands of colones for each worker just for agreeing to give up' 
.To get rid of SINTRAJAP s executive board, the Government s established a strategy to eliminate the union s leaders and it used the mediator group as a front to oust the existing board, which was appointed by the workers for the period ' . The sequence of events was as follows:
.In its communication dated  September , the Government stated that the allegations were no longer relevant since the members of SINTRAJAP s executive board, in the exercise of their constitutional right of appeal to the courts provided for under the country s legal system, have lodged a series of complaints in order to clarify the situation within the trade union:
.The Government states that the Constitutional Chamber recently ruled on two of the above cases, ordering the cancellation of the  agreements reached at the ordinary general assemblies of SINTRAJAP held on ,  and  January , as well as of the appointment of a new executive board' 
.Recognizing the primacy of the principles of freedom of association and in accordance with the rulings of the highest juridical institution, the Government consequently ordered the cancellation of the registration of the executive board appointed at the assemblies cited by the Constitutional Chamber and accordingly registered and reappointed the previous executive board, by resolution No. /J-/DOS/ adopted at . p.m. on  August  by the Department of Social and Labour Organizations of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security. It is clear from the above that the Ministry of Labour and Social Security has, with due expediency, re-established the juridical situation as requested by the complainants in the two cases ruled upon by the highest juridical institution, thereby resolving the complainants' allegations. Moreover, on  September , the Constitutional Chamber dismissed one of the requests for the protection of the courts that had been lodged and ruled that it was not competent to revise the JAPDEVA collective agreement, as was requested in the application to have it declared unconstitutional. Notwithstanding the above, the parties concerned ' JAPDEVA as the employer and the reinstated trade union ' are currently engaged in a process of renegotiating the collective agreement, with the participation of the Ministry of Labour as facilitator.
.The courts of justice are still examining the dispute, stage by stage, in accordance with the requirements of due process of law.
.The Government states that it cannot be concluded from the complainants' allegations and from the circumstances surrounding the situation within SINTRAJAP that it failed in any way to comply with the labour legislation in force and with the fundamental Conventions of the ILO.
.The Government stresses that, although it considers that all the public institutions and their departments involved in the present case acted in accordance with the law and with the principle of legality, they are at the same time subject to the control of the Constitutional Chamber as the highest juridical institution.
.Thus, as indicated above, the Constitutional Chamber has already ruled on specific points raised by the complainants, and the Government therefore considers that the present complaint is no longer relevant and contentious issues have been resolved by the competent legal and administrative institutions.
.Nevertheless, in order to clarify the sequence of events, the Government has the following observations to make regarding the complainants' allegations.
.The Government rejects the accusation that it conducted an alleged campaign to discredit and eliminate SINTRAJAP, which it considers a purely subjective appreciation lacking in any legal foundation or evidence. It is not true that there is a Government campaign to discredit and eliminate the union.
.The measures taken by the Government were legitimate and part of a regulatory and technical context involving the modernization of Costa Rica s ports as a key element in the country s socio-economic development.
.In order to make it quite clear that none of the steps were taken for anti-union motives, it is necessary to refer in general terms to the process of modernization of the national ports.
.With regard to the modernization of the country s ports, it is the courts of law that are competent to authorize a process of this nature. The Constitutional Chamber has for its part voted on the legality of the planned expansion and modernization of the ports and determined that, so long as the collective agreement is amended to include the cost of compensating workers who lose their jobs as a result, the process could be authorized in the normal course of events.
.Regarding the main point raised by the complainants, it is",0,2010,Costa Rica
41,"important to know that one of the main thrusts of the National Development Plan for '  was the modernization of the ports of the Caribbean seaboard, with a view to generating employment and export income and thus mitigating to a large extent the social and labour backwardness of the province of Limn, where the poverty index is a matter of grave concern.
.Costa Rica has for years been falling behind in its investments in port facilities for handling ships on the Caribbean seaboard, and as a result it is becoming less competitive in terms of foreign trade.
.That being so, the Government has the major responsibility of adopting measures to reverse the situation. The country does not, however, have the resources to expand the port system as proposed in the Ports Master Plan, which has been authorized by the General Comptrollers' Office, the highest supervisory body of the State.
.The construction of Limn s new container terminal alone entails an investment of almost US$ billion, while at least US$ million dollars are needed to modernize fully the services currently afforded by the Limn-Mon port complex. The funding of these projects is to be made possible by means of financial arrangements determined by the country s legal system ' the first by means of a public service franchise (Act No. ) and the second by putting the management of public services out to tender (Administrative Contract Act, section ). The first project is well under way, since the Cartel has already received the backing of the Public Services Regulatory Authority and the General Comptrollers' Office, which are responsible for overseeing public expenditure.
.Regarding the representation of SINTRAJAP, the Government notes that the records of the Department of Social and Labour Organizations of the Ministry of Labour show Ronaldo Blear was the union s Secretary-General from  January  to  January .
.With regard to the refusal of the executive board of SINTRAJAP to convene an assembly, the modernization of the port of Mon involves a process of management of the public service in which the only change concerns the port operator. For the modernization process to take place, the existing employees of JAPDEVA have to be compensated. Initially, compensation was set at . million colones per worker for each year under contract to JAPDEVA up to a maximum of  years, and  million colones for each additional year. SINTRAJAP s previous executive board raised the issue at a union assembly, which rejected the proposal and demanded US$, per employee, which the Government authorities rejected as unreasonable and disproportionate. Subsequently, the Government raised its offer to . million colones per year under contract up to a maximum of  years. However, the union s executive board refused to submit this new proposal to an extraordinary union assembly, which is the union s highest authority, thereby restricting its members in the exercise of the rights inherent in freedom of association and trade union autonomy.
.SINTRAJAP s by-laws entitle a group of members to collect signatures to request that the executive board convene an extraordinary assembly. A group of the union s members accordingly collected signatures from  per cent of the union membership and requested the convening of an extraordinary assembly. Article  of the union s by-laws reads as follows:Twenty-five per cent of the union s members may request the executive board to take appropriate steps to convene an extraordinary general assembly ' The executive board ' must do so within eight days of receiving the request.Moreover, article  of the by-laws states the following:The highest authority of the union is the general assembly, which shall meet ordinarily once a year and in extraordinary session when the union s executive board or  per cent of its members so determine.
.Receiving no reply to their request that an assembly be convened in accordance with the union s by-laws and considering that their fundamental rights were thus denied, the union members concerned requested the intervention of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security which, in accordance with section  and other relevant articles of the Labour Code, initiated proceedings against the executive board for violation of the labour legislation.
.For greater clarity, reference should be made to statement No. DNI-UAL-- issued by the National Labour Inspectorate to the following effect:Considering that the labour inspectorate have ascertained that  per cent of the signatories, as active members of SINTRAJAP, fulfilled the requisite conditions to convene an assembly under article  of the union s by-laws and that they were nevertheless and without justification denied the possibility of doing so on  October , the National Labour Inspectorate deems that the said provision has been violated. It reached this determination on  November  and accorded the default party three days to comply with the provision, but this, according to labour inspectorate report No. SJ-DNI-- of  November , it failed to do. Considering that workers have a constitutional right to organize in order to further and defend their interests, whether individually or collectively, and that any act that limits or restricts that right is in violation of the labour legislation in force, the National Labour Inspectorate on  November  brought a charge before the courts of law of Limn citing an infringement of the labour laws.
.When the charge was brought before the competent jurisdiction on  December , SINTRAJAP s executive board convened an ordinary assembly ' at which one of the items on the agenda concerned the question of compensation ' to be held at  p.m. on  January  at the union s headquarters.
.The Government adds that on  January , a member of SINTRAJAP, Mr Ivansky Blackwood Sharpe, wrote to the regional headquarters of the Ministry of Health in Limn to request it, prior to the holding of the assembly, to verify whether the union s premises were suitable for the holding of the assembly, given the number of participants that were expected to attend and the limited space available. The matter was duly taken up by the Ministry, which in report No. HA-ARS-L-RS-- of the Health Directorate for Limn province declared that  no activity is authorized on SINTRAJAP s premises located in the city centre of Limn'  It will be appreciated from the foregoing that the complainants' claim that the Ministry of Health suspended the holding of the assembly is untrue. On the contrary, it was altogether within the Ministry s competence to recommend that the assembly not be held on the premises chosen by SINTRAJAP because of the limited space available and in the interests of the participants' health, so that, given the large attendance that was expected at the assembly, the executive board might seek an appropriate solution.
.More specifically, the report of the Health Directorate for the province of Limn stated:According to the regulations governing mass concentrations of people, and given the fact that all the members of the union have been invited to attend a mid-term ordinary assembly at  p.m. on  January  (an expected , participants) and that prior inspection of the premises indicates that there is not enough space for such an assembly, the Health Directorate does not recommend that over , people meet in an area of  square metres, which it deems insufficient for so many participants.
.In keeping with proper legal proceedings, the Ministry of Heath at no time suspended the assembly or prevented it from taking place; it simply expressed its opposition to the venue on the understanding that the assembly could be held elsewhere, inasmuch as it has the legal obligation, under the General Health Act and the rules and regulations governing the issuance of health permits (executive decree No. -S and amendments), to ensure the protection and betterment of the health of the population.
.As to the assemblies that were held on ,  and  January , as noted above the Ministry of Health did not in any way prevent their being held but merely objected to the venue for reasons of public health while leaving open the option of choosing some other venue.
.Although the complainants state that the executive board cancelled the assembly the day before it was being held, not all the workers were aware of that fact. Consequently, members of the union turned up at the chosen venue and, seeing that there was no quorum, set a new date for a second assembly in accordance with section (h) of the Labour Code and with the legislation in force. This explains how they met in assembly and, after establishing that there was not the necessary quorum for the initial assembly (two-thirds of the union membership), they decided to convene a second assembly, as provided for in the union s by-laws, to be held at  a.m. on  January in one of the warehouses belonging to JAPDEVA.
.The workers were informed by circular, email and fax that the assembly was convened for  a.m. on  January  but, since attendance at this second assembly was less than",0,2010,Costa Rica
42," per cent of the union members plus one (according to the official record, there were  members present), the participants decided unanimously to convene a third assembly at  a.m. the same day with as many union members as were present, as provided for in the Labour Code.
.For the above reasons, the Government considers that the situation stems from a dispute between union members and the executive board deriving from the latter s failure to comply with the statutory provisions by refusing to convene an extraordinary assembly where the workers could decide for themselves matters that directly concerned them. Quite clearly, the Government did not play any part in the holding of the assemblies and the confusion stemmed directly from the attitude of the members of the executive board.
.With regard to the role of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, the Ministry ' as the body responsible for the registration of trade unions ' has no authority under the country s legislation to act as an administrative police force, by virtue of the principles of trade union autonomy and independence embodied in article  of the Constitution and in ILO Convention No. , which has been duly approved and ratified by Costa Rica. That said, the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice has on numerous occasions recognized the authority of the Ministry of Labour in terms of registration and, through its Department of Social Organizations and at the request of the newly appointed executive board, the Ministry duly registered the agreements that were officially submitted to it.
.According to established case law, the principle of freedom of association prevents any administrative measure being taken that is liable to affect the existence of a trade union, unless it is by the courts pursuant to sections  and  of the Labour Code. The Ministry only has the authority to determine whether the legal requirements have been met in the documents submitted to it (this is implicit in section  of the Labour Code) as any issues that may arise among the union members with respect to anomalies in the conduct of an assembly, that are not recorded in the documentation submitted, must be referred by the union members to the labour courts.
.Notwithstanding the above, as already mentioned, the Department of Social Organizations proceeded to cancel the registration of the executive board appointed at the assemblies referred to above, and to register and reinstate the previous executive board, in accordance with resolution No. /J-/DOS/ of  August . For these reasons, the Government repeats that it considers that the present complaint is no longer relevant, inasmuch as the SINTRAJAP s executive board has been reinstated in compliance with the ruling of the highest juridical institution of the country.
.With regard to the alleged non-compliance with the principle of due process of law and trade union autonomy, the Government notes that in their resolutions the highest courts of the land, namely, Constitutional Chamber  and Second Chamber , possess an extensive and detailed case law on the subject of due process. Articles  and  of the Constitution and article  of the American Convention on Human Rights declare that this is a fundamental right of all people, and the Government of Costa Rica is the supervisory institution responsible for monitoring issues of constitutionality and legality. According to that case law, due process comprises the right to be notified of the nature and purpose of proceedings, to be given a hearing, to prepare and exercise one s defence and to present evidence in one s defence, as well as the right of access to all information concerning the proceedings, the right to a just and reasoned ruling, the right to be notified of such ruling and the right of appeal against it. However, the situation described by the complainants with regard to the convening and holding of the assembly and the adoption of agreements is a matter that concerns only the union s members and its executive board. In accordance with the principle of freedom of association as embodied in the Constitution and in international instruments, the Government has no authority to intervene in such matters. Consequently, if any disagreement arises in the conduct of union activities, it is strictly for the workers themselves to apply to the courts of law responsible for guaranteeing law and order, if they consider that their rights have been violated. In the exercise of this right and in accordance with the country s labour legislation, the members of SINTRAJAP s executive board initiated a series of legal proceedings aimed at arriving at the truth of the matter, most of which have already been resolved ' except for one administrative dispute that is currently before the courts.
.The Government has acted in conformity with the principles of legality and of freedom of association embodied in the Constitution, in accordance with the rulings of the highest juridical institution, thereby restoring the juridical situation called for by the complainants in two cases corresponding to the allegations presented by the complainants, which were resolved with all due expediency. It is thus established that Costa Rica fully guarantees access to justice and the protection of the rights which all workers possess, irrespective of union membership. The Government reiterates that the modernization of the country s ports is not designed to eliminate trade unions but that is part and parcel of the country s economic development policy. In the light of the recent rulings of the Constitutional Chamber, the Ministry of Labour has convened meetings with the reinstated executive board of SINTRAJAP, under the chairmanship of Mr Ronaldo Blear, in order to reach agreements through transparent social dialogue.
.In its communication of  February , the Government states that on  January  SINTRAJAP trade union elections were held and for the fourth consecutive period the union members elected the executive board headed by Mr Ronaldo Blear Blear, who will continue for a further two years in the post of Secretary-General of the JAPDEVA Workers' Union.
.The Government also states that to date three decisions (attached) have been handed down by the Constitutional Chamber in response to the requests for the protection of the courts (amparo) lodged by the complainant trade union organization and reported on by the Government in its reply concerning this case. It was clear from these documents that the public institutions had complied with both prevailing labour legislation and ILO fundamental Conventions, and that the circumstances surrounding the allegations were the result of matters relating to the internal organization of the trade union and its members.
.The Government notes that the applicants had free access to the judicial and administrative authorities to address the aspects with which they disagreed. It also states that both the employer JAPDEVA and the trade union officials of SINTRAJAP, recently appointed for a further two-year period, had been able to sustain dialogue in negotiating the collective agreement, and that the Ministry of Labour and Social Security had participated in a social dialogue facilitation role.
.The Government concludes by asking that case No.  be set aside in its entirety.
.The Committee observes that in the case under examination the complainant organizations allege: () that the former President of the Republic and former Minister of Public Works and Transport made anti-union statements during the process of modernization (i.e. privatization and mass dismissals) of the JAPDEVA docks, with the intention of putting aside SINTRAJAP s executive board which was opposing privatization and which subsequently demanded much higher compensation for the dismissals than the authorities were prepared to offer; () that the authorities and the executive president of JAPDEVA used a group of workers (the self-styled mediator group) to have the SINTRAJAP executive board dismissed at an illegal union assembly and to appoint a new board backed by the authorities and the employer; and () that the Ministry of Labour registered the new executive board in connivance with the authorities and dismissed the legitimate board. The Committee notes that the Government denies the anti-union nature of the measures adopted and describes the allegations as stemming from a dispute between the union s executive committee and a group of union members who, according to the Government, took action when the board failed to inform the workers of the employer s second compensation offer; the Government notes that one of the assemblies organized by the said group of workers was attended by  union members.
.With regard to the alleged anti-union statements of the authorities concerning the modernization of JAPDEVA, the Committee notes the following statements in the press reproduced by the complainants:' In Diario Extra of Tuesday  January , the President of the Republic reportedly stated:More and more employees are backing the Government s proposal to put the docks out to tender. In exchange for the union backing down and allowing a private company to take over the running of the docks, we have offered them US$ million in compensation, in other words tens of thousands of colones for each worker just",0,2010,Costa Rica
43,"for agreeing to give up.' On  February , the then Minister of Public Works and Transport informed the press and television of the Government s position on the trade unions, as follows:The Government is declaring war to the trade unions of Limn and invites the private entrepreneurs to close ranks in order to allow the concession of the new Caribbean dock to a private company. In two or three weeks the Government will be putting a new dock in Limn out to tender. In the words of the Minister of Transport, this will be the first shot in a battle that is going to last all year and one of whose aims is to get rid of the dockworkers' union in the Caribbean. The Minister met with representatives of the chamber of employers and told them in the harshest terms that it was a war in which no quarter would be shown. The Government has been working on a plan to put the construction of the new docks out to tender, for a total cost of $ million. The existing port facilities will be modernized and, though they will remain in the hands of the State, they will operate under a new system, with no trade unions and with no collective agreements.
.The Committee considers that, although the authorities are entitled to inform the public of their policies and decisions and also to give their opinion on the position adopted by the trade unions, for example when the latter oppose a privatization process involving a large number of dismissals, the statements reported seem to have gone beyond the mere exercise of freedom of speech by explicitly urging members to resign from the union and by advocating a new trade union system.
.The Committee notes that, although the Government states that there is no anti-union campaign and that the steps it took had no such anti-union objective as putting aside the trade union, it does not deny the statements cited in the allegations which, in so far as they are liable to encourage workers to leave the union or have the effect of destroying the union, are contrary to the right of workers to join the union of their own choosing, in accordance with Article  of Convention No. . The Committee emphasizes the importance that the authorities' statements to the media should not seek to influence the right of workers to join organizations of their own choosing.
.Regarding the alleged use by the authorities and by the executive president of JAPDEVA of a group of workers (the self-styled mediator group) to dismiss SINTRAJAP s executive board by means of illegal assemblies, in violation of the union s by-laws, and to appoint a new board backed by the authorities, as well as the subsequent registration by the Ministry of Labour of the board sponsored by the mediator group, the Committee notes the Government s statement that the Supreme Court ordered the previous executive board to be reinstated and the registration of the second board to be cancelled, and that the Ministry of Labour immediately complied with the order. The Committee points out that the allegations emphasize the interference of the Ministry of Public Works and Transport and Ministry of Health. According to the complainants, the latter suspended one of the assemblies called by SINTRAJAP s legitimate executive board because the venue did not meet requirements and agreed to the mediator group holding an assembly (attended by only  of the , members of the union) which thereupon appointed a spurious executive committee that the Ministry of Labour promptly registered. The Committee observes that the Government offers a very different version of events, according to which the venue chosen ( square metres) was too small for over , participants and that, in accordance with the relevant regulations and at the request of a member of SINTRAJAP (from the mediator group), the Minister of Health raised an objection to the venue in the interests of public health and recommended that the assembly not be held there, but did not suspend the assembly. In the Government s view, the problem stemmed from a dispute between a number of union members (according to the Government, the second assembly was attended by  union members and was convened because the union s executive board had not informed the workers of the employer s second offer of compensation for dismissal) and the new executive board, and the authorities were not involved in the assemblies. The Government makes the point that the Ministry of Labour ' which is not empowered to act as an administrative police force ' registered the agreements submitted to it but later cancelled the registration of the new executive board following the ruling of the judicial authority. Thus, the Government is of the view that the problem that was at the heart of the complaint has been resolved.
.The Committee notes the court rulings sent by the Government on this matter. The Committee lists below the facts that the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice considers to have been established:(a) On  December  the executive board of SINTRAJAP in office at the time convened a mid-term general assembly to be held on  January .(b) By way of official communication HA-ARS-L-RS-- of  January , the Ministry of Health s Health Directorate for Limn province refused SINTRAJAP authorization to hold its mid-term general assembly on  January  as the proposed location did not have the appropriate technical or sanitary facilities.(c) On  January , the Secretary-General of SINTRAJAP informed the members of the trade union organization that the general assembly scheduled for that day had been cancelled.(d) On  January  a group of SINTRAJAP members agreed to convene a second ordinary general assembly of the organization to be held on  January .(e) On  January , during the third ordinary general assembly of SINTRAJAP, a member made a motion to remove the entire executive board in office at that time from their positions on the board, which was accepted by the majority of those present.(f) On  January  a group of SINTRAJAP members fixed  January  as the date on which to continue the organization s ordinary general assembly, and appointed the new ad hoc executive board, transferring to them the duties of the executive board members removed on  January .(g) On  January  the new executive board of SINTRAJAP notified the members of the previous executive board that they had been granted a hearing on  February .(h) On  January  a group of SINTRAJAP members proceeded with the mid-term ordinary general assembly.(i) From  January to  January  the leaders of the previous executive board of SINTRAJAP met with various officials from the Ministry of Labour and Social Security.(j) On  January  the previous executive board removed from SINTRAJAP did not attend the hearing granted it by the new ad hoc board.(k) By way of decision -DOS- handed down at  p.m. on  February , the Ministry of Labour and Social Security registered the ordinary general assemblies held by a group of SINTRAJAP members on ,  and  January . The appointment of the new executive board was also registered.(l) On  February , the Ministry of Labour and Social Security sent the appellant (Mr Ronaldo Blear, Secretary-General of the union) decision -DOS- handed down at  p.m. on  February .
.The Committee notes that in these rulings the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice decided: () to reinstate the Secretary-General of the union and other members of the executive board in their duties because the assembly held on  January  did not give them the opportunity to exercise their (constitutional) right to defend themselves (the Supreme Court did not however rule on whether or not the officials had engaged in conduct that would merit their removal); () to annul the Ministry of Labour s decision to register the provisional executive board and to reinstate the current executive board. The Committee understands that that annulment of the ministerial decision does not in itself imply a reproach to the Ministry as, in accordance with legislation, the Ministry of Labour must confine itself to verifying compliance with procedural requirements when it registers an executive board of a union (according to the Government s statements, only the judicial authority can examine the substance of the case).
.The Committee also notes that the Supreme Court has declared as established that: (a) on  January  the Health Directorate for Limn province received a complaint from worker and service-lift operator Mr Ivansky Blackwood Sharpe indicating that the premises of the JAPDEVA Workers' Union was too small to accommodate its , members who had been convened for a mid-term workers' general assembly on  January , as the premises could in fact only accommodate about  people; (b) in response to the complaint an inspection was carried out that identified the following sanitary anomalies:",-1,2010,Costa Rica
44,"the size of the structure is approximately  square metres and there is seating for  people; it is located on the third floor, has mixed ventilation and has no emergency stairs; and (c) given the above, on  January  the acting Director of the Health Directorate for Limn province and the environmental management expert for the area informed the appellant that the authorization to hold a mid-term general assembly of the JAPDEVA Workers' Union on  January  had been refused for technical and sanitary reasons. The Supreme Court also considered that the  refusal to grant permission to carry out mass activities that exceed the capacity of the premises in question as established by the Ministry of Health does not injure any fundamental rights, and this activity can only be authorized if it is in accordance with the law, in other words, if the permits and authorization required for activities of this kind have been granted' 
.Given these circumstances and the judicial decisions mentioned, and taking into account that the executive board of SINTRAJAP was reinstated in its functions and that the trade union and the employer are engaged in a collective bargaining process, the Committee will not pursue its examination of the allegations.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.",1,2010,Costa Rica
45,".The Committee last examined this case, which concerns a series of alleged anti-union acts carried out by a public banking entity to undermine and destabilize the Banco Popular workers' trade union (SIBANPO, the complainant organization) and its leaders, at its meeting in June  (see paragraphs  to ). On that occasion, the Committee:(a)	suggested to the trade union and the Bank to consider the possibility of setting up a joint commission within the framework of the collective agreement for the periodic verification of the legality of the activities financed by the funds whose management the collective agreement entrusts to the trade union. The Committee requested the Government to keep it informed of any decision in this respect;(b)	suggested that cases of disputes concerning the trade union leave provided for in the collective agreement be submitted to the above-mentioned joint committee, possibly chaired by an independent person, in order to guarantee the right of the trade union to ensure that the trade union leave provided for in the collective agreement is applied in practice without prejudicing the effective functioning of the Bank. The Committee requested the Government to keep it informed of any decision in this respect;(c)	requested the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the administrative proceedings against the dispute secretary of the complainant union; and(d)	expressed the hope that efforts would be made by the Bank and the union to improve the industrial relations climate and that the suggested dispute resolution mechanisms would be put in place in the very near future.
.In a communication dated  August , the complainant organization indicates that the Bank s General Management unilaterally decided on the salary adjustment without prior negotiation with SIBANPO. In this regard, in a communication dated  March , the Government indicates that the obligation to negotiate salaries should only be complied with when the increase proposed by the Bank itself was lower than the Consumer Price Index, because what the clause in the agreement actually includes as a benefit for the workers is that the salary adjustments should be compensated according to the increase in the cost of living, reflected in that index. The Government also indicates that the trade union did not participate in an administrative conciliation process initiated by the Bank in November  and points out that the Bank asked the labour administration for an interpretation of the above-mentioned clause and that it was awaiting that opinion.
.By communications sent on  February ,  January and  August , as well as  September and  October , the Government provides the following information in respect of the above-mentioned recommendations:
.In a communication dated  September , the Government indicates that labour relations at the Bank are conducted within the framework of respect for freedom of association, collective bargaining and unionization, all in line and harmony with the Bank s institutional obligations and goals. It also indicates that the parties are currently negotiating a new collective agreement; that all legal proceedings related to this case have been resolved, all decisions being favourable to the Bank; and that there are no administrative proceedings related to this case pending before the National Inspection Directorate. The Government also emphasizes that a significant period of time has elapsed without any update from the complainant organization.
.The Committee takes due note of the information provided by the Government. The Committee recalls that the issues giving rise to the complaint occurred more than a decade ago and notes that, according to the Government s information, SIBANPO and the Bank have negotiated various collective agreements to date. The Committee also notes that, according to the documents annexed by the Government, the collective agreement between SIBANPO and the Bank in force in  provided for a mechanism called the  Labour Relations Board'  which is a permanent bipartite and joint body. The Committee further notes that, in the collective agreement signed in  between SIBANPO and the Bank, available on the website of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, it is stated that the  Labour Relations Board' is a permanent body with joint representation whose purpose is to resolve labour-management and legal disputes arising from the application of the law or the collective agreement, as well as complaints of union persecution brought by SIBANPO or any worker. On the basis of the foregoing, having received no recent information from the complainant organization and noting that, according to the Government, the parties are negotiating a new collective agreement, the Committee considers that the case is closed and will not pursue its examination.
.The complaint is contained in a communication dated  November  from the Banco Popular Employees' Union (SIBANPO), which presented additional information in a further communication in February .
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  January and  April .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  November , SIBANPO explains that it represents employees of the Banco Popular y de Desarrollo Comunal, a corporate public body that has successively concluded a number of collective labour agreements with the union, the latest of which was signed on  December . SIBANPO alleges that, because of its active role in trade union affairs, the union and its leaders have for some time been confronted by a series of arbitrary anti-union and discriminatory measures that have been backed or perpetrated by the employers' representatives of Banco Popular, including the general manager, in attempts to undermine and destabilize the trade union. These anti-union measures have taken many different forms: persecution of union officials, harassment, arbitrary disciplinary sanctions, unjustified denial of leave to carry out union activities, the bringing of baseless criminal charges against them by higher institutional bodies, unlawful administrative requirements, denial of freedom of expression, etc. Specifically, SIBANPO alleges that its requests for paid trade union leave, as provided for in the collective agreement so that some of its members can assist in training activities and other strictly union activities, have been denied without any ground for doing so (Human Development and Organizational Directorate communications (ref. Nos DDHO-- of  January , DDHO-- of  June , DDHO-- of  May  and DDHO-- of  July ), copies of which were attached). In addition, leave requests submitted by members of SIBANPO s electoral committee have on several occasions been denied, thereby disrupting the work of this extremely important union body (Human Development and Organizational Directorate communications (ref. Nos DDHO-- of  May , DDHO-- of  April  and DDHO-- of  October ); a number of leave requests for SIBANPO executives have also been refused (communication ref. No. DDHO-- of  May ). Predictably, the employer  justifies' these decisions on the grounds that the Bank s work would suffer if the requests were granted.
.SIBANPO further alleges that on  June , following the Bank s internal auditor s report AG-- and on instructions from the general manager, the director of the legal department, who is the Bank s legal representative, lodged criminal charges with the Office of the Public Prosecutor against Ms Oriette Zonta Elizondo, SIBANPO s Secretary-General, on the grounds that the Bank considered that part of the funds it transferred to SIBANPO in accordance with section  of the collective agreement in force were used not for the purposes for which they were intended, i.e. for activities designated as social, cultural and sporting activities for the Bank s employees, but for activities of interest only to the trade union, which were identified in the report.
.According to the complainant, the auditor s report states that part of the funds corresponding to the first advance payment for  were used to finance advisory services that the union claimed were paid out of its own funds, whereas in fact the money was used to pay for the services of an expert to organize a cultural event and to train the workers in subjects of general institutional interest (development banking and projects of direct relevance to the Bank itself). SIBANPO states that, in accordance with section  of the collective agreement, the advance was authorized by the general manager himself, who nevertheless gave instructions for charges to be lodged with the Office of the Public Prosecutor (communication ref. No. GGC--).
.The misleading auditor s report also states that another part of this  advance was used to pay invoices for food, equipment, transport and training services in some of the Bank s branches and that part of the second advance for the same year was spent on end-of-year activities in several of the Bank s offices. According to the auditor s strange criterion, these funds could not be spent on the union s own activities, even though the activities it organized were for the direct benefit of the Bank s employees. Here again, the auditor s assessment is not in keeping with section  of",1,2009,Costa Rica
46,"the collective agreement.
.As for the funds that were transferred in , the report claims that part of the money was used to pay for the end-of-year party for the Bank s employees, which it again claims was a strictly trade union affair. However, the conclusions drawn in the auditor s report are altogether unacceptable, as there is no doubt that these occasions are social and cultural events whose financing is covered by section  of the collective agreement.
.In conclusion, SIBANPO observes that the criminal charges were eventually restricted to the question of the advisory service ' which were training activities ' and the  endofyear staff party and were disallowed by the Criminal Court of the Second Judicial Circuit of San Jos on  September .
.According to SIBANPO, the purpose of all this was to discredit the union and undermine its leaders' credibility with the employees.
.On another issue, SIBANPO states that, on  July , the Judicial Investigation Body (OIJ) ordered a search of the offices of the internal auditors and of the Bank s national management board, after criminal charges had been brought by a Costa Rican journalist on the grounds that a person under contract to the Bank had gone to two offices of the Costa Rican Electricity Institute (ICE) with a forged document authorizing the Institute to provide him with information regarding the journalist s incoming and outgoing telephone calls.
.The story, which was reported the following day in La Nacin, one of the newspapers with the biggest circulation in Costa Rica, caused a national outcry. As the article pointed out,  the internal auditor of Banco Popular, with the authorization of its management board, engaged the services of two private detectives to investigate recent  leaks' to the press.' The article went on to state that one of the detectives, a former agent of the Judicial Police Assault Force, had been convicted of abuse of authority and has been one of the defendants in a case concerning the death of an alleged gangster who died a few hours after being arrested and taken to judicial police headquarters (a copy of La Nacin of  July  was attached).
.The article published by La Nacin, which was clearly very serious, caused great concern among the staff of Banco Popular, who felt obliged to question the Bank s national management board about the story. The last paragraph of their communication read as follows:The employees of Banco Popular request, along with its clients, seek clarification of the alleged incidents, which are such as could cause a loss of confidence in the Bank. If any such action had been perpetrated by any other employee, the same auditor s report would in no uncertain terms have called for an official administrative inquiry into the matter. We therefore believe that the national management board must take appropriate steps, treating everybody on an equal footing irrespective of their position in the Bank, so as to arrive at the truth of the matter and, above all, correct the poor image of the Bank given by the auditor s recruitment of a private investigation company (a copy of SIBANPO s communication ref. No. -S- was attached.)
.SIBANPO adds that, following this communication, the Bank s internal auditor brought criminal charges against the union s Secretary-General, Ms Oriette Zonta Elizondo, for libel, injury and defamation.
.The case was brought before the Criminal Court of the First Judicial Circuit of San Jos, which on  October  handed down decision No.  absolving Ms Oriette Zonta Elizondo of any blame and responsibility and citing the right of any union official to express his or her views on a public issue of national interest, and ruled she had not acted incorrectly.
.An appeal was lodged against the decision, but the appeal was rejected by the Third Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice on  August .
.Since then, the general manager of Banco Popular has repeatedly demanded that the union return part of the funds that it used in accordance with section  of the collective agreement to finance social, cultural and sporting activities (communications ref. Nos GGC-- of  March  and GGC-- of  April ). Moreover, the general manager has taken the unilateral decision to suspend the transfer of funds under section  for the periods of  and . This has seriously compromised the union s plans and programmes (communication ref. No. GGC--) and is designed to destabilize the union s finances and disrupt its social, cultural and sporting activities. The management s demands are altogether unacceptable, for the following reasons:(a) Regarding the demands that the union reimburse funds that have been transferred to it, the Bank s repeated demands are quite clearly inadmissible as they are based on irregular operational rules that were modified unilaterally without the union being consulted or even informed at any time.(b) Regarding the reimbursement of  million colones (CRC), it has been clearly shown that the sum was spent on the professional services of an expert who provided training for the employees of Banco Popular on matters of interest to the Bank (restructuring, draft Development Bank Act). The purpose for which these funds ' which at the time had been duly authorized by the general manager himself ' were used is altogether in conformity with the rules and regulations laid down in section  of the collective agreement.(c) As to the other funds whose reimbursement is being demanded, these were earmarked for activities conducted at the end of  in several of the Bank s offices. In , funds were transferred at the end of the year to SIBANPO, which it spent on cultural and sporting events, but the administration again decided to change the rules for their use without consulting or even informing the union. In Budget Department communication ref. No. SPR--, the general manager claims that it was the third time that SIBANPO had had to revise its accounts, but the fact is that, although the union submitted its account before the deadline, the administration changed the rules. Obviously, the union s invoices did not conform to changes that were introduced subsequently.
.The general manager s demands are in any case unfounded, since the purpose for which the transferred funds were used is entirely in accordance with section  of the collective agreement and with the invoices that were submitted along with all the relevant documentation.
.Furthermore, union member Ms Fressy Chavarra Marchena, who until  was the Disputes Secretary of SIBANPO s Executive Committee, has been a victim of systematic and insidious harassment. She was unjustly sanctioned several times, on one occasion on the basis of evidence that had been obtained illegally by the administration (communication ref. No. DDHO-- of  June ) ' namely, details of her Internet access that were divulged by officials responsible for computer security, as stated in a letter to Ms Chavarra dated  April . Her work productivity has also been questioned for no valid reason and without any preliminary investigation, and on a number of occasions she has been unjustly denied leave to take part in union activities (communication ref. No. DDHO - of  March ). Finally, the Director of the Human and Organizational Development Department of Banco Popular ordered the initiation of administrative proceedings against Ms Chavarra on the grounds that on  March , while on sick leave, she attended a seminar on  The impact of the financial and economic crisis on companies' human resources strategies'  Ms Chavarra s participation in the seminar was financed by SIBANPO as being of interest to the workers and to the union itself. SIBANPO adds that, because of the constant harassment suffered by Ms Chavarra, a complaint was lodged with the Ombudsperson setting out the repeated occasions on which she had been harassed.
.Finally, the complainant organization states that it is applying to the Committee on Freedom of Association because the senior management of Banco Popular is orchestrating an increasingly intense campaign against SIBANPO and engaging systematically in anti-union practices.
.In its communication of February , SIBANPO refers to a letter from the general manager dated  December  (enclosed) demanding illegally that the union reimburse the sum of CRC,, for the year , which had been transferred and duly authorized in accordance with section  of the collective agreement, This sum was earmarked for training activities organized by SIBANPO and for end-of-year social activities in which all the Bank s employees took part whether or not they were union members. SIBANPO again draws attention to the Bank s persistent attempts to force the union to reimburse funds which had been rightly transferred to it under the collective agreement and which had been duly authorized by the general management, completely disregarding the fact that the criminal courts have already ruled once and for all that the union had not acted improperly.
.In its communications dated  January and  April , the Government summarizes the principal allegations made by the complainant organization, as follows: (a) the trade",-1,2009,Costa Rica
47,"union has been the target of arbitrary anti-union and discriminatory measures promoted or carried out by representatives of the employer organization, the Banco Popular; (b) unjustified denial or restriction of paid union leave for officials and members of other bodies of the union; (c) lodging of criminal charges against the union s Secretary-General in connection with the administration of union funds; (d) criminal charges against the union Secretary-General for libel, injury and defamation; and (e) arbitrary administrative orders by management with the aim of destabilizing the union financially and undermining the union s social, cultural and sports programmes.
.The Government indicates that it communicated a copy of the complaint to the general manager of the Banco Popular y de Desarollo Comunal to enable it to address the allegations, which it did through a detailed report (sent with the Government s reply), and emphasizes that the law provides for transparency in the public service, underpinned by provisions for establishing, operating, maintaining, developing and assessing internal monitoring systems, in accordance with Act No. .
.With regard to the alleged arbitrary measures of an anti-union and discriminatory character, promoted or carried out by management representatives of the Bank, the complainant organization does not give any specific information that might be indicative of such arbitrary measures, and it is therefore difficult to address vague and unfounded claims. At any event, the management emphasizes that it acknowledges the protection provided by the law to all workers against any harmful act including dismissal. Similarly, the Constitutional Court acknowledges the right of employers to reorganize their companies and cut costs in order to achieve economic stability, which is in accordance with the constitutional right to engage in free trade, provided that the fundamental rights and liberties of citizens are not infringed. It is thus important to ensure a balance between those two areas of constitutional rights.
.With regard to the alleged denial and/or restriction of paid union leave for officials and members of other union bodies, the Government states that according to the Bank s report of  September , paid trade union leave both for union officials and for rank and rank file members is governed by clauses '  and  and  of the collective agreement in force in the Banco Popular. In that regard, the Bank s management states that it has not granted  per cent of the union leave that has been claimed, but that it cannot be claimed that the aim was to undermine the functioning of the union. The Bank s management indicates in its report that when such leave has been refused, the decision was justified by the necessity of ensuring, in specific circumstances, the effective functioning of the public service intended to benefit citizens in accordance with ILO Convention No. , according to which  The granting of such facilities shall not impair the efficient operation of the undertaking concerned.' The percentage of union leave applications actually granted is as follows:Result of application / Worker hours / PercentageLeave granted / . / .Leave not granted /  / .Applications not processed /  / .Total / . / .
.Consequently, taking into consideration the fact that leave applications not processed are those that are not granted because the official in question is on holiday and/or on sick leave, or the officials concerned are non-union members or indicate a wish not to participate, in only . per cent of the applications processed was leave refused, and in every case for work-related rather than anti-union reasons.
.As regards the allegation that the internal audit report of the Bank is biased and wishes to discredit the union and undermine its credibility with its members, the Government states that Costa Rica is a State based on the rule of law, whose civil servants are governed by public laws and regulations and by the principles of probity, respect and adherence to the law. In that regard, the Bank s management states that: ' .. it is this framework that should guide the actions of the Bank s management, the General Auditor, the Legal Affairs Director, and the Secretary-General of the complainant union'  It adds that there is an overriding obligation to report acts that are contrary to the sound administration of public funds and that the internal audit contested by the complainant was produced in that legal context.
.Giving further details, and referring to the auditor s report, the Bank s management in its report states that:It is not relevant here whether or not the funds available to the union under section  of the collective agreement were properly administered.What must be considered here is whether or not, once the Bank s General Auditor had established that they were not being administered properly, the criminal charges brought by the Bank constitute an infringement of freedom of association because their purpose, as the complaint has claimed, was to  discredit the union and cause it to lose credibility among the workers [...]'  The internal auditors of the State banks, like those of the Banco Popular, are sufficiently independent, even within the Bank s own management structure, to ensure that in order to remove them, the approval of the Comptroller General of the Republic is required. That is intended to ensure that they have sufficient autonomy to be able to investigate issues such as the administration of public funds even if administered by their own employer. The General Internal Inspection Act No.  of  June  provides that:  Section . Independence in respect of function and judgement: Officials of the Internal Audit Office shall carry out their functions in full independence in respect of their functions and judgements in relation to the management hierarchy and to other bodies of the administration' It follows that in the event that the general manager of the institution in question does not concur with the report, he or she is not free to refuse to implement it, to order it to be shelved, or to seek changes to it, other than by the procedures established by the Law itself.
.The management of the Bank acknowledges, on the other hand, that according to section  of the collective agreement in force, the Bank is required to allocate . per cent of the annual budget allowed for expenditure on staff services to the development of social, cultural and sports programmes for all workers; for that purpose public funds are made available to the union to allow it to organize events in accordance with the collective agreement. At the time of the events in question, however, the internal auditor s report drew attention to certain irregularities on the part of the Secretary-General of SIBANPO in connection with the administration of the public funds in question, on the grounds that approval had been given for the use of public funds remitted under the terms of section  of the collective agreement in order to cover costs arising from the union s own activities.
.In the light of the recommendations made in the internal audit, and in order to allow the appropriate investigation to be carried out with regard to the accounting and monitoring of the administration of public funds, the Bank s management lodged a formal criminal complaint with the prosecution service against that union s Secretary-General on  June . Subsequently, on  September , the Criminal Court of the Second Judicial Circuit of San Jos, set aside the complaint on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence of any irregularities in the facts referred to by the Bank s auditor.
.It is clearly the case that the union officials, like any other citizen, must enjoy the presumption of innocence, and must be ensured due process of law and be judged with the minimum delay by an impartial and independent judicial authority. This has been made clear by the Committee on Freedom of Association.
.However, the Committee has also indicated that it behoves the Government to show that the measures it has adopted are not motivated by the union s activities. The Committee has also stated that union office does not confer legal immunity or other such privileges.
.All the above requirements were respected by the Bank s management, as the Secretary-General was not denied the rights and guarantees due to her in a criminal case or those covered by the constitutional principle of due process; it is therefore not possible to conclude that there was any violation or infringement of freedom of association.
.The allegations made by the union are thus inaccurate in claiming that the Secretary-General s trade union rights and freedoms were infringed, since the facts must be seen in context, not in isolation and without taking into account the background and various indicators which appeared to warrant objective investigation by a court of law as an independent body.
.As regards the events of  July  in the offices of the internal auditor and the board of directors of the Bank, and the criminal charges brought against the Secretary-General of SIBANPO by another Bank employee, the",1,2009,Costa Rica
48,"Government states that, according to the general management, the disputes in question are such as would not be welcome to any company or institution, but that they do not come under the managerial remit of the employer. Freedom of opinion and expression are inherent aspects of freedom of association. Those rights must not, however, be regarded as absolute and unlimited. The Committee on Freedom of Association has stated that:The full exercise of trade union rights calls for a free flow of information, opinions and ideas, and to this end workers, employers and their organizations should enjoy freedom of opinion and expression at their meetings, in their publications and in the course of other trade union activities. Nevertheless, in expressing their opinions, trade union organizations should respect the limits of propriety and refrain from the use of insulting language.
.In the judgement of the Bank, in a case like this one, the employer could not exercise any form of control on information prior to its dissemination, but can do so once it has been made available.
.It should also be noted that the management of the Bank, in its report, drew attention to the fact that the person in this case who initiated the judicial proceedings was another worker, a colleague of the union s Secretary-General, rather than the management. From that perspective, it cannot be regarded as a violation of freedom of association, as the worker was seeking redress for what he considered to be an attack on his honour under the terms of national criminal law.
.With regard to the specific aspects of this case, the Bank s management state that: ' .. in cases of protest demonstrations in the context of labour relations, it is essential to strike the appropriate balance between the right of workers to act freely in defence of their own ideas and opinions, and the mandatory respect, among other things, that is due to the dignity and honour of persons at the workplace' 
.To date, as the union has indicated in its complaint, a ruling has been given in these proceedings to the effect that the charges were unfounded and the procedure complied with the applicable constitutional and legal rules.
.As regards the reimbursement of certain sums transferred under section  of the collective agreement for the period ' , the Government notes that the Bank s management in its report stated that SIBANPO was asked to reimburse the funds, a decision based on recommendations made by the Bank s internal audit office which must be implemented once endorsed by the director.
.In the same vein, the report in question warns the general management of the Bank that:  unjustified failure to honour internal monitoring obligations by the director and subordinate managers and staff carries administrative liability under the terms of section  of the General Internal Audit Act' 
.According to section  of the Act in question, managers, subordinate staff and other public officials incur administrative liability if through their actions or omissions they undermine the internal auditing system or fail to take appropriate action to establish, maintain, improve and assess such a system in accordance with the applicable technical regulations.
.Similarly, the Act in question stipulates that managers and subordinate staff also incur administrative and civil liability if they obstruct or delay the auditor, deputy auditor and other internal audit office staff in carrying out their tasks,
.It follows from the above that, although the report contains recommendations, if the director of the Bank deems them to be consistent with the Bank s own rules and such as to allow the Bank to operate in a financially efficient manner, they must be implemented in accordance with the General Internal Audit Act No. .
.Consequently, the actions of the Bank s general management were consistent with its obligations, given that the director and other officials are obliged, as public officials, to ensure that public funds are properly administered. That in no way constitutes unfair or discriminatory labour practice by the Bank s management, as the complainant organization claims.
.In any event, the Government is clear about the need to punish anti-union practices and does not hesitate to apply the full rigour of the law in cases where such acts can be shown to have occurred.
.The Government is working on improvements in national legislation in order to safeguard, to a greater extent, respect for the rights of unionized workers, in accordance with the constitutional guarantees of due process and legitimate defence, as has been indicated in its reports submitted in reply to questions regarding Cases Nos  and  that have been before the Committee.
.As regards the alleged acts of discrimination against members of SIBANPO s Executive Committee by the management of the Bank, the Government states that the union presenting the complaint refers, in general terms, to discrimination by the Bank against members of its Executive Committee, especially in the specific case of the Secretary-General, Ms Oriette Zonta Elizondo, on the grounds referred to in previous paragraphs, and in the case of the union s Disputes Secretary, Ms Fressy Chavarra Marchena.
.As regards the latter case, the Bank s general management states that the official in question is the subject of a disciplinary investigation because of her attendance at a training seminar under the heading:  The impact of the financial and economic crisis on human resources strategies in companies'  although she was unable to work at the time for health reasons. Nevertheless, in accordance with the views of the Bank s general management and for the sake of presenting evidence suggesting a misrepresentation of the facts, some of the management s statements are set out below.Firstly, although no one can question the fact that freedom of association is a fundamental right, it is not absolute but subject to certain limits.When the conduct of a trade union representative or member goes beyond what is indispensible to that fundamental right, he or she cannot be protected and consequently must accept the disciplinary liability that may ensue from that conduct.This is the case that concerns us here. Ms Chavarra Marchena requested union leave on  March  to attend a training course in her area of activity but was informed on  March by her superiors that leave was not granted because she was required to finish some prior work. Following a further request, explanations were given of the work-related reasons for the refusal. On  March, Ms Chavarra reported being incapacitated for health reasons as of that day, and until  April, and on  March she attended the training course for which she had requested leave.Given these facts, a minimum of reasoning ability would suggested that further scrutiny was warranted in order to corroborate the truth or otherwise of the reported incapacity. Even if her health were known to be poor, the compatibility of the latter with her attendance at the course would be questionable. The Bank decided to report what had happened to the preliminary commission to enable it to ascertain whether or not there was sufficient evidence to justify disciplinary proceedings. The preliminary commission is an internal bipartite body created under the collective agreement concluded with the complainant organization and has the mandate, as its title suggests, of carrying out preliminary investigations into reports of contraventions of labour agreements and standards with a view to determining whether there is insufficient evidence to justify disciplinary proceedings against a Bank employee. Once the commission had been briefed on the case at an ordinary session No. - on  June , its members decided unanimously to order the establishment of a steering body for proceedings against Ms Chavarra Marchena. The unanimous decision was thus also supported by the vote of the SIBANPO representative, that is, Ms Chavarra s own trade union colleague, who was the nominated representative of the complainant organization s Secretary-General. That the complainant union should accuse its own representative of an anti-union act is absurd.In addition, on  July this year, the Steering Body for the Administrative Proceedings set a date by which Ms Chavarra could submit such evidence as she might consider appropriate for her defence, and she also had the right to attend the hearing accompanied by a union representative. Until such time as the proceedings are concluded, it will not be possible to know with certainty whether there was any misconduct or what the appropriate sanction, if any, would be, but the procedure adopted for the investigation is governed by the General Law on Public Administration, which guarantees citizens due process and the constitutional right of defence.The same procedure applied with regard to the warning issued to Ms Chavarra for reportedly accessing Internet sites unrelated to her work; as was reported in official communication No. DDHO-- dated  April , when the report was received from the Bank s Information Technology Department, she was given the opportunity to formulate her defence after the contents of the report referring to her had been passed on, the evidence was examined, and finally the appropriate sanction was imposed, as is",1,2009,Costa Rica
49,"the case with any other employee of the Bank who commits the same offence.It is generally understood that with banks, IT security is far more delicate and requires more stringent preventive checks than are considered usual in other forms of economic activity.
.The Government concludes by stating that it has been shown that the actions of the management of the Bank and its board of directors was in no way motivated by anti-union considerations, and indeed was based on the recommendations made by the internal audit office, and the administrative and judicial procedures followed under the relevant constitutional and legal provisions. All this, in the view of the general management, was aimed at achieving better internal functioning and more appropriate management of public funds.
.In the light of the substantive and legal reasoning set out above, the Government requests that the Committee on Freedom of Association reject the complaint of SIBANPO, given that the actions of the management representatives of the Bank are consistent with the principles of law that prevail in Costa Rica and with the principles and rights ensuing from freedom of association and that the measures taken were not motivated by anti-union reasons.
.The Committee observes that in this case the complainant organization alleges that Banco Popular y de Desarrollo Comunal (BPDC), which is a public entity, has been conducting a campaign to undermine and destabilize SIBANPO and its leaders by means of a series of anti-union acts. The Committee observes that many of the alleged incidents have been submitted to the judicial authorities and that the criminal charges brought against the union s leaders have been dismissed, namely: () a criminal charge against the Secretary-General alleging the use of funds transferred to the union by the Bank for purposes other than those provided for in the collective agreement ' rejected by decision of the judicial authority on  September ; and () a criminal charge brought by the Bank s representatives against the same union leader for libel, injury and defamation ' dismissed by the judicial authority in its ruling of  October , and again on appeal on  August , on the grounds that she was exercising her right as a union leader to express her views on a public matter implicating the Bank. As regards point (), the Committee notes the statements made by the Bank s general management to the effect that the criminal charge against the union s Secretary-General was made when the internal audit office found evidence of apparent irregularities perpetrated by the union official in the use of the public funds in question, which had been transferred under section  of the collective agreement; unjustified failure to meet the obligations in respect of internal auditing is a matter of administrative responsibility for the employer under the terms of the General Internal Audit Act; the resulting complaint thus has no anti-union objective and was not upheld by the judicial authority. As regards the charge against the same union official for libel, injury and defamation, the Committee notes that according to the Bank s management, the charge was made by a colleague of the official in question in an attempt to obtain redress for what he considered to be an attack on his honour, and not by the Bank s management, which has confirmed that the charge was rejected by the judicial authority. Taking into account the judicial rulings which did not uphold the two criminal charges in question, the Committee will not pursue its examination of these allegations.
.The Committee also notes that the complainant alleges that: () between March and April , the Bank demanded the reimbursement of funds that had been transferred to the union to finance social, cultural and sporting activities under the collective agreement; and () the Bank decided unilaterally to suspend the transfer of funds scheduled under the collective agreement for the periods of  and . The Committee notes that, according to the Bank s management, the reimbursement of these sums by the union was demanded by the Bank as a result of enforceable recommendations made by the internal audit office, and did not constitute discriminatory or unfair practice.
.In its latest communication of February , the complainant alleges that the Bank is also demanding repayment of CRC,, for , an amount which was likewise transferred to the union in accordance with the collective agreement and which SIBANPO states was spent on training activities organized by the union and on social activities in which all the Bank s employees took part, whether or not they were union members. The complainant notes that this latter demand totally disregards the decision of the judicial authority on  September  rejecting a previous complaint by the Bank against the union s Secretary-General for the same reason.
.The Committee wishes to point out that, although collective agreements are mandatory, it is not in a position to determine whether each of the payments made by a trade union from funds transferred to it by an employer for training or for social and cultural activities conformed to the rules laid down in the collective agreement. Moreover, the Committee believes that, the constant resort to the courts to resolve disputes between the union and the Bank deriving from the lodging of criminal charges ' even though the charges against the union were dismissed ' has deteriorated relations between the parties concerned, because of the length of the judicial proceedings (two years), and has hampered the normal exercise of trade union rights. The Committee suggests that the complainant organization and the Bank consider the possibility of setting up a joint committee under the collective agreement to verify periodically the legality of the activities financed by funds whose management the collective agreement assigns to the trade union. The Committee requests the Government to pass on this recommendation to the complainant trade union and to the Bank and to keep it informed of any development in this regard.
.Regarding the Bank s alleged refusal without reason to allow members of the complainant organization to take paid union leave, in violation of the terms of the collective agreement, the Committee notes that, according to SIBANPO, several of its members have been denied leave to carry out training and other activities and that its officials and the members of its electoral committee have likewise been refused leave. The Committee notes that, according to the Bank s management, . per cent of leave requests were granted, and refusals were justified on work-related grounds rather than being for any anti-union motives. The Committee emphasizes in this regard that it is not in a position to verify whether or not in each specific case the Bank s refusal to grant trade union leave conformed to the terms of the collective agreement. Consequently, the Committee suggests that disputes over trade union leave provided for in the collective agreement be submitted to a joint committee, which could be presided over by an independent personality so as to ensure that SIBANPO can in practice use its right to union leave under the collective agreement without prejudice to the smooth running of the Bank. The Committee requests the Government to pass on this recommendation to the trade union and to the Bank and to keep it informed of developments.
.Regarding the allegations concerning Ms Fressy Chavarra Marchena, until recently SIBANPO s Disputes Secretary, the Committee notes that Ms Chavarra has allegedly been the victim of constant harassment at work: questions of her work productivity, denial of leave, several administrative sanctions ' including on one occasion on the basis of evidence obtained illegally by the management ' and initiation of disciplinary proceedings for attending a SIBANPO seminar on the impact of the financial crisis while on sick leave, even though her attendance was funded by the union. The Committee notes the Government s statement to the effect that, according to the management of the Bank, the trade union leave requested on  March  for the purpose of attending a training course in the worker s area of competence could not be granted because the worker in question had to complete some prior work. Subsequently, according to the Bank, she reported sick, but on the following day attended the training course, and administrative proceedings against her were therefore initiated by a unanimous decision of an internal tripartite commission which included a vote in favour of that measure by the representative of the complainant organization, who had been nominated by the union official. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the aforementioned administrative proceedings. The Committee also notes that, according to the Bank s management, the trade union official in question was given a warning in the context of a procedure which respected the right of defence and had been instituted because the individual concerned had accessed Internet sites unrelated to her work.
.In general terms, the Committee notes that this case refers to a substantial number of disputes between the Bank and the trade union. The Committee",0,2009,Costa Rica
50,"trusts that both parties will make an effort to improve the climate of their labour relations and will in the very near future establish the dispute settlement mechanisms suggested in the conclusions outlined above.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee suggests that the complainant organization and the Bank consider the possibility of setting up a joint committee under the collective agreement to verify periodically the legality of the activities financed by funds whose management the collective agreement assigns to the trade union. The Committee requests the Government to pass on this recommendation to the complainant trade union and to the Bank and to keep it informed of any developments in this respect.(b) The Committee suggests that disputes over trade union leave provided for in the collective agreement also be submitted to the joint committee referred to in the preceding paragraph, whose chairperson could be an independent personality so as to ensure that SIBANPO can in practice exercise its right to union leave under the collective agreement without prejudice to the smooth running of the Bank. The Committee requests the Government to pass on this recommendation to the trade union and to the Bank and to keep it informed of developments in this respect.(c) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the administrative proceedings against the Disputes Secretary of the complainant organization.(d) In general terms, the Committee notes that this case refers to a considerable number of disputes between the Bank and the trade union. The Committee trusts that both parties will make an effort to improve the climate of their labour relations and will in the very near future establish the disputes settlement machinery suggested in the recommendations above.",1,2009,Costa Rica

.The Government sent its observations in a communication of December .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  July , the SITAGAH alleges that the Standard Fruit Company, in disregard of trade union immunity, has carried out anti-union dismissals. It refers specifically to the following: () Isaac Eliel Garca Mendoza, dismissed on  May  following his appointment as workers' representative on  April ; () Filemn Velsquez Rayo, dismissed on  May ; () Freddy Mena Prez, dismissed on  March ; () Wilberth Enrique Hernndez Prez, dismissed on  March  (joined the union on  March ); () Jos Ros Duarte, dismissed on  March  (joined the union on  January ); () Santos Gonzlez Garca, dismissed on  March  (joined the union on  November ); and () Arturo Meneses Prez, dismissed on  March  (Undersecretary-General of SITAGAH since  January ).
.The complainant states that the company signed an agreement with the Coordinating Committee of the Costa Rica Banana Workers' Unions in  and thereby undertook to respect freedom of association, but the agreement has not in fact been respected. It adds that the Coordinating Committee and the company met on a number of occasions (on  September ;  April,  June,  and  July,  September and  October ; and  March and  April ) in order to discuss matters of concern to the complainant organization, including the issue of the dismissals referred to above, but failed to obtain results.
.Lastly, the complainant states that the Government authorities have taken no steps to prevent these anti-union dismissals and is failing to guarantee the basic right to unionize, which exists only in theory,  on paper'  not in reality.
.In its communication of December , the Government states that Costa Rica is endeavouring to respect freedom of association in all its aspects: freedom to join and leave a union; respect for union pluralism; autonomy of unions to act freely and independently of the State or employers; etc. The Ministry of Labour and Social Security, through the National Labour Inspection Directorate, ensures that labour legislation is respected, including legislation relating to trade union rights. In this regard, and in accordance with the Labour Code, the inspectorate intervenes in procedures relating to unfair employment practices which include unjustified or unlawful dismissals.
.The Government states that Administrative Directive No. - establishes a new streamlined and updated procedure for dealing with cases of unfair employment practice. This Directive stipulates that complaints of such practices must be dealt with within two months.
.With regard to the specific allegations in this case, the Government states that the company sent a report through a note dated  October , which states among other things that none of the dismissals was due specifically to union membership; they were part of a general measure that was applied to groups  and  of the Zurqui plantation and was due to the project of modernizing the plantation and matching production to market demand; and the measure was applied throughout the banana sector, not just to the Zurqui plantation. According to the company, as African and Caribbean countries have increased their share of banana production since , competition from a number of Latin American countries and a fall in productivity of Costa Rica s banana plantations have all led to increasing pressure to improve productivity in the country s plantations. This has led to modernization programmes, involving production control based on the use of cuttings and new planting with a view to restoring productivity. According to the company, both SITAGAH and the Coordinating Committee were informed of this situation before the measures were put into effect. Currently, there are unionized workers working on the plantation in areas not affected by the modernization programmes of . The company states that it has openly offered work on the plantation to workers laid off in connection with the modernization programme but the offer was not accepted by the union, despite the fact that work had already resumed in those areas. The company emphasizes that, despite this offer, none of the complainants has applied to the plantation for work, which proves that there is no foundation to the allegations of anti-union harassment made by SITAGAH. According to the company, the unionized worker Filemn Velsquez Rayo is working on the plantation.
.The Government states that the lay-offs carried out by the company are clearly not part of any supposed anti-union persecution but rather necessitated by modernization programmes involving production control with cuttings and new planting with the aim of restoring productivity of banana plantations and matching banana production to international demand. As regards failure to respect trade union immunity, the Government recalls that this comprises a range of measures intended to protect union officials from possible harm as a result of their union activities, but that protection is in no way intended to be unlimited. In this regard, the Constitutional Court in its jurisprudence has consistently stated that trade union immunity is not unlimited, and union officials can therefore be dismissed if there is good reason, in accordance with labour legislation and the principles of due process.
.The Committee notes that, in this case, the complainant organization alleges the anti-union dismissal of a union official and six union members between March and May  on a banana plantation, and that the Government takes no steps to guarantee the free exercise of trade union rights. The Committee notes that the complainant organization does not refer to any judicial proceedings that might have been instigated in connection with those dismissals, and that the company indicates that the unionized worker Filemn Velsquez Rayo is currently working on the plantation.
.The Committee notes from the Government s reply that the company indicates that: () none of the dismissals alleged were due specifically to the union membership of the individuals concerned; () the dismissals applied to everyone in groups  and  at the Zurqui plantation, and were connected with the programme of modernization; () the measure was not unique to the Zurqui plantation but a general one that applied to the entire banana sector; () as more African and Caribbean countries have entered the banana market since , and the competitivity of some Latin American countries has increased, while the productivity of Costa Rica s own banana plantations has fallen, there has been strong pressure to become more competitive, which has led to modernization programmes involving production control based on the use of cuttings and new planting to restore productivity; () SITAGAH and the Coordinating Committee of Costa Rica Banana Workers' Unions were informed of this objective situation before the measures were applied; () unionized workers are currently working on the plantation in areas not affected by the modernization programmes of ; and () there has been an open offer of employment on the plantation for workers who were laid off in connection with the modernization programmes, but the offer was not accepted by the union, despite the fact that work had resumed in those areas, and no one applied for work, which proves that there is no basis for the allegation by SITAGAH of trade union harassment.
.Taking into account this information, and in particular the fact that the company has offered to rehire the dismissed workers referred to in this case, the Committee will not pursue its examination of these allegations.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to decide that the present case does not call for further examination.",0,2009,Costa Rica
52,".The Committee last examined this case at its November  meeting when it made the following recommendations on the matters still pending [see th Report, para. ]:The Committee looks forward to hearing the ruling that is handed down on Dr Sonia Romn s (trade union leader of the National Medical Union) trade union leave. The Committee requests the Government to indicate whether, following the Constitutional Chamber s ruling on the dismissal of the trade union official Mr Salas Sarks (of the UPINS trade union), Mr Sarks has filed new administrative or judicial appeals.
.In its communications dated  September , the Government refers to communications dated  January and  August  (not received by the ILO) which, according to the Government, show that the actions of the authorities complied with national law and the principles of the ILO.
.The Committee takes note of this information provided by the Government but must point out that the communications of  January and  August  have not been received and requests that they be resent.
.At its November  meeting, the Committee formulated the following recommendations on the issues that were still pending [see st Report, para. ]:(a) the Committee requests the Government to make further efforts to bring the parties together with a view to re-examining the extent of the hours of Dr Romn s trade union leave, taking into account both the needs of the union and of a sustainable enterprise.(b) With regard to UPINS, the Committee appreciates the Government s efforts since the beginning of  to convene meetings and create room for dialogue between the parties to find an appropriate solution. The Committee requests the Government to continue promoting dialogue between the parties and to inform it of the result of the appeal for amparo filed by the General Secretary of UPINS against his dismissal in order to be able to examine this question with all the elements.
.In its communication of  June  (received at ILO headquarters in April ), the National Medical Union (UMN) states that, by a decision of  February , the National Director and Inspector-General of Labour decided to lodge a complaint of unfair practices against the National Insurance Institute for refusing to grant trade union leave to the trade union official, Dr Sonia Romn on the same terms that she had been granted for  years and, on  February , it submitted a formal complaint to the judicial authority.
.In its communications of  April and  June , the Government states that it will provide information on the result of the judicial process against the National Insurance Institute relating to Dr Sonia Romn s trade union leave, and indicated that Dr Romn is no longer a member of the UMN s executive, therefore, in the Government s opinion, the allegations are not of current interest.
.With regard to the dismissal of Mr Luis Alberto Salas Sarks, General Secretary of the National Insurance Institute Staff Union (UPINS), the Government states that measures have been arranged with the aim of promoting dialogue between the parties in order to reach a solution that is satisfactory for all involved, including a meeting between the trade union officials concerned and the authorities, and another with the President of the Republic. The Government adds that the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice refused the appeal for protection (amparo) filed by Mr Salas Sarks against his dismissal. The Government sends the ruling which states the following with regard to the substance of the case:The appellant (Mr Salas Sarks) claims that due process was violated in three ways. Firstly, management is trying to dismiss him although he has not committed any wrongdoing in the exercise of his post, as the actions attributed to him were carried out in his role as a trade unionist. According to the final report of the panel that conducted the disciplinary proceedings, the Institute, in its dealings with the defendant, granted several instances of trade union leave with pay so that Alicia Vargas Obando could participate in trade union activities, although in reality the leave was used for other activities. This Chamber considers that determining if this was committed in the role of a trade union member or in another capacity is a matter outside the authority of a constitutional court. This was in fact at the very core of the discussion during the administrative proceeding. Consequently, the appellant s opposition to decisions arising from the administrative proceeding must be channelled through existing administrative appeals. Secondly, in the factual report above, it was proven that the transfer of charges was done in a valid way, given that Mr Sarks knew about the charges against him, the legislation that was infringed and his rights in the administrative proceeding initiated against him. Lastly, the defendant may exercise his right to defence by giving notice of the appeals provided for by the legal system. He took part in the private oral hearing, where he had the opportunity to question the witnesses more than once and actively defend his rights. Once again, the grounds and proportionality between the offence and the penalty are set out as part of the disciplinary proceeding itself, or possibly as part of industrial proceedings. Contrary to what the appellant appears to assume, there is no constitutional right to a less serious penalty. For these reasons, the appellant s reservations cannot be considered as having any grounds, which is why the appeal is dismissed.
.The Committee takes note of the information from the Government. The Committee looks forward to hearing the ruling that is handed down on Dr Sonia Romn s trade union leave. The Committee requests the Government to indicate whether, following the Constitutional Chamber s ruling on the dismissal of the trade union official Mr. Salas Sarks, Mr Sarks has filed new administrative or judicial appeals.
.The complaints are contained in communications of the National Medical Union (UMN) and the General Confederation of Workers (CGT) dated  and  October , respectively. The Government sent its observations in communications dated  February and  May .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and also the Workers' Representatives Convention,  (No. ).

53,".In its previous examination of the case in March , the Committee made the following recommendations on the questions still pending [see th Report, para. ]:With respect to the dismissals of the trade union leaders, Mr Teodoro Martnez Martnez, Mr Amado Daz Guevara (member of the Committee on the Implementation of the Regional Agreement IUF/Colsiba/Chiquita), Mr Ricardo Peck Montiel and Mr Manuel Murillo de la Rosa, the Committee regrets the long period that has elapsed since the commencement of the current court proceedings without rulings being handed down up to now, trusts that the current judicial proceedings will be brought to a conclusion rapidly and requests the Government to keep it informed of their outcome.With regard to the possibility of the ILO Subregional Office undertaking an independent inquiry in the banana sector into the allegations concerning the keeping of blacklists, the Committee notes the acceptance of such a mission by the Government and expects that it will be carried out in the very near future. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any developments in this respect.
.In its communication of  September , the Government provides information on the status of the judicial proceedings involving the trade union officials Teodoro Martnez Martnez (first instance ruling to be handed down shortly), Amado Daz Guevara (enforceable judgement in the worker s favour), Peck Montiel (ruling being appealed), and Manuel Murillo de la Rosa (enforceable judgement in the worker s favour).
.The Government adds that it would appear from the foregoing information that the judicial cases have been dealt with in the appropriate manner and resolved in strict compliance with the existing guarantees of access to justice and the principle of due process as provided for in Costa Rican law.
.The Committee takes note of this information and requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the judicial proceedings instigated by the union official Teodoro Martnez Martnez following his dismissal, and of the appeal lodged in connection with the dismissal of union official Peck Montiel.
.As regards the recommendation concerning the possibility of the ILO Subregional Office undertaking an independent investigation in the banana sector into the allegations concerning the keeping of blacklists, the Government cautions that this is an issue of which the new labour and social security authorities have been informed only recently. For this reason, before agreeing to the possibility of carrying out the mission in question in the country, the Government considers it advisable to reconsider, from a different viewpoint, the request made initially by the supervisory body for an independent investigation in the banana sector. It should be borne in mind that labour inspection is a priority area for the current administration and is being strengthened by institutional projects and the support of international cooperation. Consequently, the Government wishes to formally reconsider its agreement to allow the mission, as it considers that the competent authorities are meeting their obligations and carrying out their functions with regard to supervision and will continue to give particular importance to this sector of the national economy.
.The Committee takes note of this information, and considers that there is no disadvantage in allowing the labour inspectorate to conduct the investigation into the alleged use of blacklists in the banana sector. The Committee trusts that the Government will be in a position to communicate the results of that investigation before long.
.The Committee last examined the substance of this case at its March  meeting, when it presented an interim report for approval by the Governing Body [see rd Report, paras ' , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session].
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  June .
.Costa Rica has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.At its March  meeting [see the th Report, para. ], the Committee made the following recommendations:(a) The Committee expects that the various bills currently in progress in relation to the slowness and ineffectiveness of administrative and judicial procedures in cases of anti-union practices, on which the Government provides information, will be adopted in the very near future and that they will be in full conformity with the principles of freedom of association.(b) As to the alleged discrimination in favour of the permanent workers' committees to the detriment of the trade unions, while noting that the Government has submitted this issue to a tripartite body and that it intends to adopt measures regarding the report made by an independent investigator in this respect, the Committee expects that appropriate solutions will be found to the problem of collective agreements with non-unionized workers referred to when the case was last examined.(c) In the absence of information from the Government regarding certain allegations, the Committee expects that, together with any information the enterprises might wish to transmit, the Government will send its observations in due course regarding the following recommendations made in November , which are reproduced below:' in regard to the Chiquita Cobal enterprise, the Committee requests the Government to inform it: () whether trade union officials Mr Teodoro Martnez Martnez, Mr Amado Daz Guevara, member of the Committee on the Implementation of the Regional Agreement between the IUF/COLSIBA and Chiquita, Mr Juan Francisco Reyes and Mr Ricardo Peck Montiel have initiated judicial proceedings concerning their dismissals and, if so, of the status of these proceedings; () of the grounds for the dismissal of Mr Reinaldo Lpez Gonzlez and the reasons why the court ruling ordering his reinstatement was not executed, and to send it a copy of the agreement that is to be signed by the enterprise and the worker; and () of the grounds for the dismissal of Mr Manuel Murillo de la Rosa and the status of the court proceedings concerning his dismissal;' in regard to the Chiquita-Chiriqu Land Company, the Committee requests the Government to inform it whether, in the process of the negotiations which the company says it has conducted with the trade union, it was decided to reinstate the dismissed trade unionists and members and, if not, to inform it of the grounds for the dismissals and whether judicial proceedings have been initiated in this regard.(d) The Committee urges the Government, as previously requested, to take all steps at its disposal so as to promote collective bargaining between the employers and their organizations on the one hand, and the organizations of workers on the other, in order to regulate the conditions of work in the enterprise Desarrollo Agroindustrial de Frutales SA and to keep it informed in this respect.(e) The Committee understands that the Government is prepared to accept a mission sent by the Subregional Office so that an independent inquiry can be carried out into the allegations concerning the keeping of blacklists in the banana sector, and hopes that the necessary measures will be taken to provide this assistance as soon as possible.
.In its communication of  June , the Government sent its observations in relation to the recommendations made by the Committee at its March  meeting.
.With regard to recommendation (a), the Government notes the recommendations made by the Committee concerning the present case, particularly with regard to the urgency of approving the various bills currently in progress in relation to the slowness and ineffectiveness of administrative and judicial procedures in cases of anti-union practices. In this regard, it should be recalled that the Government of Costa Rica has made efforts to promote the approval of the above bills and it reiterates its will to resolve the problems raised. The Government considers that the solution to the problems affecting the country has to be found through the joint efforts of the representatives of the three authorities of the Republic, the executive, legislative and judicial authorities, with a view to the adoption as laws of the Republic of the set of bills that are currently going through the legislative process and which are intended to strengthen the effect given in practice to Convention No. , under the terms indicated by the ILO. The Government is aware that the efforts to resolve the problems identified in the country need to be undertaken on a joint basis and indicates that work is being carried out on this process.
.To illustrate the interest of the Ministry of Labour and with a view to strengthening the measures to guarantee effective compliance with the principle of collective bargaining in the public sector, the Minister of Labour, via official letter No. DMT-- of  January , requested the Minister of the Office of the President to push forward the whole group of bills to contribute to strengthening the right of collective bargaining, including the bills approving Conventions Nos  and  of the ILO and the draft reform of labour procedures. Despite the fact that approval is still pending for the these bills, in which the highest authorities of the country are showing interest, when analysing the delay in the approval of",1,2006,Costa Rica
54,"the bills, on which the Committee of Experts was consulted, the events in the country in recent years have to be taken into consideration. In the first place, on  October , in a binding referendum, the Free Trade Agreement concluded by Central America, the Dominican Republic and the United States was approved. With the implementation of this Agreement, the Members of Parliament embarked on the examination, discussion and approval of a series of bills which had to be tabled alongside the Treaty and which formed an additional legislative agenda. These bills took up the attention of the Members of Parliament until the end of  in both their ordinary and extraordinary sessions. In brief, the long discussions on the Free Trade Agreement and the approval of the additional laws delayed examination of the reforms to labour procedures and compliance with the Agreement of the Higher Labour Council of October .
.In addition, at the present time, the Government is focusing its efforts on dealing with the situation arising out of the global financial crisis as it affects the families of Costa Rica, men and women workers, enterprises and, in general terms, the financial sector of the country, as other governments throughout the world are doing. In this respect, Costa Rica is no exception and this situation is even having an impact on the order in which draft legislation is examined by the Legislative Assembly, which is currently engaged in the examination of the bills tabled under the  Escudo Plan' presented by the President of the Republic. The Escudo Plan does not constitute a reform of the Labour Code, but consists of a series of temporary measures, the principal objective of which is social protection and economic stimulus in the face of the international crisis. The Plan is based on four pillars, which are the beneficiaries of the Government s measures: families, workers, enterprises and the financial sector. One of the components of the Plan is Bill No.  on the protection of labour in times of crisis, which provides for the possibility of the conclusion of an agreement between employers and workers under which, in the light of the crisis, enterprises undertake to reduce the number of hours worked by their employees, without reducing the value of the hour not performed by the worker, on condition that there are no dismissals. Managers and high-level executives are also urged to reduce their salaries.
.Furthermore, through this Bill it is hoped to promote new working arrangements in law, which will have a direct effect on the creation of employment, as it has had in other countries. The Bill is currently going through the legislative process of being discussed and examined. Alongside the Bill, it is intended to promote telework in private enterprises, which will offer major benefits for the public sector, as it involves a reduction in costs. Enterprises will accordingly have to consider reducing costs through this system before cutting back their staff. In addition to these measures, it is planned to implement a programme of grants to train , workers in enterprises affected by the crisis with a view to encouraging enterprises not to reduce their payroll, but to keep their employees on and at the same time train them in fields such as English, computer skills and the management of micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises.
.Moreover, on  March , the launch was officially announced of the Young Entrepreneurs Programme. This is a proposal intended for young persons between  and  years of age who want to become entrepreneurs. The Programme is designed to develop an enterprise culture among the young, providing them with the essential skills to become good entrepreneurs and persons who contribute to national development. Another important measure is the extension of the period of health insurance coverage for persons who have stopped working, so that for six months after leaving their jobs, they and their families continue to be covered by the scheme to which they were paying contributions while they find another job. The Escudo Plan has been submitted to the International Labour Office for analysis and its comments are currently awaited.
.The Government indicates that, on  May , the President of the Republic received in the Presidential Residence a group of representatives of the social sectors with a view to listening to and considering their Ten-Point Proposal to address the crisis in the country. This response is based on two principal approaches: the first is from the viewpoint of the supply of decent work, and the second from the viewpoint of the demand for decent work. The first element proposes the promotion of productive activities by refocusing on the socio roductive function of the financial system, guaranteed security and food sovereignty, as well as agricultural employment. A system of conditional transfers is also established to promote decent work by minimizing dismissals for economic reasons and promoting social, labour and environmental investment. As these initiatives are intended to mitigate the negative impact of the global economic crisis in the various sectors of the national economy, they require the attention of the Members of Parliament for their examination and rapid implementation, which makes it necessary to leave aside temporarily the examination and approval of other draft legislation, including the bills relating to the effectiveness and rapidity of protection procedures against anti-union discrimination and for collective bargaining in the public sector.
.The Government of Costa Rica therefore retains the hope that, once the response to the economic crisis has been dealt with, the Legislative Assembly will take up again all the bills relating to anti-union discrimination and collective bargaining in the public sector and that they will be approved in the near future. With regard to the progress of the various bills in the Legislative Assembly, it should be noted that Bill No.  to reform various sections of the Labour Code, of Act No.  of  August , and sections , , ,  and  of Decree No.  of  November , and their amended texts, is near the top of the agenda of the Legislative Plenary. Bill No.  to reform labour procedures is currently being examined by a subcommittee set up by the Standing Committee on Legal Affairs of the Legislative Assembly and it is hoped that it will be tabled during the ordinary sessions to be held from May to October .
.The Bill to reform labour procedures is an integrated proposal incorporating the recommendations of the ILO Committee on Freedom of Association in relation to the matters under examination. It is the outcome of a broad consultation process set in motion by the Supreme Court of Justice. It has benefited from the financial support of the Government of Canada and from ILO technical assistance. Emphasis should be placed on the participation of titular and substitute magistrates of the Second Chamber, labour judges, law professionals specializing in labour law, officials of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, representatives of employers' chambers and of trade unions, among others. The Bill addresses the subject of the slowness of procedures in the case of anti-union action and strengthens the right to collective bargaining in the public sector. Essentially, it seeks to simplify judicial procedures and make them more rapid, including those relating to anti-union acts, by replacing written proceedings by oral hearings, as well as strengthening the application in practice of the right to collective bargaining in the public sector and reinforcing protection against anti-union acts.
.It is important to indicate that official letter No. DMT--, of  May , submitted to the subcommittee of the Standing Committee on Legal Affairs of the Legislative Assembly the study on the Bill to reform labour procedures, which was prepared with the technical assistance requested by the Ministry of Labour to ensure that all the terms of the Bill are in compliance with the provisions of ILO Conventions Nos  and . This was done so that the comments by ILO experts were taken into consideration in the analysis of the Bill. The bill respecting the negotiation of collective agreements in the public sector, and the addition of subsection  to section  of the General Act on the Public Administration, is being examined by the Standing Committee on Legal Affairs of the Legislative Assembly. It was placed in st position at the last sitting of the ordinary session held on  November  and a legal report has now been prepared by the Technical Services Department of the Legislative Assembly, through official letter No. ST-. It is expected that it will be tabled during the ordinary session at the initiative of the Members of Parliament.
.In view of the significance of the joint efforts made by the executive and judicial authorities and the principal social partners, guided by ILO technical advice, the Government hopes that the bills, once they have been analysed and studied by the Legislative Plenary session, will be adopted as laws of the Republic in the near future. On various occasions, the Committee on",0,2006,Costa Rica
55,"Freedom of Association has been informed of the comments received from the Second Chamber and the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice. In the present case, the comments are being forwarded that were received from the current President on  April . The President of the Second Chamber transmitted his observations to the Office of the President of the Supreme Court of Justice on  March . In his communication he indicated, with regard to the principle of collective bargaining, that the Supreme Court of Justice has endeavoured to achieve its effective implementation through legal provisions which make it possible and practicable in reality. In this respect, reference is made to the Bill to reform labour procedures, with the indication that the Bill has not received the agreement of the social organizations in relation to certain provisions, including those relating to the percentage of workers required to call a strike and engage in protest action. He adds that he held a meeting with the Standing Committee on Legal Affairs (where the Bill is currently being examined), with a view to determining the bills of interest to the judicial authorities, and on that occasion the Bill to reform labour procedures was included as a priority.
.With regard to the subject of the slowness of administrative and judicial procedures in cases of anti-union persecution, it should be noted that the Supreme Court of Justice, in addition to promoting the Bill to reform labour procedures, has made other significant efforts to resolve this problem, which are documented in the reports on its activities. These efforts include the allocation of increased human resources to the labour courts, as well as strengthening the operation of the courts through the extension of electronic links with external institutions, such as the CCSS, the INS and the Public Registry, with a view to facilitating judicial processes in labour procedures, and the purchase of digital recording equipment for use in oral hearings. Emphasis should be placed on the establishment of smaller labour tribunals in various areas of the country with a view to accelerating procedures, particularly as the rules governing these services are characterized by the principle of oral proceedings. It is hoped that these decisions will contribute to improving the service in this jurisdiction and that users can have their cases settled in a more appropriate time period. The Government adds that a workshop was successfully held on  June  in the Legislative Assembly on  The Impact of the Reform of Labour Procedures'  The most important conclusions of this activity concern the importance of focusing discussion on the Bill to reform labour procedures on the points of divergence in the social sectors so as to make progress in its examination, thereby guaranteeing access to justice as a human right.
.The Government hopes to be able to make tangible progress in its efforts to give effect to ILO Convention No. , particularly through the establishment of a joint commission (unions, employers, the executive, legislative and judicial authorities), with the technical assistance of the ILO, with a view to promoting and developing consensus concerning the text of the Bill to reform labour procedures, which is currently before the legislative bodies.
.With regard to recommendation (b) concerning the examination of the ILO report on direct settlements, prepared by an independent investigator, it is necessary to note that it was submitted by the Minister of Labour to the Higher Labour Council, a tripartite body reporting to the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, and was discussed at its meetings on  April and  June . Nevertheless, it has not been possible for the Council, at least at present, to continue the discussion of the report on direct settlements as it has had to attend to other priority subjects, including the reform of labour procedures and the Decent Work Country Programme. Examination of the report on direct settlements is the next priority on the Council s agenda and it is hoped that the meetings will soon be held at which it will be examined fully in a tripartite context.
.With reference to recommendation (c), the Government notes the Committee s recommendations concerning the absence of information regarding certain allegations in the context of Case No. . Nevertheless, the Government reiterates that it forwarded the follow-up reports requested by the Committee in due time and form, with the information provided by the enterprises concerned. Notwithstanding this, the observations and recommendations of the rd Report of the Committee on Freedom of Association were communicated once again to the enterprises Chiquita Cobal SA and Chiriqu Land Company SA so that they could exercise their right of legitimate defence in relation to the supervisory body and provide the relevant information. In this respect, the Government indicates that in most of the cases referred to by the Committee the workers have initiated the corresponding official procedures, as indicated by the Atlntica Banana Company Ltd.
.In this regard, the Government wishes to forward the report containing the company s reply, which was received with the communication dated  May , and which refers to the cases of Mr Teodoro Picado, Mr Amado Daz, Mr Ricardo Peck, Mr Reinaldo Lpez, Mr Manuel Murillo and Mr Juan Reyes, workers at Chiquita Cobal. The report also contains information on the final negotiations through which Mr Ramiro Beker, Mr Demetrio Lpez and Mr Norlando Ortiz, workers in the ranches of the Chiriqu Land Company, were reinstated. The text of the company s comments on each specific case is quoted below:' The case of worker Teodoro Martnez Martnez: judicial file No. ---LA, before the Labour Court, Second Circuit of San Jos, based in Goicoechea. Cause of dismissal: addressed his immediate chief in an unruly and disrespectful manner. Date of the occurrence:  April , during working hours. Current status: by decision of the judicial office, at . p.m. on  August :  ...The parties are hereby informed that they are to await the determination by this Office of the schedule for the next year to indicate the respective hearing  ?(this refers to the hearing for conciliation and the submission of evidence). Attachment No. .' The case of worker Amado Daz Guevara: judicial file No. ---LA, before the Labour Court, Second Circuit of San Jos, based in Goicoechea. Cause of dismissal: failure to comply with contractual obligations in relation to pruning, for which he was under contract, causing prejudice to the plantation; failing to inform his immediate superior of the true situation, claiming that the assigned work had been fully completed, which was not true. Date of the occurrence:  May , Oropel ranch, in the jurisdiction of Sarapiqu. Current status: an appeal has been lodged against the ruling of the court of first instance, No. , at . a.m. on  August , which upheld the charges before the Labour Court. On  September  the appeal was found receivable.' The case of worker Ricardo Saturnino Peck Motiel: judicial file No. ---LA, before the Labour Court, Second Circuit of San Jos, based in Goicoechea. Cause of dismissal: Mr Peck Montiel, in his work of protecting the fruit, for which he was hired by the Cocobolo ranch, in the jurisdiction of Sarapiqu, repeatedly failed to carry out his work, failing to follow the established procedures that were known to him in his work of protecting the fruit, as the achievement of the condition required to export the fruit depends on the efficient performance of this work, which is therefore essential for the cultivation of bananas. On previous occasions, prior to his dismissal, Mr Peck Montiel had received warnings for the same reason of failing to perform his work. His employment contract was terminated on  September . Current status: the latest decision of the judicial office consists of the acknowledgement of receipt at . p.m. on  January  of the action by the party.' The case of worker Reinaldo Lpez Gonzlez: judicial file No. ---LA, before the Labour Court, Second Circuit of San Jos, based in Goicoechea. Current status: this file dates from the year , and we have no copy of it. The case has been settled by agreement between the parties, as noted in a document submitted to the judicial office on  February , following payment to the complainant Mr Lpez Gonzlez by the Atlntica Banana Company Ltd. of the sum of  million colones. The court ordered the file to be placed in the archives and lifted the restraints that had been ordered  ...As the parties have reached an out of court settlement  ?' The case of worker Manuel Murillo de la Rosa: judicial file No. ---LA, before the Labour Court, Second Circuit of San Jos, based in Goicoechea, against the Chiriqu Land Company. Current status: by ruling No. , at . p.m. on  December , the claims brought by Mr Manuel Murillo de la Rosa were  set aside with all their demands'  The ruling is currently under appeal before the Labour",1,2006,Costa Rica
56,"Tribunal, . p.m.,  February .' The case of worker Juan Francisco Reyes: after reviewing our files of the claims brought against the Atlntica Company Ltd. in the courts, we have not found any brought by Mr Juan Francisco Reyes (of unknown second family name); however, we will send notification immediately if the file is found.
.The Atlntica Banana Company Ltd. has accordingly provided information on the current status of the cases referred to by the Committee, some of which have already been resolved through out of court settlements, while others are awaiting their judicial outcome, as indicated in the documentation provided by the company. The Government of Costa Rica is clear in its intention to punish the existence of anti-union practices and has no hesitation in applying the full rigour of the law in those cases in which there is evidence that such unlawful acts have been committed. In this respect, the Government of Costa Rica is fully prepared to resolve the judicial proceedings concerning alleged unfair labour practices, such as those referred to in the present case, through the adoption of reasonable policies to guarantee the rights of unionized workers, in accordance with the constitutional guarantees of due process and legitimate defence. The Government is working on this together with the three authorities of the Republic, namely the legislative, judicial and executive authorities.
.With regard to recommendation (d), the Government notes the Committee s recommendations concerning the promotion of collective bargaining between employers and their organizations, on the one hand, and organizations of workers, on the other, with a view to regulating conditions of work in the enterprise Desarrollo Agroindustrial de Frutales SA In this respect, it should be noted that a collective agreement is concluded between one or more workers' organizations and one or more employers, or one or more employers' organizations, with the objective of regulating the conditions under which work is to be performed and other related matters. It has the force of law between the parties which conclude such an agreement, and must be understood to include all the provisions relating to trade union guarantees set out in the ILO Conventions that have been ratified by the country, in accordance with section  of the Labour Code.
.The Basic Act respecting the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, No. , establishes in section  the functions of the competent institution, namely the Directorate of Labour Affairs of the Ministry. These include:  ...Intervening amicably in labour disputes with a view to endeavouring to resolve them, keeping under constant review labour disputes which arise, analysing their causes and proposing appropriate means for their avoidance in future, or of rendering their consequences less serious; and reviewing collective labour agreements, making appropriate comments so that they are in accordance with the law.' This responsibility is shared between the Departments of Social Organizations and of Industrial Relations, which provide advice to both workers and employers. Advisory services are also provided under budget line -TRABAJO and by the Department for External Advisory Services of the Directorate of Legal Affairs. Section (f) of Act No. , referred to above, also sets out as a function of the Directorate of Labour Affairs:  ...Convening employers and workers with a view to concluding a collective labour agreement which is to be raised to the category of a legislative contract, or for the purpose of revising contracts of this nature.' In this respect, it should be noted that the intervention of officials of the Ministry of Labour is always at the initiative of the parties. This means that the Ministry cannot initiate collective bargaining in a private enterprise or public institution without previously being so requested by the workers or a workers' organization, by virtue of the freedom of trade unions and employers to decide whether to conclude a collective agreement in the institution or enterprise concerned.
.Once the intervention of the Ministry has been requested, the officials of the Directorate of Labour Affairs are able to promote and initiate collective bargaining, providing legal advisory services to the parties concerned, taking up an impartial position and acting as an amicable intermediary. In addition, the Department of Industrial Relations of the Directorate of Labour Affairs keeps a register of the collective agreements concluded, with a view to complying with the approval procedure set out in the Labour Code. The enterprises or institutions concerned are under the obligation to submit a copy of the collective agreement once it has been concluded, under firm penalty of it being null and void if this step is omitted, as collective agreements acquire legal status as from the date on which a copy is submitted to the above Department. In this way, the Ministry of Labour controls the lawfulness of the provisions of such agreements.
.In the present case, the Directorate of Labour Affairs indicates that it has no record of any communication or letter sent by the trade union of the enterprise Desarrollo Agroindustrial de Frutales SA, under the terms of the Labour Code, with a view to notifying or requesting the intervention of the Ministry for the purpose of promoting the negotiation of a collective agreement. Furthermore, it should be noted that the company referred to above was merged in February  with the Corporacin de Desarrollo Agrcola del Monte, in a takeover by the latter.
.With reference to recommendation (e), the Government notes the consent of the supervisory body to consider the sending of a mission by the ILO Subregional Office to carry out an independent inquiry in the banana enterprise sector in relation to the allegations concerning the keeping of blacklists. In this respect, it should be emphasized that it is of great importance for the Government to have an official report to determine the truth in this sector of the national economy so that the necessary and appropriate measures can be taken in accordance with the mission s findings and recommendations.
.The Committee observes that the Government sent its observations on the recommendations that it made when it last examined this case.Recommendation (a)
.The Committee indicated that it expected that the various bills currently in progress in relation to the slowness and ineffectiveness of the administrative and judicial procedures in cases of anti-union practices, on which the Government provided information, would be adopted in the very near future and that they would be in full conformity with the principles of freedom of association. The Committee notes the Government s indication that: () the solution to the problems raised has to be found through the joint efforts of the representatives of the State authorities with a view to the adoption in law of the set of bills that are currently going through the legislative process and which are intended to strengthen the effect given in practice to Convention No. ; () to illustrate the interest of the Ministry of Labour and with a view to strengthening the measures to guarantee effective compliance with the principle of collective bargaining in the public sector, the Ministry of Labour, via official letter of  January , requested the Minister of the Office of the President to push forward the whole set of bills with a view to contributing to strengthening the right to collective bargaining, including the Bills to approve Conventions Nos  and  and the draft reform of labour procedures; () despite the fact that approval is still pending for these bills and the interest shown by the highest authorities of the country, when analysing the delay in the approval of the bills the events in the country in recent years have to be taken into consideration (the approval of the Free Trade Agreement with the Dominican Republic and the United States and the various bills which had to be tabled alongside the above Agreement, as well as the various bills designed to address the situation resulting from the global financial crisis); () the hope is retained that once the response to the economic crisis has been dealt with, the Legislative Assembly will take up again all the bills relating to anti-union discrimination and collective bargaining in the public sector and that they will be approved in the near future; () the Bill to reform labour procedures is an integrated proposal incorporating the recommendations of the Committee on Freedom of Association in relation to the matters under examination, and it addresses the subject of the slowness of procedures in cases of anti-union acts and strengthens the right to collective bargaining in the public sector (on  May , the study prepared on the Bill to reform labour procedures to ensure that all the terms of the Bill are in compliance with the provisions of Conventions Nos  and  was submitted to the subcommittee within the Standing Committee on Legal Affairs); () the Supreme Court of Justice, in addition to promoting the Bill to reform labour procedures, has made other significant efforts, including the allocation of increased human resources to the labour courts and strengthening the operation of the courts with a view to",0,2006,Costa Rica
57,"facilitating judicial processes in the labour procedures; and () it is hoped to make tangible progress in relation to the application of Convention No.  and in particular to establish a joint commission (unions, employers, the executive, legislative and judicial authorities) with the technical assistance of the ILO,- with a view to promoting and developing consensus concerning the text of the Bill to reform labour procedures, which is currently before the legislative bodies.
.The Committee expects that the bills referred to by the Government, which have been before the Congress for years, and particularly the Bill to reform labour procedures, which in the Government s view addresses the subject of the slowness of procedures in cases of anti-union acts and strengthens the right to collective bargaining in the public sector, will be adopted in the near future.Recommendation (b)
.With regard to the alleged discrimination in favour of the permanent workers' committees to the detriment of trade unions, the Committee noted that the Government had submitted this issue to a tripartite body and that it intended to adopt measures regarding the report made by an independent investigator in this respect, and it indicated that it expected that appropriate solutions would be found to the problem of collective agreements with non-unionized workers. The Committee notes the Government s reiterated statement that the report in question was submitted to the Higher Labour Council ' a tripartite body ' in , and the indication that it has not been possible for the Council to continue the discussion of the report as it has had to attend to other priority subjects, including the reform of labour procedures and the Decent Work Country Programme. The Committee further notes the Government s indication that the report is the next priority on the agenda of the Council and that it is hoped that the meetings will soon be held to examine the report fully in a tripartite context. The Committee regrets the delay that has occurred in the discussion of the above report and expects that it will be examined in the very near future and that the appropriate measures will be adopted without delay in this respect.Recommendation (c)
.The Committee requested the Government to send its observations regarding the allegations concerning the enterprise Chiquita Cobal, and to inform it:' whether the trade union officials, Mr Teodoro Martnez Martnez, Mr Amado Daz Guevara (member of the Committee on the Implementation of the Regional Agreement IUF/Colsiba/Chiquita), Mr Juan Francisco Reyes and Mr Ricardo Peck Montiel, have initiated judicial proceedings concerning their dismissals and, if so, of the status of these proceedings. The Committee notes the Government s indication that: () the case of Mr Teodoro Martnez Martnez is before the Labour Court, Second Judicial Circuit of San Jos; the grounds for his dismissal were that he addressed his immediate chief in an unruly and disrespectful manner on  April  during working hours, and that in August  the determination of the date of the hearing for conciliation and the submission of evidence was awaited; () the case of Mr Amado Daz Guevara is before the Labour Court, Second Judicial Circuit of San Jos; the grounds for dismissal were the failure to comply with contractual obligations in the work of the plantation, causing prejudice to the plantation; he also failed to inform his immediate superior of the true situation by claiming that the assigned work had been carried out; the ruling of the court of first instance upheld the charges and an appeal has been lodged with the Labour Tribunal; and () the case of Mr Ricardo Saturnino Peck Montiel is before the Labour Court, Second Judicial Circuit of San Jos; the grounds for dismissal were the repeated failure to follow the established procedures for the protection of the fruit; the latest decision by the judicial office in relation to the action brought by the party was on  January ; in this respect, the Committee regrets the long period that has elapsed since the commencement of the current court proceedings without rulings being handed down up to now. The Committee trusts that the current judicial proceedings will be brought to a conclusion rapidly and requests the Government to keep it informed of their outcome;' of the grounds for the dismissal of Mr Reinaldo Lpez Gonzlez and the reasons why the court ruling ordering his reinstatement was not executed, and to provide a copy of the agreement that the enterprise and the worker were about to sign. The Committee notes the Government s indication that the file dates from the year  and that it does not have a copy of it. According to the indications of the judicial authorities, the plaintiff received the sum of  million colones from the enterprise and the respective court ordered the file to be placed in the archives and lifted the restraints that had been ordered. In the light of this information, the Committee will not pursue its examination of these allegations;' of the grounds for the dismissal of Mr Manuel Murillo de la Rosa and the status of the judicial proceedings concerning his dismissal. The Committee notes the Government s indication that, in a ruling of  December , the claims brought by the worker were set aside with all their demands and that the ruling has been under appeal before the Labour Tribunal since February . The Committee requests the Government to provide a copy of the ruling of the court of first instance. The Committee also expects that the judicial authorities will rule in the near future on the appeal and requests the Government to keep it informed of the final outcome;' with regard to the case of Mr Juan Francisco Reyes, the Committee notes the Government s indication that it has not found any claim in the files, which was brought against the Atlntica Banana Company Ltd by the worker. Noting this information, the Committee will not further pursue its examination of this allegation.
.With reference to the Chiquita-Chiriqu Land Company, the Committee requested the Government to inform it whether, in the process of the negotiations that the company conducted with the trade union, it was decided to reinstate the dismissed trade unionists and members and, if not, to inform it of the grounds for the dismissals and whether judicial proceedings had been initiated in this regard. In this respect, the Committee notes with interest the Government s indication that, as a result of the negotiations held, Mr Ramiro Beker, Mr Demetrio Lpez and Mr Norlando Ortiz were reinstated.Recommendation (d)
.The Committee urged the Government to take all steps at its disposal to promote collective bargaining between employers and their organizations, on the one hand, and the organizations of workers, on the other, in order to regulate conditions of work in the enterprise Desarrollo Agroindustrial de Frutales SA and to keep it informed in this respect. The Committee notes the Government s indication that: () the Basic Act governing the Ministry of Labour and Social Security establishes the functions of the competent institution, namely the Directorate of Labour Affairs of the Ministry, which include intervening amicably in labour disputes with a view to endeavouring to resolve them and reviewing collective labour agreements, making appropriate comments so that they are in accordance with the law; () also, in accordance with the above Act, it is the function of the Directorate of Labour Affairs to convene employers and workers with a view to concluding a collective labour agreement which is to be raised to the category of a legislative contract, or for the purpose of revising contracts of this nature; () the intervention of officials of the Ministry of Labour is always at the initiative of the parties, and accordingly the Ministry cannot initiative collective bargaining in a private enterprise or public institution without previously being so requested by the workers or a workers' organization, and by employers, to determine whether to conclude a collective agreement; () once the intervention of the Ministry has been requested, the officials of the Directorate of Labour Affairs are able to promote and initiate collective bargaining, providing legal advisory services and taking up an impartial position; () in the present case, the Directorate of Labour Affairs indicates that it has no record of a communication or letter sent by the trade union of the enterprise with a view to notifying or requesting the intervention of the Ministry for the purpose of promoting collective bargaining; and () the enterprise Desarrollo Agroindustrial de Frutales SA was merged in February  with the Corporacin de Desarrollo Agrcola del Monte, in a takeover by the latter.
.In this respect, the Committee recalls that it was alleged that it was impossible to engage in collective bargaining in the enterprise, for which reason the authorities could intervene with a view to bringing the parties closer so that they could reach an agreement on the terms and conditions of employment of the workers. Under these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government, should it be requested to do",1,2006,Costa Rica
58,"so by the trade union organizations, to make every possible effort to promote collective bargaining between these organizations and the representatives of the Corporacin de Desarrollo Agrcola del Monte (which was merged with and took over the enterprise Desarrollo Agroindustrial de Frutales SA).Recommendation (e)
.The Committee understood that the Government was prepared to accept a mission sent by the ILO Subregional Office so that an independent inquiry could be carried out in the banana sector into the allegations concerning the keeping of blacklists, and it hoped that the necessary measures would be taken to provide this assistance as soon as possible. In this respect, the Committee notes the Government s indication that it is of great importance to have an official report to determine the truth in this sector of the national economy so that the necessary and appropriate measures can be taken in accordance with the mission s findings and recommendations. The Committee expects that the mission will be undertaken in the very near future and requests the Government to keep it informed of any developments in this respect.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee expects that the bills referred to by the Government, and particularly the Bill to reform labour procedures, which in the Government s view addresses the subject of the slowness of procedures in cases of anti-union acts and strengthens the right to collective bargaining in the public sector, will be adopted in the near future.(b) As regards to the alleged discrimination in favour of the permanent workers' committees to the detriment of trade unions, and the report made by an independent investigator in this respect, the Committee expects that the report will be examined in the very near future and that the appropriate measures will be adopted without delay in this respect.(c) With respect to the dismissals of the trade union leaders, Mr Teodoro Martnez Martnez, Mr Amado Daz Guevara (member of the Committee on the Implementation of the Regional Agreement IUF/Colsiba/Chiquita), Mr Ricardo Peck Montiel and Mr Manuel Murillo de la Rosa, the Committee regrets the long period that has elapsed since the commencement of the current court proceedings without rulings being handed down up to now, trusts that the current judicial proceedings will be brought to a conclusion rapidly and requests the Government to keep it informed of their outcome.(d) The Committee requests the Government, should it be asked to do so by to the trade union organizations, to make every possible effort to promote collective bargaining between these organizations and the representatives of the Corporacin de Desarrollo Agrcola del Monte (which was merged with and took over the enterprise Desarrollo Agroindustrial de Frutales SA).(e) With regard to the possibility of the ILO Subregional Office undertaking an independent inquiry in the banana sector into the allegations concerning the keeping of blacklists, the Committee notes the acceptance of such a mission by the Government and expects that it will be carried out in the very near future. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any developments in this respect.
.The Committee last examined the substance of this case at its November  meeting and on that occasion submitted an interim report to the Governing Body for approval [see th Report, paras ' , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session].
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  February and  September .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.At its November  meeting [see th Report, para. ], the Committee made the following recommendations:(a) recalling that the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations (CEACR) has, for several years, referred to the slowness and ineffectiveness of administrative and judicial procedures in cases of anti-union practices, the Committee, like the CEACR, urges that the various bills currently in progress in relation to the issues on which the Government provides information, will be adopted in the very near future and that they will be in full conformity with the principles of freedom of association;(b) in regard to alleged discrimination in favour of the permanent workers' committees to the detriment of the trade unions, the Committee requests the Government to send its observations without delay;(c) in regard to the Chiquita Cobal enterprise, the Committee requests the Government to inform it: () whether trade union officials Mr Teodoro Martnez Martnez, Mr Amado Daz Guevara, member of the Committee on the Implementation of the Regional Agreement between the IUF/COLSIBA and Chiquita, Mr Juan Francisco Reyes and Mr Ricardo Peck Montiel have initiated judicial proceedings concerning their dismissals and, if so, of the status of these proceedings; () of the grounds for the dismissal of Mr Reinaldo Lpez Gonzlez and the reasons why the court ruling ordering his reinstatement was not executed, and to send it a copy of the agreement that is to be signed by the enterprise and the worker; and () of the grounds for the dismissal of Mr Manuel Murillo de la Rosa and the status of the court proceedings concerning his dismissal;(d) in regard to the Chiquita-Chiriqu Land Company, the Committee requests the Government to inform it whether, in the process of the negotiations which the company says it has conducted with the trade union, it was decided to reinstate the dismissed trade unionists and members and, if not, to inform it of the grounds for the dismissals and whether judicial proceedings have been initiated in this regard;(e) in regard to the Desarrollo Agroindustrial de Frutales SA enterprise, the Committee: () urges the Government to take all steps at its disposal so as to promote collective bargaining between the employers and their organizations on the one hand, and the organizations of workers on the other, in order to regulate the conditions of work in the enterprises concerned; and () requests the Government to send its observations concerning the alleged anti-union dismissal of Mr Jorge Luis Rojas Naranjo and to indicate whether the conciliation referred to in the case of Mr Germn Enoc Mndez s dismissal involved his reinstatement;(f) in regard to the Santa Mara del Monte SA agricultural enterprise, the Committee requests the Government: () to send its observations concerning the allegations that workers of the enterprise were detained by the migration police; and () to inform it of the total number of workers dismissed at the same time as the trade unionists referred to by the complainant organizations, broken down into unionized and non-unionized workers, to keep it informed of the judicial proceedings under way referred to in the information sent by the enterprise, and to inform it if there were any trade union members among the workers rehired by the enterprise;(g) in regard to the allegations concerning the Cariari and Teresa plantations owned by Banacol, the Committee requests the Government to send its observations without delay;(h) the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps to ensure that an independent inquiry is carried out in the banana sector concerning the allegations that blacklists are being kept, and to keep it informed in this regard.
.In its communications dated  February and  September , the Government refers to the recommendations made by the Committee when it last examined the case. As regards recommendation (a), the Government states that it takes note of the views of the Committee concerning the case in question, in particular with regard to concern about the slowness and ineffectiveness of administrative and judicial procedures in cases of antiunion practices and the urgent need to adopt the various bills currently in progress in relation to those issues. The Government hopes that all of these issues will be resolved and that the relevant bills will be adopted in the near future. The Government has shown an interest in strengthening all the necessary measures in accordance with the principles of freedom of association, including the promotion of responsive and swift legal and administrative procedures in cases involving anti-union practices. According to the Government, this is evidenced by letter No. DMT--, of  February , in which the Ministry of Labour and Social Security requests the Ministry of the Presidency, among other things, to promote a group of bills that will contribute to strengthening the procedures in question (including the approval of the Bill to reform labour procedures).
.The Government adds that the Ministry of Labour and Social Security sent a copy of the report of the Committee on Freedom of Association on  February  toMr Luis Paulino Mora Mora, President of the Supreme Court of Justice (in letterNo. DMT--), Mr Jos Pablo Carvajal Cambronero, Executive Director of the High Labour Council (in letter No. DMT--) and Mr Alexander Mora Mora, Chairperson of the Permanent Committee for Legal Affairs of the Legislative Assembly (in letter No. DMT--), so as to inform them of the recommendations and elicit their views in",1,2006,Costa Rica
59,"that regard. The Government undertakes to inform the Committee in the near future of the opinions submitted by the abovementioned authorities.
.The President of the Second Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice responded to the observations concerning the slowness and ineffectiveness of administrative and judicial procedures in cases of anti-union practices, in letter No. SP-- of  May . In this letter, the President expresses his agreement with some of the points made regarding the Bill to reform labour procedures, which is being processed under legislative procedure No.  and is currently before the Plenary of the Legislative Assembly for discussion and approval. The President states that the abovementioned Bill is intended to simplify labour procedures by reducing the number of courts and appeals involved and introducing oral proceedings. In addition, procedures for the settlement of economic and social disputes are being amended in order to make them more practical and effective, and rules are being drawn up to regulate dispute settlement in the public sector.
.Moreover, the President states that the Supreme Court of Justice is doing its utmost to help ensure that the Bill becomes law, given that it would provide the courts with a swift and effective means of settling legal, economic and social labour disputes. The Supreme Court of Justice recognizes that certain legal procedures have been slow.
.In relation to the Bill to reform labour procedures (legislative procedure No. ), the Government adds that the High Labour Council has reactivated a special study and analysis committee with tripartite participation. The committee s objective is to reach consensus on certain points of the Bill and transmit the results of the study to the members of Parliament, with a view to smoothing the way for approval of the Bill in the near future, especially given that the main actors have already concluded important agreements regarding this issue. An important contribution to the work of the abovementioned special committee of the High Labour Council has been the report submitted by the ILO Subregional Office to the Ministry of Labour and Social Security in August . This report is the result of technical assistance requested by the abovementioned official in order to ensure that the Bill is in full conformity with the provisions of ILO Conventions Nos  and , as stated in letter No. DMT-- of  July .
.The expert report will be transmitted, not only to the special committee of the High Labour Council, but also to the special subcommittee established on  May  within the Committee for Legal Affairs of the Legislative Assembly to study the Bill to reform labour procedures and issue an opinion on it. Given the considerable joint effort undertaken by the executive and judicial branches, together with the main social partners (guided by ILO technical assistance) the Government of Costa Rica, acting in a responsible manner and determined to resolve the situation, hopes that the Bill will become law in the near future, once it has been analysed and studied by the Plenary of the Legislative Assembly.
.In addition to contributing to the promotion of the Bill, which will streamline legal procedures, the judiciary has also taken steps to increase its human resources, and to strengthen the functioning of courts through improved computerized links with external bodies to speed up legal procedures in labour cases (connecting it to the Civil Registry, the Public Registry, the Office of the Attorney-General, etc.) and to purchase digital recording equipment to be used during oral hearings, among other things. Furthermore, small claims labour courts have been established in various regions of the country in order to handle cases more swiftly, especially since the rules governing these courts provide for oral proceedings. The judiciary has thus considerably reduced the average duration of labour cases and the caseload.
.The Government adds that, in order to strengthen the judicial system further, in March , the Supreme Court of Justice approved the establishment of the Conciliation Centre of the Judiciary, which promotes flexible, informal and effective judicial mechanisms. Conciliation ' either in the labour courts or in other judicial bodies ' is offered as an additional means of fulfilling the constitutional mandate of providing swift and full justice. This is an ideal tool for a preventive approach, allowing judges to deal with disputes which, by their nature, can only be resolved through a court ruling.
.The Government adds that the Ministry of Labour and Social Security is also interested in strengthening alternative means of dispute resolution by the administrative authority, given that efforts in this direction help reduce the number of cases brought before the labour courts, thereby relieving court congestion and saving judicial resources.
.Furthermore, the judiciary is continuing to implement the  Programme to combat delays in legal proceedings'  which seeks to balance the caseload among the different judicial bodies in order to provide a more timely service to users. This is done by providing congested courts with supernumerary judges appointed by the Office of the Chief Justice. In , the Programme provided assistance to  courts, including misdemeanour, maintenance, family and labour courts. In the same year, a total of , cases were handled under the Programme, with , judgements and decisions handed down and around  cases rejected.
.As to recommendation (b) on the issue of alleged discrimination in favour of the permanent workers' committees to the detriment of the trade unions, the Government states that this issue was examined by the ILO high-level technical assistance mission which visited Costa Rica in October . During its visit, the mission took note of the formal request by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security for ILO assistance in conducting an independent inquiry into the issue. To carry out this task, the ILO appointed Adrin Goldn, Professor of Labour Law at the University of San Andrs (Argentina) in February . The Government of Costa Rica, acting through the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, cooperated fully, providing all the logistical and technical support requested by Mr Goldn. In May , the Government of Costa Rica received a copy of the study carried out by the independent expert appointed by the CEACR, to which it had agreed during the visit of the ILO high-level mission to the country. In this regard, the Government reiterates that, even if it might be claimed that there are a wide variety of factors conducive to the existence of more direct settlements than collective agreements, as noted by the CEACR, the fact is that both institutions have a basis in law and are freely chosen by the sectors involved.
.However, owing to its constitutional status and its important role in maintaining social peace, collective bargaining is given special protection, both in Costa Rican positive law and in national practice. This can be seen not only in the labour law status granted to it by the Constitution and in the regulatory framework governing collective agreements, but also in the content of an administrative directive of  May  on the  correct procedure for handling direct settlements submitted after a request has already been made for collective bargaining'  The National Inspection Directorate must act in accordance with these provisions whenever a direct settlement is submitted to it in order to be deposited. In such cases, before the settlement can be deposited, the General Labour Inspectorate must ascertain that there is not already a trade union recognized for purposes of negotiating a collective agreement present in the enterprise concerned and that it has not already initiated the bargaining procedure, in accordance with section  of the Labour Code.
.Should it be found that a trade union recognized for bargaining purposes already exists in the enterprise, the General Labour Inspectorate shall reject the direct settlement immediately, without assessing its content, so as not to undermine the negotiation of the collective agreement (as such agreements have a higher legal ranking). However, it is true that the independent expert refers to circumstances which would appear to contradict the commitment under Article  of Convention No. , regarding the promotion of the full development and utilization of machinery for voluntary negotiation. Thus, given that the report in question has only recently been received, and taking into account the recommendation of the Committee of Experts addressed to the Government concerning the need to submit the document and its conclusions for tripartite analysis, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security has sent a complete copy of the study to each of the members of the High Labour Council with a view to correcting the imbalance between the number of collective agreements and direct settlements.
.The Government emphasizes that it continues to hope that a satisfactory solution will be found through genuine social dialogue, involving all the social actors concerned, without prejudice to any technical assistance that the ILO may be able to offer in this matter, in order to ensure that permanent committees and direct settlements do not have an anti-union impact in practice (as pointed out by the independent expert in his report). The issue is a complex",1,2006,Costa Rica
60,"one, and the Government hopes that, in the near future, it will be able to put forward a consolidated proposal that offers a satisfactory solution to the situation referred to by the independent expert.
.As to recommendations (c), (d), (f) and (g), the Government states that it has sent a copy of the th Report of the Committee on Freedom of Association to representatives of all of the enterprises mentioned: the Chiquita Cobal enterprise, Chiquita-Chiriqu Land Company, Agrcola Santa Mara del Monte SA and Banacol (with regard to the Cariari and Teresa plantations), and transmits the observations of the enterprises in question. As to recommendations (c) and (d), the Government transmits information provided by the Chiquita Cobal enterprise and Chiquita-Chiriqu Land Company, reiterating that provided when this case was examined in November . As to recommendation (f) regarding the Agrcola Santa Mara del Monte SA enterprise, the Government sends a communication from the enterprise stating that, in , a decision was taken to dismiss  estate workers, with full payment of entitlements, in order to reduce the workforce to  in accordance with the needs of the estate. Most of those  workers were non-unionized. Among the  new workers hired, only one worker, Fabio Amador Martnez, a union member, was rehired. As to the workers detained by the immigration authorities, the enterprise denies any involvement with the matter, which concerns undocumented workers.
.As to recommendation (g) regarding the Cariari and Teresa plantations (owned by Banacol), the Government transmits Banacol s reply to the effect that it recognized the Plantation Workers Trade Union (SITRAP) as soon as it learned that there were members of SITRAP among its workers, and that it gave express instructions to its managers on the Cariari and Teresa plantations in that regard. The enterprise denies that SITRAP members have been persecuted, affirming, on the contrary, that  The exercise of disciplinary authority (warnings, reprimands, etc.) by the employer does not constitute grounds for complaints of anti-union persecution' 
.The enterprise has provided the following statement regarding the workers concerned:' Mr Isidro Snchez Obando s replanting work was discontinued because it was no longer necessary. Once all the plants allotted for each plot have been planted, this work is no longer carried out. This was the case at four plantations, including the one on which he was employed, and hence he could not be assigned the same task, as it had been discontinued. This type of work is known as mantenimiento de resiembra (ongoing replanting), and is carried out to cope with a temporary shortage of banana plants, which was overcome, and as de mata lenta (slow plant) work, which involves tending plants that are growing at a slower rate than normal;' Mr Hermes Cubillo Gmez was paid the wage difference owed to him, as noted in the minutes of the meeting between the enterprise and SITRAP that was held at the Ministry of Labour offices in San Jos on  August . On  September  (long before he joined the trade union) this worker had received a written reprimand for physically and verbally assaulting Mr Mora Mora Gerardo, while he was doing his job. This constituted grounds for dismissal, but the enterprise only issued a reprimand (section (a) of the Labour Code). On  May , he was again issued with a warnings for leaving his post. On  and  April , he was given written warnings for having abandoned his post. These acts constitute grounds for dismissal under sections (a) and (y) of the Labour Code, but the enterprise did not dismiss the worker. How can anyone allege trade union persecution in the case of a worker who could have been dismissed for serious misconduct but who merely received reprimands or suspensions instead of being dismissed;' Mr Oscar Hernndez did not perform his task of pruning plants correctly and his productivity was low as a result. Consequently, he was assigned another task. Such reassignments are often carried out on estates in the case of labourers, who are recruited to carry out all the usual agricultural tasks that are commensurate with their strength, abilities, state or condition and are of the same nature as the core business, activity or industry in which the employer is engaged, in accordance with section  of the Labour Code. This worker received a reprimand on  April  for failing to carry out his duties correctly;' as to Mr Angel Snchez Coronado, the coordinators of the trade union and the enterprise agreed to review the tasks assigned to him and his wages.
.As to the withdrawal from trade union membership by members of SITRAP, the enterprise states that a number of SITRAP members decided to leave the trade union of their own accord. They requested Mr Carlos Luis Snchez Marn, a member of the permanent committee of estate workers, who was going to attend a meeting on the programming of courses on solidarism at the Escuela Social Juan XXIII in Siquirres, to give them a lift in a vehicle provided for the use of the solidarist association. Once in Siquirres, the former trade unionists asked Mr Snchez, as a member of the permanent committee, to accompany them to the SITRAP offices, which he did. This was portrayed as employer interference in withdrawal from trade union membership. The enterprise cannot be held responsible for the actions of third parties (such as solidarist associations, members of the permanent committee or other workers or middle management) unless it is shown that they were acting with its consent. There is no proof that the enterprise gave its consent with regard to any of the incidents mentioned in the complaints, or that it imposed disciplinary penalties that were not grounded in the authority of the employer.
.As to recommendation (e), the Government states that the Desarrollo Agroindustrial de Frutales SA enterprise informed it, in letter No. S.OB. -, of  January , that, in the labour court proceedings initiated by the workers Jorge Luis Rojas Navarro and Germn Enoc Mndez Aguirre (heard by the Labour Court of the Second Circuit of San Jos) the parties reached a conciliation agreement, and the cases were shelved as a result. The representative of the enterprise provided certified copies of the court rulings stating that the complaint had been withdrawn and ordering that the case be shelved (both these rulings were handed down by the Labour Court of the Second Circuit of San Jos). The legal representative of the respondent enterprise also provided a copy of the document in which he accepted the withdrawal of the complaint and requested that the proceedings be closed.
.As to recommendation (h), the Government states that, convinced of the need to implement in national practice institutions enabling workers to exercise their rights at work fully, and in the light of the Committee s recommendation, it considers it prudent to submit a formal request for ILO technical assistance, so that the ILO s interdisciplinary teams and/or advisers can carry out the  independent inquiry' suggested by the Committee, in order to address the allegations concerning the keeping of blacklists in the banana sector and protect the fundamental rights and guarantees of all the workers in that sector.
.At its November  meeting, the Committee examined allegations regarding the slowness and ineffectiveness of administrative and judicial procedures in cases involving anti-union practices, the impossibility of exercising the right to strike given that most strikes are declared illegal by the judicial authority, discrimination in favour of permanent workers' committees to the detriment of trade unions and numerous acts of anti-union discrimination in enterprises in the banana sector, and on that occasion made recommendations [see th Report, para. ].
.As to recommendation (a), in which the Committee urged the Government to adopt in the very near future the various bills currently in progress in relation to the slowness and ineffectiveness of administrative and judicial procedures in cases of anti-union practices, on which the Government provided information, and stressed that they should be in full conformity with the principles of freedom of association, the Committee notes that the Government states that: () in letter No. DMT--, of  February , the Ministry of Labour and Social Security requested the Ministry of the Presidency to promote a group of bills that would contribute to strengthening the procedures in question (including the approval of the Bill to reform labour procedures); () it sent copies of the Committee s report to the President of the Supreme Court of Justice, the Executive Director of the High Labour Council and the Chairperson of the Permanent Committee for Legal Affairs of the Legislative Assembly, to inform them of the recommendations and elicit their views in that regard; () the President of the Second Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice stated that he agreed with some of the points made regarding the Bill to reform labour procedures, which is currently before the Plenary of the Legislative Assembly for discussion and approval, and that the Supreme Court of Justice was doing",1,2006,Costa Rica
61,"its utmost to help ensure that the Bill became law, given that it would provide the courts with a swift and effective solution to legal, economic and social labour disputes;( ) as regards the Bill to reform labour procedures, the High Labour Council has reactivated a special study and analysis committee with tripartite participation. The aim of this committee is to reach consensus on certain points of the Bill and transmit the results of the study to the members of Parliament, with a view to smoothing the way for approval of the Bill in the near future; () the judiciary has also taken steps to increase its human resources, and to strengthen the functioning of courts, thereby considerably reducing the average duration of labour cases; and () the Ministry of Labour and Social Security is also interested in strengthening alternative means of dispute resolution by the administrative authority, given that efforts in this direction help reduce the number of cases brought before the courts. Under these circumstances, the Committee appreciates the fact that the Government has submitted this issue to the competent authorities and to a tripartite body, and expects that the bills in question will be adopted in the near future.
.As to recommendation (b), in which the Committee requested the Government to send its observations without delay regarding alleged discrimination in favour of the permanent workers' committees to the detriment of the trade unions, the Committee notes that the Government states that: () this issue was examined by the ILO high-level technical assistance mission which visited Costa Rica in October ; () during the visit, the mission took note of the formal request by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security for ILO assistance in conducting an independent inquiry into the issue; () to carry out that task, the ILO appointed Adrin Goldn, Professor of Labour Law at the University of San Andrs (Argentina) in February . The Government of Costa Rica cooperated fully, providing all the logistical and technical support requested by Mr Goldn, and received his report in May ; () even if it might be claimed that there are a wide variety of factors conducive to the existence of more direct settlements than collective agreements, it is true that both institutions have a basis in law and are freely chosen by the sectors involved; however, owing to its constitutional status and its important role in maintaining social peace, collective bargaining is given special protection; () should it be found that a trade union recognized for bargaining purposes already exists in the enterprise, the General Labour Inspectorate shall reject the direct settlement immediately, without assessing its content, so as not to undermine the collective bargaining process; () it is true that the independent expert refers to circumstances which would appear to contradict the commitment under Article  of Convention No. . Accordingly, and taking into account the recommendation of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security has sent a complete copy of the study to each of the members of the High Labour Council; and () the Government continues to hope that a satisfactory solution will be found through genuine social dialogue, involving all the social actors concerned, in order to ensure that permanent committees and direct settlements do not have an anti-union impact in practice. In this regard, the Committee appreciates the fact that the Government has submitted this issue to the competent authorities and to a tripartite body, and expects that the measures planned by the Government will enable appropriate solutions to be found to the problem of collective agreements with non-unionized workers.
.As to recommendations (c) and (d), in which the Committee requested the Government to transmit its observations regarding allegations concerning the Chiquita Cobal enterprise and the Chiquita-Chiriqu Land Company, the Committee notes that the Government has sent information that had already been provided by the enterprises when the case was examined in November . Under these circumstances, the Committee regrets that the Government has not sent the requested observations, reiterates the recommendations it made when last examining the case and expects that, together with any information the enterprises might wish to transmit, the Government will send the requested observations in due course.
.As to recommendation (f) regarding the enterprise Agrcola Santa Mara del Monte SA, in which the Committee requested the Government: () to send its observations concerning the allegations that workers of the enterprise were detained by the migration police; and () to inform it of the total number of workers dismissed at the same time as the trade unionists referred to by the complainant organizations, broken down into unionized and non-unionized workers, to keep it informed of the judicial proceedings under way referred to in the information sent by the enterprise, and to inform it if there were any trade union members among the workers rehired by the enterprise, the Committee notes that the Government has transmitted a report from the enterprise indicating that: (a) the enterprise has nothing to do with the undocumented workers detained in March  by the immigration authorities, and (b) in , the enterprise decided to dismiss  estate workers, including a few unionized workers, with full payment of entitlements, and  workers were later hired, of whom one was a union member. In this regard, the Committee notes that the dismissed workers do not seem to have lodged a complaint with the national authorities, and trusts that, in future, when staff cuts are being planned, the trade union organizations concerned will be fully consulted.
.As to recommendation (e) regarding the enterprise Desarrollo Agroindustrial de Frutales SA, the Committee: () urged the Government to take all steps at its disposal so as to promote collective bargaining between the employers and their organizations on the one hand, and the organizations of workers on the other, in order to regulate the conditions of work in the enterprise concerned; and () requested the Government to send its observations concerning the alleged anti-union dismissal of Mr Jorge Luis Rojas Naranjo and to indicate whether the conciliation referred to in the case of Mr Germn Enoc Mndez Aguirre s dismissal involved his reinstatement. In this regard, the Committee notes that the Government states that the enterprise reported that, in the labour court proceedings initiated by the workers Mr Jorge Luis Rojas Naranjo and Mr Germn Enoc Mndez Aguirre, the parties reached a conciliation agreement, and the cases were shelved as a result. Under these circumstances, in the absence of information from the Government regarding the allegations concerning collective bargaining, the Committee urges the Government to take all steps at its disposal so as to promote collective bargaining between the employers and their organizations on the one hand, and the organizations of workers on the other, in order to regulate the conditions of work in the enterprise Desarrollo Agroindustrial de Frutales SA, and to keep it informed in this respect.
.As to recommendation (g), regarding allegations of anti-union persecution of the workers Isidro Snchez Obando (allegedly transferred to other duties), Angel Snchez Coronado, Hermes Cubillo Gmez and Oscar Hernndez of the Cariari and Teresa plantations (owned by Banacol), who decided to become members of SITRAP, as well as pressure brought to bear by the enterprise to force workers to leave the trade union, the Committee observes that the Government transmits a report from the enterprise which states that: () it recognized SITRAP as soon as it learned that there were members of the union among its workers; () members of SITRAP are not persecuted; () Mr Snchez Obando was transferred to other duties because the tasks he had previously been assigned had been discontinued; Mr Hermes Cubillo Gmez was paid the wage difference owed him and reprimanded for verbal and physical assault (long before he joined the trade union); Mr Oscar Hernndez was transferred to another task because he was not carrying out his duties in a satisfactory manner and received a warning in that regard; and () as to the cases of withdrawal from SITRAP membership, a number of workers decided to leave the trade union of their own accord and requested a member of the permanent workers' committee of the plantation, Mr Carlos Ruiz Snchez Marn, to accompany them to the SITRAP offices. The enterprise states that it cannot be held responsible for the actions of third parties unless it is shown that they were acting with its consent. The Committee takes note of this information furnished by the enterprise and regrets the absence of any information from the Government respecting this matter.
.As to recommendation (h), in which the Committee requested the Government to take the necessary steps to ensure that an independent inquiry is carried out in the banana sector concerning the allegations that blacklists are being kept, and to keep it informed in this regard, the Committee notes that the Government has requested ILO technical assistance, so that the ILO s interdisciplinary teams and/or advisers can carry out the independent",1,2006,Costa Rica
62,"inquiry, in order to address the allegations concerning the keeping of blacklists in the banana sector and protect the fundamental rights and guarantees of the workers in that sector. In this regard, the Committee understands that the Government is prepared to accept a mission sent by the Subregional Office so that an independent inquiry can be carried out into the allegations concerning the keeping of blacklists in the banana sector, and hopes that this assistance will be provided as soon as possible.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee expects that the various bills currently in progress in relation to the slowness and ineffectiveness of administrative and judicial procedures in cases of anti-union practices, on which the Government provides information, will be adopted in the very near future and that they will be in full conformity with the principles of freedom of association.(b) As to the alleged discrimination in favour of the permanent workers' committees to the detriment of the trade unions, while noting that the Government has submitted this issue to a tripartite body and that it intends to adopt measures regarding the report made by an independent investigator in this respect, the Committee expects that appropriate solutions will be found to the problem of collective agreements with non-unionized workers referred to when the case was last examined.(c) In the absence of information from the Government regarding certain allegations, the Committee expects that, together with any information the enterprises might wish to transmit, the Government will send its observations in due course regarding the following recommendations made in November , which are reproduced below:' in regard to the Chiquita Cobal enterprise, the Committee requests the Government to inform it: () whether trade union officials Mr Teodoro Martnez Martnez, Mr Amado Daz Guevara, member of the Committee on the Implementation of the Regional Agreement between the IUF/COLSIBA and Chiquita, Mr Juan Francisco Reyes and Mr Ricardo Peck Montiel have initiated judicial proceedings concerning their dismissals and, if so, of the status of these proceedings; () of the grounds for the dismissal of Mr Reinaldo Lpez Gonzlez and the reasons why the court ruling ordering his reinstatement was not executed, and to send it a copy of the agreement that is to be signed by the enterprise and the worker; and () of the grounds for the dismissal of Mr Manuel Murillo de la Rosa and the status of the court proceedings concerning his dismissal;' in regard to the Chiquita-Chiriqu Land Company, the Committee requests the Government to inform it whether, in the process of the negotiations which the company says it has conducted with the trade union, it was decided to reinstate the dismissed trade unionists and members and, if not, to inform it of the grounds for the dismissals and whether judicial proceedings have been initiated in this regard.(d) The Committee urges the Government, as previously requested, to take all steps at its disposal so as to promote collective bargaining between the employers and their organizations on the one hand, and the organizations of workers on the other, in order to regulate the conditions of work in the enterprise Desarrollo Agroindustrial de Frutales SA and to keep it informed in this respect.(e) The Committee understands that the Government is prepared to accept a mission sent by the Subregional Office so that an independent inquiry can be carried out into the allegations concerning the keeping of blacklists in the banana sector, and hopes that the necessary measures will be taken to provide this assistance as soon as possible.

.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) Recalling that the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations (CEACR) has, for several years, referred to the slowness and ineffectiveness of administrative and judicial procedures in cases of anti-union practices, the Committee, like the CEACR, urges that the various bills currently in progress in relation to the issues on which the Government provides information, will be adopted in the very near future and that they will be in full conformity with the principles of freedom of association.(b) In regard to alleged discrimination in favour of the permanent workers' committees to the detriment of the trade unions, the Committee requests the Government to send its observations without delay.(c) In regard to the Chiquita Cobal enterprise, the Committee requests the Government to inform it: () whether trade union officials Mr Teodoro Martnez Martnez, Mr Amado Daz Guevara, member of the Committee on the Implementation of the Regional Agreement between the IUF/COLSIBA and Chiquita, Mr Juan Francisco Reyes and Mr Ricardo Peck Montiel have initiated judicial proceedings concerning their dismissals and, if so, of the status of these proceedings; () of the grounds for the dismissal ofMr Reinaldo Lpez Gonzlez and the reasons why the court ruling ordering his reinstatement was not executed, and to send it a copy of the agreement that is to be signed by the enterprise and the worker; and () of the grounds for the dismissal of Mr Manuel Murillo de la Rosa and the status of the court proceedings concerning his dismissal.(d) In regard to the Chiquita ' Chiriqu Land Company, the Committee requests the Government to inform it whether, in the process of the negotiations which the company says it has conducted with the trade union, it was decided to reinstate the dismissed trade unionists and members and, if not, to inform it of the grounds for the dismissals and whether judicial proceedings have been initiated in this regard.(e) In regard to the Desarrollo Agroindustrial de Frutales SA enterprise, the Committee: () urges the Government to take all steps at its disposal so as to promote collective bargaining between the employers and their organizations on the one hand, and the organizations of workers on the other, in order to regulate the conditions of work in the enterprises concerned; and () requests the Government to send its observations concerning the alleged anti-union dismissal of Mr Jorge Luis Rojas Naranjo and to indicate whether the conciliation referred to in the case of Mr Germn Enoc Mndez' dismissal involved his reinstatement.(f) In regard to the Santa Mara del Monte SA agricultural enterprise, the Committee requests the Government: () to send its observations concerning the allegations that workers of the enterprise were detained by the migration police; and () to inform it of the total number of workers dismissed at the same time as the trade unionists referred to by the complainant organizations, broken down into unionized and non-unionized workers, to keep it informed of the judicial proceedings under way referred to in the information sent by the enterprise, and to inform it if there were any trade union members among the workers rehired by the enterprise.(g) In regard to the allegations concerning the Cariari and Teresa plantations owned by Banacol, the Committee requests the Government to send its observations without delay.(h) The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps to ensure that an independent inquiry is carried out in the banana sector concerning the allegations that blacklists are being kept, and to keep it informed in this regard.",1,2006,Costa Rica
63,".The Committee last examined this case at its November  meeting [see st Report, paras ' ] and on that occasion requested the Government: () as to the dismissal of the members of the executive committee of the Independent Union of Workers of the National Community Development Office of DINADECO (SINTRAINDECO) (Lucrecia Garita Argedas, Rafael Ayala Hasermann and Giselle Vindas Jimnez) a few months after the trade union was established, to keep it informed of the outcome of the judicial or administrative proceedings relating to the dismissals of the trade union leaders in question, and should it be found that they were dismissed on anti-union grounds, to take measures to ensure that they were reinstated in their posts or in similar posts corresponding to their abilities, with payment of wages due and appropriate compensation. Moreover, if the competent judicial authority finds that reinstatement is not possible, the Committee requests that they be fully compensated; and () concerning the alleged dismissal of the leaders of SINTRAINDECO, scar Snchez Vargas and Irving Rodrguez Vargas, to take measures to ensure that an independent investigation is carried out in this regard and, should it be found that they were dismissed on anti-union grounds, to take measures to ensure that they are reinstated in their posts, with payment of wages due and appropriate compensation. Moreover, if the competent judicial authority finds that reinstatement is not possible, the Committee requests that they be fully compensated.
.In a communication of  April , the Government refers to information provided by DINADECO, according to which all the civil servants referred to were appointed on a temporary basis to posts in the public sector, and therefore enjoy  estabilidad impropia' (when the interim worker may only be removed from his post if he is to be replaced by a permanent candidate, or if he was standing in for another worker who then returns to work) in accordance with the terms of judgement - of  May , issued by the Constitutional Chamber. This means that they can be dismissed from their posts provided that they are replaced by workers who have passed the corresponding exams. These interim workers are then added to the list of those eligible for appointment to permanent posts maintained by the General Directorate of the Civil Service.
.As to Ms Lucrecia Garita Argedas, in accordance with official letter RSDA---RH, she took up post No.  on a temporary basis at DINADECO on  June , remaining in that position until  February , on which date she was informed that her interim appointment had been terminated. She was again hired on a temporary basis from  March , in post No. . On  July , through official letter
.With regard to Giselle Vindas Jimnez, who was appointed on an interim basis by DINADECO as of  February , she was later appointed, again on a temporary basis, to another post as an information systems analyst, as of  January . On  June , Ms Vindas Jimnez was made redundant owing to the fact that her post had been reclassified as a graduate class social promotion position within DINADECO, as approved by the Decentralized Office of the Civil Service of the Ministry of Public Security. Ms Vindas Jimnez lodged an amparo (protection of constitutional rights) appeal with the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice against the decision to make her redundant. The Constitutional Chamber ruled in her favour and DINADECO proceeded to reinstate Ms Vindas Jimnez in her post (which she occupies to this day), on a temporary basis.
.With regard to Mr Rafael Ayala Hasermann, who was appointed on a temporary basis to the post of social promoter within DINADECO, on secondment from the Ministry of Public Security, as of June . Later on, from  January , he was appointed on a temporary basis to post No.  (mobile equipment operator). On  July , DINADECO informed him that the post had been altered to security and surveillance class , approved by the Decentralized Office of the Civil Service of the Ministry of Public Security, his contract being terminated as a result. Mr Ayala Hasermann lodged an amparo appeal with the Constitutional Chamber, with the Chamber ruling that the appeal was groundless on  June  and stating that  In the case of the interim appointment and in those cases in which a replacement must be found for a permanent civil servant for a fixed period, in order to ensure consistent interpretation of our legislation the dismissal of the interim worker be carried out on the grounds that the post is to be permanently occupied by a civil servant ...' 
.scar Snchez Vargas was appointed on a temporary basis to a post within DINADECO from  January , to  December . On  November , he lodged a formal request for an invalidity pension with the Costa Rican Social Security Fund. On  October , he was informed that the Directorate for the Classification of Invalidity Status had granted him invalid status. Once a worker has been informed that his request for an invalidity pension has been granted, he must resign from his state post in order to enjoy the benefit granted. In view of Mr Snchez Vargas' invalid status, it can be concluded, looking at his personal file, that he accepted the invalidity pension, and, therefore, he was not made redundant as a result of anti-union discrimination.
.As to Mr Irving Rodrguez Vargas, he was employed on a temporary basis as of  July . On  August , he was made redundant because a candidate was appointed to the post on a permanent basis.
.The Committee takes note of this information, in particular, the reinstatement of Ms Vindas Jimnez and the fact that Mr Snchez Vargas made a successful application for an invalidity pension, as a result of which his contract was terminated. As to the other dismissals, the Committee notes that the Government denies that they were carried out on anti-union grounds and emphasizes that the staff affected were on interim contracts. The Committee notes that the Constitutional Court refused Mr Ayala Hasermann s request to be reinstated and that the other workers dismissed lodged unsuccessful administrative appeals. The Committee observes that from the Government s statements it can be deduced that there are no legal appeals pending regarding these trade union officials.
.The Committee last examined this case at its June  meeting [see th Report, paras ' ], and, on that occasion, made the following recommendations:(a)	As to the alleged slowness of procedures in resolving cases involving anti-union acts, the Committee, while noting that according to the Government, a  Bill to reform labour proceedings' is currently on the parliamentary agenda in order to ensure flexible and swift judicial procedures, requests the Government to keep it informed of developments regarding the Bill in question and expects that it will resolve the problem of the excessive slowness of procedures.(b)	As to the dismissal of the members of the executive committee of DINADECO (SINTRAINDECO) (Lucrecia Garita Argedas, Rafael Ayala Hasermann and Giselle Vindas Jimnez) a few months after the trade union was established, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the judicial or administrative proceedings relating to the dismissals of the trade union leaders in question, and should it be found that they were dismissed on anti-union grounds, to take measures to ensure that they are reinstated in their posts or in similar posts corresponding to their abilities, with payment of wages due and appropriate compensation. Moreover, if the competent judicial authority finds that reinstatement is not possible, the Committee requests that they be fully compensated.(c)	Regretting that the Government has not sent its observations concerning the alleged dismissal of the leaders of SINTRAINDECO, Oscar Snchez Vargas and Irving Rodrguez Vargas, the Committee requests the Government to take measures to ensure that an investigation is carried out in this regard and, should it be found that they were dismissed on anti-union grounds, to take measures to ensure that they are reinstated in their posts, with payment of wages due and appropriate compensation. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard. Moreover, if the competent judicial authority finds that reinstatement is not possible, the Committee requests that they be fully compensated.(d)	As to the allegations relating to the small number of collective agreements in the country and the very high number of direct agreements signed with non-unionized workers, the Committee expresses its concern at the situation regarding collective bargaining and requests the Government to keep it informed in that respect, as well as with regard to all measures adopted in relation to the small number of collective agreements with a view to ensuring the application of Article  of Convention No.  regarding the promotion of collective bargaining with workers' organizations.
.In a communication dated  February , the Government states that there are currently no documents pending or further information which necessitate a statement by the Government.",1,2006,Costa Rica
64,"The Government states that it reiterates its reply of  December . In this regard, the Government recalls in general that it does not concur with the rash allegations made by the complainant organization, given that they are highly subjective and have no basis in fact or in law. According to the Government, the complainant organization has failed to respect the constitutional principle of due process in that it turned to an international legal body without having first exhausted the legal channels provided by law to deal with unfair labour practices, which amounts to improper use of the bodies of the ILO.
.The Government adds that it is fully prepared to resolve the administrative and legal proceedings concerning the alleged unfair labour practices referred to by the complainants through the drafting of reasonable policies aimed at protecting the rights of unionized workers, in accordance with the constitutional guarantees of due process and legitimate defence. The Government reiterates that the Ministry of Labour and Social Security organized several meetings with the parties concerned, in an attempt to find a solution which would bring about social and labour peace within the National Community Development Office (DINADECO). It also states that it has taken a clear stance against anti-union practices and does not hesitate to apply the full force of the law in those cases where it has been proven that such illegal acts have been committed. For these reasons the Government requests the Committee to reject the complaint in question, given that the competent authorities have acted within the law and in accordance with the principles of the ILO.
.The Committee notes this information and welcomes the organization of meetings with the parties by the Ministry of Labour in order to find a solution. As regards the alleged improper use of the ILO bodies, the Committee wishes to point out that its procedure does not require the exhaustion of national procedures [special procedures for the examination in the International Labour Organization of complaints alleging violations of freedom of association, para. ]. As to the issues referred to in recommendations (a) and (d), the Committee observes that these will be examined within the framework of Case No. . As to recommendations (b) and (c), the Committee reiterates its previous statements and requests the Government to send the specific information requested on that occasion.

Moreover, if the competent judicial authority finds that reinstatement is not possible, the Committee requests that they be fully compensated.(c) Regretting that the Government has not sent its observations concerning the alleged dismissal of the leaders of SINTRAINDECO, Oscar Snchez Vargas and Irving Rodrguez Vargas, the Committee requests the Government to take measures to ensure that an independent investigation is carried out in this regard and, should it be found that they were dismissed on anti-union grounds, to take measures to ensure that they are reinstated in their posts, or in similar posts, with payment of wages due and appropriate compensation.

In its reply, the Government sends observations in this respect and includes the opinion of the Supreme Court of Justice. The Government indicates that it will inform the Committee which other authorities it consults and that it has taken measures to move along the processing of the bills on collective bargaining in the public sector and on the ratification of Conventions Nos  and . The Committee will examine these matters when it receives the comments from the other authorities consulted by the Government (including the Legislative Assembly, which is the competent state authority on these matters) and has all the necessary information at its disposal.
.In its communications dated  June and  September , the Government states that the Minister of Labour requested the Minister of the Office of the President to move forward with the draft of bills contributing to the strengthening of the right to collective bargaining, including the bill on the approval of ILO Conventions Nos  and .
.The Committee takes note of this information and requests the Government to keep it informed of any developments in the processing of these bills and hopes, given that they have been submitted to the Legislative Assembly on several occasions over the last few years, that they will be adopted in the near future.
.At its November  meeting, the Committee formulated the following recommendation on an issue still pending [see st Report, para. ]: the Committee deplores the criminal complaint made [against trade union leaders] by the member of parliament for submitting a complaint to the ILO and requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome and to verify that no trade union leader is sanctioned for having submitted a complaint to the ILO.
.In its communication of  April , the Government states that the member of parliament who had filed the criminal complaint stated in writing on  February  that it was not in his interest to pursue the complaint, which was made several years earlier, and that he has requested the closure of the file on this case. The Committee takes note of this information.
.At its November  meeting, the Committee made other recommendations relating to existing restrictions on the right to bargain collectively in the public sector [see st Report, para. ]. In its reply, the Government sends observations in this respect and includes the opinion of the Supreme Court of Justice.

.The Government sent further observations in a communication dated  February .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its previous examination of the case at its November  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendations regarding the issues pending [see th Report, para. ]:(a)	The Committee reiterates that additional legal and other guarantees are required to avoid the abusive use of the recourse of unconstitutionality against collective agreements in the public sector by the Office of the Ombudsperson and the Libertarian Party which inevitably leads to the social partners losing confidence in collective bargaining and requests the Government to keep it informed in that respect.(b)	The Committee requests the Government to continue to keep it informed of developments with regard to the measures and decisions adopted in relation to ensuring respect for the principle of collective bargaining in the public sector, including the bills mentioned in the conclusions (bill of ratification of Conventions Nos  and ), as well as of the progress of the joint commission of the Higher Labour Council and the Legislative Assembly with the assistance of the ILO.(c)	The Committee expects that the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court will take fully into account Costa Rica's commitments arising from the ratification of Convention No. .(d)	Lastly, the Committee regrets that the Government has not responded to the allegation regarding the criminal complaint made to the Office of the Attorney-General against union leaders for submitting a complaint to the ILO, in which their dismissal was sought. The Committee requests the Government to respond to this allegation without delay and recalls that no union leader should be subject to intimidation, reprisals or sanctions as a result of submitting complaints to the ILO.
.In its communication of  February , the Government states that it notes the recommendation made by the Committee on Freedom of Association and states that the issue of collective bargaining in the public sector and the use of actions for unconstitutionality against collective agreements in this sector have been repeatedly submitted to the ILO s supervisory bodies, as well as to the Committee on Freedom of Association, especially within the follow-up to Case No. .
.The mandate of the October  high-level technical assistance mission covered the issue of restrictions to the right to bargain collectively in the public sector in the light of various rulings issued by the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court, as well as the subjection of collective bargaining in the public sector to criteria of proportionality and rationality in accordance with the case law of the Constitutional Chamber, which has declared unconstitutional a number of clauses of collective agreements in the public sector.
.All of these proceedings are marked by numerous arguments to refute the accusations and statements made regarding this affair by the Government, which is why the Government requests that all the arguments it has put forward concerning the issue be taken into account.
.As to recommendations (b) and (c) of the th Report of the Committee on Freedom of Association, the Government states that it sent copies of the report to Mr Luis Paulino Mora Mora, President of the Supreme Court of Justice of the Judiciary, Mr Alexander Mora Mora, President of the Standing Committee on Judicial Affairs of the Legislative Assembly and Mr Jos Pablo Caravajal, Executive Director of the Higher Labour Council, in February , in order to inform them of the Committee s observations so that they could give their opinions on the recommendations and report on progress made relating to the concerns expressed by this supervisory body. In this regard, the Government undertakes to keep the Committee informed of any responses made by the abovementioned national authorities.
.As to the progress made by the joint commission of the Higher Labour Council ' Legislative Assembly (recommendation (b) of the Committee), the Government states that this issue is a priority; however, the Legislative Assembly is currently considering the approval of the implementation agenda for the free trade agreement with the United States (DR-CAFTA, Dominican Republic-Central American Free Trade Agreement). However, this has not prevented a study into a bill on collective bargaining in the public sector from being undertaken within the Higher Labour Council (a national tripartite body) in the context of the reform of working procedures.
.The Government sends a copy of official letter No. DMT--, of  February  in order to paint a clearer picture of its intention to strengthen measures effectively guaranteeing the respect of the principle of collective bargaining in the public sector. In this letter, the Minister of Labour requests the Minister of the Presidency to speed up work on those bills contributing to the strengthening of the right to collective bargaining in the public sector, including the bills of ratification for the abovementioned ILO Conventions Nos  and .
.Furthermore, the Government recalls that bills relating to the promotion of collective bargaining in the public sector were submitted and recommended for adoption to the Legislative Assembly: the reform of section  of the Constitution, the purpose of which is to legalize the right to conclude collective agreements in the public sector; the  bill on bargaining for collective agreements in the public sector' and the elevation to the status of law of the current Decree No. -MTSS, governing dispute resolution and collective bargaining for public servants.
.In addition, in the light of the actions for unconstitutionality seeking the annulment of certain clauses in collective agreements, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security has presented appropriate",1,2006,Costa Rica
67,"legal assistance in defence of the right of collective bargaining in the public sector with regard to the legal proceedings that have taken place.
.In any case, in a follow-up to the recommendations of the October  high-level mission and under the auspices of the ILO Subregional Office for Central America, located in Costa Rica, and its team of specialists, the Government refers to a seminar organized on  March  on  Standards and case law on collective agreements in the public sector: From an international and domestic law perspective' 
.All the social and government partners involved in the effective application of the principles of freedom of association and collective bargaining were invited to participate in this activity, including the very highest authorities of the executive (heads of institutions and advisers to the bodies signatories to collective agreements, heads of bodies belonging to the Policy Committee on Collective Bargaining in the Public Sector), the Ombudsman General of the Republic, the Office of the Comptroller-General of the Republic, the Public Prosecutor-General of the Republic, the Minister of Finance, the Director-General of the Civil Service, the Regulator-General of Public Services, among others, including the technical officers of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security responsible for the issue in question. Furthermore, the heads of the legislative branch were invited (members of parliament accompanied by their advisers) and the judicial authorities, including judges of Chamber II and the Constitutional Chamber and their counsels, as well as the most representative organizations of the workers and the employers party to collective agreements in the public sector and recognized labour law experts, and authorities from institutes of higher education, among others.
.In accordance with the brief given by the ILO supervisory bodies to the Government, the aim of this seminar is to contribute to the dissemination of the principles of the international standards which govern collective bargaining in the public sector, the subject of much study and analysis in many forums within this international organization.
.The Government states that with regard to the criminal complaint made to the Office of the Attorney-General against union leaders for submitting a complaint to the ILO, it sent its response to the Committee on  August  as a part of the last reply sent.
.In its reply, the Government showed that the complaint was an isolated incident, within the rule of law in Costa Rica, of a member of parliament exercising the right to make a complaint to the criminal courts. However, it is clear that the Government is not connected in any way to the complaint made by the member of the legislature. The outcome of the legal proceedings will depend entirely on the ruling of the competent legal body within the framework of the separation of powers essential to the rule of law, under which the procedural guarantees in criminal cases (the Government refers to the relevant constitutional standards relating to due process) and trade union guarantees are recognized.
.The Committee observes that in the present case the complainant organizations alleged: () the declaration as unconstitutional by the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice of a considerable number of clauses of collective agreements concluded with public institutions and enterprises, relating to economic and social issues, which extended social and economic benefits established under the Labour Code and in legislation; () the lodging of a criminal complaint against trade union leaders for having submitted a complaint to the ILO.
.The Committee notes the Government s latest reply which refers to measures already adopted by the national authorities regarding the issue in question, as well as to new measures. As to the measures previously adopted by the authorities, the Committee took note of these in its previous conclusions which are reproduced below in order to clarify the situation [see th Report, para.]:The Committee notes the Government's statements, according to which () the Government does not endorse the actions of the Office of the Ombudsperson nor of other political parties in challenging collective agreements, even if they are entitled to do so; () the Constitutional Chamber's decisions have not been drafted in full, only the operative paragraphs exist, but they suggest that voting was divided; () the Government's analysis process makes it clear that the full text of the rulings is required in order to avoid falling into speculation and subjective interpretations; () the Government has indicated the ILO s position and its principles to the Constitutional Chamber; and () the Government has demonstrated its will to ensure collective bargaining in the public sector as an institution. The Government attaches communications from the heads of enterprises and institutions affected by the annulment of particular clauses in their collective agreements. There is a particular unease emanating from these communications, especially since the agreements had been set before the Committee on Policies for Collective Bargaining in the public sector at the time in order to have technical support, although they do point out that they must abide by the Constitutional Chamber's rulings and the separation of powers principle. The Committee observes the Government's request that its statements and arguments made in previous cases also be included. The Committee summarizes the Government's previous statements in earlier cases as follows: () the Government possesses the will and commitment to resolve the problems; () it has requested the ILO s technical assistance in the hope that this will help to solve the problems mentioned; () the efforts of the Government (many of which were tripartite) regarding these problems included the presentation of several legislative proposals to the Legislative Assembly and their reactivation: a draft constitutional amendment concerning article , a bill on collective bargaining in the public sector, and the addition of paragraph  to article  of the General Law on Public Administration (the three initiatives are intended to strengthen collective bargaining in the public sector); bill on parliamentary approval of ILO Conventions Nos  and ; the draft revision of various sections of the Labour Code, Act No.  of  August  and Decree No.  of  November ; () the Government's efforts also include other types of initiatives, such as the intervention of third parties to defend collective agreements (coadyuvancia) in legal actions of unconstitutionality brought in order to annul specific clauses.
.The Committee had also noted that, according to the report of the October  high-level technical assistance mission, the bills in question would be examined by the Higher Labour Council (a tripartite body for dialogue) with the objective of studying them and providing them with new impetus, through consensus; the Higher Labour Council asked the Legislative Assembly to set up a joint commission, with the technical assistance of the ILO, in order to develop the plan for the reform of the working procedures [see th Report, para. ].
.As to the Government s new measures, in the light of the previous examination of the case, the Committee notes the Government s statement that: () it has transmitted the report of the Committee on Freedom of Association to the President of the Supreme Court of Justice, the President of the Legislative Assembly s Standing Committee on Judicial Affairs and the Executive Director of the Higher Labour Council (a national tripartite body) in order to inform them of the Committee s observations so that they may report on progress made relating to the concerns expressed by the Committee; () the progress made by the joint commission of the Higher Labour Council ' Legislative Assembly is a priority for the Government, however, the Legislative Assembly is currently considering the approval of the implementation agenda for the free trade agreement with the United States (DR-CAFTA, Dominican Republic-Central American Free Trade Agreement). However, this has not prevented a study from being undertaken within the Higher Labour Council (a national tripartite body) into a bill on collective bargaining in the public sector, in the context of the reform of working procedures; () on  February  the Minister of Labour formally requested the Minister of the Presidency to speed up work on all bills contributing to the strengthening of the right to collective bargaining in the public sector, including the bills of ratification for the abovementioned ILO Conventions Nos  and ; () in a follow-up to the recommendations of the high-level mission, and under the auspices of the ILO, a seminar was organized on  March  on the issue of collective bargaining to which were invited, among others, the social partners, the heads and bodies of the various branches of government affected by the issue, including Supreme Court judges and members of parliament, as well as their assistants and advisers, in order to disseminate the principles of the ILO Conventions.
.The Committee appreciates the Government s efforts in promoting ratification of the ILO Conventions on collective bargaining and of the various bills relating to this issue, as well as the initiatives adopted by the various state authorities concerned and the social partners. The Committee notes that, according to the Government, the progress made by the joint commission of",0,2006,Costa Rica
68,"the Higher Labour Council ' Legislative Assembly regarding the abovementioned bills on constitutional and legal reforms aimed at resolving the issue at hand regarding collective bargaining in the public sector has been blocked by discussion of the implementation agenda of the free trade agreement with the United States. The Committee regrets this delay. The Committee expects that the joint commission will take up its work again shortly and that it will be in a position to report on any developments in the near future.
.The Committee once again requests the Government to keep it informed of developments regarding the measures and decisions adopted, as well as developments concerning those bills relating to collective bargaining in the public sector (including those relating to the ratification of Conventions Nos  and ) and expresses once again the expectation that the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice will take into account fully the commitments made by Costa Rica when ratifying Convention No. , in particular with regard to collective bargaining in the public sector. The Committee reiterates that additional legal and other guarantees are required to avoid the abusive use of the recourse of unconstitutionality against collective agreements in the public sector by the Office of the Ombudsperson and the Libertarian Party which inevitably leads to the social partners losing confidence in collective bargaining, and requests the Government to continue to keep it informed in that respect, as well as of the progress of the joint commission of the Higher Labour Council and the Legislative Assembly with the technical assistance of the ILO.
.Finally, the allegation relating to the criminal complaint made by a member of parliament to the Office of the Attorney-General against union leaders for submitting a complaint to the ILO (as a part of which it was requested that the leaders be dismissed), the Committee notes the Government s statements to the effect that this was an isolated incident and that the Government is not in any way connected to the complaint made by the member of the legislature, but that however he was exercising his right to make a complaint before the criminal courts, which must in turn act within the framework of the procedural guarantees enshrined in the Constitution and the trade union guarantees. The Committee deplores the criminal complaint made by the member of parliament and requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome and to verify that no trade union leader is sanctioned for having submitted a complaint to the ILO.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee reiterates that additional legal and other guarantees are required to avoid the abusive use of the recourse of unconstitutionality against collective agreements in the public sector by the Office of the Ombudsperson and the Libertarian Party which inevitably leads to the social partners losing confidence in collective bargaining, and once again requests the Government to continue to keep it informed of developments regarding the measures and decisions adopted with regard to ensuring respect for the principle of collective bargaining in the public sector, including the bills mentioned in the conclusions (bill of ratification of Conventions Nos  and  and other projects of constitutional and legal reform), as well as of the progress of the joint commission of the Higher Labour Council and the Legislative Assembly with the assistance of the ILO.(b)	The Committee expects that the joint commission will take up its work shortly and that it will be in a position to report on any developments in the near future.(c)	The Committee again expresses its expectation that in the future the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice will take into account fully the commitments made by Costa Rica when ratifying Convention No. .(d)	The Committee deplores the criminal complaint made by the member of parliament for submitting a complaint to the ILO and requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome and to verify that no trade union leader is sanctioned for having submitted a complaint to the ILO.
.The Juanito Mora Porras Social Confederation (CS-JMP) signed the complaint dated  May  and submitted new allegations in a communication dated  July . The Government sent its comments in this regard in communications dated  August and  December , challenging the receivability of communications from this movement, contending that it was not a registered trade union and was unrepresentative, among other matters. The Office forwarded these comments to the CS-JMP for its observations. Given that they have yet to be received, the Committee does not include the allegations made by the CS-JMP in this report and will only consider them once it is able to take a decision on the receivability of the complaint.
.The Government sent its comments in communications dated  August and  December  and  May,  August and  October .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee reiterates that additional legal and other guarantees are required to avoid the abusive use of the recourse of unconstitutionality against collective agreements in the public sector by the Office of the Ombudsperson and the Libertarian Party which inevitably leads to the social partners losing confidence in collective bargaining and requests the Government to keep it informed in that respect.(b) The Committee requests the Government to continue to keep it informed of developments with regard to the measures and decisions adopted in relation to ensuring respect for the principle of collective bargaining in the public sector, including the bills mentioned in the conclusions (bill of ratification of Conventions Nos  and ), as well as of the progress of the joint commission of the Higher Labour Council and the Legislative Assembly with the assistance of the ILO.(c) The Committee expects that the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court will take fully into account Costa Rica s commitments arising from the ratification of Convention No. .(d) Lastly, the Committee regrets that the Government has not responded to the allegation regarding the criminal complaint made to the Office of the Attorney-General against union leaders for submitting a complaint to the ILO, in which their dismissal was sought. The Committee requests the Government to respond to this allegation without delay and recalls that no union leader should be subject to intimidation, reprisals or sanctions as a result of submitting complaints to the ILO.",0,2006,Costa Rica
69,".The Government replied in letters dated  and  May .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) Observing that the new collective bargaining regulations in the public sector are based on a mere executive decree in , subsequent to decisions of the Supreme Court of Justice which questioned the right of collective bargaining of civil servants, so that the present situation is somewhat confused and needs to be clarified, and considering that additional guarantees are also required to avoid the more or less systematic use of the recourse of unconstitutionality against collective agreements in the public sector by the Ombudsman s Office and the Libertarian Party, the Committee will continue to address these questions in the framework of its examination of Case No. .(b) The Committee regrets that the opening of discussions between the parties was delayed by seven months from the submission of the list of claims in October  due to the delay by the Commission on Bargaining Policy in issuing the bargaining directives and requests the Government to take measures to ensure that the said body issues its directives in a reasonable time.(c) The Committee observes that it is apparent from the documentation sent by the complainant organizations and the Government that the Commission on Bargaining Policy did not authorize a large number of draft clauses presented by the trade union for the purposes of negotiation, invoking the principle of legality. The Committee requests the Government to indicate whether the decisions of the Commission on Bargaining Policy can be appealed to the judicial authority or to an independent body.(d) The Committee suggests that the Government should seek ILO technical assistance to accelerate the dispute settlement mechanisms for collective bargaining in the public sector.(e) The Committee requests the Government to send it full information on the possible signing of the document sent by the Ministry of Justice to the trade union and invites the complainant organizations to explain the reasons why the trade union has not yet signed it.",0,2004,Costa Rica
70,".At its June  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendations [see th Report, para. ]:(a) As to the allegations concerning delays affecting procedure in the case concerning the dismissal of trade union officials of the Association of Workers of the Fertilizer Sector (more than eight-and-a-half years after the dismissals took place), the Committee notes and deplores the excessive delays affecting the abovementioned case and recalls that proceedings relating to matters of anti-union discrimination, in violation of Convention No. , should be examined promptly, so that the necessary corrective measures can be really effective; excessive delay in dealing with anti-union discrimination cases and, in particular, the long delay in deciding proceedings for the reinstatement of dismissed union leaders amounts to a denial of justice and thus a denial of the union rights of those affected. Whilst taking note of the efforts being made by the authorities to resolve the question of delays to legal proceedings, the Committee once again expresses its concern at the delays affecting proceedings, in particular with regard to the present case. The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that the draft laws it referred to which are aimed at speeding up the operations of the legal system are adopted promptly. The Committee expects that the judicial authority will issue a ruling on the dismissal of the trade union officials of the ATF without delay, given that over eight and a half years have passed since the dismissals took place and requests the Government to communicate a copy of the ruling as soon as it is issued.(b) As to the entry effected by employees of FERTICA into the trade union office of the AFT and requisitioning of documents and goods, the Committee deplores the fact that representatives of the enterprise FERTICA unilaterally and without prior warning or consent entered into the office of the ATF trade union and relocated it to other premises belonging to the enterprise. The Committee requests the Government to communicate a copy of the ruling to be handed down as a consequence of the legal process undertaken by the Ministry of Labour for unfair employment practices and expects that the ruling will be handed down in the near future, restitution will be made for the damages and the ATF trade union will have its possessions returned to it.(c) The Committee requests the Government to communicate a copy of the ruling dated  April , handed down by the Lower Small Claims Court of Puntarenas.
.In its communications of  November  and  February , the Government indicated its willingness to respond to the Committee s concerns regarding the delay in the proceedings, and refers to the information given to the Committee of Experts on a number of bills aimed at resolving this problem and drawn up with the ILO s technical assistance. The Government adds that it has communicated the Committee s conclusions on the present case to the President of the Supreme Court of Justice and to the general manager of FERTICA. The Supreme Court considers that the situation with regard to Case No.  is unacceptable, and that efforts must be made to ascertain whether the delay is due to the conduct of the parties concerned or of one of the individuals responsible for examining the case. The Supreme Court on  September  reported on developments in the proceedings in relation to this case, which have dragged on for more than nine years.
.The Government also reports another case examined by the Lower Small Claims Court of Puntarenas which led to a ruling on  February  against the FERTICA company for arbitrarily evicting the supplies store and union office of ATF from their premises. The company was fined , colones, but lodged an appeal which is still pending.
.The Committee notes this information and, noting that the judicial proceedings in this case have been dragging on for more than nine-and-a-half years, once again expresses its serious concern at the situation which it deeply deplores, reiterates its previous recommendations, and hopes that rulings will be handed down without any further delay. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  January .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) As to the allegations concerning delays affecting procedure in the case concerning the dismissal of trade union officials of the Association of Workers of the Fertilizer Sector (more than eight-and-a-half years after the dismissals took place), the Committee notes and deplores the excessive delays affecting the abovementioned case and recalls that proceedings relating to matters of anti-union discrimination, in violation of Convention No. , should be examined promptly, so that the necessary corrective measures can be really effective; excessive delay in dealing with anti-union discrimination cases and, in particular, the long delay in deciding proceedings for the reinstatement of dismissed union leaders amounts to a denial of justice and thus a denial of the union rights of those affected. Whilst taking note of the efforts being made by the authorities to resolve the question of delays to legal proceedings, the Committee once again expresses its concern at the delays affecting proceedings, in particular with regard to the present case. The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that the draft laws it referred to which are aimed at speeding up the operations of the legal system are adopted promptly. The Committee expects that the judicial authority will issue a ruling on the dismissal of the trade union officials of the ATF without delay, given that over eight and a half years have passed since the dismissals took place and requests the Government to communicate a copy of the ruling as soon as it is issued.(b) As to the entry effected by employees of FERTICA into the trade union office of the AFT and requisitioning of documents and goods, the Committee deplores the fact that representatives of the enterprise FERTICA unilaterally and without prior warning or consent entered into the office of the ATF trade union and relocated it to other premises belonging to the enterprise. The Committee requests the Government to communicate a copy of the ruling to be handed down as a consequence of the legal process undertaken by the Ministry of Labour for unfair employment practices and expects that the ruling will be handed down in the near future, restitution will be made for the damages and the ATF trade union will have its possessions returned to it.(c) The Committee requests the Government to communicate a copy of the ruling dated  April , handed down by the Lower Small Claims Court of Puntarenas.",1,2004,Costa Rica
71,".The complaint was presented by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) in a communication dated  September . This organization sent additional information in a communication dated  April . In a communication dated  August , the International Transport Workers' Federation (ITF) associated itself with the ICFTU s complaint.
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  February and  August .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communications dated  September  and  April , the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) alleges that, on  September , the Trade Union of the Workers at the Committee for Port Administration and Economic Development of the Atlantic Coast (SINTRAJAP) in Puerto Limn began a strike demanding the application of the terms of their collective agreement, which had been pending for three months. Other trade unions in the sector from the Limn region, which were also experiencing similar problems, joined the strike. In total, the strike had the participation of around , workers.
.The ICFTU adds that the Government, through the Ministry of Labour, brought an action to declare the strike illegal before the industrial courts. According to the ICFTU, the Government threatened workers, through announcements on the television and other media, that workers who missed two days of work would be dismissed.
.Also, the ICFTU adds, heavily armed police undertook a wide-ranging and violent operation to evict workers from their places of work in order to take control of the Committee for Port Administration and Economic Development of the Atlantic Coast (JAPDEVA) terminal at the port in Mon, beating them and throwing tear gas at them, leaving several workers seriously injured. During this operation the following were arrested:
.The ICFTU points out that they were all freed on  September ; but nevertheless, the respective authorities gave the order to begin port operations with the help of strike breakers, non-unionized workers and workers of other nationalities, after government negotiations with the Governments of Colombia and Venezuela about sending technicians and professionals from these countries, experts in the fields of petroleum and ports, to operate the system of pumping and filling tankers, as well as for the loading and unloading of merchandise on the quay. The ICFTU encloses a document showing that Colombian technicians answered the call. According to the ICFTU, the Government even managed to illicitly hire and move a Columbian tug with a crew of the same nationality, to carry out the port services of loading and unloading.
.Finally, the ICFTU points out that the strike ended on Saturday,  September , at  p.m. with a promise to continue dialogue and negotiation.
.The ICFTU reports that the strike took place in the context that the SINTRAJAP union, along with the Federation of the Workers of Limn (FETRAL) and the civil organization Limn en lucha had presented a list of demands to the Government, which, besides respect of the collective agreement, included demands from civil society to increase public infrastructure and social security. The ICFTU explains that the Government established a dialogue process with the unions and civil society and, as a result, signed an act of negotiation on  May  in which it committed to fulfilling various points, including compliance with the current collective agreement between SINTRAJAP and JAPDEVA. As three months after signing the act of agreement the Government had not complied with its commitment to respect the current collective agreement, and this added to the threat of cancelling the rights of the union members covered by the collective agreement, workers affiliated to SINTRAJAP exercised their right to strike, in accordance with national law, on  September .
.Finally, the ICFTU alleges that the Government has created a legal body called the Defensora de los Habitantes (Office of the Ombudsman) which, at the request of the state enterprise JAPDEVA, is encouraging the non-recognition and distortion of the rights agreed in the collective agreements in the belief that any benefit agreed in a collective agreement that is greater than those contained in the Labour Code is illegal.
.The ICFTU specifies that, among others, the Office of the Ombudsman, the regulatory authority of the public services and several members of the Libertarian Party have claimed that the collective agreement between the JAPDEVA and the SINTRAJAP is unconstitutional despite the fact that the Ministry of Labour declared that said collective agreement dated  August   is in keeping with the legal regulations in force, not observing flaws in form and content'  It has emerged from the ICFTU s complaint that there have been other cases where collective agreements in the public sector have been challenged in the Constitutional Court.
.In its communications of  February and  August , the Government states that the complainant organization, under the pretext of supposed non-compliance with the act of agreement of  May , which is essentially political, is trying to justify a strike movement (- September ). This act does not contain labour demands; it was signed between trade union organizations, civil organizations and government representatives and was drawn up within the framework of strengthening constructive dialogue, with the aim to deal with the needs of various social and economic sectors of the province of Limn, in accordance with the economic means of the Government of the Republic. It contains various requests to, among others, companies like JAPDEVA and RECOPE and sectors such as agriculture; it deals with the issue of landfill, as well as the plan for regional development of the Atlantic coast and the issue of public safety, among others.
.In its complaint, the complainant organization does not clearly specify what the alleged non-compliances with the act or the collective agreement are, and it does not mention the Government s efforts in the province of Limn to guarantee to meet the requests of all the socio-economic sectors involved. The motives of the strike were nothing to do with defending labour rights and the Government made every effort to take all measures necessary to fulfil the agreements reached (in its response the Government lists numerous measures, procedures and efforts relating to the agreements). Between making the agreements and the start of the strike, the authorities maintained dialogue and agreement and even asked the religious authorities to intervene to help get the search for shared solutions back on track. It is not true that the Ministry of Labour asked the enterprise JAPDEVA to bring an action for the strike to be declared illegal. The enterprises JAPDEVA and RECOPE requested the ruling and the judicial authority (in the first and second instance) declared the strike illegal as it involved public services essential for the economic life of the country, whose paralysis causes significant serious and immediate damage to certain goods. The judicial authority found that the strike action was not intended to protect the economic interests of the unionized workers but rather that it was taking place as an act of solidarity for the adverse economic situation that the province of Limn is going through which was not per se a situation affecting the whole workforce. Article  of the Labour Code states that strikes will not be permitted in the public services.
.Regarding the alleged threats of dismissal for workers who missed two days of work, the complainant organization does not identify the authority that is meant to have made this declaration. In any case, what is shown by the complainant is the legitimate consequence of illegal strike action (article  of the Labour Code). However, in this case, no worker was dismissed because of the aforementioned illegal strike. The enterprise JAPDEVA merely lowered workers' salaries from  to  September , in accordance with the Freedom of Association Committee s principle that salary deductions for days of strike gives rise to no objection from the point of view of freedom of association principles. The enterprise RECOPE denies non-compliance with the collective agreement and threatening workers for exercising their right to strike.
.Regarding the alleged unjust police action, the Government declares that the -strong police force was not armed and only had tear gas and white smoke in some cases and in no cases had firearms. Neither did they evict the workers from their places of work (in fact they had not entered these places). The police action in some areas was due to disturbances or blockages of the public highway or where it was necessary to avoid damage to fuel storage plants. In these cases they cleared the areas and apprehended those responsible for the disturbances who were handed over to the Public Prosecutor s Department. The police action was rational, restrained and proportionate and within the framework of the laws governing police behaviour (efforts of prevention, security and to conserve public order). The Government rejects the allegations that workers were beaten, leaving several workers injured. The Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court allows the police to use harmless",0,2003,Costa Rica
72,"tear gas of the lowest level of irritation that does not have any side effects and does not warrant medical attention, when public safety, human life or the security of goods is affected.
.On another matter, regarding the alleged use of strike-breakers and non-unionized workers from other areas, including the use of a foreign tug, to restart operations suspended by the strike action in the port in Mon, the enterprise JAPDEVA points out the following:It is worth mentioning that the motives of the strike were nothing to do with defending labour rights. Moreover, they were motivated by their own interests of by-issues over which the administration as employer has exclusive competence.In the motives contained in the  list of demands' were various complaints, for example, regarding port safety and the maintenance of equipment and other things.As was indicated at the beginning, because it involved the provision of essential public services ' as declared by the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic, the Constitutional Chamber and the labour courts themselves, the Government of the Republic endeavoured to continue these services with workers from outside JAPDEVA, which is not illegal; on the contrary, acting in such a way was a right that is enshrined in the most fundamental acts of government and administration and is not detrimental to any type of trade union activity.
.Above all, what the Government of Costa Rica achieved was to guarantee the continuity of an essential public service with those workers available, having taken into account that one of the immediate consequences of the illegal action was the paralysis of fuel distribution throughout the country as well as paralysing Costa Rica s only Atlantic port, dedicated to exports and imports, which, however you look at it, and from a legal perspective, could not be allowed.
.Regarding the unconstitutionality case brought by the Ombudsman against the  JAPDEVA collective agreement, the Government points out that the Constitutional Chamber has not yet ruled and that the Minister of Labour has appeared at the trial to defend the right of collective bargaining, considering that, should the collective agreement be declared unconstitutional for reasons of proportionality, rationality or equality, it would violate Convention No. , ratified by Costa Rica.
.The Government sends abundant documentation relating to its declarations.
.The Committee observes that in this case the allegations refer: () to the declaration of illegality of a strike by workers in the port sector and the fuel sector in the province of Limn, to the intervention of the police to evict workers leaving a number of people wounded and the arrest of  trade union members (freed shortly afterwards) and to the hiring of strike-breakers to replace the strikers; and () to the bringing of a legal action of unconstitutionality against various provisions of the collective agreement in force, particularly at the decision of the Ombudsman.
.The Committee notes the Government s declarations according to which: () the motives of the strike were nothing to do with defending labour rights and refer to supposed non-compliance with the act of agreement of  May  (signed between the authorities, trade unions and civil society) which is essentially political and refers to issues such as  landfill'   public safety' and  plan for regional development'  () the declaration of illegality of the strike was not requested by the authorities but rather by the enterprises JAPDEVA and RECOPE and the judicial authority in the first and second instance declared it illegal as it involved essential public services in which article  of the Labour Code does not permit strikes; () regarding the alleged threat of dismissals, the complainant organization does not mention which authority is alleged to have made it but article  of the Labour Code permits sanctions of this kind in cases of illegal strike; () no worker was dismissed because of the strike in question; () the police did not evict workers from their places of work, they were not carrying firearms and only in some cases used tear gas and white smoke where there were disturbances or blockages of the public highway or to avoid damage to fuel storage plants and always in a rational, restrained and proportionate manner and within the framework of legal standards; () those responsible for the disturbances were apprehended and handed over to the Public Prosecutor s Department; () the Government rejects the allegations that workers were beaten leaving several people wounded; () the Government and the enterprise JAPDEVA secured the continuity of services during the strike with workers from outside the enterprise because it involved an essential public service, given that the strike would lead to the paralysis of Costa Rica s only Atlantic port and of fuel distribution; and () the Government denies that the collective agreement was breached.
.The Committee notes that the strike in question took place from  to  September  and that it ended when the parties reached an agreement on  September.
.Regarding the Government s statement that the motives of the strike had nothing to do with the defence of labour rights and referred to supposed non-compliance with the act of agreement of  May  (which the Government encloses), the Committee observes that said act was signed by the authorities and trade union and civil society organizations, and that, although it may fundamentally contain numerous clauses about economic development of the port of Limn region, it contains certain labour-related clauses or clauses which contain possible benefits for workers (for example, negotiations to revise the basic salary of certain workers so that they are paid a salary that conforms with the international parameters of the region; tripartite commission charged with finding a solution in the sense that six docking companies that are the exclusive property of the workers can bid or be hired); the agreement of  September  that ended the strike also has clauses in favour of certain categories of workers. The Committee concludes that the act of agreement of  May  constitutes an exercise of collective bargaining and therefore if the trade unions believe that it was not fully respected they had the right to call a strike to achieve that objective as long as essential services in the strict sense of the term are not involved.
.The Committee has found on previous occasions that the establishment of minimum services in the case of strike action should only be possible in: () services the interruption of which would endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population (essential services in the strict sense of the term); () services which are not essential in the strict sense of the term but where the extent and duration of a strike might be such as to result in an acute national crisis endangering the normal living conditions of the population; and () in public services of fundamental importance [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. ]. The Committee observes that in this case, there was no minimum service and the authorities hired workers to replace the strikers. The Committee considers that a minimum service could be required in the petroleum sector and ports (loading and unloading) and that it would be desirable that such service be defined with the participation of the authorities, trade union organizations and employers.
.Regarding the arrest of workers, freed shortly afterwards as the complainant organization recognizes, the Committee notes that the Government indicated that those arrested were responsible for disturbances and blocking public highways and that they were handed over to the Public Prosecutor.
.Regarding the legal action for unconstitutionality brought before the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court by the Ombudsman against various provisions of the collective agreement for the port sector, the Committee has been informed that this issue has been submitted to and is being examined by the Committee of Experts, as well as that within the framework of the proceedings of said Committee, the Government has requested a mission of technical assistance for March , as well as the establishment of a dialogue process with employees of the ILO and experts from said Committee.
.In light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:While it notes that the conflict at the origin of the present case was resolved when a collective agreement was signed, the Committee requests the Government to amend the Labour Code in line with Conventions Nos.  and  so as to allow strikes in the public sector when they do not involve essential services in the strict sense of the term.",1,2003,Costa Rica
73,".At its March  session, the Committee requested the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the legal proceedings with regard to the officials Mr. Rodolfo Jimnez Morales and his wife, Ms. Kenya Meja Murillo, and their disassociation from the National Insurance Institute (INS); the Committee requested the Government to inform it of the outcome of the proceedings for defamation against Mr. Rodolfo Jimnez Morales and expressed the hope that the procedures in question would be concluded soon [see th Report, para. ].
.In its communication of  October , the complainant organization (the National Association of Public and Private Employees ' ANEP) sent a copy of the judgements of  May and  October  of the Third Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice, which endorsed the judgement of first instance dismissing the action for defamation instituted by the former executive director of the INS against the union official Mr. Rodolfo Jimnez Morales as the deadline for initiating criminal proceedings had expired. The ANEP adds that, since the disassociation of the officials Mr. Rodolfo Jimnez Morales and his wife, Ms. Kenya Meja Murillo, the INS continues to prevent them from working as insurance brokers; the ANEP expresses its concern as it could take up to ten years for a final judgement to be handed down concerning the disassociation of the two people in question. The ANEP also provides new information and indicates that the complaint by the former director of the INS was not filed in a personal capacity, as maintained by the Government.
.In its communications of  May,  August,  October and  November  and  January and  February , the Government states that the current executive director of the INS sent a report dated  June  in which he indicates that it has been stated repeatedly that the former executive director of the INS instituted proceedings against Mr. Rodolfo Jimnez Morales in his personal capacity and not in his capacity as a public official. Thus, the matter is a private one concerning the complainant and the defendant and, as such, it would be necessary to request information from the complainant concerning the outcome of the proceedings. In other words, the INS is not a party to these judicial proceedings which restricts its access to the case files. Furthermore, with regard to the proceedings under labour law initiated by Mr. Rodolfo Jimnez Morales against the INS, the ordinary proceedings are at the first instance stage, the demonstration phase, during which the various means of proof furnished by both parties and/or requested by the judge are admitted. Given that in cases involving labour issues, evidence can be furnished until such a time as the court is ready to pass judgement, and that the other party is informed of this evidence and can refer to it, the proceedings have taken a very long time. The complainant s most recent judicial proceeding was the submission of a request for reinstatement, on which the court still has to take a decision. Once a decision has been handed down concerning the request for reinstatement and the judge considers that all the evidence has been examined, the judgement of first instance will be pronounced. The Government states that the proceedings concerning the reinstatement of Ms. Kenya Meja Murillo are still pending.
.The Committee notes the judgements provided by the complainant organization which dismiss the action for defamation instituted against union official Mr. Rodolfo Jimnez Morales. The Committee notes the information provided by the Government on developments concerning the labour law proceedings initiated by the official in question and his wife, Ms. Kenya Meja Murillo, whereby they have requested their reinstatement. The Committee notes the complainant organization s concern that the proceedings may last for years. The Committee hopes that the proceedings will soon be concluded and requests the Government to send its observations on the communication from the complainant organization dated  October .
.The Committee last examined this case at its March  session and at that time requested that the Government keep it informed of the outcome of the legal proceedings with regard to the union officials Mr. Rodolfo Jimnez Morales and his wife Ms. Kenya Meja Murillo and their disassociation from the National Insurance Institute (INS). The Committee also requested that the Government inform it of the outcome of the proceedings for defamation against Rodolfo Jimnez Morales [see th Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body at its th session (March )].
.The National Association of Public and Private Employees (ANEP), in its communications of  February and  April , states that on  July  an application was made for enforcement of constitutional rights in the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice to restore the rights to freedom from persecution and the right to work of Mr. Rodolfo Jimnez Morales. This application was rejected on legal grounds by the Constitutional Chamber leaving it to the ordinary industrial courts to pass sentence. Subsequently, Mr. Rodolfo Jimnez Morales applied for a writ of habeas corpus for the order to arrest and imprison put out for him at the time, but this application was declared to have no grounds. The ANEP also alleges persecution against Ms. Kenya Meja, Mr. Rodolfo Jimnez Morales wife, who was dismissed from her new job at the Banco Popular because her immediate superior alleges that the good relationship between said organization and the National Insurance Institute was at risk. Ms. Kenya Meja made an application for enforcement of constitutional rights in the Constitutional Chamber in order to be reinstated. The Constitutional Chamber admitted the application and established temporary reinstatement until a legal ruling was made. However, the authorities at the Banco Popular did not recognize this order and proceeded to dismiss her, but this time without management responsibility, protected by the presumption that the Constitutional Chamber would again reject the application on legal grounds.
.The ANEP condemns the tardiness and inefficiency of the reparation proceedings in the administration of labour justice for anti-union activity and states that the current judicial applications regarding Rodolfo Jimnez Morales and his wife Kenya Meja Murillo will take years.
.The Government, in its communications of  August  states, on the subject of the outcome of the legal proceedings with regard to the officials Mr Rodolfo Jimnez Morales and his wife Kenya Meja Murillo, that they are ordinary labour proceedings in which no ruling of first instance has yet been given.
.Regarding the outcome of the legal proceedings for defamation against Mr. Rodolfo Jimnez Morales, the Government points out that this is a matter of a private nature for which it would be necessary to request information from the complainant when a judicial decision is made. In addition, this action was brought by Mr. Cristobl Zawadski Wojtasiak in a personal capacity and not in his capacity as executive director of the National Security Institute, which is why, in the opinion of the Government, the Committee should not deal with this matter.
.The Government states, regarding the application for enforcement of constitutional rights brought by Mr. Rodolfo Jimnez Morales referred to by the ANEP, that this application was rejected because it corresponded to ordinary jurisdiction; therefore, passing a verdict on the matter could interfere with the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts. Regarding the application for a writ of habeas corpus for the order to arrest and imprison in the first instance (a matter that the Committee had already examined), in relation to the action for defamation against Mr. Rodolfo Jimnez Morales; this application for a writ of Habeas Corpus was rejected because the Penal Court of Justice of the First Justice Circuit of San Jos declared it to be defaulting in the terms of article  of the Code of Penal Procedure by virtue of the fact that the defendant was not able to appear, even though every effort was made.
.The Government states, regarding the application for enforcement of constitutional rights brought by Ms. Kenya Meja Murillo, that the plaintiff was indeed reinstated; however, she was dismissed from the new organization where she worked due to unjustified absence. From the ruling it seems that there is no reason why this would be an unfair dismissal, as it was noted that her last sick note covered the period from  to  June  and the appellant did not come to work in the days subsequent to  June of that year, thus absenting herself unjustifiably.
.Regarding the lawsuit for defamation against Mr. Rodolfo Jimnez Morales, the Committee emphasizes that although the Government states that this is a private dispute, given Mr. Rodolfo Jimnez Morales position as a trade union official and Mr. Cristbal Zawadski Wojtasiak's position as executive director of the National Insurance Institute, it believes it necessary to examine the outcome of the legal proceedings in order to determine whether said official's testimony went too far.
.The Committee reiterates its previous recommendations, requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the legal proceedings with regard to the officials Mr.",-1,2003,Costa Rica
74,"Rodolfo Jimnez Morales and his wife Ms. Kenya Meja Murillo; the Committee requests the Government to inform it of the outcome of the proceedings for defamation against Mr. Rodolfo Jimnez Morales and expresses the hope that the procedures in question will be concluded soon.
.The complaints are presented in communications from the National Association of Insurance Brokers (ANDAS) of  June  and the National Association of Public and Private Employees (ANEP) of  May . ANDAS submitted further information in communications dated  July and  September , and ANEP in communications dated  and  July . The Government sent its observations in communications dated  July,  September and  November .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communications of  June,  July and  September , the National Association of Insurance Brokers (ANDAS) states that, in order to avoid paying their social obligations, the National Insurance Institute (INS) arbitrarily and unilaterally dismissed insurance brokers selling insurance policies, including the executive committee of ANDAS; it partially annulled the rights of these brokers to severance pay and disavowed the existence of the trade union organization and the collective agreement, declaring that the employment contracts had changed to being commercial contracts. According to ANDAS, the political machinations of the INS, using the President s Office and the Attorney-General s Office of the Republic led, in a fraudulent evasion of applicable law, to the employment relationship of those workers being considered a commercial relationship, leaving the insurance brokers unprotected with regard to their social rights and guarantees (health insurance, pension and life insurance). ANDAS indicates that these measures were adopted unilaterally by the INS, contrary to the Constitution and the legislation, and involve false  commercial' contracts. ANDAS indicates that it lodged a judicial complaint against the INS in April , but the proceedings may take years and further legal action for violation of the entire collective agreement. ANDAS indicates that the reason that the insurance brokers accepted, in August , partial payment of their rights to severance pay was because the INS left them no alternative. Moreover, ANDAS was evacuated from its trade union premises (laid down in the collective agreement) and left to collect trade union dues through means other than the check-off facility, which was discontinued by the employer. The set of boxes for trade union members was abolished.
.In its communications of  May,  and  July , the National Association of Public and Private Employees (ANEP) states that on  July  the State, through the courts, issued an order to arrest and imprison Rodolfo Jimnez Morales, a trade union official of the Insurance Brokers' Association (AGEINS) as a result of a defamation complaint (of which he was not notified) submitted by the former executive president of the INS. According to ANEP, this was in the light of retaliation for  the crime' of stating in public that the Social Security (Minimum Standards) Convention,  (No. ) had been violated as a result of the forced relinquishment of the social guarantees of the insurance brokers (which, in the opinion of the trade union official referred to, constituted the beginning of the privatization of the INS), and for revealing acts of corruption and  irregularities attributable to the former president of the INS, an investigation into which had been requested in the Legislative Assembly. According to press cuttings, the  underhand privatization' of the INS entailed the payment of severance pay benefits  without the addition of years of service' to the insurance brokers whose employment contracts were terminated, although they were able to continue with their duties and their client lists.
.ANEP adds that trade union official Rodolfo Jimnez Morales and his wife, Ms. Kenya Meja Murillo (also a trade union official of AGEINS), were ' according to the attached information sent by ANEP ' the only employees dismissed from their posts when they opposed signing of a commercial contract, in the context of a  reorganization' of  insurance brokers; the heads of the opposition party in the Legislative Assembly requested of the President of the Republic that Rodolfo Jimnez Morales be reinstated as he was dismissed in violation of ILO Conventions relating to freedom of association, and they highlighted that this trade union official had promoted the movement for the Legislative Assembly to investigate the irregularities of the  underhand privatization' process and other irregularities at the INS and that his dismissal took the form of retaliation. ANEP adds that both trade union officials, after their dismissal, refused to sign the temporary administrative contract for six months offered to the dismissed insurance brokers, in which their social guarantees were abolished, and the INS gave instructions to exclude Mr. Jimnez Morales and his wife subsequently from the public tender process to accede to the new employment articles of independent broker and not to issue them with the certification for production of premiums (one of the requisites for the tender) as, according to the INS, when they did not sign the temporary contract they lost their status as insurance brokers and their client list. The other insurance brokers were forced to sign the temporary contract as they were threatened with the distribution of their client lists.
.In its communications of  July,  September and  November , the Government sent its observations and the comments of the National Insurance Institute (INS) on the complaint. The Government states that the restructuring carried out at the INS in the insurance policy sales area is based on Act No.  of  November , which approves various international agreements in  and  between Costa Rica and the Inter-American Development Bank that include loans and sectoral programmes for investment and structural adjustment that envisage, among other things, the breaking up of monopolies, dynamic competition in the insurance and re-insurance sectors, participation of the private sector and the restructuring of the INS in this sector. The reorganization of the INS hoped to tackle increasing competitiveness in the field of insurance, insure the sustainability and the increase of sales and achieve better management of client services, providing services to those insured at lower intermediary costs, create a framework for monitoring and control and modernize the regulatory framework of insurance activities. The complainants' accusation of corruption, fraudulent and illegal practices is completely untrue. The Government emphasizes that the present case does not refer to violations of trade union rights but to changes in employment conditions and the articles of association of INS insurance brokers, who move from being employees to independent brokers with a commercial relationship.
.The Government and the INS point out that the administrative reorganization for the reasons explained gave rise to the dismissal, from September , of all  insurance brokers of the INS, whether or not they were trade union members (who received compensation worth millions), for which reason it is not correct to say that the dismissal was a result of anti-union discrimination or persecution. In fact, in this case, the employees affected have not appealed to administrative or judicial bodies on the basis of anti-union discrimination or persecution in spite of the fact that there are appeal procedures laid down in the legislation.
.According to the Government, the reorganization process was carried out in a transparent way and, in fact, the insurance brokers and ANDAS actively took part in the process and in the various activities; the Government attaches a circular of August  from ANDAS (which is recognized as the largest association of insurance brokers), in which it indicates that  ANDAS has participated in this process, endeavouring ' to the extent possible ' to ensure that the form of change undertaken will be that which is least damaging to the brokers' and, in a communication dated  July , it indicated that  in continuing our participation in the search for solutions to the problems affecting us in our employment relations, it is in the interests of the institution to carry forward the model of the independent broker, in which the administration has requested our participation ...' 
.The Government adds that, on a number of occasions, the AGEINS trade union official, Rodolfo Jimnez Morales, was summoned to discuss the new model of independent broker but Mr. Jimnez Morales showed no interest whatsoever, nor did he reply to the invitations, this at least according to INS documentation.
.The labour court, in Decision No.  issued on  July , clearly stated that from  September  insurance brokers would no longer be employees of the INS and would move to having independent status under the administrative employment system regulated by the act on administrative employment (a commercial contract rather than an employment contract), for which reason this is not a false employment relationship.
.A large group of insurance brokers lodged a complaint (currently under way) with the ordinary labour courts, in which they demand,",0,2003,Costa Rica
75,"specifically, that the existence of an employment relationship between independent brokers and the INS (following reorganization) be stated.
.The Government states that the brokers have not been deprived of social security and that nothing restricts the right of each broker or each family to enrol in a voluntary insurance programme with the Costa Rican Social Security Fund, as was stated by the legal authorities in the ordinary legal proceedings against the INS, which was appealed.
.In spite of the employment relationship being terminated, the brokers, in a transition plan of six-months' duration, were freely able to continue working under a temporary administrative contract, in which case they had the possibility of participating in a public competition that culminated in making the administrative contracts for independent brokers official and they were able to sign contracts with commercial companies made up of these; in this way there were very satisfactory results for the INS (sustained increase in income through sales, reduction of administrative expenses, greater possibilities of access to services, decentralization of administrative procedures, etc.).
.According to the Government, Rodolfo Jimnez Morales and his wife, Kenya Meja Murillo, did not present themselves to sign the temporary contract of services in the time limit laid down, and for this reason they disqualified themselves from this process of temporary employment and the new model of independent broker, preferring to use judicial procedures to request their reinstatement in the INS (incidentally, without bringing up at any time anti-union persecution), in spite of the fact that, currently, there are no insurance brokers in this company. As a result of not signing the temporary contract, they lost their accreditation and their client list was transferred to the INS. Moreover, the Insurance Brokers' Association of the INS (AGEINS) (in which the couple are officials), which was established with  members on  August , is not a trade union nor is it registered as such. It is an association that is registered in the commercial register, according to government documentation.
.Decision No.  of  July  of the labour courts clearly stated that the collective agreement signed by the INS and ANDAS, which governed the relationship of the insurance brokers and which provided premises for the trade union, is not in force, as the employer denounced this collective agreement one month prior to its expiry. The arbitrator s decision regulating labour relations expired on  November ; moreover, in an act that damaged the principle of good faith, the insurance brokers used one of the boxes to receive communications and the trade union headquarters to attempt, through having legal domicile, to re-establish labour relations, after having signed an administrative agreement. These facilities have continued to be used up until now, in which as a legal domicile they tried to show through these facilities that they had continuity of employment contracts (the Government provides documentation in this respect).
.According to the documentation received, the judicial order to arrest and imprison Rodolfo Jimnez Morales occurred as a result of his non-appearance before the judicial authorities following the action brought against him by the former president of the INS for defamation. The judicial authorities established contempt of court for non-appearance following information that the person concerned was not to be found at the address that he himself provided and that, on two occasions, there had been telephone communication by the legal assistant in which he was informed of the action and the need to be present. The complaint indicates that Mr. Jimnez Morales stated to Radioperidicos that the president of the INS was a person who  alters invoices ... who buys people ...'  The Government states that the complaint lodged by the president of the INS falls into the personal and individual sphere and that no consequences arising out of this can be accepted for the Institute or the Government. The INS confirms that the complaint was not lodged on behalf of the INS.
.The Committee notes that in the present case the complainant organizations allege that the National Insurance Institute (INS) was unilaterally reorganized in August , terminating the employment contracts of  insurance brokers (, according to the Government), including members of the ANDAS executive committee, whose relationship with the employer became a commercial one without social guarantees, in a fraudulent evasion of applicable law and in violation of the Constitution and the legislation; the dismissal of two trade union officials of AGEINS who refused to accept the change in the articles of association and, with regard to whom, the INS issued instructions for exclusion from the new non-employment articles of independent broker. They also allege a judicial order for the arrest and imprisonment for alleged defamation following statements by a trade union official of AGEINS against the  underhand privatization'  Finally, the complainant organizations allege the withdrawal of the trade union facilities laid down in the collective agreement (premises, sets of boxes, etc.), the existence of which, moreover, was disavowed.
.The Committee notes the statements of the Government and the INS rejecting the allegations, as follows: () the reorganization of the INS to restructure and to reduce costs was not unilateral but rather, according to the documentation attached, carried out with the participation of the insurance brokers and ANDAS, and that the representative of AGEINS did not reply to the invitations issued to him; () the dismissals affected all insurance brokers and, as such, cannot be held to constitute anti-union discrimination; () the employees dismissed were paid compensation and were offered a temporary administrative contract under which they were able to participate in a subsequent public tender as independent insurance brokers; () the legal authorities stated that the collective agreement (denounced by the employer one month prior to its expiry), including the sections relating to the trade union premises and the arbitrator s decision (which had expired), were inapplicable; () the legal authorities had stated that from  September the insurance brokers would no longer be workers or employees of the INS and would become independent under the administrative contract, for which reason this was not a false labour relationship; () with regard to their rights to social security, the brokers could enrol in a voluntary insurance programme with the Costa Rican Social Security Fund and this was stated by the legal authorities; () the two trade union officials of AGEINS referred to by the complainant organizations are not officials of a trade union but of an association registered in the commercial register; after their dismissal, they did not accept the temporary administrative contract offered and, because of this, they lost their accreditation and their client list, choosing instead to appeal for reinstatement to their previous positions with the legal authorities; () the judicial order to arrest and imprison trade union official Rodolfo Jimnez Morales of AGEINS arose because he was declared in contempt by the judicial authorities for not appearing before them as a result of a complaint for defamation lodged by the former president of the INS, after Mr. Jimnez Morales stated on the radio that the former president  alters invoices' and  buys people'  according to the INS and the Government, the complaint was lodged on an individual and personal basis by the former president of the INS and not on behalf of the Institute; and () the Government sent documentation attesting that the ANDAS facilities (trade union premises, boxes) were being used as the legal domicile in order to try to show continuity of employment contracts, after the insurance brokers had signed an administrative contract; for this reason use of these facilities was withdrawn.
.The Committee emphasizes in this regard that the right to express opinions through the press or otherwise is an essential aspect of trade union rights [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. ]. The Committee has indicated that it can examine allegations concerning economic rationalization programmes and restructuring processes, whether or not they imply redundancies or the transfer of enterprises or services from the public to the private sector, only in so far as they might have given rise to acts of discrimination or interference against trade unions [see Digest, op. cit., para. ].
.In these circumstances, the trade union organizations having been able to take part in the restructuring process of the INS, and noting that the dismissals affected all the insurance brokers of the INS, the Committee concludes that there does not seem to have been any anti-union discrimination. The Committee notes that the restructuring process consisted mainly of a change in the legal articles of association affecting the insurance brokers, who were offered the possibility of participating ' under a temporary administrative contract ' in a public tendering process to choose to be independent agents, in the context in which the collective agreement had expired and it considers, without assessing the following proceedings, that in itself this had no bearing on trade union freedoms.
.With regard to the alleged instructions of the INS to exclude the AGEINS trade union officials, Rodolfo Jimnez",0,2003,Costa Rica
76,"Morales, and his wife, Kenya Meja Murillo, from the public tendering process to accede to the new status of independent agent, the Committee notes the Government s explanations in this regard rejecting these allegations and that it also denies that they were officials of a trade union. Given that the complainant organizations have appealed that the disassociation of these employees with regard to the INS is linked to defence activities in the interests of the insurance brokers (in particular, denouncement of irregularities and the attempt to establish a commission of inquiry in the Legislative Assembly on the restructuring process), the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the legal proceedings with regard to both officials. The Committee also requests the Government to inform it of the outcome of the proceedings for defamation against Rodolfo Jimnez Morales.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the present report and, in particular, the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the legal proceedings with regard to AGEINS officials, Rodolfo Jimnez Morales, and his wife, Kenya Meja Murillo.(b) The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the outcome of the proceedings for defamation against Rodolfo Jimnez Morales.",-1,2003,Costa Rica

.The Government sent new observations in a communication dated  September .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the present case, the complainant organization alleged anti-union dismissals (with payment of the legal compensation set out in the legislation on unfair dismissal) of a group of workers in the PROPOKODUSA company ( according to the information provided by the Government and the company) including the eight members of the executive committee of the SINTRAINAVI union because of the formation of this union, the dismissals taking place without warning on  July  when the workers in question did not accept the new and unilateral conditions of work proposed by the company, which invoked a supposed and unknown process of restructuring of the company.
.The Committee observed that the company, for its part, maintained that the dismissals did not have anti-union but economic motives, that the process of restructuring was known to the workers since the beginning of , that meetings had been held with the workers (the last on  January ), that only  of the  company workers were members of the union and that  July  was the deadline for workers to accept the restructuring, i.e. the new conditions of work proposed by the company and that anyone who did not accept the changes would be dismissed with payment of their full labour entitlements.
.The Committee notes the Government s information with regard to the provisions of the Labour Code, which protects against anti-union discrimination, and which includes administrative and judicial proceedings allowing anti-union dismissals to be declared null and void and penalties to be imposed.
.The Committee notes that the complainant organizations have not sent the additional information that was requested from them and that neither the complainant organizations nor the Government have indicated that those dismissed have begun legal proceedings. In these circumstances, taking into account the contradicting reports of the complainants and the company on the dismissals, the Committee is not in a position to reach conclusions on this matter and, therefore, will not proceed with an examination of this case.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.
.The complaint is contained in a letter from the Latin American Workers' Confederation (CLAT) dated  November . The World Confederation of Labour (WCL) supported the complaint in its letter of  December .
.The Government sent its observations in a letter of  February .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its letter of  November , the Latin American Workers' Confederation (CLAT) alleges the violation of trade union rights in the poultry company PROPOKODUSA where a group of workers were dismissed for forming a trade union (constituted on  June  with  workers), the Poultry Industry and Similar Workers' Union (SINTRAINAVI). This union fulfilled all the legal requirements and is affiliated to the Trade Union Organization Movement of Costa Rican Workers (CMTC). Despite efforts by the CMTC to bring about a dialogue between the company and the trade union on its recognition and reinstating the workers in their jobs, it was not successful. The CLAT has sent various documents and information on these dismissals which can be summarized as follows.
.On  June , the workers of the company in question formed the SINTRAINAVI union. The company s response was not long in coming and on  June, without warning, the workers were called by the management in small groups to accept unilateral conditions of work under a supposed reorganization of the company of which they had no knowledge. The workers who did not accept the new unilateral conditions, which were not only fundamental but no time was allowed to consider them, immediately received a dismissal letter. They were told that those who did not collect the letter would have to wait until the employers' representatives handed it to them in the presence of two witnesses.
.The trade union confederation to which SINTRAINAVI is affiliated (the CMTC) lodged a complaint of violation of the right of freedom of association with the Ministry of Labour on  September . Following the formation of the trade union (on  June ) the workers were threatened with dismissal and changes in working hours and form of remuneration. On  July the trade union requested a meeting. The company replied on  July asking what subjects were to be discussed and on  July the trade union members were unfairly, without warning, called in small groups by company representatives who gave them two options: accept the new conditions clearly prejudicial to the workers' economic interests or sign for a letter of dismissal with management responsibility and the requirement to complete one month s work (notice). The workers refused to sign. On  July the CMTC sought an urgent meeting with the Ministry of Labour to have the company reconsider the dismissals and that it should first attend the meeting requested by the trade union. On  July the dismissed members and members of the executive committee were given a cheque for their legal entitlements and prevented from entering the workplace, in breach of the legal one month s notice. On  August, after a meeting between representatives of the trade union and the Ministry, the company stated its decision to uphold the dismissals.
.In its letter of  February , the Government states that the Ministry of Labour received an initial complaint from the Costa Rican Confederation of Democratic Workers Rerum Novarum ( September ) and subsequently from the Trade Union Organization Movement of Costa Rican Workers (CMTC) ( September ) against the PROPOKODUSA company SA for trade union harassment and unfair labour practices. The Ministry asked them for the SINTRAINAVI workers' membership cards and an attestation of the legal status of that trade union. The issue was also raised as to which of the two confederations could legitimately represent the trade union. The Rerum Novarum Confederation later withdrew its complaint.
.The report of  December  by the competent Regional Director in the National Directorate of Labour states that the CMTC only provided information on the eight members of the trade union s executive committee without indicating, among other things, to what extent they were affected by the alleged unlawful actions by the company and which other members of the union were also affected, which information has still not been provided by the complainant organizations, although they were repeatedly requested to do so. Independent of the complaint of trade union harassment and unfair labour practices lodged by the CMTC, the labour inspectors carried out an inspection of the PROPOKODUSA workplace on  October  and were told, among other things, about offences involving excessive working hours, prohibited working hours, compulsory minimum rest and the minimum wage. In addition, according to the workers, when asked who was a member of a union, none of them replied in the affirmative. The Regional Director s report states that, since it was impossible to proceed with the investigation for failure by the complainant organization to provide the information required by law, a decision to shelve the case would be taken within the next few days in view of the lack of interest of the complainant.
.The Government states that on  July , on the instructions of the Minister of Labour, two labour inspectors and the Director-General of Labour Affairs visited the company s premises to ascertain the facts and deal with the initial complaint submitted by the Trade Union Organization Movement of Costa Rican Workers (CMTC) about the dismissal of members of the Poultry Industry and Similar Workers' Union (SINTRAINAVI). On that occasion they spoke separately with trade union representatives and made the first moves to bring about a conciliation meeting. They returned to the factory on  July , to urge a conciliation meeting between the trade union and the company. On that date, the dismissal of  workers took place and they were paid termination entitlements. A police patrol at the factory gates was observed. On  August , a conciliation meeting was convened by the Office of the Vice-Minister of Labour, attended by the Vice-Minister and the Director-General of Labour Affairs, to seek a solution to the dispute between the trade union and the company. At the meeting, the parties reiterated their positions:' PROPOKODUSA company: since  March  the  workers in the processing plant had been notified of the company s reorganization, consisting of hourly pay rather than piecework (for processed chicken) as had been the case until then and",1,2002,Costa Rica
78,"to work only eight hours, in compliance with labour legislation. On  July , these workers were presented with a new personnel action with the changes in question. Anyone who did not accept the changes was dismissed with payment of their full labour entitlements. On  July , they were called on to decide, summoned to the administration in groups of , and those who did not accept the new conditions were dismissed. The company continues to state that the trade union was formed during the reorganization process, and that they had no knowledge of the names of the members, although they did know the names of the leaders. In any case, all the workers were given the option of continuing to work and if the trade union leaders did not accept the new conditions, no one forced them to do so. Of the  workers affected by the reorganization (not the same number as the total workforce)  did not accept the new conditions, and were therefore given their letter of dismissal by the management. The company does not know if members were dismissed because it does not know their names.' Trade Union Organization Movement of Costa Rican Workers: there is an industrial dispute in the company as a result of the dismissal of the executive committee of a trade union formed on  June  and who are seeking reinstatement. On  July , the trade union presented the company with an agenda for discussion, including, among other things, that workers were given five minutes to accept the new conditions or be dismissed. The workers' organization seeks reinstatement, recognition of the trade union and the opening of negotiations.Other possible meetings between the parties, with the mediation of the Ministry of Labour, were ruled out because the company informed the Vice-Minister by telephone of its refusal to consider the points proposed by the trade union.
.In a letter of  December , the National Director and Inspector General of Labour asked the Ministry of Labour for the investigation into the case to be continued.
.The Government sends a letter from the company concerning the complaint in which it underlines the following points: () since January  the company was expanding rapidly and hired new workers (under a new system of working hours and form of pay) and had to reorganize; () from that month onwards, in a fully transparent manner, the company kept the workers informed through several meetings and announced that there would be changes (different working hours and pay ' which would be higher ' in particular to align them with the conditions of work of the new workers who had been hired because of the expansion of the company s activities); () right in the middle of the restructuring process,  of the  workers formed a trade union; () the deadline for accepting the restructuring and the new conditions was  July , the company indicating that those who did not accept would be dismissed, although the company hoped that they would all accept; () many of those who belonged to the trade union accepted the new conditions, others did not accept but later changed their mind, in which case the company cancelled the dismissal order; () none of the members of the executive committee of the trade union accepted the restructuring and were dismissed, and paid all their entitlements; () the company acted lawfully and there are no legal proceedings against it on this matter; () the purpose of the restructuring was economic and not anti-union; and () the vacant jobs have already been filled.
.According to trade union documents sent by the Government, the formation of the trade union was notified to the Ministry of Labour on  June  and to the company on  July . According to a letter from the company provided by the Government,  workers left (were dismissed from) the company when faced with two alternatives due to the restructuring of the company (offer of better conditions of work or total termination of their employment rights).
.The following is the model letter of acceptance of the restructuring:I, the undersigned  ?hereby inform you as follows:
.I accept the new restructuring of the company.
.I accept the new payment for my work which will be  colons per hour with effect from  August .
.I accept the new working hours which will be  hours per week with effect from  August .
.In the light of the foregoing, with effect from  August  I shall cease to work under the conditions which previously applied and will begin to work under the new conditions set out in paragraphs  and  of this letter.
.I thereby continue as an employee retaining my length of service rights.Signature of the worker.
.The Committee observes that in the present case the complainant organization has alleged anti-union dismissals with management responsibility (i.e. with payment of the legal compensation set out in the legislation on unfair dismissal) of a group of workers in the PROPOKODUSA company ( according to the information provided by the Government and the company) including the eight members of the executive committee of the SINTRAINAVI union because of the formation of this union, the dismissals taking place without warning on  July  when the workers in question did not accept the new and unilateral conditions of work proposed by the company, which invoked a supposed and unknown process of restructuring of the company.
.The Committee observes that the company, for its part, maintains that the dismissals do not have anti-union but economic motives, that the process of restructuring was known to the workers since the beginning of , that meetings had been held in the company (the last on  July ), that only  of the  company workers were members of the union and that  July  was the deadline for workers to accept the restructuring, i.e. the new conditions of work proposed by the company (see last paragraph of the Government s reply) and that anyone who did not accept the changes would be dismissed with payment of their full labour entitlements.
.The Committee takes note of the inspections and conciliation hearings (which were unsuccessful) conducted by the Ministry of Labour authorities as a result of a trade union complaint and observes that in the investigation the trade union side did not provide the membership cards of all the members dismissed as requested by the authorities but only those of the eight members of the trade union s executive committee, nor did it state how far and to what degree the alleged unlawful actions by the company affected those members, for which reason it was not possible to proceed with the investigation for lack of the information requested from the complainant trade union. The Committee observes that on  December, the National Director and Inspector General of Labour asked for the investigation into the case to be continued.
.The Committee observes that, contrary to the company, the complainant organization maintains that the workers had no knowledge of the restructuring until the last minute.
.The Committee requests the Government and the complainant organizations to send additional information and, in particular, to transmit all legislative texts ensuring protection of trade union officials and to indicate whether this legislation protects them against dismissal throughout their term of office (except in the case of serious professional misconduct) or whether it only protects them to the extent that the dismissal decision or other prejudicial measure is related to the performance of trade union activities.
.Finally, the Committee regrets in any case that the company did not consult the trade union concerning the restructuring. The Committee therefore underlines the importance of employers and workers' organizations consulting on questions of common interest and seeking to reach agreement and in particular to discuss the consequences of restructuring programmes on employment and conditions of work.
.In the light of the foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee requests the Government and the complainant organizations to send additional information and, in particular, to transmit all legislative texts ensuring protection of trade union officials and to indicate whether this legislation protects them against dismissal throughout their term of office (except in the case of serious professional misconduct) or whether it only protects them to the extent that the dismissal decision or other prejudicial measure is related to the performance of trade union activities.",-1,2002,Costa Rica
79,".At its March  meeting, the Committee requested the Government to keep it informed of any developments with regard to: () the proceedings concerning trade union official Luis Enrique Chacn, the Ministry of Public Education and the Public University of Costa Rica; and () the initiatives by the authorities to guarantee fully collective bargaining in the public sector (the Government had informed it that the draft instruments of adoption of ILO Conventions Nos.  and  had been tabled before the Legislative Assembly).
.In its communications of  May,  August,  September and  November , the Government reiterates the information previously provided and points out that it is expecting a report from the Ministry of Public Education on these issues and will forward it to the Committee as soon as it receives it. The Government recalls that the Ministry of Education was acquitted in the first instance of the proceedings for unfair labour practices and violation of freedom of association.
.The Committee notes this information and reiterates its previous recommendations. It expresses the hope that the proceedings in question will be brought to a prompt conclusion.
.At its meeting in March , the Committee requested the Government to keep it informed with regard to issues relating to the dismissal of the trade union official Luis Enrique Chacn, the unfair practices of the University of Costa Rica verified by the administrative authority and the violations of the Ministry of Education in the matter of trade union leave [see rd Report, paras. -].
.The Government states that the proceedings regarding the dismissal of Luis Enrique Chacn, the Ministry of Public Education and the University of Costa Rica are still pending. The Government reiterates the various initiatives and measures on the part of the Ministry of Labour and other authorities to guarantee collective bargaining. The Government also states that the Executive (the President of the Republic and the Ministry of the Presidency), by Decree No. -MP of  July , tabled the draft instruments of adoption of ILO Conventions Nos.  and  for examination by the extraordinary sessions of the legislative assembly which opened on  August .
.The Committee takes note of this information and requests the Government to keep it informed of any developments with regard to these issues.
.At its November  meeting [see th Report, paras. -] and its June  meeting [see st Report, paras. -], the Committee made the following recommendations on the pending questions:' the Committee requests the Government to inform it of the decisions handed down relating to: () the dismissal of trade union official Luis Enrique Chacn; () the unfair labour practices at the University of Costa Rica verified by the administrative authorities; and () the violations of the Ministry of Education in the matter of trade union leave;' the Committee notes with interest the various initiatives taken by the Ministry of Labour and other authorities (proposed constitutional and legislative amendments, etc.) with a view to guaranteeing full enjoyment of the right of collective bargaining in the public sector, including bills to ratify Conventions Nos.  and , and notes that an ILO official has provided technical assistance in one of these initiatives. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments with regard to these issues.
.In its communications of  September and  November , the Government states that the legal proceedings relating to this case are awaiting decisions. Moreover, the Government outlines the steps taken and the efforts made by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security with the Legislative Assembly for the ratification of Conventions Nos.  and , the draft acts of which are to be found under agenda items  and  of the  first discussions in the second part of the plenary session'  All of the above shows the Government s interest and goodwill in ensuring collective bargaining in the public sector.
.The Committee notes this information and requests the Government to keep it informed with regard to these issues.
.At its meeting in November , the Committee made the following recommendations on pending questions [see th Report, paras. -]:' The Committee notes with interest the Government s intention to adapt its legislation to the ILO standards relating to collective bargaining and the steps it has taken to do so, which include a constitutional reform (which has been submitted to the legislative plenary) and the submission of draft legislation for the ratification of Conventions Nos.  and . The Committee hopes that progress will be made in the near future and requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.' With regard to the other two recommendations made at its previous meeting, the Committee notes that the Government has not sent the information requested of it and therefore the Committee repeats these requests, that the Government:n with regard to the matter of unfair labour practices at the University of Costa Rica noted by the administrative authorities, keep it informed of any appeal and any new decision;n keep it informed of the outcome of the complaint lodged by the administrative authorities to the courts after confirming that the Ministry of Education had committed violations in the matter of trade union leave.' Finally, the Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the dismissal of the trade union official, Mr. Luis Enrique Chacn.
.In its communications of  January and  March , the Government lists the many steps taken by the Ministry of Labour to ensure that the Legislative Assembly examines the draft legislation to ratify ILO Conventions Nos.  and  before the end of the period of extraordinary sessions ( April ). Also, at the initiative of the Ministry of Labour, an official of the multidisciplinary advisory team provided technical assistance to the leaders of the various parties in the legislature in connection with these Conventions. These initiatives were all intended to guarantee collective bargaining in the public sector. In addition, the government party in the Legislative Assembly on  May  submitted a proposal to amend article  of the Constitution, which was the result of dialogue between the authorities and the trade union confederations. With the same objective, the executive branch submitted to the Legislative Assembly amendments to the General Public Administration Act, together with a draft law to introduce collective bargaining in the public sector which gives force of law to Decree No.  of  May . The draft law in question was the result of work done by a bipartite commission. The Government also refers to recent administrative rulings (which are binding) confirming the right of public servants to negotiate collective agreements.
.The Government also states that the judicial proceedings in connection with violations (by the Ministry of Education) of trade union leave entitlements and unfair labour practices in the University of Costa Rica, as well as the proceedings in connection with the dismissal of trade union leader, Luis Enrique Chacn, have yet to be concluded.
.The Committee notes the Government s information on these proceedings, and requests the Government to supply copies of any rulings that may be handed down. The Committee notes with interest the various initiatives taken by the Ministry of Labour and other authorities (proposed constitutional and legislative amendments, etc.) with a view to guaranteeing full enjoyment of the right of collective bargaining in the public sector, including bills to ratify Conventions Nos.  and ; and notes that an ILO official has provided technical assistance in one of these initiatives. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments with regard to these issues.
.The Committee last examined this case concerning restrictions of the right of collective bargaining in the public sector and unfair labour practices in the education sector at its March  meeting [see th Report, paras. -]. On this occasion, the Committee made the following conclusions and recommendations:' The Committee expresses its deep concern at the situation with regard to the right of collective bargaining in the public sector, which constitutes a serious violation of Convention No.  and trusts that this situation may be resolved once the Legislative Assembly ratifies Conventions Nos.  and .' As regards the allegations of anti-union discrimination by the University of Costa Rica, the Committee notes with interest the Government s statements to the effect that the anti-union actions in question (dismissal procedure against trade union official Mr. Luis Enrique Chacn Solano, pay cuts, blacklists with threats of pay cuts, etc.) have been remedied, and that the University authorities have been urged in future to refrain from taking action of that type. Taking into account the fact that an appeal may be lodged against the administrative resolution confirming the existence of these unfair practices, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any appeal that may be lodged and any new decision.' The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the complaint lodged by the administrative authorities to the courts after confirming that the Ministry of Education had committed violations in the",0,2000,Costa Rica
80,"matter of trade union leave.[Specifically, the complainant organization had supplied a copy of a resolution by the administrative authorities dated  November , which confirmed certain actions by the Ministry of Education with regard to trade union leave that violated the principles of ILO Conventions Nos. ,  and .]
.In a communication dated  June , the complainant organization (SINDEU) states that the trade union official Mr. Luis Enrique Chacn was dismissed in spite of previous resolutions by the administrative authorities that provided this official with protection.
.In a communication dated  May , the Government sends a copy of draft law No. , concerning the reform of article  of the Political Constitution to guarantee collective bargaining in the public sector, which went before the legislative plenary on  May . The explanatory preamble of the draft law refers to the conclusions of the ILO technical assistance mission that visited the country recently and recognizes that  obviously the prevailing legal uncertainty has greatly hindered legal and constitutional performance, and has moreover given rise to excessive constraint of the right to collective bargaining'  The Government hopes that this plenary session will approve the draft law, which will allow ratification of Conventions Nos.  and . The new article will allow the granting of the right to collective bargaining in the public sector to public employees who are governed by the statute of civil servants and carry out public administration as representatives of the public authorities (upper-level management employees in public administration, such as members of executive boards of institutions, executive presidents, managers and heads of diplomatic missions; high-level supervisory employees for public finance, such as auditors, sub-auditors and the Comptroller-General of the Republic; employees in positions of trust, the Attorney-General of the Republic, the Council for Public Defence and employees of similar nature). This constitutional reform will be implemented under ordinary law. Moreover, the Government repeats that it has submitted to the Legislative Assembly draft laws for the ratification of Conventions Nos.  and  concerning collective bargaining in the public sector.
.The Committee notes with interest the Government s intention to adapt its legislation to the ILO standards relating to collective bargaining and the steps it has taken to do so, which include a constitutional reform (which has been submitted to the legislative plenary) and the submission of draft legislation for the ratification of Conventions Nos.  and . The Committee hopes that progress will be made in the near future and requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.With regard to the other two recommendations made at its previous meeting, the Committee notes that the Government has not sent the information requested of it and therefore the Committee repeats these requests, that the Government:' with regard to the matter of unfair labour practices at the University of Costa Rica noted by the administrative authorities, keep it informed of any appeal and any new decision;' keep it informed of the outcome of the complaint lodged by the administrative authorities to the courts after confirming that the Ministry of Education had committed violations in the matter of trade union leave.
.Finally, the Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the dismissal of the trade union official, Mr. Luis Enrique Chacn.
.The complaints are contained in communications from the Association of Employees of the University of Costa Rica (SINDEU), the Union of Medical Professionals of the Costa Rica Social Insurance Fund and Allied Institutions (SIPROCIMECA) and the Costa Rica Union of Education Workers (SEC), dated respectively  October ,  September  and  November . The SINDEU provided additional information in a communication dated  January .
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  January,  May,  August and  October .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.As regards the alleged adverse effects of certain rulings by the Constitutional Division of the Supreme Court of Justice regarding the right of collective bargaining in the public sector, the Committee notes the Government s observations and in particular the Executive Regulation of  May  respecting that right. The Committee also notes that legislative bills to ratify ILO Conventions Nos.  and , which deal among other things with the right of collective bargaining in the public administration, have been submitted to the Legislative Assembly for approval. The Committee notes that the Committee of Experts has already expressed its views on the issue of collective bargaining in the public sector, as follows:The Committee notes that, according to the report of the technical assistance mission, there are good grounds for believing, including the opinion expressed by the President of the Constitutional Chamber, that the Chamber s rulings Nos. - of  May  and - of  August , as well as the Chamber s vote of clarification (No. -) of  November , totally exclude collective bargaining for all public sector employees with a statutory employment status, including those working in public or commercial enterprises or in independent public institutions. The Committee notes the action taken by the Government, in the context of this case law, to defend the right of collective bargaining in the public sector, and more particularly the recent Decree No. -MTSS of  May  (regulations for the negotiation of collective agreements in the public sector), which only excludes from this right public servants of the highest level in the public sector, and that the above regulations, in accordance with the recommendations of the technical assistance provided by the ILO, includes certain substantial improvements with regard to the  regulations (for example, abolition of the approval commission, broadening the scope of application of the Convention, limitations on collective bargaining only for the public sector or its representatives) and which were the subject of certain comments by the technical assistance mission with a view to developing future legislation, in which emphasis was placed on certain problems and on the need to clarify certain points.Nevertheless, the Committee notes that the technical assistance mission, commenting on the above rulings of the Constitutional Chamber, ""emphasizes the confusion, uncertainty and even legal insecurity existing with regard to the scope of the right to collective bargaining in the public sector in terms of the employees and public servants covered (according to the rulings, the administration of the public institutions or enterprises is responsible for determining which employees have statutory status, and their decision may in turn be appealed to the judicial authorities) and in parallel concerning the validity and effect of certain collective agreements which are in force, as well as the constitutionality of the large number (according to the Government) of de facto negotiations existing, and even of the recent regulations respecting collective bargaining in the public sector of  May . The mission also emphasizes that the ruling of  May  indicates that it has retroactive effect"".The Committee expresses its deep concern over this situation, which constitutes a serious violation of Convention No.  in terms of the right to collective bargaining in the public sector, since the Convention only allows the exclusion from its application of public servants engaged in the administration of the State (Article ). However, the Committee notes the existence of a Bill which is before the Legislative Assembly and is supported by the social partners and the Government, the President of the Legislative Assembly and the main opposition party, providing for the ratification of ILO Conventions Nos.  and  (which address, among other matters, the right of collective bargaining in the public administration) and which would make it possible to find solutions to the problems that exist and strengthen the application of Convention No. . It expresses the firm hope that it will be adopted in the very near future and requests the Government to provide information in this respect.
.The Committee shares the view expressed by the Committee of Experts. It expresses its deep concern at the situation with regard to the right of collective bargaining in the public sector, which constitutes a serious violation of Convention No. , and trusts that this situation may be resolved once the Legislative Assembly ratifies Conventions Nos.  and . The Committee emphasizes the principle that: ""It is imperative that the legislation contain specific provisions clearly and explicitly recognizing the right of organizations of public employees and officials who are not acting in the capacity of agents of the state administration to conclude collective agreements. From the point of view of the principles laid down by the supervisory bodies of the ILO in connection with Convention No. , this right could only be denied to officials working in the ministries and other comparable government bodies but not, for example, to persons working in public undertakings or autonomous public institutions"" [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, , th edition, para. ].
.As regards the allegations of",1,2000,Costa Rica
81,"anti-union discrimination by the University of Costa Rica, the Committee notes with interest the Government s statements to the effect that the anti-union actions in question (dismissal procedure against trade union official Mr. Luis Enrique Chacn Solano, pay cuts, blacklists with threats of pay cuts, etc.) have been remedied, and that the University authorities have been urged in future to refrain from taking action of that type. Taking into account the fact that an appeal may be lodged against the administrative resolution confirming the existence of these unfair practices, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any appeal that may be lodged and of any new decision.
.As regards the allegation regarding the failure by the authorities to honour the commitments to ratify certain ILO Conventions, the Committee notes the Government s statements to the effect that the complainant has not specified which instruments it is referring to, or what ratification requires approval of the instruments by the Legislative Assembly, which is separate from and independent of the executive branch. The Committee notes that according to the Government, various ILO instruments, including Conventions Nos.  and , have been submitted to the Legislative Assembly.
.Lastly, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the complaint lodged by the administrative authorities to the courts after finding that the Ministry of Education had committed violations in the matter of trade union leave.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee expresses its deep concern at the situation with regard to the right of collective bargaining in the public sector, which constitutes a serious violation of Convention No. , and trusts that this situation may be resolved once the Legislative Assembly ratifies Conventions Nos.  and .(b) The Committee requests the Government, with regard to the matter of unfair labour practices noted by the administrative authorities, to keep it informed of any appeal and any new decision.(c) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the complaint lodged by the administrative authorities to the courts after confirming that the Ministry of Education had committed violations in the matter of trade union leave.",0,2000,Costa Rica
82,".At its March  meeting, the Committee requested the Government to transmit the decision handed down relating to the dismissal of trade union official Mario Alberto Zamora Cruz [see th Report, para. ], having noted the Government s statement that an appeal had been filed with the labour tribunal against the decision of the Civil Service Tribunal, dated  August , that the dismissal of Mario Alberto Zamora Cruz was justified and did not give rise to any liability on the part of the State.
.In its communications of  May,  August,  September and  November , the Government states that it requested the Minister of Justice to provide the information requested by the Committee and to transmit it as soon as possible. The Government states that on  June , the Minister of Justice stated that the case of trade union official Mario Alberto Zamora Cruz was still pending, awaiting a decision concerning the appeal to the labour tribunal, given that the appeal regarding constitutionality was lodged by the Office of the Attorney-General of the Republic and questioned the actions of the judicial tribunals as a higher court, leading, among other things, to the suspension of all appeal processes by the labour tribunal until the Constitutional Chamber could issue a statement in this respect. The abovementioned appeal regarding constitutionality was recently resolved, but the full text of the ruling is still not available.
.The Committee notes this information and requests the Government to transmit the ruling handed down by the labour tribunal. The Committee hopes that the process in question will be concluded rapidly.
.At its meeting in March , the Committee requested the Government to transmit the decision handed down relating to the dismissal of trade union official Mario Alberto Zamora Cruz [see rd Report, para. ].
.In its communication of  August , the Government reports on the decision of the Civil Service Tribunal dated  August , that the dismissal of Mario Alberto Zamora Cruz was justified and did not give rise to any liability on the part of the State. The Government adds that an appeal against the decision has been filed with the labour tribunal and is still pending.
.The Committee takes note of this information and requests the Government to communicate any ruling handed down by the labour tribunal.
.At its November  meeting, the Committee requested the Government to keep it informed of the final administrative decisions and judicial verdicts handed down in relation to the case of trade union leader Mario Alberto Zamora Cruz [see th Report, paras. -].
.In its communications of  March and  September , the Government states that, in Decision No.  of , the Small Claims Labour Tribunal, Second Division, rejected the complaint filed by Mario Alberto Zamora Cruz for infringement of the labour legislation (monitoring this trade union official) after having indicated that there was no evidence of personal or trade union harassment against this person, or that his trade union leave had been restricted. The Government adds that it will provide the information on the decision relating to the dismissal of this trade union official when it is handed down by the Civil Service Tribunal.
.The Committee requests the Government to transmit the decision handed down relating to the dismissal of trade union official Mario Alberto Zamora Cruz.
.At its meeting in November , the Committee requested the Government to keep it informed of the final administrative decisions and judicial verdicts handed down in relation to the case of trade union leader, Mario Alberto Zamora Cruz [see th Report, paras.  and ], who had been dismissed.
.In its communications of  January and  March , the Government undertakes to communicate the rulings and decisions requested by the Committee. The Government explains in detail the status of the proceedings relating to his dismissal, in particular the proceedings in the Civil Service Tribunal (delayed as a result of the many appeals brought by the complainant;  of the  such appeals have been resolved). In addition, the Constitutional Division has rejected the complaint brought by Mr. Zamora against the Deputy Minister on the grounds that this is an allegation that can be dealt with through criminal law procedures; at the same time, the Attorney-General s Office has issued a statement that the management board of the institution where Mr. Zamora worked has no grounds for instituting criminal proceedings against him, and that only board members who considered their honour to have been impugned by Mr. Zamora s actions could bring private complaints and thus instigate criminal proceedings.
.The Committee notes this information, and requests the Government to transmit the ruling handed down by the Civil Service Tribunal on the dismissal of the trade union official, Mario Alberto Zamora Cruz.
.At its March  meeting, the Committee requested the Government to keep it informed of the final administrative decisions and judicial verdicts handed down in relation to the case of trade union leader Mr. Mario Alberto Zamora Cruz to enable it to reach a decision in this case [see th Report, para. ].
.In its communications of  May and  August , the Government states that the Attorney-General has not yet handed down a decision concerning the defamatory and libellous complaint filed by Mr. Zamora against the Minister of Justice. Furthermore, Mr. Zamora has lodged a succession of appeals against the members of the Civil Service Tribunal for absolutely unfounded irregularities and incidents relating to the disciplinary proceedings being taken against him, thus employing delaying tactics in order to invoke the prescription.
.The Committee notes this information and reiterates its earlier requests for information concerning the final administrative decisions and verdicts relating to this case.
.The complaint is contained in a joint communication from the Trade Union of Workers and Retirees of the National Registry and Allied Workers (SITRARENA) and the Rerum Novarum Confederation of Workers (CTRN) of May . The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  August .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communication of May , the Trade Union of Workers and Retirees of the National Registry and Allied Workers (SITRARENA) and the Rerum Novarum Confederation of Workers (CTRN) allege that on  March  disciplinary proceedings were initiated against Mr. Mario Alberto Zamora Cruz, general secretary of SITRARENA, with the clear aim of dismissing him for his involvement on behalf of the workers and his denunciatory stance with regard to irregularities in the National Registry.
.The complainants add that in response to this, SITRARENA filed a complaint for unfair labour practices and anti-union harassment with the Ministry of Labour on  May . This complaint was examined by the Ministry of Labour authorities and resulted in a report stating that there were clear indications of anti-union persecution and in the initiation of proceedings on  August  before the small claims labour court of the second circuit of San Jos with the aim of ascertaining the truth of the matter; these proceedings have been slow and complicated.
.In addition to the proceedings for anti-union harassment, on  April  ordinary proceedings were initiated against the Minister of Justice and in September  criminal complaints were brought against two of the Minister's advisers for corruption when they justified their position by instituting ordinary proceedings against trade union leader Mr. Mario Zamora Cruz. According to the complainants these ordinary proceedings were riddled with irregularities, such as the disappearance of the report of the body responsible for conducting the disciplinary proceedings against the trade union leader.
.The complainants state that as of  January  Mr. Mario Zamora Cruz was suspended from his duties despite the fact that the disciplinary proceedings and other judicial sanctions were pending. The complainants criticized the authorities' delay in this case, which shows that measures of legal protection have been inadequate and inappropriate, in particular as a result of the authorities' delaying tactics. Nonetheless, these authorities have discredited Mr. Mario Zamora Cruz in the national press, pointing out that dismissal proceedings are pending against him.
.In its communication of  August , the Government states that it is not true that disciplinary proceedings were initiated against Mr. Mario Zamora Cruz on  March  as alleged by the complainant. It is true that administrative disciplinary proceedings were initiated against him, for which a body was appointed to carry out the procedure in order to ascertain the truth of the matter, in accordance with the constitutional principle of due process, by an administrative decision issued on  July . In this respect, it is important to point out that the acts which gave rise to the complaint and investigation are as follows: () failing in his duties as a public official by allowing, through his negligence and irresponsibility, more than  documents submitted for registration to the National Registry to be mislaid, these documents being in his custody and under his responsibility, since as a public official",-1,2000,Costa Rica
83,"and as the ""right-hand man"" for sector - he was in charge at the time the documents were lost, and has not yet reported their whereabouts, displaying indifference to such a serious matter; () he also failed in his duties by allowing himself, in his position as official responsible for sector -, to fall entirely behind with his work without having accounted for this so far, with the result that the Directorate of the Property Registry had to restructure this sector as a precautionary measure in view of the backlog; () failing to hand in a report as the official responsible for sector -, on the mislaid documents and to report on their whereabouts before resigning on grounds of incompetence as he was duty-bound to do, especially since he was the official in charge when the abovementioned documents were lost. It is clear from the above that Mr. Mario Zamora Cruz was guilty of serious misconduct, which constituted the grounds for filing a petition for dismissal with the competent body, in this case the General Directorate of the Civil Service, which was received on  October  as recorded in the case file.
.As regards Mr. Mario Zamora Cruz's complaint of unfair labour practices and anti-union harassment filed with the Ministry of Labour, in the course of the proceedings it became clear that he attempted to distort the facts on which the petition for dismissal was based, even going so far as to file endless complaints intended to delay the proceedings, without so far giving any explanation to the administration concerning the whereabouts of the  documents he mislaid since, as noted above, he was the official in charge of processing these documents, given that they were in his custody.
.It is true that the complaint of unfair labour practices has been examined by the Ministry of Labour; the case file contains allegations by the National Registry submitted as evidence that the complaint is unfounded. Moreover, in a further effort to distort the facts, Mr. Mario Zamora Cruz filed another action with the labour court of the second circuit, which was dismissed.
.Mention should be made of the unfounded acts of Mr. Mario Zamora Cruz, who has used every available means to distort the facts, alleging that anti-union harassment took place, in an effort to misrepresent the facts leading to the institution of administrative disciplinary proceedings against him in accordance with the law, in which the complainant exercised his right to defence according to the highest principles of due process, and even had himself represented by six or seven lawyers, and which culminated in a petition for dismissal which again was in conformity with the law; he also filed complaints against the lawyers who had been appointed to conduct the proceedings, in accordance with the constitutional principle of due process.
.The ordinary proceedings instituted against Mr. Mario Alberto Zamora Cruz were in conformity with the principle of legality and the constitutional principle of due process, to the extent that Mr. Zamora Cruz actively took part in them, filing, through his lawyers, all manner of motions and unfounded appeals with the aim of delaying the final ruling. This is evidenced by the fact that all of the appeals for protection of his constitutional rights filed with the constitutional chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice were dismissed on grounds that they were unfounded. As regards the disappearance of the report drawn up by the body in charge of the proceedings, it has repeatedly been noted in letters submitted by the National Registry that this report was never lost, as evidenced by the fact that it is provided in this reply as part of the documentary evidence requested.
.On  November  an addition to the petition for dismissal filed against Mr. Mario Alberto Zamora Cruz was presented to the General Directorate of the Civil Service in view of the fact that, for purposes of defamation, Mr. Zamora Cruz had signed a document which he submitted to the President of the Republic, inter alia, containing denunciations and entitled ""Denunciation of serious political anomalies in the National Registry"", subtitled ""Influence peddling and corruption"", a document which is blatantly defamatory and libellous with regard both to the ministerial department and to the members of the administration of the National Registry. It is important to point out that the document in question does not have the support or approval of the Trade Union of Workers and Retirees of the National Registry, since in a letter of  November , reference No. STRN?, signed by Mr. Felipe Espinosa Fernndez, general secretary of the trade union, states the following:Concerning the denunciation presented by Mr. Mario Zamora Cruz, entitled ""Denunciation of serious anomalies in the National Registry"", our organization did not authorize, neither does it authorize, the denunciation written or drawn up by Mr. Mario Zamora Cruz and does not accept it as a denunciation by this organization since it did not meet the formal requirements under the rules of our organization.To this end the executive committee of the Trade Union of Workers and Retirees of the National Registry, at its extraordinary meeting No.  on  November  stated the following:Agreement :The SITRARENA executive committee does not authorize and dissociates itself from any denunciation presented by Mr. Mario Zamora Cruz, labour relations secretary of this organization, to the Office of the Controller-General of the Republic.
.These serious acts prompted the National Registry to present new allegations to the competent body as grounds for dismissal of the official Mario Alberto Zamora Cruz. It also requested temporary suspension with pay of the official based on the provisions of section .
.The Government states that at no time did it publicize the dismissal proceedings against Mr. Mario Zamora Cruz. As regards the alleged delay in the proceedings, the Government emphasizes that Mr. Mario Zamora Cruz resorted to delaying tactics, as is incontestably clear from the fact that he is constantly filing various appeals aimed at holding up a final decision in the case.
.The Committee observes that in this case the complainant organizations alleged the institution of disciplinary proceedings and subsequent suspension of Mr. Zamora Cruz, general secretary of SITRARENA, for activities on behalf of the workers of the National Registry and for having denounced irregularities in that institution. In this context, according to the complainants, ordinary proceedings were instituted against the Minister of Justice and criminal complaints for corruption brought against two of the Minister's advisers. Lastly, the complainants criticize the delay in the proceedings, in particular as a result of delaying tactics by the authorities.
.The Committee observes that according to the Government: () the administrative disciplinary proceedings against Mr. Zamora Cruz were due to the fact that he was guilty of seriously failing in his duties as an official (having mislaid over  documents submitted for registration to the National Registry through his negligence and irresponsibility, falling behind with his work without explaining why and failing to account for the lost documents); () Mr. Zamora Cruz has attempted to distort the facts and has filed endless complaints in order to delay the proceedings for unfair labour practices; () in the ordinary proceedings for serious misconduct instituted against Mr. Zamora Cruz, his lawyers filed various motions and unfounded appeals in order to delay the final decision; () Mr. Zamora Cruz subsequently signed a defamatory and libellous document against the Minister of Justice and against the National Registry - which was not authorized by the trade union to which he belongs and which its executive committee dissociated itself with - with the result that, in accordance with the law, a request was submitted for temporary suspension with pay of the official, which the latter did not challenge; () in this document Mr. Zamora Cruz used terms such as corruption, abuse of power, influence peddling and embezzlement of public funds, and the case was therefore referred to the Attorney-General's Office in order for court proceedings to be instituted.
.The Committee observes that the versions put forward by the complainants and the Government concerning the facts that prompted the administrative and judicial proceedings filed by and against trade union leader Mr. Zamora Cruz are entirely contradictory. In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the final administrative decisions and judicial verdicts handed down in relation to the case of trade union leader Mr. Zamora Cruz, so that it may reach a decision in this case.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the final administrative decisions and judicial verdicts handed down in relation to the case of trade union leader Mr. Zamora Cruz, so that it may reach a decision in this case.",-1,2000,Costa Rica
84,".At its March  meeting, the Committee requested the Government to keep it informed of the process and outcome of the negotiations provided for in the agreement of  June  reached between the Ministry of Public Education and the trade unions, whereby as from the  school year the Ministry will negotiate the school calendar with the trade union organizations, incorporating trade union activities and granting the necessary leave to attend national assemblies and sessions of executive committees [see th Report, paras.  and ].
.In its communication dated  August , the Government sends an agreement of May-June  signed by the Minister of Public Education and the teachers' organizations whereby the issues that remained pending are settled satisfactorily.
.The Committee notes this information with satisfaction.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the Secondary School Teachers' Association of Costa Rica (APSE) dated  January . The Government sent its observations in communications dated  May and  August .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  January , the Secondary School Teachers' Association of Costa Rica (APSE) states that since its inception it has always had permission to take time off to carry out its activities (assemblies, meetings, etc.) during the working day. APSE adds that the Minister of Public Education established a school calendar that included  teaching days and ruled out any trade union activities on these days during the working day (or at least partly) as it considered these to be an activity that was distinct from teaching. APSE believes that this violates Conventions Nos. ,  and  of the ILO.
.In its communications of  May and  August , the Government states that the allegations in this case are identical to those of Case No. , which was examined in the th Report of the Committee. The Government refers back to the observations that it presented in this report and to the agreement of  June  between the trade union organizations and the Government, which allowed these issues to be resolved.
.The Committee observes that the case under discussion deals with the same issue that arose in Case No.  (see th Report, paras. -), i. e. the denial of trade union leave in the public education sector during the working day (or part thereof) as a result of a new school calendar with  actual days of school.
.In this respect, the Committee refers to its conclusions in Case No.  (paras. -) where it noted with interest that the Ministry of Public Education and the trade union organizations reached an agreement on  June  whereby as from the  school year the Ministry will negotiate the school calendar with the trade union organizations, incorporating trade union activities and granting the necessary leave to attend national assemblies and sessions of executive committees.
.The Committee notes that the complainant organization (APSE) is mentioned in the agreement of  June  and that its complaint (which dates from January ) does not mention whether negotiations for the year  took place with the authorities, as was agreed in the aforementioned agreement. The Committee also observes that the complainant organization does not refer to any specific case of denial of trade union leave. In these circumstances, the Committee reiterates the conclusions that it came to in Case No.  and requests the Government to keep it informed of the negotiation process provided for in the agreement of  June  and its outcome.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the negotiation process provided for in the agreement of  June  and its outcome.",-1,2000,Costa Rica
85,".Concerning Case No. , at its March  meeting the Committee requested the Government to provide it with the text of the amended Code as soon as it is adopted [see th Report, para. ]. The Government states in its communication of  May and  August  that it will send the text of the law as soon as it is adopted.
.As regards Case No. , at its March  meeting, the Committee requested the Government to send the decision of the Administrative High Court concerning decision - of  April  taken by the Administrative Board of the National Registry as soon as it is handed down [see th Report, para. ]. In a long communication of  February , the Rerum Novarum Confederation of Workers replies to the arguments put forward by the Government in its last communication to the Committee and mentions the negative impact of the decision of the Constitutional Chamber regarding collective bargaining in the public sector and insists that the previous agreement on collective bargaining in the public sector was extremely restrictive and had been criticized by the Committee. In its communications of  May and  August  the Government states that the judicial authority has rejected the complaint lodged by the Trade Union of Workers and Retirees of the National Registry and that no appeal has been lodged against that ruling (which has been transmitted).
.The Committee takes note of this information. It draws the attention of the complainant organization to the fact that the issue of the right to bargain collectively in the public sector will be dealt with in the context of Case No. .
.The complaint is contained in a joint communication from the Rerum Novarum Confederation of Workers (CTRN) and the Trade Union of Workers and Retired Workers of the National Registry and Related Persons (SITRARENA) of May . The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) supported this complaint in a communication dated  June . The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  August .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee notes that, in this case, the complainant organization (SITRARENA) alleges that: () the regulations concerning collective bargaining in the public service in force, published in the Official Gazette of  March , contains considerable restrictions (in particular, it obliges parties to collective bargaining to submit the text of their agreement to a committee of certification and ratification made up of a number of ministers, who might or might not approve the said agreement and exclude from it provisions they do not feel fit) and that it has not been applied to date; () within this framework, SITRARENA signed the ""collective agreement"" with the National Registry, but this agreement has not been applied because it has been ignored by the administrative board of the National Registry (which had nevertheless approved it) and by the Minister of Justice; furthermore, the National Committee of Certification and Ratification brought before the Attorney-General's Office the matter of the invalidity of the decree of the Government Council concerning the regulations pertaining to collective bargaining in the public service (reason for which the previous Minister of Labour did not convene the National Committee of Certification and Ratification for it to approve the ""collective bargaining""; subsequently, the Minister of Labour stated that he did not have either the original or a duly certified copy of the ""collective agreement"" in question, bearing the signature of the parties and the date of the signature; () the complainant refers to the laws which encourage collective bargaining in the public sector and recalls that the authorities committed themselves to submitting to the Legislative Assembly a law concerning the settlement of disputes in the public sector.
.The Committee notes that the Government stresses the following points: () the regulations concerning collective bargaining in the public service are in force and authorize a specific form of bargaining in the public sector known as ""agreement""; () there is a bill on public employment which will improve the opportunities for bargaining in the public sector under the conditions provided for by ILO Conventions; the Higher Labour Council (tripartite) decided on  October to encourage tripartite dialogue between the Government, the Legislative Assembly and the trade unions with a view to regulating collective bargaining on the basis of this bill, by setting up a joint committee in the Legislative Assembly; () as regards the ""collective agreement"" concluded between the National Registry and SITRARENA, it is riddled with a number of legal, constitutional and functional flaws, which make it inapplicable, thus explaining the fact that on  April  the administrative board of the National Registry decided to repeal and consider invalid all the administrative acts and decisions ensuing from the collective agreement; in short, a mere signature at the end of the record of proceedings does not suffice, given that the content of agreements must be submitted to the National Committee for Certification and Ratification of Collective Bargaining which must approve it, conditions which were not fulfilled although provided for under the abovementioned regulations; furthermore, the agreement of ""collective bargaining"" submitted to the Ministry of Labour and Social Security was not dated and did not bear the signatures of the parties; () according to the document of  October  (which the Government encloses with its communication), SITRARENA acknowledges, as moreover does the administrative board of the National Registry, that it has doubts on the procedure followed concerning the documentation with respect to the ""collective agreement"" of the National Registry, and the two parties state that once they have finished eamining and reviewing the ""collective agreement"" they will submit, in accordance with the procedure provided for, the document in question to the National Committee of Certification and Ratification, which will be responsible for making a final analysis; () the Constitutional Court notes, in its decision of  September , that SITRARENA did not submit the ""collective agreement"" signed with the authorities of the National Registry and that the National Committee for Certification did not approve this document.
.The Committee considers, in the light of all these factors, that the instrument known as ""collective agreement"" concluded between SITRARENA and the National Registry does not fulfil the legal requirements provided for under the regulations concerning collective bargaining in the public service (absence of date and signatures, failure to submit the document - for approval - to the National Committee for Certification and Ratification). The Committee nevertheless notes that, irrespective of the above, parties had reached agreements - which apparently have started being applied for certain issues - and, in all events, signed the record of proceedings; it also notes that the provision contained in the regulations concerning collective bargaining in the public service which requires the approval by the National Committee for Certification and Ratification of agreements reached, is contrary to the principles of Convention No. ; what is more, everything would seem to point to the fact that, in practice, the present system of bargaining does not function in a satisfactory way. The Committee notes that the parties are continuing negotiations with a view to revising the ""collective bargaining"" and submitting the document to the National Committee for Certification and Ratification.
.Under these circumstances, the Committee stresses the importance of adopting, as soon as possible, the bill on public employment which has been submitted to the Legislative Assembly and is at present being examined by the Committee on Legal Affairs (which the Committee noted with satisfaction at its November  meeting (see th Report, para. )); the Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that making the validity of collective agreements signed by the parties subject to approval by the authorities of these agreements is contrary to the principles of freedom of association (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Committee of Freedom of Association, th edition, , paras. -) and of Convention No. ; it urges the National Registry and SITRARENA to try and settle in the very near future, on the basis of the unofficial agreement they reached, all the contentious points in the ""collective agreement"" and urges the Government to ensure that the National Committee for Certification and Ratification - made up of ministers and whose present attributions are incompatible with the principles of freedom of association - will not change the content of the final agreement between the parties; and it requests the Government to communicate to it the outcome of the administrative proceedings on the matter dealt with in this complaint, which are at present in their final stage.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) Stressing the importance of adopting as soon as possible the bill on public employment submitted to the Legislative Assembly, the Committee reminds the Government that it might, if it so wishes, request the technical assistance of the",1,1999,Costa Rica
86,"ILO to ensure that the future law is fully in compliance with the principles of Convention No. .(b) The Committee urges the National Registry and SITRARENA to try and settle, in the very near future, on the basis of the unofficial agreement they reached, all the contentious points in the ""collective agreement"".(c) While drawing the Government's attention to the fact that making the validity of collective agreements signed by the parties subject to approval of these agreements by the authorities is contrary to the principles of Convention No. , the Committee urges the Government to ensure that the National Committee for Certification and Ratification will not change the content of the final agreement reached by the parties.(d) The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the outcome of the administrative proceedings on the matter dealt with in this complaint, which at present are in their final stage.",1,1999,Costa Rica
87,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) dated  April . This Organization sent additional information in communications dated  May and  June .
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  August and  September .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ) and the Workers' Representatives Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  April , the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) alleges that the banana-producing enterprise Southern Banana Corporation (COBASUR) refuses to deduct union dues for workers affiliated to the Southern Workers' Union (SITRASUR) as stipulated in the Labour Code of Costa Rica. The ICFTU adds that following a complaint by the union about this matter and also about the violation of other trade union and social rights, the enterprise dismissed Mr. Adrin Herrera Arias, general-secretary of the trade union, without taking into account his status of trade union leader. In addition, when the trade union presented a statement of claims, COBASUR refused to discuss it with the workers' legitimate representatives and set up a solidarity association, negotiating a direct settlement with a workers' committee it appointed itself which was advised by the solidarity members. The Ministry of Labour was informed about these events in two complaints submitted to the National Directorate of Labour Inspection. A further complaint was made concerning anonymous documents addressed to Mr. Adrin Herrera Arias, pressuring him to leave the trade union because his life was in danger, and also indicating that an entirely unidentified vehicle had tried to run him over once when he was walking along one of the roads in the plantation. His immediate reaction had been to throw himself into the trees which saved his life, causing only minor injury. Similarly, on  April , after attending to some business on behalf of the workers, Mr. Herrera Arias was stopped in the road by two hooded men carrying guns who tied him by his hands and feet to a banana transport cable, brutally beat him and shot him on the left side of the chest. While they were beating him they warned him to leave the trade union and the banana plantation area; if not, his life and his family's lives would be in danger.
.Furthermore, in its communications dated  May and  June , the ICFTU refers to the following events which it considers demonstrate that the Ministry of Public Education is violating trade union freedoms in clear breach of ILO Conventions Nos. ,  and :-- The members of the National Executive Council of the Costa Rican Education Workers' Union (SEC) are being refused leave to attend Council sessions. On  December , a note was sent to the Ministry of Labour to inform it about the silence of the Ministry of Public Education in respect of the requests for leave made on  November for the members of the National Executive Council. This Council is made up of representatives from the country's various regional structures and meets every Friday and Saturday. Official letter reference DGP -, signed by the Director of the Personnel Department of the Ministry of Public Education, informs the Minister of Public Education that the requests for leave made by the Costa Rican Education Workers' Union for the members of the National Executive Council were approved by the Director and had therefore already been processed and communicated. In addition, in official letter reference DTM -, dated  January , the Minister of Labour states that in accordance with related conversations, this matter had been favourably resolved. However, no specific communication by the Minister of Public Education granting the leave in question was ever made.-- On  April , a personal memorandum was addressed to the Minister of Labour and Social Security reiterating the ongoing violation occurring with regard to requests for trade union leave of absence. He was asked to order, in accordance with prevailing regulations, the Ministry of Public Education not to infringe the right to freedom of association. There has been no response to this request.-- On  March , in official letter DVM - the Deputy Minister of Public Education sent to the Costa Rican Education Workers' Union the authorization to conduct regional assemblies scheduled throughout that year. As a result of this authorization all related scheduling and preparatory work for these regional assemblies was carried out. However, without any warning or consultations the Deputy Minister of Public Education revoked the circular through official letter reference DVM dated  April . He granted leave for only  April , leaving the entire scheduled programme in the lurch. Then, in official letter DVM -, dated  May , the Deputy Minister of Public Education refused a request for leave of absence to carry our regional assemblies and trade union activities.-- In official letter reference DVM -, addressed to the President of the Costa Rican Education Workers' Union, the Deputy Minister of Public Education refused leave for caretakers to participate in trade union activities on  May . However, the most serious part of the communication is contained in the following two paragraphs: ""In compliance with the Central American Agreement on the Basic Unification of Education, this Ministry has scheduled the  school calendar to consist of an academic year of  days of teaching, with no provision for days off to hold assemblies of teachers' associations and trade unions or for their executive committees to meet during school hours."" And the most serious aspect of this note is the following statement: ""I must also point out that our legislation contains no provision granting trade union organizations the right to and consequently obliging this Ministry to issue, the requested leave."" With this statement the State of Costa Rica, through the Ministry of Public Education, is ignoring the existence of ILO Conventions Nos. ,  and , ratified by Costa Rica, which have a higher authority than the law, as established in article  of the Constitution which states: ""Public treaties, international agreements and concordats duly approved by the legislative assembly shall have a higher authority than the laws upon their enactment or from the day that they designate.""
.The National Teachers' Association (ANDE) finds itself in a similar situation. Being the principal teachers' organization in the country, when it was first established it received the necessary support for its start-up and subsequent development, and legal provisions were established to ensure that it could carry out its trade union activities. In effect, the legislation setting up the ANDE guaranteed it the right to hold national congresses, thus promoting the necessary participation of its affiliates as an unquestionable element in its development. In this respect article  states: ""The Ministry of Public Education will grant paid leave to members who perform functions under its jurisdiction in order to attend the sessions of national teachers' congresses."" As teachers constitute a majority group of workers in the public service sector, the ANDE should carry out activities at the regional level in all the districts and provinces of Costa Rica in order to meet the need for information and training for teachers, not only with respect to their entitlements, but also to provide support for the development of education in Costa Rica.
.The ICFTU explains that owing to the large number of teaching staff that make up the ANDE - at present over , affiliates - the organization consists of grass-roots and regional subsidiaries, which hold annual assemblies, the former in May and August and the latter in June and September, in accordance with articles (a) and (a) of its statutes. During these assemblies activities are carried out such as the election of representatives to the association's highest management bodies which are the central executive committee and the board of directors. Since its establishment, the ANDE has only held the minimum number of assemblies necessary to ensure its associates their rights of participation and election, which is why any appropriate time during the working day is used, and it has become a recurrent and accepted custom to grant absence of leave for such assemblies.
.Likewise, it is important to point out that the National Executive Committee of the ANDE, consisting of  representatives, usually meets on Saturdays. Nevertheless, the representatives who come from the border zones and other faraway places must make the journey at least one day earlier, and therefore need leave to stop work earlier, but the Government, through the Deputy Minister of Public Education, expressly states that leave will not be granted to these representatives. The other ANDE management body is the board of directors, consisting of nine members, four of whom have unpaid leave to carry out their duties on a full-time basis, with the other five representatives requiring leave to participate in the sessions which are usually held on Friday afternoons; these five will also be affected by the Government's refusal",0,1999,Costa Rica
88,"to grant leave. But it is not only the ANDE and the SEC that have been denied leave to carry out their assemblies and trade union activities - the same thing has happened to administrative workers in the Costa Rican educational system, as in the case of the caretakers, when the Ministry of Public Education refused to grant leave to the organizations to which these workers belong, that is the National Caretakers' Union (UCEP) and the National Union of Caretakers in Public and Private Education (SINCOSEPP).
.In its communications dated  August and  September , the Government states that with respect to the allegations concerning the enterprise called COBASUR, the statement of claims presented by the SITRASUR trade union led to the parties being convened by the directorate for labour affairs for industrial conciliation. During the negotiating process, the enterprise signed a direct settlement with a ""standing workers' committee"". Given the enterprise's refusal to continue dialogue with SITRASUR, the trade union representatives lodged a complaint for alleged unfair labour practices against the trade union on  June and  September . The Government adds that in reports dated  August and  November , the labour inspectorate established through administrative channels: () the unjustified dismissal of Mr. Adrin Herrera Arias and anti-union persecution against him; () direct interference by the enterprise administration in the establishment of the standing committee to the detriment of the union; () direct participation by the enterprise administration in the establishment of the standing committee to the detriment of SITRASUR. Consequently, the inspectorate lodged a complaint with the labour courts on  November ; the defendant did not appear and the final judgement is now being awaited as the case is in the final phase.
.The Government adds that the complaint concerning the threats and aggression targeting the trade union leader Adrin Herrera Arias was a penal matter and was therefore submitted to the Attorney-General's office in order for it to carry out the necessary investigation. Nevertheless, the labour inspectorate's report states that there is no proof of the attempt to run the trade union leader over nor of the shots fired at him, and certainly nothing about the enterprise's involvement in sending anonymous letters.
.With respect to the allegations concerning the failure of the Ministry of Education to grant leave for leaders from teaching organizations to attend meetings and to enable their affiliates to attend the assemblies and congresses of these organizations, the Government states that it finds it surprising that the complainant organizations did not appeal to the Constitutional Court concerning the alleged violation of Conventions Nos. ,  and  which have higher authority than the laws (article  of the Constitution) and notes that there are expeditious and effective means and instruments that can be used before this Court to establish unconstitutionality.
.The Government indicates with regard to these allegations that Costa Rica, by way of Act No.  of  August , approved the so-called Central American Agreement on the Basic Unification of Education, article () of which establishes that the States formally agree to the following: ""The signatory States decide to establish a minimum of  days of actual classes per year with a working day of no less than five hours. Likewise, they must endeavour by all possible means, and as far as circumstances permit, gradually to eliminate non-stop, double-shift and alternate-attendance teaching."" The Constitutional Court has ratified the applicability, obligatory nature and priority of the agreement, which requires States to ensure adherence to an academic year of a minimum of  days. In compliance with the agreement, the Ministry of Education scheduled the  school year to include  actual school days, with the school calendar not making provision for days to hold teacher association and union meetings, or for the executive committees of these bodies to conduct their sessions during school hours. Accepting the complaint made by the applicants would unavoidably imply repudiating the above agreement which has a higher authority than other national laws and therefore infringing upon the right of students to education, as a school year of less than  actual days of class would be forced upon them, which is an infringement of a right as fundamental as education. Legislation does not contain any regulation granting the right of trade union associations to the requested leave, and the consequent obligation of this Ministry to issue it, affecting the minimum length of the school year.
.The Government indicates that the assemblies of trade unions and their associations are a strictly internal matter and are unrelated to the development of the teaching/learning process, so that the logical, prudent and legal approach is for their assemblies and the meetings of their executive committees to be held outside working hours, as this is the only way of ensuring that they will not interrupt school hours, the continuity of which the Ministry of Education should guard particularly jealously. The refusal to grant leave does not in any way infringe upon the right of unionization. This case comes down to the fact that, for legal reasons and on the grounds of the best interests of the student community and the supreme right to education, their assemblies cannot be held during school hours or on school days.
.The Government points out that the complaint lacks any current relevance as the parties involved, that is the Ministry of Public Education and the complainant trade unions, reached an out-of-court agreement. On  June  the parties signed an agreement under which, as from the  academic year, the Ministry of Education will negotiate the school calendar with the teaching organizations, incorporating trade union activities and ensuring that the school year will be of a duration of no less than  actual days of class. The agreement also stipulated that during the  academic year the Ministry would grant the necessary leave to attend national assemblies and executive committee sessions. In other words, following the submission of the complaint to the ILO, the Government of Costa Rica, turning once again to dialogue, managed to overcome the disparate views held on this issue.
.The Committee observes that the allegations relate to various anti-union acts and practices in the Southern Banana Corporation (COBASUR) and to the refusal to grant trade union leave in the public education sector.
.As regards the enterprise COBASUR, the Committee observes that the complainant organization alleges the enterprise's refusal to deduct trade union dues for the affiliated workers, the dismissal of the general-secretary of the Southern Workers' Union (SINTRASUR) - Mr. Adrin Herrera Arias, the threats and serious aggression inflicted on this trade union leader, and the negotiation of a direct settlement with a workers' committee advised by a solidarity association set up by the enterprise in spite of the fact that SITRASUR had already submitted a statement of claims to the enterprise for the signature of a collective agreement.
.In this respect, the Committee notes that according to the Government, on the basis of a complaint made by SITRASUR, on  June and  September  the administrative authority proved - as demonstrated in its reports of  August and  November - the unjustified dismissal of the trade union leader Mr. Adrin Herrera Arias, and also participation and direct interference by the enterprise in the establishment of the workers' committee, and as a result the authorities filed a complaint with the courts, with the case now being in its final phase. The Committee deeply regrets the acts of anti-union discrimination and interference confirmed by the administrative authority and requests the Government to keep it informed of the results of the decision handed down.
.As regards the alleged threats and aggression (beatings) inflicted on the trade union leader Mr. Adrin Herrera Arias, the Committee notes that as this was a penal matter the complaint was submitted to the Attorney-General, although according to the report by the labour inspectorate there is no proof of the attempt to run the trade union leader over nor of the shots fired at him, and certainly nothing to imply the enterprise in the sending of anonymous threatening letters. The Committee requests the Government to inform it about what the Attorney-General's office has done in this regard, to ensure a judicial inquiry is promptly carried out and to send it the results. Lastly, the Committee requests the Government to take measures to ensure that COBASUR deducts the dues of SITRASUR affiliates as provided by law.
.Concerning the alleged refusal to grant trade union leave to the members of the National Executive Council of the Costa Rican Education Workers' Union (SEC), the Committee observes that the complainant organization underlines that initially (December ) the administrative authority did not reply in writing to the request for leave, then subsequently authorized regional meetings to be held ( March ). On  April  the Deputy Minister of Labour revoked his own circular and granted leave for only  April , stating that the Central American Agreement on the Basic Unification of Education contained a commitment to ensure  actual",-1,1999,Costa Rica
89,"school days per school year and that legislation did not contain any provision granting the right to trade union leave (outside school hours). The complainant organization indicates that the National Teachers' Association (ANDE) - more specifically its board of directors and its national executive committee - as well as the organizations that group together the administrative staff in the public education sphere (for example, the National Caretakers' Union and the National Union of Public and Private Education Caretakers) are in a similar situation.
.The Committee notes the Government's declaration that in compliance with the abovementioned Central American Agreement, the Ministry of Education structured the  school year to include  actual days of school and that no provision was made for days off to hold assemblies nor for the executive committees to hold their sessions during school hours, in order not to infringe upon the students' right to education. In addition, according to the Government there is no rule obliging the Ministry of Education to grant trade union leave, and trade union assemblies are internal union activities that can take place outside work hours without interrupting schooling. Nevertheless, the Committee observes the Government's information that the Ministry of Public Education and the trade unions reached an agreement on  June  whereby as from the  school year the Ministry will negotiate the school calendar with the trade union organizations, incorporating trade union activities and granting the necessary leave to attend national assemblies and sessions of executive committees. The Committee notes this information with interest. However, it must underline that, according to the complainant, trade union leave had been granted for some years as an established practice and had been withdrawn for the most part unilaterally and abruptly between December  and the date of the above agreement, which was highly detrimental for the trade union organizations. It cannot but regret this measure, despite its temporary nature.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) Deeply regretting the acts of anti-union discrimination and interference carried out by the COBASUR enterprise, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the results of the decision handed down by the legal authority concerning the complaint submitted by the administrative authority relating to the dismissal of the trade union leader Mr. Adrin Herrera Arias and to the acts of anti-union discrimination and interference carried out by the enterprise.(b) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed about action taken by the Attorney-General's office concerning the complaint relating to the beatings, threats and aggression inflicted on the trade union leader Mr. Adrin Herrera Arias, to ensure a judicial inquiry is promptly carried out and to send it the results.(c) The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that COBASUR deducts the dues of SITRASUR affiliates as provided by law.",-1,1999,Costa Rica
90,".At its March  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendations on pending issues [see th Report, para. ]:' with regard to the allegations concerning the enterprise Oropel (anti-union reprimands addressed to the trade union official Mr. Roberto Durn in the context of trade union persecution) and to the enterprise Roble (harassment of the trade unionist Mr. Luis Prez Jarqun, blaming him alone for a poor harvest), the Committee notes that during the conciliation proceedings the trade union representative asked that these matters be transferred to the General Labour Inspectorate. The Committee asks the Government to keep it informed of the results of the investigation conducted into this matter;' as regards the allegations concerning the banana enterprise Ceibo (persecution of SITRAP members), the Committee urges the Government to ensure that this matter is promptly investigated.
.With its communications of  May and  August , the Government forwarded the text of the administrative decisions that concluded the case of Mr. Roberto Durn (as unfair labour practices were not found to exist), dismissed the complaint relating to the alleged harassment of Mr. Luis Prez Jarqun (considering that the facts denounced did not correspond to acts of anti-union persecution but to job-related activities involving the internal administration of the enterprise) and dismissed the complaint relating to the persecution of SITRAP members and the administrative appeal proceedings.
.The Committee notes this information.
.The Committee examined this case at its June  and March  meetings and presented two interim reports [see th Report, paras, -, and th Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th and th Sessions respectively (June  and March )].

The Government sent new observations in communications dated  August and  and  September .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:Allegations concerning the Enterprise Bananera Isla Grande S.A.(a) Regretting to note that the Government once again has not provided complete observations and noting that in its investigation into allegations concerning the enterprise Bananera Isla Grande S.A. the administrative authority had found that harassment had been used to force workers to leave their union, that there had been serious violations of labour legislation, and that the judicial authorities on  August  ordered the reinstatement of the workers who had been dismissed to date (five in all), but that this decision has not been implemented to date, the Committee is bound to deplore once again these facts and urges the Government to send without delay the text of the final ruling made by the judicial authorities and to have the court ruling, already handed down and ordering the reinstatement of five dismissed workers, implemented pursuant to its obligations.(b) The Committee regrets once again that the Government has not sent its observations on the other allegations concerning the company Bananera Isla Grande S.A., namely: the dismissal for ""unjustified absence"" of  trade union members who had signed the list of claims following an operation against illegal migrants conducted at the border between  and  August  by police and immigration officials in the presence of company representatives and using lists of union members; pressure on workers to make them join a solidarity association; the proposal made to workers to sign a ""direct arrangement"" bypassing the union; and pressure on union members to sign blank pieces of paper. The Committee urges the Government promptly to send its observations in this regard.Allegations concerning the enterprise PAIS S.A.(c) The Committee requests the Government to send the text of the ruling given on the complaint presented by the administrative authorities concerning the use of harassment and threats against employees of PAIS S.A. to make them resign from their union as well as the withholding of trade union membership dues. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of any administrative action taken in response to the allegation that there are security doors at the enterprise and guards who aggressively prevent union officials from entering.The complainant's allegations of  May (d) The Committee requests the Government to inform it of any ruling given on allegations concerning the dismissal of  workers employed by Bananera Isla Grande S.A. once it learned of their membership to UTRAL. The Committee requests the Government to indicate whether or not the  workers concerned worked in the company and, if so, to indicate the reason for their dismissal.(e) The Committee requests the Government to verify once again whether the dismissal of the trade union official Mr. Augustn Gaitn Fernndez was due to unjustified absences over a three-day period, as the company claims, and to inform it in this regard.(f) The Committee urges the Government to send its observations on the complainant's allegations of  May and  November  concerning anti-union dismissals and other anti-union acts.
.The International Union of Food, Agricultural, Hotel, Restaurant, Catering, Tobacco and Allied Workers' Associations (IUF) sent this complaint in a communication dated  September , additional information in a communication dated  September , and new allegations in a communication dated  May . The Government sent its observations in communications dated  January and  March .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  September  the International Union of Food, Agricultural, Hotel, Restaurant, Catering, Tobacco and Allied Workers' Associations (IUF) submitted a complaint against the Government of Costa Rica for its failure to guarantee the right to organize and to bargain collectively of its affiliate in Costa Rica, the Coordinating Organization of Banana Growers' Trade Unions of Costa Rica (COSIBA), which is a federation.
.The IUF alleges that the Government does not ensure that its own legislation and legal decisions with respect to the exercise of trade union rights in banana plantations are properly respected or effectively applied. Various forms of repression of trade union leaders and trade unionists are taking place, including the compiling of blacklists, dismissals without just cause, assigning of the most strenuous tasks in a discriminatory manner and prohibiting trade union leaders access to the plantations. Over  cases are pending before the judicial bodies (some take as long as three or four years) and  are awaiting the decision of the administrative authorities. Some of these cases relate to violations of trade union rights committed over three years ago. This implies a refusal to grant trade union organizations a rapid solution to violations of this kind, leading to the dismissal of the workers involved and a loss of interest in the procedures, particularly as a result of the blacklists exchanged by employers. Moreover, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security has done nothing to remedy this situation in spite of the handing down of more than  legal decisions ordering them to do so. According to the IUF, the Ministry is ineffective and delays the processing of complaints of trade union persecution and unfair practices.
.The IUF attaches to the complaint two statements by COSIBA dated  July and  September  in which specific charges are made by its affiliated trade unions with respect to a number of banana companies (Bananera Isla Grande, Proyecto Agroindustrial de Sixaola, Chiriqu Land Company, Compaa Bananera del Atlntico).First complaint by COSIBA
.COSIBA's first complaint is as follows:-- Agricultural Workers' Trade Union",1,1998,Costa Rica
91,"of Limn (UTRAL): at present (this complaint was submitted to the Committee in September ) the trade union has pending before the courts of the Province of Limn a socio-economic collective dispute in which it is seeking to enter into negotiations with the enterprise Bananera Isla Grande S.A. (which belongs to Chiquita Brand). The decision to submit a legal instrument of this kind to the courts is due to the enterprise's refusal to recognize the trade union or to enter into any type of negotiations. As regards the initial results of this action, the Civil and Labour Court of First Instance of the Atlntico-Limn region upheld the grievance, giving the enterprise  hours to appoint its representatives for negotiations -- which constitutes a major achievement given its implications -- thereby obliging it to begin the negotiation process. Although the enterprise was notified by both the trade union and the courts of the submission of the grievance, it did not stop its harassment of the workers who had signed the list of claims, despite the fact that the Labour Court ordered them not to engage in any type of reprisals. Furthermore, as a preventive measure the trade union appealed to the Ministry of Labour not to authorize any type of direct arrangement proposed by the enterprise, permanent committee or solidarity associations. It also requested an official inspection of the plantation, citing a number of examples of disregard for workers, but surprisingly the results of this inspection were detrimental to the workers, maintaining that they did not have the necessary official documents and allowing the enterprise to use this to nullify the complaint. Most of the workers have worked up to six years for this enterprise and have never encountered this type of problem before. It is thought that the reason is because the workers subscribed to a collectively negotiated instrument, as in all the plantations located in Sixaola there are workers who fit the same description. Perhaps the enterprise's reaction explains why  per cent of the workers supported the socio-economic grievance. Most of the workers at Isla Grande are of Guaymie origin, coming from Panama but working in Costa Rica.-- In the plantations of the enterprise Proyecto Agroindustrial de Sixaola S.A. (PAIS S.A.), owned by the National Banana Corporation which is supposedly the regulating body of the banana sector, and in which the State of Costa Rica is a shareholder, the workers are harassed by the enterprise management to resign their membership of the trade union. The enterprise's officials have used pressure and blackmail and in some cases have even dismissed workers simply because they belong to the trade union. Immediately upon the workers deciding to join the trade union, the enterprise installed a security door to stop the trade union leaders entering and to monitor the affiliated workers. Security guards also appeared, behaving in an aggressive and threatening manner.-- The Workers' Trade Union of the Chiriqu Land Company (SITRACHIRI) has a collective agreement in force with the Chiriqu Land Company which is owned by Chiquita Brand. This trade union has succeeded in maintaining a collective agreement with numerous benefits for its workers; moderate success has been achieved in providing workers with a certain degree of dignity. For this reason this enterprise is using countless ruses in its quest to put an end to the only collectively negotiated instrument that currently exists in the banana plantations and has attacked the trade union leaders, accusing them of various invented actions. For example, the workers in plantations  and  at the Chiriqu Land Company (Chiquita Brand) presented a document in which they requested the division manager to intercede to encourage Mr. Ricardo Hernndez, an official in the Human Resources Department, to adopt a position of respect for human rights, as he is an aggressive, insulting person who consistently violates the rights established in the collective agreement. The company took an aggressive stance in its reply to the trade union. A complaint was even made against the general secretary of SITRACHIRI alleging that some signatures were not actually attributable to the workers. The Coordinating Body of Banana Unions brought in its lawyer and is currently requesting that a handwriting test be carried out and also that preparations be made to submit a counter-claim because what the company is saying through Mr. Ricardo Hernndez is false. The only definite fact is that this particular official is harassing unionized workers. Similarly, the enterprise has managed in a variety of ways to manipulate certain workers into submitting complaints and claims against the trade union and its leaders in order to harass and discredit the organization. To conclude, the executive committee is being severely persecuted.-- The Industrial Trade Union of Agricultural, Livestock and Similar Workers of Heredia (SITAGAH) operates in the Sarapiqu sector (Heredia Province) in the plantations of the Compaa Bananera del Atlntico (Chiquita Brand). At no time has the enterprise let up from fruitlessly harassing the workers not to join the trade union, and seeing their efforts frustrated as the workers continue to become members, they persecute them using a number of the methods described at the beginning of the complaint. There has been such extensive and heavy pressure that some workers have gone to the offices of the trade union in order to resign their membership, following the instructions of the enterprise management. Sworn statements to this effect have been made by the workers. All the violations described in this complaint have been submitted to the Ministry of Labour and Social Security which has been entirely inefficient and has drawn out the proceedings for up to three years, leaving the trade union and its affiliates in a state of defencelessness. This has forced SITAGAH to appeal to the Constitutional Chamber to have its rights upheld, and more than  times the Ministry of Labour and Social Security has been found guilty of delaying the proceedings and required to pay the damages caused. To illustrate this situation, the following rulings have been handed down by the Constitutional Chamber: -, -, -, -, -, -, -, -, -, -, -, -, -.
.The IUF adds that in the weeks following the first written declaration, the violations of trade union rights at the Costa Rican plantations not only continued but in fact increased. On  August , the Isla Grande plantation not only refused to reinstate workers as it had been ordered by law, but dismissed  more, in particular immigrants who for many years had travelled every day from Panama. The police and Costa Rican immigration officials also cooperated with the company refusing to allow these workers to cross the border for three days, using lists supplied by the company to pick out the workers who supported the trade union in order to treat them in this discriminatory manner. The company then alleged that these workers had abandoned their posts and refused to give them work. According to the IUF, the trade union held two meetings with representatives of the Ministry of Labour but no measures have been taken to remedy the violations of trade union rights.Second complaint by COSIBA
.The IUF also sends the text of the second written declaration by COSIBA dated  September  relating to the enterprise Bananera Isla Grande S.A. in which it relates the ongoing harassment of workers affiliated to the trade union who had signed the socio-economic collective dispute, consisting of pressuring the workers to sign blank pieces of paper in order subsequently to dismiss them and undermine the grievance; moreover, the workers are constantly being threatened by the foremen Enrique Urbina Mairena and Jos Santamara Gabarrete among others, Alicio Ellington Ellington (office worker), Ricardo Hernndez Coto in labour relations at the Chiriqu Land Company (Chiquita), the solidarity promoter Froylan Jimnez Salas and Mr. Adrin Alvarado Morales, the plantation manager, who put pressure on workers to join the Solidarity association they have tried to set up at the plantation, using arguments such as ""it will benefit you whereas all the trade union does is give you problems"", ""the enterprise could shut down operations"" and ""it won't negotiate with the trade union"". In addition, workers were shut in their offices to pressure them into signing the abovementioned blank sheets of paper. It was proposed to the workers that they sign a ""direct arrangement"" with the enterprise which is what happened on  July , just four days after the workers had submitted the grievance to the courts. For this purpose they were taken to a private meeting at the home of the plantation manager in the company of Mr. Ricardo Hernndez Coto, where a series of offers were made to the committee members such as the separate negotiation with them of high salaries and better working conditions. They were shown films and videotapes relating to the strikes that took place in  in the south of Costa Rica and the trade union was blamed for the subsequent withdrawal by the Compaa Bananera de Costa Rica from that region; they were told",1,1998,Costa Rica
92,"that the strike had led to misery and abandoned plantations and if they did not want the same thing to happen at Sixaola they had to ""negotiate"" the ""direct arrangement"" being proposed to them. On that occasion attempts were even made to inebriate the workers' representatives in a restaurant. When the indigenous workers refused the proposals they were called ""stupid and idiots"" by the enterprise's representatives.
.The day after the submission of the grievance ( July ) a worker who had signed the list of claims and who was a member of UTRAL, Samuel Abrego Abrego, was dismissed. The workers Manuel Pineda Becker, Ernesto Abrego Santos, Alejandro Palacios Becker and Hilario Jimnez Miranda were unable even to sign the list of claims as they were dismissed when the enterprise became aware of their intention to sign. More recently, the following workers were dismissed: Dionisio Toms Robinson, Seferino Eugenio Jaen, Venancio Abrego Abrego, Valentn Abrego Santos, Pineda Salazar Marchena, Clemente Abrego Ochi, Genio Pineda Salazar, Leonel N. Garca Estrib, Alejandro Gustavino Chamorro, Celestino Pinda Beker. All these workers have signed the list of claims and are members of the UTRAL trade union. On  August , at the request of the representatives of Isla Grande S.A. and the other enterprises operating in the region, troops from the Civil Guard, Sixaola Commando, on the orders of Major Carlos Brenes, together with immigration officials and in the presence of representatives from the enterprise, blocked the workers at their respective workstations. In order to carry out the operation, which according to statements by Major Brenes was to target illegal Nicaraguan migrants, the Civil Guard troops had lists of workers affiliated to the trade union and of the signatories of the collective disputes and these workers were immediately returned to their place of origin. The enterprise' objective was to stop the workers reaching their posts in order subsequently to dismiss them for unjustified absence as in the case of Proyecto Agroindustrial Sixaola S.A. (PAIS S.A.), a subsidiary of the National Banana Corporation (CORBANA) in which the State of Costa Rica is the majority shareholder and which sells to Chiquita, which is currently seeking to dismiss workers affected by the ""Civil Guard and Immigration Operation"" carried out on ,  and  August in which the foremen of this enterprise played a special role as ""police officers"" and ""judges"". Despite the complaint immediately lodged by the trade union, on the morning of  August over  workers were dismissed from the plantation, including managerial staff and foremen to give the impression that it was not a case of trade union persecution.
.In its communication dated  September , the IUF alleges that the conditions of Chiquita workers in Costa Rica are not improving at all as regards trade union freedoms and the free movement of trade union leaders. More specifically it indicates the following:-- the security doors and security guards continue to be a problem in the Sarapiqu sector where they are still obstructing the entry of its leaders and affiliated workers, specifically at ""Compaa Bananera Gacelas"" where affiliation is growing rapidly;-- at ""Isla Grande S.A."" the subsidiary of Chiquita is carrying out a sham sale to another subsidiary enterprise of Chiquita called ""Chiriqu Land Company, Divisin Sixaola"", with the aim of undermining the socio-economic collective dispute submitted by the workers. As is already known, the grievance was allowed and the administrative means of redress have now been exhausted which is why the application for a legal strike was submitted to the labour judge of the Province of Limn. A large number of the workers have still not been reinstated in their posts, in spite of the judge's decision ordering the immediate reinstatement of all the workers dismissed in retaliation for having presented the collective dispute;-- the campaign being waged against the Workers' Trade Union of the Chiriqu Land Company (SITRACHIRI) continues with a view to eliminating the existing collective agreement; this campaign is led by Mr. Ricardo Hernndez Coto, the enterprise's industrial relations manager, who has apparently been contracted for this purpose. With the same vigour a similar campaign is being waged in favour of ""solidarity"" with a promoter from the Juan XXII Social School having been called in for this purpose. The executive committee of the solidarity association imposed by the Chiriqu Land Company is made up of administrative representatives, in contravention of legislative provisions established to regulate solidarity associations.
.Finally, in its communication of  May , the IUF alleges that the banana company Chiriqu Land Company dismissed  workers of the Isla Grande S.A. agricultural complex, who wanted to join the Agricultural Workers' Union of Citron. These facts took place on  April , a few days after their confirmation of membership had been transmitted to the company, in order to have their union dues checked off. The workers, like many of those who are employed by the Chiriqu Land Company (Chiquita, Unit ) have no protection against occupational risks, are not affiliated to Costa Rica Social Security, and their salaries are not linked to the pay benchmarks set by the National Pay Board, since they were lowered to , colons (US$) for two full weeks of work, without a single day of rest. This salary is also lower than the one agreed upon in their employment contract. In addition, following the fabricated dismissal motives, Mr. Gaitn Fernndez (steward of the Trade Union of Workers of Agriculture, Cattle Raising and Associated Industries, and one of the most militant members of that union) was recently dismissed by the Gacelas agricultural enterprise.
.In its communication of  January , the Government points out firstly that the complainant's allegations of violations of trade union rights are imprecise and that there is no record of such complaints at the Ministry of Labour and Social Security. Whatever the case may be, and considering among other things the magnitude of the communication under examination, the lack of evidence to confirm the claims contained in the complaint, the vagueness of its content and above all the deadlines given for the Government's response, the competent national authorities proceeded to carry out an examination of the investigations into trade union persecution and/or unfair labour practices submitted by the trade unions involved in Case No. . The protection of trade union rights is one of the Government's principal activities and one to which it dedicates considerable attention. The Constitution and the legal system guarantee trade union rights and Costa Rica has ratified Conventions Nos. , ,  and . On the basis of this concern for trade union rights, in May  the Executive Branch submitted for the consideration of the Legislative Plenary, in accordance with the law, a bill for constitutional reform prepared with the technical assistance of the ILO, which would remove the prohibition for foreigners to exercise management positions or positions of authority in trade unions as prescribed in the section under examination.
.Furthermore, it should be noted that in the current legal system, freedom of association is clearly established in Convention No.  of the International Labour Organization ratified by Costa Rica. This instrument includes freedom of association and trade union autonomy. Freedom of association is recognized on two levels, both individual and collective. On the collective level, the establishment without the need for previous authorization of trade union organizations that cannot be dissolved and, on the individual level, the possibility of freely joining such organizations. Article  of the Constitution confers ""higher authority to laws"" to the international Conventions approved by the Legislative Assembly. Many ILO Conventions,  in total, have been incorporated into the legal system of Costa Rica in this way and in keeping with the letter of the Political Constitution, are observed in a general and compulsory manner.
.Furthermore, the Labour Code which dates from  takes up the main principles concerning the protection of freedom of association contained in the Political Constitution and the abovementioned international labour Conventions and regulates them in sections - and  et seq. Among the serious attempts to modernize labour legislation and with the aim of developing constitutional standards pertaining to freedom of association and international Conventions, above all Conventions Nos.  and , the Legislative Assembly passed Act No.  of  November  which amends the Act concerning solidarity associations, the Labour Code and the Organization of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security Act. Among the most important reforms incorporated into the Labour Code by this Act it is important to underline the addition of Chapter III concerning ""protection of trade union rights"", which guarantees effective protection against all forms of anti-union discrimination. In effect, this chapter bans any ""acts or omissions that tend to avoid, restrict, constrain or prevent the free exercise of the collective rights of workers, their trade unions or associations of workers"" establishing also that ""any act originating from them is absolutely null and void and will be penalized according to the form and conditions indicated in the Labour Code, its supplementary or related Acts, for the",1,1998,Costa Rica
93,"infringement of prohibitive provisions"". As confirmation of the above, the legislation under reference provides that the members of trade unions in the process of being set up (for a period of no more than four months) enjoy labour stability, as do a certain number of trade union leaders (while exercising their duties and for six months afterwards) and candidates to the executive committee (for three months from the time their applications are made). In addition, Act No.  establishes, in the event of the dismissal without just cause of workers protected by this stability, that ""the competent labour judge will declare this dismissal null and void and will consequently order the worker's reinstatement and the payment of the arrears of wages, as well as the penalties to be imposed on the employer in keeping with this Code and its supplementary or related Acts"". It establishes that ""acts or omissions committed by employers, workers or their respective organizations which transgress the standards provided in the Conventions adopted by the International Labour Organization and ratified by the Legislative Assembly, and the standards provided in this Code and in social security legislation, constitute punishable offences"". In the case of violations of these rights, the worker or his or her organization can have recourse to the relevant administrative body, in this case the National Labour Inspection Directorate of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security or directly to judicial means of redress. This Act grants considerable powers to the National Labour Inspection Directorate for the investigation of violations that have been brought to its attention, in keeping with the provisions made by the Constitutional Chamber on this subject in rulings Nos. - and -. The Act empowers the National Labour Inspection Directorate to use ""the means it considers to be appropriate"" for this purpose which means that the investigating inspector can visit the work centre and obtain all available information; to this end the inspector can review payrolls, books, take statements, etc.
.If the existence of unfair labour practices is discovered, the National Director of the General Labour Inspectorate informs the competent legal authority with priority over all other matters. Moreover, and in order better to protect the worker, the decision ordering the case to be transferred to the judicial authority cannot be appealed. If the violation of trade union rights is proven through legal channels the judge will order the reinstatement of the worker and the payment of the arrears of wages, without prejudice to the penalties to be imposed on the employer in accordance with the provisions of the Labour Code and its supplementary and related Acts. In short, Costa Rica has broad legal protection in the trade union sphere, contained in the regulatory framework outlined above, namely the Political Constitution, ILO Conventions and the Labour Code.
.Furthermore, the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice has also participated in protecting trade union freedoms, handing down relevant rulings in this area which are binding erga omnes except for itself. The following are some of these rulings:-- Ruling No. - handed down at : on  October : this establishes that the dismissal of a workers' representative violates the fundamental right of association as the workers are deprived of their leaders and therefore of the appropriate and legitimate defence of their personal and trade union rights. The Constitutional Chamber determined that ""a dismissal of workers' representatives, whether unionized or not, is legally inadmissible (even if the employers pay social benefits) as it violates the special protection granted to representation under the Political Constitution, international Conventions and other laws, to the personal detriment of the representatives and the workers they represent and whose fundamental right of association is also violated as a result of this dismissal, as they are deprived of their leaders and therefore of the appropriate and legitimate defence of their personal and trade union interests ..."". Similarly, the Chamber provided that ""the dismissal of regular workers must be resolved with equal regulatory support when the express or tacit reason is their membership of an association or trade union because this too violates their fundamental rights. It should be noted that a link to such an organization as a regular member brings into play higher values of good fellowship and social and labour harmony vis--vis which economic compensation, represented by the payment of social benefits, lacks legal validity because the will of the employer is constitutionally and legally restrained or restricted from the general perspective of workers' human rights and from the specific perspective of labour law which protects general public interests ..."". This protection was subsequently confirmed in Costa Rican law with the issuing of Act No.  of  November .-- Ruling No. - handed down at : on  August  and its corresponding addition and clarification handed down at : on  October  (relating to public sector workers).-- Ruling No. - handed down at : on  July  and the corresponding administrative guidelines: as regards the procedure for complaints of alleged trade union persecution and unfair labour practices, it is indicated that: ""... For this purpose a procedure was established which begins with administrative means of redress before the National Labour Inspection Department of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security whose work is restricted to carrying out an investigation to determine whether or not there are grounds to submit a complaint through the competent legal channels"". The procedure foreseen in sections  et seq. of the Labour Code is a special one as its main function is to ensure harmony in relations between workers and employers and as a result legal provisions of an industrial nature are evaluated without the fundamental objective being to find a final solution to the conflict between the parties but, as previously indicated, simply to determine whether or not there are grounds for submitting the complaint to the competent legal authority. To summarize the procedure established in the Labour Code: () it can be initiated at the request of one of the parties or by operation of law; () if it is clear from this and the documents submitted that the merits of the case should be heard, the parties involved will be summoned to a hearing in which all the evidence considered necessary will be submitted; () on the assumption that the documents and the evidence provided by the complainant are insufficient to determine whether or not it is necessary to examine the merits of the case, the National Labour Inspection Directorate shall order the appointed inspector to carry out a preliminary investigation in which he or she can look into the alleged violations using the means he or she considers appropriate; () if after this preliminary investigation the inspector considers that there should be an examination of the merits of the case, he or she will grant the parties a hearing, pursuant to section  of the Labour Code, to allow them to give statements on the facts investigated; () once this hearing has taken place a record will be drawn up and the report will be transmitted to the National Director of Labour; () the National Director of Labour then decides whether to submit the request to the competent judicial authority or to order the shelving of the file on the basis of a substantiated decision against which a discretionary remedy and an appeal before the Minister of Labour are possible. Concerning the procedure, the Chamber referred to adds: ""... it is reasonable to expect that the National Labour Inspection Directorate shall respect a deadline ... (of two months) to conclude its administrative intervention (from the due submission of the complaint before this body until the decision to submit a complaint through judicial channels or to shelve the case) ..."". The Government has respected the above terms pronounced by the Constitutional Chamber. In this respect the Minister of Labour and Social Security issued Directive DMT-- dated  May  in which the competent administrative authorities are reminded of their duty to process rapidly -- within two months --, without prejudicing the rights that derive from the principles of due process and legitimate defence, the processes applicable in cases of anti-union discrimination. At present the National Labour Inspection Directorate has set about processing the case within the given deadlines. In this respect the Government provides some examples of the efforts being made by the National Labour Inspection Directorate in order to comply in a reasonable manner with the deadline indicated by the Constitutional Chamber.
.In addition, faithful to the principles that inspire the ILO, on  January  the Minister of Labour issued a new directive in which he draws the attention of the competent bodies to the deadlines provided in the Chamber ruling and in the Directive issued on  May. The purpose of this is to guarantee that procedures relating to allegations of anti-union discrimination are completed within two months. Similarly, a copy of the th Report of the ILO Committee on Freedom of Association has been transmitted",-1,1998,Costa Rica
94,"to the President of the Supreme Court of Justice under cover of official letter DMT-- dated  January . In this document the judicial authorities are informed of the Committee's concern about slowness and long delays in deciding proceedings. The Government wishes to make plain its full readiness to remedy the concerns of the Committee on Freedom of Association regarding alleged delays in achieving justice through administrative processes to evaluate unfair labour practices, by defining reasonable policies to protect the rights of unionized workers and ensuring swift procedures without prejudice to the constitutional guarantees of due process and legitimate defence. It is the parties to the dispute who are primarily responsible for delaying the procedures in question by using the delaying actions and tactics available to them through due process, a situation the Government has informed the Committee on Freedom of Association about at great length. In this respect, the Government regrets that the complainant trade union is making inexact claims to the ILO which have now been superseded in national legislation and practice. As a result the complainants seem somewhat hasty in their claim that the ""Government of Costa Rica does not ensure that its own legislation and legal decisions with respect to the exercise of trade union rights in banana plantations are properly respected or effectively applied"".
.Moreover, the Government refers to ruling No. - handed down at : on  February  (record No. -A-) and indicates that for a number of years the ILO bodies responsible for monitoring the application of international labour Conventions, particularly the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations and the tripartite Committee on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations of the International Labour Conference have made observations to the Government of Costa Rica relating to its adoption of the necessary measures to allow strikes in the agriculture (including banana plantations) and forestry sector and consequently in the public sector. For this reason, having evaluated the doctrine and legislation that uphold the prohibition of the right to strike in the agriculture and forestry sector contained in clause (b) of section  of the Labour Code, in August  the Executive Branch presented a draft bill to the Legislative Assembly to repeal that clause. Similarly, in February  the Constitutional Chamber issued its momentous ruling No. - handed down at : on  February , record No. -A-. This ruling declares clauses (a), (b) and (e) of section  and the second paragraph of section  of the Labour Code to be unconstitutional.
.Furthermore, considering the lack of evidence to confirm the claims contained in the IUF's complaint, the Government gives an extensive summary of the investigations (not mentioned in the allegations) that the competent national authorities carried out into trade union persecution and/or unfair labour practices in banana plantations ( cases between  and ).
.As regards the specific complaints cited by the complainant in Case No. , the Government states that the National Labour Inspection Directorate has carried out the following inspections, in accordance with the law, on the basis of applications from the UTRAL, SITRACHIRI and SITAGAH trade unions:-- Workers' Union of Limn: the National Labour Inspection Directorate has in its files seven records relating to complaints of trade union persecution and unfair labour practices. Only one of these complaints is against the enterprise Bananera Isla Grande S.A., and was received by the Directorate on  July . This complaint of unfair labour practices has been legally processed and has now been submitted by the National Labour Inspection Directorate to the labour courts. During the administrative investigation the enterprise was found to be violating labour and social security legislation as well as committing unfair labour practices and trade union persecution when it was determined that the workers were being harassed to resign their membership of the trade union. With respect to the complaint submitted by the trade union following the end of the abovementioned investigation, concerning the alleged sale of the assets of the Isla Grande S.A. enterprise to the Chiriqu Land Company, so that it would be considered as part of the judicial process submitted, the Government wishes to state that the administrative authorities do not know whether this sale is fraudulent or not, given that the party concerned must take the appropriate legal action before the corresponding courts.With respect to the inspection carried out on  and  July  by officials from the National Labour Inspection Directorate at Isla Grande S.A., it was established that the enterprise was infringing labour legislation in the following ways: practising periodic dismissal (section , clauses (b) and (c) of the Labour Code); hiring a higher percentage of (illegal) foreigners than permitted by law (section  of the Labour Code); it was not registered with the Costa Rican Workers' Social Security Fund; workers were treated disrespectfully; pay was below the legal minimum, etc. All these inspection duties were carried out by investigating inspectors under the protection of the powers granted by the Organization of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security Act.Of the remaining five cases relating to the complaint lodged by the UTRAL trade union relating to the Virginia, Manzanillo, Gandoca and Daytona plantations, owned by the enterprise Proyecto Agroindustrial de Sixaola (PAIS), and lastly the case relating to Proyecto Agroindustrial de Sixaola (PAIS), the competent ministerial department, through its body of inspectors, carried out the relevant investigations between  July and  November . As a result of these investigations the corresponding complaints were submitted to the courts as described above. The investigations determined the existence of unfair labour practices in the form of harassment and threats so that workers would resign their membership in the trade union as well as the wrongful withholding of union dues deducted from workers. The Government wishes to underline the fact that at no time did the trade union in question denounce through administrative channels the presence of security doors or aggressive guards to prevent the entry of trade union officials.-- Workers' Trade Union of the Sixaola Agroindustrial Project (SITRAPAIS): on  July , this trade union lodged a complaint with the National Labour Inspection Directorate against the enterprise called Proyecto Agroindustrial de Sixaola (PAIS) for unfair labour practices and trade union persecution. This ministerial office processed the complaint according to the law, investigating the case and concluding in effect that within the enterprise workers were being dismissed for their membership of the trade union and affiliated workers were being intimidated and threatened as were those who intended to join the trade union. For these reasons, on  June , the National Labour Inspection Directorate lodged a formal complaint with the competent labour courts. Although the initial complaint referred to chains on doors, padlocks and permanent security guards, at no time was it shown that these security measures were an obstacle to trade union officials entering the enterprise. (The facts relating to the complaint referred to in this paragraph are not mentioned in the IUF's complaint.)-- Workers' Trade Union of the Chiriqu Land Company (SITRACHIRI): on  August , this trade union lodged a complaint with the abovementioned Directorate against the Chiriqu Land Company. The same organization lodged an application for the withdrawal of the complaint, informing the ministerial office that the loss of interest in pursuing the investigation was due to the fact that a satisfactory agreement had been reached with the enterprise. Given these facts, the National Labour Inspection Directorate closed the case under examination. On  September , SITRACHIRI submitted a further complaint to the ministerial authorities against the Chiriqu Land Company, Sixaola division, plantations  and , citing unfair labour practices and anti-union persecution. From the investigation carried out it was found that workers were being harassed to resign their membership of the trade union and preferential treatment was given to members of the Solidarity association, whose executive committee includes employers' representatives. In view of this result and the violations encountered, on  February  the National Labour Inspection Directorate lodged a complaint with the courts against the Chiriqu Land Company. In this connection the Government wishes to stress that during the complaint and investigation process, SITRACHIRI made no reference to the infringement of the prevailing collective agreement, as stated in the complaint brought before this international body.-- It is necessary to make it clear to the ILO that a review of the records in the archives of the National Labour Inspection Directorate reveal that there are no pending complaints relating to the Compaa Bananera del Atlntico.-- Trade Union of Agricultural, Livestock and Similar Workers of Heredia (SITAGAH): there are records of seven complaints having been submitted between  and  through administrative channels, of which four concern Bananera Guapinol S.A. These complaints have been shelved, given that the results of the investigations carried out did not reveal any evidence of legal issues. As regards the complaint instituted in April  by this trade union against Bananera El Roble Sociedad, this has been archived at the National Labour Inspection Directorate",0,1998,Costa Rica
95,"as the existence of anti-union persecution and unfair labour practices was not demonstrated. Furthermore, on  October  the same complainant lodged a complaint with the National Labour Inspection Directorate for unfair labour practices and anti-union persecution against Amado Daz Guevara, a member of the trade union's executive committee, against the enterprise Bananera Oropel S.A. This investigation was completed on  November  when the investigating official submitted his final report and referred the case to the Directorate for a final decision, which is currently under consideration. On  October , SITAGAH lodged a complaint against Bananera Las Gacelas S.A. for unfair labour practices and anti-union persecution, citing the fact that when they arrived at the enterprise the security guards would not let them pass. In view of the complaint, the National Labour Inspection Directorate called for an investigating inspector to carry out an investigation. He submitted his final report on  November , referring the file back to the National Labour Inspection Directorate for its final decision. The Government stresses that this case is the only one under examination in which a complaint has expressly been sent to the national authorities by the trade unions denouncing the obstruction by employers' representatives of entry into the enterprise.-- Complaint lodged by Mr. Florentino Valencia Valencia, for unfair labour practices and anti-union persecution against the Finca Talamanca, on  December . The Government states that the action was shelved in November  at the request of the plaintiff.-- Workers' Trade Union, Plantaciones Agrcolas (SITRAP): on  March and  June , this trade union lodged a complaint against the Corporacin de Desarrollo Agrcola del Monte S.A. The complainant claims that the enterprise is engaging in anti-union conduct with the objective of removing Mr. Didier Leiton Valverde, a member of the workers' permanent committee and a trade union member. Once the corresponding investigation had been carried out, which was completed on  September , it was found that the enterprise had in fact engaged in unfair labour practices to the detriment of Mr. Didier Leiton Valverde. For these reasons the National Labour Inspection Directorate proceeded to lodge a legal complaint on  October . However, in view of a verbal request by the Labour Relations Department of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, the process was interrupted since SITRAP and the representatives of the enterprise requested administrative conciliation in order to resolve the conflict that had arisen between the parties. As a result of this conciliation, in a document dated  October , prepared by the above-noted department and sent to the National Labour Inspection Directorate by mutual agreement, the parties withdrew the complaint and therefore the file is pending examination.
.As regards the alleged delay in administrative procedures in the trade union sphere, the Government reiterates its comments on Constitutional Chamber ruling No. - handed down at : on  July  and on the related administrative directives. All the statements by the complainant concerning alleged delays in the administrative processing of investigations of infringements of trade union rights concern aspects that have now been overcome as a result of the efforts made by various government bodies.
.Nevertheless, the administrative and judicial procedures end when all stages, both administrative and judicial, have been completed, and not before. Omitting part of the due process of law established in the legislation, be it administrative or judicial, is tantamount to ignoring the Constitution. The parties to the dispute are primarily responsible for delaying the proceedings being considered, by using delaying actions and tactics available to them under due process, a situation that the Government of Costa Rica has informed the Committee on Freedom of Association about at great length and that the Committee has clearly noted in paragraph  of the th Report (November ). In that paragraph the Committee expressly recognizes the delay caused by the parties during these proceedings, concluding that the ""administrative and legal actions brought by (the enterprise) meant that the Government was unable to go to the judicial authority before the end of August  in order to obtain the penalties and compensation provided for in the legislation"". It is incorrect to claim, as the complainant has done, that the National Labour Inspection Directorate intentionally delays the processing of complaints of union persecution and unfair labour practices, given that it has been shown that the conduct of the National Labour Inspection Directorate was entirely in keeping with the procedures recognized and approved both by the country's highest jurisdictional body and by the ministerial authorities. In this respect the Government once again expresses its regret that the complainant is making inexact claims which have now been superseded in national legislation and practice.
.As regards the inspection measures carried out at the work centres referred to in this complaint, the Government sends a copy of the report, dated  December , prepared by the inspector called in to do this work and sent to the legal section of the National Labour Inspection Directorate.
.The Government attaches a copy of a report from the Labour Relations Department concerning the individual complaints referred to in the complaint under examination submitted to the ILO by the IUF and the involvement of the Labour Relations Department. According to that report:-- Agricultural Workers' Trade Union of Limn (UTRAL): In accordance with sections ,  and  of the Organization of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security Act, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, through the Labour Relations Department, initiated the conciliation procedure proposed by UTRAL and convened the relevant conciliation meetings as authorized by law.-- In this connection, and on the request of the trade union in question, the Labour Relations Department, pursuant to an official letter DRT-- dated  July , convened the representatives of Bananera Isla Grande S.A. and of the UTRAL trade union to a conciliation meeting to be held on  July  at ..-- On that occasion, the trade union requested that a meeting be convened to settle the following issues with the enterprise: () recognition of UTRAL; () dispute settlement procedure; () deduction of union dues; () free entry to the plantation; () dismissal of workers affiliated to UTRAL, in spite of the submission of a collective dispute to the courts; () respect for workers affiliated to UTRAL.-- On  July  at the time specified for the abovementioned conciliation meeting only the representative of UTRAL attended and he requested on the record that the employers' representatives from Isla Grande S.A. be summoned once again. Furthermore, under cover of official letter DRT-- dated  July  a copy of the above record was sent to the National Labour Inspection Directorate.-- In official letter DRT-- dated  July  the Labour Relations Department once again convened the parties concerned for a meeting on  August ; the leadership of the Civil Guard of Sixaola was involved in notifying the employers' representatives.-- As regards the alleged dismissal of workers affiliated to UTRAL despite a collective dispute having been submitted to the courts in a decision dated  August  the first civil and labour court of Limn, in proceedings relating to the socio-economic collective dispute presented by Mauricio Abrego and others against Bananera Isla Grande S.A., ordered the defendant to reinstate the workers dismissed from their usual duties.-- In a note dated  August , relating to the official convocation for  August , signed by Mr. Adrin Alvarado Morales, the administrator of the Isla Grande plantation, and addressed to the Labour Relations Department, the author states that he is not the legal representative of that company.-- On  August , the date when the abovementioned conciliation meeting was due to take place, only the UTRAL representative attended, who consequently requested that the representatives of Isla Grande S.A. be summoned a third time, and sent a copy of this convocation to the National Labour Inspection Directorate of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security for their information and eventual action.-- Once again, in official letter DRT-- dated  August  the parties were convened for a conciliation meeting on  September  at ..-- On  September , in a communication signed by the general manager of the Chiriqu Land Company, of which this Department received a copy, the executive committee of the Workers' Trade Union of Chiriqu Land Company and the workers of Isla Grande S.A. were informed that the enterprise Chiriqu Land Company had bought the assets of Isla Grande S.A. plantation, which were now covered by the collective agreement governing the Chiriqu Land Company.-- As regards  September , the date on which the conciliation meeting was to be held between the parties mentioned, it is noted that neither party attended the meeting.
.Furthermore, with respect to the executive committee of the solidarity association being supposedly made up of administrative workers and imposed by the Chiriqu Land Company, the Government indicates that according to a sworn declaration, a copy of which was attached to the response, it is testified that in accordance",1,1998,Costa Rica
96,"with section  of Act No.  concerning solidarity associations, none of the members of the executive committee in force in November  holds any of the offices stipulated and therefore the complaint submitted by the complainants to the ILO is inexact. On the subject of the Trade Union of Agricultural, Livestock and Similar Workers of Heredia (SITAGAH), on  July , Mr. Ramn Barrantes Cascante, in his capacity as general secretary of SITAGAH, addressed a request to the Ministry of Labour to summon the employers' representatives of the Compaa Bananera Gacela S.A. to a meeting to evaluate ""... the reasons why the security guard at that company acted in an unusual manner when, on  July, Mr. Flix Andino in the performance of his duties approached the security door situated at the entrance to the plantation and the security guard did not raise the door although he knew that the worker was working for the enterprise and the tractor he was driving belonged to the enterprise ..."". By reason of the above-noted action, the Labour Relations Department in official letters DRT-- dated  July  and DRT-- dated  August  convened the parties in question to a meeting to proceed with the respective conciliation procedures. Notes sent to that Department by the employer on  and  August  indicate that ""The security guards have the obligation to keep the access route for vehicles to the plantation closed in order to guarantee as far as circumstances permit the security of the people who work for it and of their property. Vehicles of all kinds, whether privately owned or the property of the plantation, must stop at the main gate before they can enter. It is not true that the guard identifies vehicles in the distance and immediately proceeds to open the gate. This procedure is contrary to all security standards. Mr. Andino, the driver of the tractor, is obliged to stop the tractor at the main gate to the plantation and wait for the guard on duty to clear the way for him to enter."" Although the employers' representative did not appear in person at the hearings, the Department drew up two records of the meetings dated  and  August .
.On another matter, relating to the allegation by the complainant requesting free passage throughout the banana plantations for trade union leaders, the Government states that in addition to free passage and the right to hold meetings being a constitutional right, the administrative directive issued by the Ministry of Labour on  January , mentioned above, orders the competent authorities ""... to remain constantly vigilant in the protection of workers' collective rights in order to ensure that the constitutional right of workers and their trade union leaders to hold meetings is not suppressed and their right to hold meetings and to undertake peaceful industrial action is upheld ..."".
.The Government considers that the complainant is wrong to allege facts which in many cases have been superseded by national legislation and in others have been attended to and solved by the competent administrative authorities. It refers to the regulations that protect trade union rights and the jurisprudence that has originated from the highest jurisdictional body, to the administrative measures taken by the National Labour Inspection Directorate and the Labour Relations Department in dealing with and solving the complaints under examination, and to the guidelines issued by the Ministry of Labour that ensure as a whole the protection of workers' trade union rights, requested by the complainants in the action under examination.
.In this context, the Government states that the Ministry of Labour and Social Security and also the other competent administrative and jurisdictional authorities have acted in the case under examination in accordance with the law and continue to make enormous efforts to guarantee that prevailing legislation is observed by the employers' sector in the matter in question. In any event, it is submitted that it is not in conformity with legal and moral principles to censure someone when that person has not been entitled to defend himself or herself. The Government has given its position in this document, to the best of its knowledge, concerning the complaints, confirming its commitment to guarantee the observance of trade union rights contained in prevailing legislation without detriment to the daily efforts being made by the competent authorities in order to achieve harmony in labour relations.
.Furthermore, in support of harmonious labour relations in Costa Rica and as a guarantee of good order and social justice, the Government states that the Ministry of Labour has issued instructions to the competent authorities (Office of Industrial Affairs and National Labour Inspection Directorate) for them to summon the relevant employer and attend to the list of claims for mediation presented by the complainant. Likewise, to enable them to carry out a thorough evaluation of the complaint under examination and any other studies, analyses and/or investigations necessary, the abovementioned authorities were informed about all facts known to the administration at the time that this complaint was submitted to the ILO (Case No. ).
.In its communication dated  March , the Government sends a long report from the Director and General Inspector of Labour concerning certain issues raised by the complainant and in particular the alleged  decisions for censuring delays in the administration of justice referred to by the IUF, and also ten of the rulings handed down by the Constitutional Chamber, most of which do not correspond to the parties to the dispute or to decisions against the Ministry of Labour, as suggested by the IUF. The report indicates the various guidelines and measures adopted by the authorities to enhance the ongoing development of effective and prompt protection in the event of the violation of trade union rights. In keeping with the provisions of ruling No. - handed down by the Constitutional Chamber which is available on record, a number of directives issued by the National Labour Inspection Director -- the person dealing with the matter before us -- can be found in the much-quoted report, such as Directive No. - dated  July  concerning the ""Administrative procedure to apply in cases such as trade union persecution and unfair labour practices"", Directive No. - dated  February  entitled ""Legal obligations pertaining to the required treatment when dealing with accusations of unfair labour practices"" and Directive No. - dated  February  entitled ""Referral of copy of official communication DMT-- and attached documentation relating to the complaint submitted to the ILO by the IUF"".
.On the basis of the above considerations, the Government seeks the dismissal of the complaint submitted by the IUF in its entirety as the situations denounced have been addressed by the competent authorities in accordance with the law.
.The Committee observes that the allegations submitted in this case relate essentially to various acts of anti-union discrimination and intimidation, practices undermining collective bargaining, obstacles to the access of trade union officials to the plantations and to the ineffectiveness of and excessive delays by the administrative and judicial authorities in processing complaints of trade union persecution and unfair labour practices. The Committee notes the extensive and detailed reply from the Government. It also notes the Government's indication that some of the allegations presented by the complainant have not been brought before the national authorities and its declaration that instructions have been issued to the competent authorities to attend to these allegations and to carry out any necessary studies, analyses and/or investigations. As regards the request by the Government to dismiss the IUF's complaint because the situations had been addressed by the competent authorities in accordance with the law, the Committee recalled that its mandate ""consists in determining whether any given legislation or practice complies with the principles of freedom of association and collective bargaining laid down in the relevant Conventions"" (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. ).Allegations relating to Bananera Isla Grande S.A.
.According to the allegations, the collective dispute that arose in this enterprise occurred as a result of UTRAL submitting a list of claims on  July  in the context of commencing the collective bargaining process; the following day one of the signatories of the list of claims (Mr. Samuel Abrego Abrego) was dismissed; a number of days previously the enterprise had already dismissed various workers whose intention of signing the list of claims was known to the enterprise (Mr. Pineda Becker, Mr. Abrego Santos, Mr. Palacios Becker and Mr. Jimnez Miranda). On  August , the judicial authority ordered that the dismissed workers be reinstated in their duties; on  August  the enterprise refused to reinstate these workers and dismissed  more who had signed the list of claims (according to the complainant, these dismissals occurred as follows: on the request of Bananera Isla Grande S.A. and other enterprises operating in the region, from  to  August, in the presence of enterprise representatives, the Civil Guard and immigration officials, citing an alleged",1,1998,Costa Rica
97,"operation targeting illegal immigrants and using lists of workers affiliated to the trade union and signatories of the list of claims, stopped workers crossing the border in order later to dismiss them alleging ""unjustified absence""); a large number of the dismissed workers were not reinstated in their duties. In addition, the workers from the enterprise were pressured to join a solidarity association that steps had been taken to establish at the plantation; it was twice proposed to the workers to sign a ""direct arrangement"" with the enterprise (outside the trade union) and the committee which was to negotiate it was offered better working conditions; pressure was also placed on the trade union members to sign blank pieces of paper in order to dismiss them and put an end to the dispute. Furthermore, the complainant alleges that the enterprise is carrying out a sham sale to another enterprise (Chiriqu Land Company, Sixaola Division) in order to undermine the collective dispute which is before the judicial authority
.According to the Government: () The National Labour Inspection Directorate received a complaint on  July  against the enterprise Bananera Isla Grande S.A.; the administrative investigation found that the enterprise was involved in unfair labour practices and anti-union persecution, it being determined that the workers were being harassed to resign their membership of the trade union and that the enterprise was infringing labour legislation by practising periodic dismissals, hiring a higher percentage of (illegal) foreigners than allowed by law, paying wages below the legal minimum, not according workers the appropriate respect, not registering workers with the Costa Rican Social Security Fund, etc. () As a result of the investigations, the National Labour Inspection Directorate submitted a complaint to the labour courts; on the request of the UTRAL trade union, this Directorate had previously invited the parties to a number of conciliation meetings (as from  July ) concerning the recognition of the trade union, the deduction of union dues, free entry to the plantation, the dismissal of UTRAL members despite the submission of a collective dispute to the courts, and respect for workers affiliated to the trade union; nevertheless, the enterprise failed to attend these meetings. () On  August , the judicial authority ordered the reinstatement of the dismissed workers in their usual duties. () On  September  the enterprise Chiriqu Land Company bought the assets of Bananera Isla Grande S.A.; as a result the workers are now covered by the collective agreement of the Chiriqu Land Company; the authorities do not know whether or not this sale is fraudulent given that in order to determine this the party concerned must institute the necessary action before the courts.
.The Committee observes that the issues relating to the collective dispute that occurred at Bananera Isla Grande S.A. were the subject of an administrative investigation that respected the legal deadline of two months. After the investigation the administrative authority submitted a complaint to the judicial authority and convened the parties to various conciliation meetings which the enterprise representatives did not attend. Observing that during its investigation the administrative authority found that workers were being harassed to resign their membership of the trade union, that there were considerable violations of labour legislation and that on  August  the judicial authority ordered the reinstatement in their duties of the workers who had so far been dismissed (five in all), the Committee must deplore these facts and requests the Government to send it the text of the final decision handed down by the judicial authority and to ensure compliance with the judicial decision that has already been handed down ordering the reinstatement of the five dismissed workers. As regards the remaining allegations (dismissal, alleging ""unjustified absence"", of  workers affiliated to the trade union who had signed the list of claims, following an alleged operation targeting illegal immigrants that occurred between  and  August  in which the Civil Guard and immigration officials were involved in the presence of enterprise representatives at the border, using lists of workers affiliated to the trade union; pressure placed on workers to join a solidarity association; proposal to workers to sign a ""direct arrangement"" with the enterprise outside the trade union; pressure on trade union members to sign blank pieces of paper), the Committee requests the Government to forward its observations in this respect.
.Concerning the alleged sham sale of Bananera Isla Grande S.A. to another enterprise (Chiriqu Land Company) in order to undermine the collective dispute which was already before the judicial authority for consideration, the Committee notes the Government's declaration that on  September  the Chiriqu Land Company bought the assets of Bananera Isla Grande S.A., that the workers were from then on covered by the collective agreement of the Chiriqu Land Company (the collective agreement is deemed to be satisfactory by the complainant) and also that in order to determine whether or not the sale was fraudulent the party concerned must submit the necessary action to the courts.Allegations relating to the enterprise PAIS S.A
.According to the allegations, in this enterprise the members of UTRAL are being harassed to resign their membership of the union and some workers have even been dismissed simply because of their union membership; in addition, the enterprise has installed a security door to stop trade union officials from entering and has brought in security guards who act aggressively and issue threats.
.The Committee notes the Government's statements that administrative investigations were instituted in November  and as a result of the investigations (which determined the existence of harassment and threats to workers to resign their membership of the trade union and the wrongful retention of union dues) the corresponding complaints were lodged with the courts. The Committee requests the Government to forward to it the text of the decision rendered. Likewise, observing the Government's indication that the trade union has never complained through administrative channels of the existence of security doors and guards who act aggressively to stop trade union officials entering, and that the Government has issued instructions for the competent authorities to address these allegations and adopt the appropriate measures, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.Allegations relating to the Compaa Bananera del Atlntico
.According to the allegations, this enterprise pressured workers to such an extent that some of them resigned their membership of the SITAGAH trade union, following the enterprise's recommendation; the complainant claims that it has sworn declarations by workers to prove this. The complainant indicates that the complaint to the Ministry of Labour was entirely fruitless, forcing the trade union to apply to the Constitutional Chamber to have its rights upheld. It refers to  decisions concerning its members handed down by that Chamber in which, it maintains, the Ministry of Labour was found to have delayed proceedings and ordered to pay damages.
.The Committee notes the Government's statement that a review of the records in the archives of the National Labour Inspection Directorate revealed no trace of any pending complaints relating to the Compaa Bananera del Atlntico.
.With regard to other enterprises that are not included in the allegations in the current complaint, the Government indicates that investigations undertaken in relation to seven complaints submitted by SITAGAH between  and  show that in four of these complaints there was no proof, in one complaint trade union persecution and unfair labour practices were not proven, in another the administrative investigation ended in November  and was referred to the National Labour Inspection Directorate for a final decision (which is under examination) and in the last administrative investigation which ended in November  (the complaint was made on  October ) the file was submitted to the National Labour Inspection Directorate for a final decision.
.The Committee observes that the allegations relating to pressure by the Compaa Bananera del Atlntico on workers to resign their membership of the trade union are too vague as there is no indication of when the pressure occurred, the workers' declarations are not attached, nor are their names. Nevertheless, the complainant refers to  decisions handed down by the Constitutional Chamber and seems to base its allegations on the ineffectiveness, in its view, of the Ministry of Labour in processing the complaints submitted to it. The Committee therefore refers to the conclusions it formulates below concerning the alleged ineffectiveness of the Ministry of Labour and the delays in the processing of complaints, where the decisions in question are examined. Allegations relating to the Compaa Bananera Gacelas
.According to the allegations, in this enterprise where there has been a rapid rise in unionization, security doors and security guards are being used to stop the free passage of trade union leaders.
.The Committee notes the Government's declarations that on  July  the trade union SITAGAH requested an examination into why security guards obstructed the entry of a worker who arrived at the enterprise. In August , following conciliation procedures by the administrative authorities, the enterprise indicated in writing that the access route for vehicles to the plantation",1,1998,Costa Rica
98,"is kept closed in order to guarantee the security of the persons working there and of their property and that the person referred to in the complaint who wanted to enter had to stop the tractor at the access gate to the plantation and wait for the guard to clear the way for him to enter. The Committee notes the Government's general statement referring to the free passage of trade union leaders in plantations, that the right to hold meetings and the right of passage are constitutional rights and that the Directive issued by the Ministry of Labour on  January  orders the competent authorities to remain constantly vigilant so that the right of workers and their trade union leaders to hold meetings and engage in peaceful industrial action is not suppressed. Given that the allegations included no names or dates relating to obstacles to the passage of trade union leaders and observing that according to the annexes to the Government's reply the trade union's complaint refers to one single worker from the enterprise driving a tractor, and makes no reference at all to whether it was a trade union leader, the Committee will not pursue the examination of these allegations.Allegations relating to the Chiriqu Land Company
.According to the allegations, the head of the human resources department at this enterprise behaves in an aggressive and insulting manner, persecutes unionized workers and constantly violates the rights established in the collective agreement. When the trade union complained about this behaviour, the enterprise denounced the general secretary of SITRACHIRI and persuaded a number of workers to take legal proceedings against the trade union and its leaders, resulting in the executive committee of the trade union being severely persecuted. In addition, in violation of legislation, the enterprise is campaigning for ""solidarity"", and administrative representatives from the enterprise belong to the solidarity association.
.The Committee notes the Government's statement that, following the investigations corresponding to the complaint submitted by SITRACHIRI on  September , the National Labour Inspection Directorate lodged a complaint with the courts against the enterprise on  June , it having been proven in the investigation that workers were being harassed to resign their membership of the trade union and that members who joined the solidarity association were receiving preferential treatment. According to the Government, the trade union did not submit any complaints relating to the violation of the prevailing collective agreement to the administrative authorities. Lastly, the Government states with reference to the alleged inclusion of administrative officials in the executive committee of the solidarity association that, according to an attached sworn declaration, no member of the executive committee in force in November  fits this description.
.The Committee requests the Government to send it the text of the decision handed down by the judicial authority concerning the complaint submitted by the administrative authorities. Allegations relating to the ineffectiveness and excessive delay by the authorities in processing complaints of the violation of trade union rights
.According to the allegations, these delays occur both in the administrative and the judicial bodies;  cases -- administrative body -- and over  cases -- judicial body -- are pending decisions by the respective authorities (at times the judicial proceedings have taken three or four years); the complainant refers to  decisions handed down by the Constitutional Chamber in which the Ministry of Labour has allegedly been censured for delaying procedures and required to pay damages.
.The Committee notes the Government's declarations and in particular that the alleged delays in the administrative procedures no longer occur and have been overcome in legislation and national practice due to various recent actions and efforts by the Government and governmental bodies and to decisions and rulings handed down by the Constitutional Chamber to address the concern expressed by the Committee on Freedom of Association in earlier cases where delays were alleged. The Committee notes with interest that: () as a result of ruling No. - handed down by the Constitutional Chamber on  July , the administrative authorities are required to carry out the applicable procedures for alleged trade union persecution and unfair labour practices within two months; () in Directives dated  May  and  January  this duty was reiterated by the Ministry of Labour to the competent administrative authorities, and the National Labour Inspection Directorate is endeavouring to process cases within the set deadline; () in an official letter dated  January  the President of the Supreme Court of Justice and the judicial authorities were informed of the Committee's concern about excessive slowness in the handing down of decisions; () by way of Constitutional Chamber ruling No. - handed down on  February  the prohibition to strike in the agricultural (including the banana plantations) and forestry sector (section (b) of the Labour Code) was declared to be unconstitutional; () the competent administrative authorities are intervening at the request of the trade unions to achieve extrajudicial conciliation. The Committee also notes the Government's indication that the administrative and judicial processes end when all stages -- administrative and judicial -- have been completed, that not to respect due process would be the same as rejecting the provisions of the Constitution and that it is the parties to the dispute who are primarily responsible for delaying proceedings by using delaying tactics and actions.
.The Committee notes the report by the Director and General Inspector of Labour sent by the Government. It observes that in keeping with the information sent by the Government, the report shows that ruling No. - handed down by the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice dated  July  establishes that the administrative procedure for investigating complaints of alleged trade union persecution and unfair labour practices (or other investigations or procedures established in the Labour Code) is a special one and differs from the general public administration procedure; this ruling indicates the guidelines to be adhered to in future in this special procedure and establishes a deadline of two months for the National Labour Inspection Directorate to conclude its administrative intervention. According to the report, before the ruling was handed down, the parties involved in industrial administrative procedures used all possible legal remedies available to them to try to strengthen and guarantee their position, delaying and obstructing the procedures with their various appeals, assessments and petitions which in practice led to the administration being slow and inefficient in resolving the dispute submitted by the trade unions. The report adds that the National Labour Inspection Directorate has taken steps to promote the ongoing development of efficient and prompt protection and has been adapting itself to the guidelines of the Constitutional Chamber, having also handed down a number of Directives such as No. N-- of  July , to be applied in conjunction with the administrative procedure to adhere to in cases such as trade union persecution and unfair labour practices.
.With respect to the alleged  decisions handed down by the Constitutional Chamber censuring the Ministry of Labour for having delayed procedures (the number of decisions is indicated by the complainant), the Government, reflecting the report by the National Director and National Inspector of Labour, declares that most of the decisions or rulings handed down by the Constitutional Chamber do not concern the parties in the case before the Committee nor refer to judgements pronounced against the National Labour Inspection Directorate or the Ministry, contrary to what is claimed by the complainant. Ten of the  decisions handed down by the Constitutional Chamber and mentioned by the complainant are attached to the report. The Committee observes that an examination of the ten decisions attached reveals the following: () four of the decisions (Nos. -, -, - and -) do not refer to trade union matters; () one decision (No. -) shows that eight months passed before the Ministry of Labour convened a conciliation hearing for three enterprises (requested by the trade union) in October  to present the new trade union executive committee; () one decision (No. -) shows that a complaint of trade union persecution and unfair practices was resolved by the administrative authority on  November ,  months after its submission; () four decisions (Nos. -, -, - and -) show that between  and  months passed between the submission of the complaint and the date on which the respective decision was handed down by the Constitutional Chamber, with these dates being situated for the various cases between  July  (when the Constitutional Chamber established the duration of the administrative procedure at two months) and  January ; in these decisions the Constitutional Chamber indicates that the administrative authority did not respect the deadline of two months for the completion of the administrative procedure and rejects the arguments put forward by the Ministry of Labour citing the limited number of officials, limited travel allowances and means of transport, the high number of appeals and interlocutory applications lodged by the parties, the high number of cases submitted or the need to",1,1998,Costa Rica
99,"adhere to chronological order when processing complaints.
.Furthermore, the Government referred in its reply to administrative investigations in banana plantations that the IUF does not mention in its complaint. The Committee observes that according to the information annexed by the Government, since ruling No. - was handed down by the Constitutional Chamber on  July  establishing a deadline of two months for the completion of the administrative procedure, in the majority of cases (particularly in ) these procedures have been completed within the legal deadline of two months from the presentation of the administrative complaint. In seven cases the administrative authority has lodged a complaint with the judicial authority; two cases have been filed and in one case the parties reached an agreement and one is currently in the preliminary stage.
.The Committee concludes: () that the  cases of violation of trade union rights before the administrative body and the over  cases before the judicial body, which according to the complainant were affected by delays, were not proven by the complainant as it put forward these figures without offering any further evidence and providing details only concerning a limited number of cases; () since  there has been a definite improvement in administrative procedures to process complaints of violation of trade union rights, with these now generally respecting the deadline of two months established by the Constitutional Chamber in July , as demonstrated by the documentation the Government attaches with respect to the banana plantations; () nevertheless, in a number of decisions handed down by the Constitutional Chamber and provided by the complainant, even some handed down after the decision of July , and in a number of cases mentioned by the Government, there is evidence of delays, sometimes considerable, in the administrative procedures.
.In these circumstances, given the fact that the Ministry of Labour has cited before the Constitutional Chamber as the reasons for the delays the limited number of officials, the limited travel allowances and means of transport, the high number of appeals and interlocutory applications lodged by the parties, the high number of cases submitted and the need to adhere to chronological order in the processing of complaints, the Committee requests the Government, in order to consolidate the concrete improvements seen in the rate of completion of administrative procedures in the case of violation of trade union rights, to take measures to guarantee that the complaints submitted through administrative channels are fully processed within the deadline of two months established by the Constitutional Chamber.
.Furthermore, bearing in mind that respect for this deadline of two months in the administrative procedure does not immediately guarantee redress for acts of anti-union discrimination or interference (as at present when the administrative authorities confirm such acts they must submit a complaint to the judicial authority for there to be redress) and taking into account the complainant's claim, not refuted by the Government, that at times the judicial processes take up to three or four years and that in other complaints relating to Costa Rica the Committee itself has found there to be excessive delays in judicial proceedings, the Committee requests the Government to take measures to amend legislation so that the effects of the anti-union acts confirmed by the administrative authority are suspended until the judicial authority hands down its sentence or decision concluding the matter. This is particularly important in order to preclude the absence of a judicial decision over a long period, in particular in cases of dismissal or other serious prejudicial measures or when the parties to the dispute are using the delaying tactics referred to by the Government, which are difficult to avoid when procedural guarantees and due process are respected.
.Finally, the Committee requests the Government to provide its observations on the latest IUF allegations concerning the anti-union dismissals in the Isla Grande and Gacelas agricultural companies.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:Allegations relating to excessive delays by the authorities in processing complaints ofviolation of trade union rights(a) The Committee requests the Government, in order to consolidate the concrete improvements seen in the rate of completion of the administrative procedure in the case of violation of trade union rights, to take measures to guarantee that complaints submitted through administrative channels are fully processed within the deadline of two months established by the Constitutional Chamber.(b) The Committee requests the Government to take measures to amend legislation so that the effects of anti-union acts confirmed by the administrative authority (in its investigations) are suspended until the judicial authority hands down the sentence or decision concluding the matter.Allegations relating to the enterprise Bananera Isla Grande S.A.(c) Observing that in its investigation concerning the allegations relating to the enterprise Bananera Isla Grande S.A., the administrative authority found there to be harassment of workers to resign their membership of the trade union and considerable infringements of labour legislation, and that on  August  the judicial authority ordered the reinstatement in their duties of the workers who had been dismissed up until then (five in all), the Committee must deplore these facts and asks the Government to send it the text of the final decision handed down by the judicial authority and to ensure compliance with the judicial decision that has already been handed down ordering the reinstatement of the five dismissed workers.(d) The Committee requests the Government to forward its observations concerning the other allegations relating to the enterprise Bananera Isla Grande S.A.: dismissal on the grounds of ""unjustified absence"" of  workers affiliated to the trade union who had signed the list of claims, following an alleged operation targeting illegal immigrants carried out at the border between  and  August  by the Civil Guard and immigration officials in the presence of enterprise representatives, using lists of trade union members; pressure placed on workers to join a solidarity association; proposals made to workers to sign a ""direct arrangement"" with the enterprise outside the trade union; and pressure placed on trade union members to sign blank pieces of paper. Allegations relating to the enterprise PAIS S.A(e) The Committee requests the Government to forward to it the text of the decision rendered concerning the complaints submitted by the administrative authorities of harassment and threats addressed at the workers of PAIS S.A. for them to resign their membership of the trade union and of the wrongful retention of union dues. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the administrative action taken in respect of the allegation that in the enterprise there are security doors and that security guards act aggressively to stop trade union leaders entering.Allegations relating to the Chiriqu Land Company(f) The Committee requests the Government to send the text of the decision handed down concerning the complaints submitted by the administrative authorities of the harassment of workers to resign their membership of the trade union and of the preferential treatment of members who join the solidarity association.Recent allegations(g) The Committee requests the Government to provide its observations on the latest IUF allegations concerning the anti-union dismissals in the Isla Grande and Gacelas agricultural companies.",1,1998,Costa Rica
100,".Concerning Case No. , at its March  meeting the Committee requested the Government to provide it with the text of the amended Code as soon as it is adopted [see th Report, para. ]. The Government states in its communication of  May and  August  that it will send the text of the law as soon as it is adopted.
.As regards Case No. , at its March  meeting, the Committee requested the Government to send the decision of the Administrative High Court concerning decision - of  April  taken by the Administrative Board of the National Registry as soon as it is handed down [see th Report, para. ]. In a long communication of  February , the Rerum Novarum Confederation of Workers replies to the arguments put forward by the Government in its last communication to the Committee and mentions the negative impact of the decision of the Constitutional Chamber regarding collective bargaining in the public sector and insists that the previous agreement on collective bargaining in the public sector was extremely restrictive and had been criticized by the Committee. In its communications of  May and  August  the Government states that the judicial authority has rejected the complaint lodged by the Trade Union of Workers and Retirees of the National Registry and that no appeal has been lodged against that ruling (which has been transmitted).
.The Committee takes note of this information. It draws the attention of the complainant organization to the fact that the issue of the right to bargain collectively in the public sector will be dealt with in the context of Case No. .
.At its meeting of November , the Committee made the following recommendations on the allegations pending (see th Report, para. ):(a) The Committee urges the Government to take new measures to implement without delay the conclusions and recommendations it made at its meeting of November  in Case No.  relating to the enterprise FERTICA SA. It requests the Government to ensure that those dismissed because of their trade union office or membership are reinstated (all the members of the executive board of the workers' association and  members have been dismissed) and that the collective agreement is implemented. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.(b) The Committee expresses its concern at the slowness, noting that the long delay in deciding proceedings amounts to a denial of justice, and inefficiency of the proceedings on allegations of anti-trade union discrimination in a considerable number of cases and requests the Government to take the measures necessary to ensure the speedy conduct of proceedings.(c) The Committee deeply deplores that the enterprise FERTICA SA has once again engaged in anti-union practices and urges the Government to take the measures necessary to ensure that it recognizes the legitimate executive board of the Association of Workers of FERTICA SA (ATFe) and hand over all its members' union dues. Furthermore, recalling that the intervention of an employer to promote the constitution of the executive board of a trade union and interference with its correspondence are acts that constitute a grave violation of the principle of freedom of association, the Committee requests the Government to take measures to ensure that such acts are not repeated in the future and to guarantee the rights of the legitimate executive board.(d) Noting that the administrative authorities confirmed in  the extension of the collective agreement in force, the Committee requests the Government to ensure that the enterprise FERTICA SA honours that collective agreement.(e) With regard to the allegations concerning: prohibition of entry by ATFe union officials into the premises of the company, and the prohibition from holding demonstrations, meetings and assemblies in the usual places; the dismissals alleged to have occurred in FERTICA SA on grounds of social and economic dispute despite the existence of a judicial order that such dismissals should not take place; promoting of the constitution of the SITRAFER trade union organization in FERTICA SA; the disappearance of the pension that had been established by the collective agreement and which was the property of the workers, the Committee requests the Government to take the measures necessary to conduct detailed investigations without delay into all the allegations and to ensure that the judicial orders stating that dismissals in FERTICA SA should not take place are respected and to keep it informed of the result of those investigations.
.In its communication of  January and  March , the Government states that as regards the alleged non-compliance with the Committee's recommendations requesting the reinstatement of trade union officials and members and the implementation of the collective agreement in the FERTICA SA enterprise, as indicated in its previous replies, the Government fulfilled its function as mediator, in particular in several meetings with the parties, and providing a timely response, by means of the conciliation machinery available under the legal system in force, to each of the Committee's recommendations. It has repeatedly urged the parties to comply with those recommendations, without at any time claiming the authority to impose measures which are the responsibility of the courts of law (the reinstatement of the workers in question who were dismissed because of their trade union office is a matter which is the exclusive competence of the courts). In particular, the Minister of Labour and Social Security, in communication DMTA.MB- dated  September , invited the general manager of FERTICA and the secretary-general of ATFe to an administrative conciliation meeting, which was held on  September , with a view to reaching an agreement on the recommendations concerning the reinstatement of the workers dismissed as well as compliance with the collective agreement. The arguments put forward by the employer against such a course of action included the statement that the dismissals of the trade union officials were made under the provisions of the collective agreement and before the latter was denounced by the ATFe. The Government also refers to a meeting that took place on  March  between the parties and the head of labour matters of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security. During the meeting, the enterprise rejected the conciliation initiative undertaken by the ministry to examine issues similar to those examined by the Committee in Case No.  and which are the subject of various judicial proceedings. Moreover, the Ministry of Labour issued an administrative guideline to the competent ministerial bodies requiring them once again to take all the necessary steps to urge the parties in dispute to reach a solution and to try to secure the reinstatement of all the dismissed workers in their workplaces and compliance with the collective agreement.
.As regards the Committee's recommendations concerning the slowness of justice, the Government states that the Committee's report was transmitted to the President of the Supreme Court of Justice and high-ranking members of the judiciary have been reminded of the ILO principle in the sphere of freedom of association that justice should be both speedy and seen to be done. Furthermore, on  May  the present Minister of Labour and Social Security issued circular DMT-- which reminded the competent ministerial authorities of their obligation to apply in a speedy manner, within a period of two months and without prejudice to the rights resulting from the principles of due process and legitimate defence, the applicable procedure in cases of anti-union discrimination. This time limit was established by the Constitutional Court, in decision No. - of  July . According to this jurisprudence, in cases of suspected trade union persecution and unfair labour practices, the task of the Ministry is to determine whether or not there are grounds for a denunciation to be made to the competent courts by the Director-General of Labour (the latter's decision may be appealed to the Ministry of Labour), with a period of two months being established for the completion of the administrative inquiry. According to the Government, it is the parties in dispute who have been mainly responsible for delaying the proceedings through the use of delaying tactics and procedures facilitated by due process. Moreover, the Government emphasized its unequivocal readiness to address the Committee's concern about the supposed slowness of justice in administrative proceedings on unfair labour practices.
.Furthermore, the Government states that it deplores all the anti-union practices which infringe the rights of the workers in the FERTICA SA enterprise and it recalls in this respect that the Ministry of Labour and Social Security has confirmed at the administrative level the validity of the collective agreement signed on  September  between FERTICA SA and AFTe. This constitutes a clear recognition of the current executive board of this organization, which has been duly registered.
.As regards the handing over of members' union dues, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security intervened in the matter on  September  with a view to ensuring that the employer change its practice regarding the handing over of members' union dues. However, the employer claimed that since the supposed representation of",1,1998,Costa Rica
101,"the ATFe trade union in the person of Marco Antonio Guzmn Rodrguez is being challenged in the ordinary labour court by Messrs. Toms Alberto Corts Gmez and Oscar Fernndez Salazar, FERTICA SA has transferred the said trade union dues to the Trade Union of Workers of FERTICA, the legal personality of which is recorded in the register of the Ministry of Labour. Moreover, the employer states that the different legal cases related to the matters in hand are still under way. As a result, the Minister of Labour has instructed the competent labour authorities to study and ensure the application of all labour legislation, with a view to establishing a harmonious relationship between the employer and employees, as a guarantee of order and social justice. In this context, direct instructions have been given to these authorities to intervene in the settlement of the dispute with a view to achieving an extrajudicial conciliation between the parties.
.Furthermore, the Government states that the supposed interference of the employer in the election of the executive board of ATFe and interference with its correspondence are ""non-proven facts"" contained in the report issued by the Labour Inspectorate on  November . At all events, with a view to furthering the abovementioned search for peaceful labour relations, comprehensive and express instructions have been given to the National Directorate of Labour Inspection, in the abovementioned communication, for vigilance to be exercised at all times as regards the protection of the collective rights of workers, non-interference by employers in the election of the executive boards of trade unions and non-interference in trade union correspondence, guaranteeing in this way the exercise of the rights of the members of the executive boards of social organizations.
.As regards the Committee's request that the Government ensure that the FERTICA SA enterprise honours the collective agreement in force, the Government points out that the Ministry of Labour has recognized at the administrative level the validity of the collective agreement and, in the same terms, the competent ministerial authorities have been applying it in accordance with the law and have received instructions to ensure that, in accordance with the law, the FERTICA SA enterprise complies with and respects the collective agreement. Furthermore, the Government states that pursuant to administrative resolution No. DRT- of  March , the Department of Labour has extended the collective agreement in question for a period ending  September .
.As regards the final paragraph of the Committee's recommendations, the Government notes the Committee's observations and the Ministry of Labour and Social Security accordingly undertakes to instruct all its inspectors to exert greater vigilance in the FERTICA SA enterprise with a view to ensuring that there is no obstacle to the constitutional right of assembly of workers and trade union officials and the right to hold peaceful meetings and assemblies with the workers. In this respect it should be noted that in accordance with the national law in force, the mere fact of participating in a strike picket or the open and peaceful incitement to other workers not to take up their workplaces is not considered an illegitimate act and therefore this right is guaranteed in the legal system applicable to workers.
.Furthermore, as regards the allegation of the promotion of the constitution of the SITRAFER trade union organization by the employer, the Minister of Labour and Social Security has given instructions to the National Directorate of Labour Inspection to undertake the respective inquiry with a view to ascertaining the truthfulness of the allegations. As a result of the above, SITRAFER is an organization which is now properly constituted, as can be seen from the file, and for this reason enjoys all the rights guaranteed by the law in force, without prejudice to the rights of other organizations in similar conditions. The Government undertakes to keep the Committee informed in this respect.
.As regards the alleged disappearance of the pension fund which is the property of the workers in the FERTICA SA enterprise, the Minister of Labour has instructed the Labour Affairs department and the National Directorate of Labour Inspection to undertake conciliation measures on a coordinated basis or, failing that, the necessary administrative inquiry with a view to establishing the truth of the matter. The Government undertakes to keep the Committee informed in this respect. Finally, the Government reiterates its readiness to comply with all the recommendations made by the Committee on Freedom of Association.
.The Committee notes the measures taken by the Government to conciliate and mediate between the FERTICA SA enterprise and the ATFe organization and to try to secure the reinstatement of the workers dismissed from their workplaces and compliance with the collective agreement and notes with interest that the administrative authorities have taken steps to ensure that the enterprise complies with and respects the collective agreement and that pursuant to an administrative decision, this collective agreement has been extended up to  September . On the other hand, it regrets that the enterprise, in disregard of the Committee's recommendations, refuses to reinstate the trade union officials and members dismissed. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the instructions given to the administrative authorities with a view to finding a solution and achieving the reinstatement of the dismissed persons and expresses the hope that these reinstatements will be made in the very near future.
.The Committee notes with interest that the Constitutional Court, in decision No. - of  July , fixed a time limit of two months for the holding of administrative inquiries into acts of anti-union persecution and unfair practices. The Committee requests the Government to study the possibility of amending legislation so that once an inquiry concludes that acts of anti-union discrimination have occurred, the effects of such acts shall be declared null and void at least until the judicial authorities have ruled on the matter.
.The Committee notes that the Minister of Labour has given instructions to the administrative authorities to try to resolve the dispute in the FERTICA SA enterprise through extrajudicial conciliation on the matter, including as regards the payment of trade union dues to AFTe (an organization which moreover the Government recognizes, as it does SITRAFER). It also notes that instructions have also been given to ensure non-interference by employers in the executive boards of trade unions and trade union correspondence and that the Government has instructed the labour inspectors to step up their monitoring of the FERTICA SA enterprise to ensure that there is no impediment to the constitutional right of assembly of workers and trade union officials and that they are permitted to hold peaceful assemblies. The Committee also notes the Government's remarks concerning conciliation measures or, failing that, an administrative inquiry into the alleged disappearance of the pension fund which is the property of the workers of the enterprise, set up under the collective agreement. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the various aspects of this case, including the new dismissals which occurred as a result of a socio-economic dispute. The Committee also requests the Government to carry out an inquiry into the alleged promotion by the enterprise of an executive board parallel to that of the Association of Workers of FERTICA SA (AFTe) and to keep it informed of the inquiry into the promotion by the enterprise of a new trade union (SITRAFER). The Committee hopes that its recommendations on this case will be applied in the near future.
.The complaint to which this case refers is contained in a communication from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) dated  May . ICFTU sent additional information in a letter of  July . The Government sent its observations in a letter of  August .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  May , the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) stated that for several years trade union organizations have been progressively eliminated, leaving workers seriously unprotected. The ICFTU states that this has occurred in several companies, such as, for example, Fertilizantes de CentroamUrica SA (FERTICA), where the collective agreement in force was broken and the entire trade union leadership in the company was dismissed. The ICFTU adds that, with regard to the acts committed by FERTICA, it entered a complaint against the Government of Costa Rica in  (Case No. ), which was examined by the Committee at its meeting in November  (see th Report, Case No.  (Costa Rica), paras.  to ). The complainant organization states that on that occasion the Committee requested the Government to take measures with a view to mediating between the parties to reach a quick settlement of the dispute between the FERTICA SA Workers' Association and the company through negotiation, taking fully into account the provisions of Conventions Nos. and , ratified by Costa Rica, and in particular to reinstate all those",1,1998,Costa Rica
102,"dismissed because of their membership of official position in the trade union, and to fulfil the collective agreement. The ICFTU alleges that the Committee's recommendations were held in contempt and ignored by the Government of Costa Rica and FERTICA SA.
.The complainant organization states that, in addition to failing to comply with the Committee's recommendations in this case, FERTICA SA committed further breaches of trade union rights. The ICFTU alleges the following specific anti-union acts:-- trade union leaders are barred from entry into the company's premises and they are prohibited from holding trade union demonstrations, meetings and assemblies in the customary places, and from publishing circulars, flyers and notices. In addition, trade union noticeboards and notices were removed, and faced with this situation, the trade union sent telegrams to the workers to call them to an extraordinary meeting to reform the constitution, but the company opened the telegrams and prevented them from reaching the people to whom they were addressed, and had them sent back. Also in the context of this obstructive attitude and rejection of any communication by the trade union, the company refused to accept a communication on the composition of the executive board of the Association of Fertilizer Workers (ATFe);-- the administrative authorities are not resolving the appeal concerning the application of the collective agreement;-- the ATFe resorted to the judicial authorities in Puntarenas on the grounds of a social and economic dispute in the company, and although a judicial order was made not to proceed with dismissals, the company dismissed the striking workers;-- the company refuses to hand over to the ATFe the trade union dues of its members withheld since May ;-- the company has promoted the formation of an executive board in parallel to the ATFe, to which it handed over the trade union dues. Furthermore, the complainant organization states that the company promoted the formation of a trade union organization within the company under the name Sindicato de Trabajadores de FERTICA (SITRAFER), whose leadership is composed of members of the executive board parallel to the ATFe;-- the company has drawn up blacklists containing the names of trade union members;-- it caused the disappearance of the pension fund that had been created through the collective agreement, and which belonged to the workers, by eliminating workers' representation in the administration of the fund and misuse of the capital.
.In its communication of  August , the Government states, concerning the allegations on the failure to fulfil the recommendations of the Committee on Freedom of Association in Case No.  and the new matters contained in Case No. , that it regrets the position adopted by the complainant organization in pursuing Case No.  before the Committee on Freedom of Association, at a time of a change in government, since it had already received a final report through that body and the national authorities were duly attending to the matter. According to the Government, from a simple reading of the supposed new matters contained in the action under examination, it is clearly evident that the cause, subject and parties are similar to Case No. . In this situation of inconsistencies and subject to reporting to the control body on the real truth of the matter, the Government maintains that the case has already been decided since the Committee on Freedom of Association had formulated definitive conclusions and the case was therefore closed.
.The Government states that as a State governed by the rule of law, it is known as a model of democracy and peace, since it has made substantive changes in the course of time which have eliminated, among other things, legal obstacles to the full enjoyment of workers' rights. Efforts are being made in Costa Rica to guarantee both the free enjoyment of fundamental human rights and internationally recognized workers' rights.
.The Government states that it is unaware of the reasons why the trade union sector, which is fully represented in the National Unity Forum (established by decision of the president) has not fulfilled the commitments to dialogue made before this body. Indeed, no case comparable to the one submitted to the Committee, even though a decided matter, has been submitted for consideration and solution, according to their records, to the Unity Forum or the Ministry of Labour and Social Security. The Government adds that it should be emphasized that the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, since commencing its functions on  May , has dealt with all matters of which it was informed of a social and labour character, and that the administrative authorities have remained open for dialogue and collaboration with all sectors of society in seeking social harmony. According to the Government, both Case No.  and the supposed ""new matters"" have been dealt with in the framework of the rule of law, faithfully observing the current legal order and employment practice, which is the reason why it cannot reasonably be asserted that workers' rights are being violated or not respected.
.With regard to the alleged failure to fulfil the recommendations of the Committee in relation to Case No. , the Government reports that the authorities meticulously and diligently attended to the recommendations contained in the th Report of the Committee on Freedom of Association. Specifically, on the recommendation to take new measures to mediate between the parties to bring about a rapid settlement of the dispute between the FERTICA SA Workers' Association and the company, through negotiation, taking fully into account the provisions of Conventions Nos.  and , ratified by Costa Rica; and in particular the reinstatement of those dismissed for trade union membership or office, as well as fulfilment of the collective agreement, the Government states that once the Ministry of Labour had determined the existence of anti-union practices and the violation of the collective agreement by the respondent company, the matter passed to the courts, with a view to a definitive settlement, with an application for sanctions against the company, compensation for the damages caused, as well as immediate reinstatement of the persons concerned, payment of salary arrears, and restitution of the violated rights. The Government adds that, under Costa Rican law, the courts are responsible for ordering the reinstatement of the workers concerned. In the present case, the Government is playing the role of mediator, in accordance with the Committee's recommendations and urging the parties to comply, as shown by the conciliatory measures taken in the above-mentioned office, but it is not permitted to impose measures that are a matter for the courts.
.The Government states that it supports the principles of the ILO and in order to continue to cooperate to resolve this matter, the Executive Power, in its letter No. DM-- of  January , instructed the Department of Labour Affairs in the Ministry of Labour and Social Security to take such measures as necessary to bring the parties to conciliation and bring about the reinstatement of those dismissed because of their trade union membership, as well as fulfilment of the collective agreement, taking fully into account the provisions of Conventions Nos.  and , ratified by Costa Rica. Pursuant to the foregoing, a meeting was held in the above-mentioned Minister's office on  January , with the participation of representatives of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security and the workers. According to the minutes, even though the employers' side was not present at this first meeting, it sent to this office a letter No. GG--, dated  January of that year, requesting a new date for the hearing, to allow them time to prepare their case. It is clear that this request does not contain the slightest wish to refuse, let alone fail to attend, the above meeting. Quite the contrary, they are desirous of clarifying some issues central to the matter and request a new date to be fixed for the hearing. The new hearing was also held in the Minister's office, and the employers' side, represented by the managing director and the trade union, after expressing their appreciation of the Minister's efforts to mediate in the matter, set about finding a solution. The Government states that the diligent steps taken by the administrative authorities throughout the proceedings are yet again clear.
.According to the Government, the National Labour Inspectorate was the principal agency legally responsible for investigating and reporting, through the appropriate legal channels, most of the illegal acts under examination. However, the complainant organization claims to assert its rights in two ways, nationally and internationally, without having exhausted the applicable legal remedies, and clearly unaware of the rule of law by which their country is governed.
.The Government points out that many of the matters under examination have been individually examined through administrative, judicial and international proceedings, administrative proceedings alone, or are apparently heard only in international forums, as is the case with the complaint under consideration, without having exhausted the dispute settlement mechanisms available under Costa Rican law. The Government states that effectively, in Case No. , the Committee on Freedom of Association already considered",0,1998,Costa Rica
103,"and decided on the process provided by the competent national authorities concerning the complaints entered by the ATFe in August, September and October , and the report submitted for the purpose by the inspectors assigned by the National Labour Inspectorate in the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, dated  November , and the applicable judicial proceedings taken by the administrative authorities against FERTICA, dated  August . In this respect, the Government gives a brief review of the main proceedings in the courts concerning the matter in question. The Government reports in detail on the criminal proceedings against FERTICA SA for breach of the labour and social security laws, and action which finally expired.
.The Government states that on  September , the ATFe submitted to the National Labour Inspectorate a new complaint against FERTICA SA for alleged unfair labour practices, and that the inspector assigned to investigate the alleged offence against the labour and social security laws in FERTICA SA, stated in her report that:
.The Government states that this report was transmitted to both parties and that FERTICA SA appealed against it and sought its revocation. By a decision of  November , the National Labour Inspectorate resolved that ""in accordance with constitutional decision No. - of h., of  July , under which, erga omnes, and following examination of the report by the labour inspector, the complaint against the respondent for unfair labour practices (failure to deduct union dues and obstruct union activity) is upheld"". The representative of FERTICA SA appealed against this decision. The National Labour Inspectorate, in its decision of December , refused the appeal and remedies of revocation. The company's representative entered an application for absolute nullity of the decision and the whole proceedings, and sought revocation of both decisions, reiterating its previous arguments. By its decision of  December , the National Labour Inspectorate referred to higher authority the decision concerning the above-mentioned nullities and revocations. In a decision No. - of  March , the office of the Minister of Labour and Social Security refused the appeal and application for nullity entered by the employer's representative in respect of resolutions Nos. DNI-- and DNI-- above by the National Labour Inspectorate.
.The Government states the following in relation to the supposed ""new matters"" alleged:-- with regard to the lack of a resolution by the administrative authorities in the appeal on the force of the collective agreement, on  August , the FERTICA Workers' Association (ATFe) submitted to the Ministry of Labour and Social Security a copy of ""a denunciation with a request for extension"" of the collective labour agreement, requesting it to be registered. Having conducted conciliation proceedings between the parties, and faced with FERTICA's lack of interest in a new agreement, the Department of Labour Relations settled the initial application by a resolution of  May , refusing the union's application. However, the same department subsequently revoked the refusal on appeal, in its resolution of  May , holding the collective labour agreement to be extended. Faced with this latter resolution, FERTICA SA sought the remedies of revocation, appeal and nullity, which were refused on  March , by a resolution of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, which confirmed the extension of the collective labour agreement. Thus the Government asserts that the Ministry of Labour and Social Security confirmed that the collective agreement signed on  September  between FERTICA and ATFe remained in force;-- with regard to the dismissals resulting from a social and economic dispute, despite the existence of a judicial order prohibiting such dismissals, the Government states that -- without verifying the truth of the facts, given that the complainant organization chose to air the matter before this international body, without first notifying the national instances competent to give due process to all the charges -- the matter refers to a supposed failure by the employer to obey a judicial order. The Government considers that to defend itself from these supposed illegal acts, the complainant organization should resort to the legal remedies available in the judicial system, within the time- limits and in the form required under the applicable law;-- with regard to the allegations concerning the barring of ATFe union leaders from entry to the company's premises, the ban on holding demonstrations, meetings or assemblies in the normal places, the removal of the union's noticeboards, circulars and flyers, the opening of telegrams addressed to ATFe members and the withholding of ATFe union dues, the Government states that the complainant organization has a full assessment of the facts of the matter in the above-mentioned report by the Labour Inspectorate;-- with regard to the creation of an executive board parallel to that of the ATFe, the Government states that it is carrying out investigations into certain aspects analysed in the above-mentioned Labour Inspectorate report;-- with regard to the SITRAFER union, which the complainant organization calls a ""shadow union"", the Government makes no comment, bearing in mind that it involves a social organization duly registered with the appropriate authorities, and that at the present time it has not been the subject of an administrative investigation to determine the truth of the facts alleged here;-- with respect to the alleged creation of blacklists, the Government says that it is not aware of this, and that it is ""a non-proven fact"", according to the Labour Inspectorate report;-- with regard to the alleged disappearance of the workers' pension fund, the Government states that these are charges against the company, FERTICA SA, on which the Government declines to comment, since this would require a prior proceeding to seek the truth of the alleged facts, so as to guarantee the parties concerned due process and legitimate defence.
.Lastly, the Government declares that it has shown that the complainant organization is clearly unaware that the State is governed by the rule of law, and that administrative and judicial dispute settlement procedures are guaranteed under the national judicial system. In any case, the Government holds that it has demonstrated its constant search for solutions to achieve social peace through dialogue and unity, wholly refuting the complaint entered by the complainants with regard to the supposed failure to comply with the recommendations made by the Committee on Freedom of Association in Case No. , and the supposed existence of new facts, which may possibly exist, but of which the Government in its undefended position, is not aware, because of the dual track, national and international, used by the complainants to air their concerns.
.The Committee notes that in the present case the complainant organization alleges that the Government has not implemented the recommendations made by the Committee when examining an earlier complaint against the Government of Costa Rica alleging anti-union dismissals and violation of the collective agreement in the company, FERTICA SA (see th Report, Case No. , paras.  to ). The Committee further notes that the complainant organization alleges new acts in violation of trade union rights at FERTICA SA, whereby the company's management: () prevents the entry of ATFe union leaders to the company's premises and prohibits them from holding trade union demonstrations, meetings and assemblies; () removed the trade union noticeboards and notices and prevented the publication of circulars, flyers and meeting notices; () prevented the delivery of telegrams addressed to ATFe members; () refuses to receive communications on the formation of the ATFe executive board; () dismissed striking workers despite the fact that the judicial authorities ordered the dismissals not to be carried out; () refuses to hand over to the ATFe its members' union dues; () promoted the constitution of an executive board parallel to that of the ATFe and a trade union organization called the Sindicato de Trabajadores de FERTICA (SITRAFER); () drew up blacklists containing the names of trade union members; and () caused the disappearance of the workers' pension fund that had been set up under the collective agreement. Finally, the Committee notes that the complainant organization alleges that the administrative authorities are not dealing with an appeal concerning the application of the collective agreement in FERTICA SA.Failure to implement the recommendations of the Committee in Case No. 
.Concerning the alleged failure to implement the recommendations arising in Case No. , the Committee recalls that on that occasion, after deploring various unfair practices and anti-union acts (which had been reported by the Labour Inspectorate), it requested the Government to take ""new measures to mediate between the parties to bring about a rapid resolution of the dispute between the FERTICA SA Workers' Association and the company through negotiation and taking fully into account the provisions of Conventions Nos.  and , ratified by Costa Rica. The Committee requested in particular that those dismissed because of their trade union office or membership should be reinstated (all the members of the executive board of the workers' association and  members had been dismissed) and that the collective agreement should be implemented (see th Report, para. (a)).
.The Committee notes that the Government states in this respect",1,1998,Costa Rica
104,"that it thoroughly and diligently followed the Committee's recommendations, and took the following measures for the purpose: (i) after investigating the anti-union practices and the violation of the collective agreement by the impugned company, it passed the matter to the judicial authorities, requesting the imposition of sanctions on the company and compensation for the damages caused, as well as the immediate reinstatement of the workers concerned, payment of salary arrears and restitution of the violated rights (according to the Government, under Costa Rican law, it is the judicial authorities that are responsible for ordering the reinstatement of the workers concerned); and (ii) the Executive Power instructed the Department of Labour Affairs in the Ministry of Labour and Social Security to take the necessary steps to urge the parties to come to conciliation, seek the reinstatement of the dismissed workers and implementation of the collective agreement, and in that context, it invited the parties to a meeting to seek a solution to the dispute.
.In this respect, the Committee notes that despite the efforts by the administrative authorities to bring the parties to the dispute together, none of the members of the executive board of the ATFe or the  members dismissed for trade union activities in September  (see th Report, para. ), was reinstated, and the collective labour agreement has not been implemented, and the proceedings against the company have not had any effect; furthermore the judicial proceedings to restore the violated rights have not reached a conclusion. In these circumstances, the Committee urges the Government to take new measures to implement without delay the conclusions and recommendations it made at its meeting of November  and to keep it informed in this regard. In addition, the Committee must once again point out that it is presented with a case of dilatoriness in the administration of justice given that the matters complained of by the complainant date from . Consequently, the Committee recalls, as it did in its first examination of these allegations (see th Report, Case No. , para. ), that proceedings relating to matters of anti-union discrimination, in violation of Convention No. , should be examined promptly, so that the necessary corrective measures can be really effective; excessive delay in dealing with anti-union discrimination cases and, in particular, the long delay in deciding proceedings for the reinstatement of dismissed union leaders amounts to a denial of justice and thus a denial of the union rights of those affected. On that occasion, the Committee also expressed its concern at the tardiness and inefficiency of the proceedings in a large number of cases and requested the Government to take the measures necessary to ensure the speedy conduct of proceedings.Allegations concerning new violations of trade union rights in the company FERTICA SA
.Concerning the new acts in violation of union rights alleged to have been committed by the company FERTICA SA since the examination of Case No. , the Committee notes that the complainant organization and the Government basically agree on the existence of such acts (as inferred from the reply of the Government to which is annexed a copy of an administrative investigation report carried out by the National Labour Inspectorate, which found that FERTICA SA had engaged in unfair practices, in that: () company employees refused to accept telegrams sent by the ATFe to convene an assembly of its members; () it did not recognize the legitimate ATFe executive board; () it facilitated the creation of another executive board parallel to the above-mentioned legitimate board; and () it unjustly refused to participate in collective bargaining pursuant to and in compliance with the established legal procedures.
.The Committee deeply deplores that the relations between the trade union and the company have deteriorated still further, once again giving rise to anti-union practices. In these circumstances, the Committee urges the Government to take the measures necessary to ensure recognition of the legitimate executive board of the ATFe and to ensure the transfer to it of all its members' union dues. The Committee further draws to the attention of the Government the intervention by an employer to promote the constitution of the executive board of a trade union, and interference with its correspondence, are acts which constitute a grave violation of the principles of freedom of association, and requests the Government to take measures to ensure that such acts are not repeated in the future and to guarantee the union rights of the legitimate board.
.With regard to the allegation on the failure by the administrative authorities to decide the appeal on the application of the collective agreement in FERTICA SA, the Committee notes that the Government states that: (i) in August , the ATFe submitted to the Ministry of Labour and Social Security a copy of the denunciation with an application to extend the collective agreement for purposes of registration. The Committee is aware that the term ""registration"" may have different connotations in different countries; however, it stresses that the approval of a collective agreement by the authorities should be limited to a control of the respect of the minimum legal standards required by the legislation; (ii) having conducted conciliation proceedings between the parties and faced with the company's lack of interest, the Department of Labour Relations refused the union's application on  May ; (iii) later, on  May , the same department issued a decision reversing the refusal, and held that the collective agreement was extended; (iv) the company sought the remedies of revocation, appeal and nullity of the decision, and (v) on  March , the administrative authorities rejected the company's applications, and the Ministry of Labour confirmed the extension of the collective agreement signed on  September . In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to ensure that the company FERTICA SA honours the collective agreement.
.The Committee further notes that it is not shown in the above-mentioned Labour Inspectorate report that there are blacklists with the names of workers who have participated in strikes or other trade union activities, and neither was it proved that the company's representatives were responsible for removing and destroying notices and communications issued and affixed by the ATFe union in the company. Finally, the Committee notes that FERTICA SA entered several administrative appeals against the report of the Labour Inspectorate, and that these were refused.
.With regard to the other allegations made, the Committee notes the following:-- concerning the prohibition on the entry of ATFe trade union officials to the company's premises, and the prohibition on holding demonstrations, meetings or assemblies in the usual places, the Committee notes that the investigation carried out by the Labour Inspectorate does not make any reference to this;-- concerning the allegation of further dismissals made by FERTICA SA as a result of a social and economic dispute, despite the existence of a judicial order forbidding such dismissals, the Committee notes that the Government states that the matter relates to a supposed breach of a judicial order and that to defend itself against the consequences of this illegal act, the trade union organization should resort to the legal remedies available under the judicial system. The Committee requests the Government to ensure that this judicial order is respected;-- concerning the serious allegation of the promotion of the constitution of the trade union organization SITRAFER in the company FERTICA SA, the Committee notes that the Government states that it declines to comment on this matter, since it concerns an organization duly registered with the appropriate authorities, which has not been subject to administrative proceedings to verify the truth of the alleged facts;-- concerning the allegation that FERTICA SA caused the disappearance of the pension fund that had been created by the collective agreement and which belonged to the workers, the Committee notes that the Government merely states that it will not comment on this since that would require a prior proceeding to seek the truth of the facts.Under these circumstances, the Committee regrets that the observations submitted by the Government concerning these allegations are too general, and requests it to take the measures necessary to undertake detailed investigations without delay to confirm the truth of these allegations. The Committee further requests the Government to keep it informed of the result of these investigations..Finally, concerning the Government's assertion to the effect that the complainants should have exhausted national procedures, the Committee recalls that although the use of internal legal procedures, whatever the outcome, is undoubtedly a factor to be taken into consideration, it has always considered that, in view of its responsibilities, its competence to examine allegations is not subject to the exhaustion of national procedures.
.Finally, concerning the Government's assertion to the effect that the complainants should have exhausted national procedures, the Committee recalls that although the use of internal legal procedures, whatever the outcome, is undoubtedly a factor to be taken into consideration, it has always considered that, in view of its responsibilities, its competence to examine allegations is not subject to the exhaustion of national procedures.
.In the light of the foregoing conclusions,",1,1998,Costa Rica
105,"the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee urges the Government to take new measures to implement without delay the conclusions and recommendations it made at its meeting of November  in Case No.  relating to the company FERTICA SA. It requests the Government to ensure that those dismissed because of their trade union office or membership are reinstated (all the members of the executive board of the workers' association and  members had been dismissed) and that the collective agreement is implemented (see th Report, para. (a)). The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.(b) The Committee expresses its concern at the slowness, noting that the long delay in deciding proceedings amounts to a denial of justice, and inefficiency of the proceedings on allegations of anti-trade union discrimination in a considerable number of cases and requests the Government to take the measures necessary to ensure the speedy conduct of proceedings.(c) The Committee deeply deplores that the company FERTICA SA has once again engaged in anti-union practices and urges the Government to take the measures necessary to ensure that it recognizes the legitimate executive board of ATFe and hand over all its members' union dues. Furthermore, recalling that the intervention of an employer to promote the constitution of the executive board of a trade union and interference with its correspondence are acts that constitute a grave violation of the principle of freedom of association, the Committee requests the Government to take measures to ensure that such acts are not repeated in the future and to guarantee the rights of the legitimate executive board.(d) Noting that the administrative authorities confirmed in  the extension of the collective agreement in force, the Committee requests the Government to ensure that the company FERTICA SA honours that collective agreement.(e) With regard to the allegations concerning: prohibition of entry by ATFe union officials into the premises of the company, and the prohibition from holding demonstrations, meetings and assemblies in the usual places; the dismissals alleged to have occurred in FERTICA SA on grounds of social and economic dispute despite the existence of a judicial order that such dismissals should not take place; promoting of the constitution of the SITRAFER trade union organization in FERTICA SA; the disappearance of the pension that had been established by the collective agreement and which was the property of the workers, the Committee requests the Government to take the measures necessary to conduct detailed investigations without delay into all the allegations and to ensure that the judicial orders stating that dismissals in FERTICA SA should not take place are respected and to keep it informed of the result of those investigations.",1,1998,Costa Rica
106,".The complaint is presented in a communication from the National Medical Union (UMN) dated  September . The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  January .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  September , the National Medical Union (UMN) alleges that Dr. Rafael Rojas Rmolo, a member of the UMN board, has been subjected to retaliatory measures and anti-union persecution. More specifically, the complainant organization alleges that the Executive Committee of the Costa Rican Social Security Fund ordered an investigation so that the union authorization enjoyed by Dr. Rojas Rmolo since  by virtue of section  of the ""conciliation arrangement"" between the National Medical Union and the Costa Rican Social Security Fund be revoked. Dr. Rojas Rmolo is expected to return the salary he was paid during the period that the Fund granted him the authorization.
.In its communication dated  January  the Government categorically denies any retaliatory action having been taken against Dr. Rafael Rojas Rmolo. The Government explains that the Internal Audit of the Costa Rican Social Security Fund, a body accountable to the office of the General Treasury Inspector of the Republic, had discovered that an authorization including wage entitlements had been irregularly granted to Dr. Rojas Rmolo (this point came out during the interpretation of a Constitutional Chamber judgement relating to arbitral awards in the public sector) and had made the corresponding recommendations to rectify the situation. The administrative investigation resulted in a favourable decision for Dr. Rojas Rmolo which demonstrates, once again, the absolute transparency of the procedure and utmost respect for national procedures and legislation. A resolution dated  October , issued by the Executive Committee of the Costa Rican Social Security Fund, ordered that the administrative record of Dr. Rojas Rmolo's case be filed, since it was concluded that he had not acted in bad faith. As clearly proven, there is not and has not been any anti-union persecution against Dr. Rojas Rmolo, nor was the authorization granted revoked, nor were proceedings instituted for him to return the monies received during the validity of the authorization.
.The Government regrets that the complainant organization lodged an appeal with the Committee on Freedom of Association, prior even to the administrative procedure being concluded and its result known.
.The Committee notes that the administrative record relating to the trade union leader Mr. Rafael Rojas Rmolo has been filed, and that his union authorization was not revoked and proceedings were not instituted for him to return the monies received during the validity of said authorization.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.",0,1996,Costa Rica
107,".The complaint in this case is contained in a communication from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) dated  April . The Government sent its observations in communications dated  August and  September .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Workers Representatives Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  April , the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) expressed deep concern that trade unions in the private sector are in a sensitive and difficult situation, as their members have been the target of a policy of reprisals on the part of employers, aimed at destroying the trade union movement in the private sector.
.The ICFTU states that on  November , the members of the Association of Workers of the Fertilizer Sector (ATFE) started a strike at Fertilizantes de Centroamrica SA (FERTICA), a company located in Puntarenas which manufactures fertilizers and has recently been privatized. The strike was prompted by FERTICA's anti-union attitude: it had violated the collective agreement and refused to recognize the ATFE, replacing it with a local solidarist association which was under its control, and dismissed the members and officers of the ATFE. The ICFTU also alleges unfair working practices by FERTICA, including the hiring of new workers at a lower wage and on less favourable health and safety conditions, and the imposition of an excessively heavy workload. These violations of the law and workers rights were duly noted by Ministry of Labour inspectors who were called in specially to investigate the case. But despite the inspectors' report, nothing will be achieved in the short term since legal proceedings are notoriously slow in the Costa Rican legal system, which means that the workers and the organizations which represent them are entirely without protection (the ICFTU attaches the inspectors' report).
.The ICFTU also alleges that a riot squad was sent to break up a peaceful demonstration that the workers had been staging outside FERTICA premises since  September .
.In conclusion, the ICFTU states that FERTICA's refusal to negotiate with the union and its use of legal subterfuge to prevent the dispute from being settled, together with the complicitous and tolerant attitude of the government authorities, are a foretaste of what awaits trade union organizations in public enterprises destined for privatization.
.In its communications of  August and  September , the Government states that, in , FERTICA underwent a process of change and reorganization as a result of privatization. The restructuring of its manufacturing sector caused a labour dispute and the Ministry of Labour and Social Security was called in in an attempt to restore calm and initiate dialogue. Notwithstanding the national legislation, in keeping with the ILO Conventions on freedom of association ratified by Costa Rica (i.e. Conventions Nos. ,  and ), bans any acts or omissions which tend to avoid, restrict, constrain or prevent the free exercise of the collective rights of workers, their unions or associations of workers.
.With regard to the alleged anti-union dismissal by FERTICA of several workers' representatives, and its anti-union acts and violation of the collective agreement, the Government states that the Ministry of Labour and Social Security has been keeping matters under close examination in order to remedy these breaches of the law, and has started the necessary legal proceedings in order to maintain the rule of law and ensure that the rules of due process are applied throughout, including in any interlocutory actions or appeals brought by the parties - which are often used as legal tools for delaying a final decision.
.In August, September and October of , ATFE officials submitted complaints to the National Labour Inspection Directorate, accusing FERTICA of violating ILO Conventions Nos.  and  and the collective agreement (virtually in its entirety), and of unfair practices and trade union persecution.
.In order to expedite processing of the ATFE's three complaints, the National Labour Inspection Directorate ordered two inspectors to investigate the matters jointly. On  November  the inspectors submitted their report (a copy is enclosed) in which they concluded that it appeared to them that FERTICA had ""arbitrarily nullified the collective agreement in its entirety, thereby violating section  et seq. of the Labour Code and Article  of the Political Constitution. Similarly, there was sufficient evidence to ascertain anti-union acts and trade union persecution and unfair practices against the Association of Workers in the Fertilizer Sector, known as the ATFE, in breach of section  et seq. of the Labour Code, Article  of the Political Constitution, and ILO Conventions Nos.  and . We therefore request that a summons be issued in accordance with the law"". With regard to the allegation of trade union persecution and unfair practices, their report indicates that the inspectors in charge of the investigation found that, on  September , FERTICA dismissed all its workers,  of whom were members of the ATFE, thus totally destroying stability of employment of organized labour. The report also indicates that on  September  FERTICA dismissed the ATFE executive, in breach of the procedure established in article  of the collective agreement, national standards on the protection of trade union representatives laid down in section  et seq. of the Labour Code and ILO Conventions Nos.  and . According to the report, as from  September  FERTICA stopped applying the collective agreement in its entirety, in breach of the legislation governing labour relations. From the same date, all works committees established by the collective agreement were made inoperative and all workers' rights and guarantees, including trade union immunity were abolished.
.The Government adds that on  December  the parties were summoned to a hearing in accordance with section  of the Labour Code. The hearing was set for  December , but did not take place until  December , having been postponed at the request of the employer's representative. At the hearing, the latter halted the proceedings by challenging the locus standi of the trade union leader Mr. Indalecio Ordoez Calvo (author of one of the complaints) as representative of the members of the organization that had submitted the complaint. By a decision of  January , the office of the Minister revoked the decision of the National Labour Inspection Directorate and allowed the employer's claim.
.In accordance with the Minister's decision, the National Labour Inspection Directorate summoned the parties to a hearing, which was set for  January . The hearing was held on that date, but was attended only by the workers' counsel, since FERTICA's head office had refused receipt of the summons. The outcome of the hearing is perfectly plain from the decision issued by the National Labour Inspection Directorate on  January , which confirms the conclusions of the investigating inspectors in their report of  November .
.One of the facts established in that decision is that FERTICA has not applied the collective agreement it concluded with the ATFE since  September , although it is valid until  September . On  September , FERTICA dismissed all workers having paid them their entitlements, including  members of the ATFE. The decision also states that the trade union leaders Indalecio Ordoez Calvo and Marco Antonio Guzmn Rodrguez have not received their pay since  September , in breach of article  of the collective agreement; and with regard to the dismissal of members of the ATFE executive, FERTICA has violated article  of the collective agreement. The National Labour Inspection Directorate therefore allowed the ATFE's complaints of violation of the collective agreement, unfair labour practices and trade union persecution by FERTICA. Furthermore, the parties were informed that, once the decision of  January  is confirmed, the requisite complaint will be filed with the proper jurisdictional authority.
.With regard to this last administrative decision, it should be noted that the complainant organization, in objecting to procedural delays, makes a number of subjective and hasty observations which are misleading for the ILO. In this connection, the Government points out that on  February , FERTICA applied to have the decision of  January  revoked or, failing that, reviewed. By a decision of  March , the National Labour Inspection Directorate dismissed the application for revocation and the other applications filed by FERTICA's representative.
.It is important to point out at this juncture that, in a telegram of  March , the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice asked the office of the Minister to forward as soon as possible the original file pertaining to the administrative proceedings, which contained FERTICA's application for a review of the decisions of the National Labour Inspection Directorate. It needed the file to examine a claim of unconstitutionality filed by FERTICA SA. The Constitutional Chamber returned the original file under cover of an official letter of  June  which also notified ruling N-- dismissing FERTICA's claim of unconstitutionality on the merits. As",0,1996,Costa Rica
108,"soon as the file was returned by the Constitutional Chamber in June , the Minister of Labour gave priority to dealing with the appeal against the administrative decision of  January . This shows that any allegation of delays on the Ministry's part is unjust, hasty and unfounded. The Ministry gave its decision on  July : it dismissed the appeal and hence the claim for the quashing of the administrative decisions of  January and  March , and the impugnment of the locus standi of the workers' representative; it also stated that the administrative means of redress had been exhausted. In addition, the National Labour Inspection Directorate was ordered to lodge a complaint without delay with the appropriate jurisdictional authority, in accordance with section  et seq. of the Labour Code, seeking the sanctions provided for in the existing labour legislation, without prejudice to any other measures which might be ordered. The actual claims were that the Mayor or Labour Judge, as the case may be, should order restitution of the rights which had been violated and compensation for the injury caused to the workers, in accordance with section  of the Labour Code. There was also an express claim for the immediate reinstatement of the workers affected and to payment of the arrears of their wages. The Government sends a copy of the complaint of  August  seeking sanctions against FERTICA.
.The Government stresses that the Ministry of Labour and Social Security conducted the proceedings in accordance with the law, and regrets that the matter has been taken to an international body without all national remedies having been exhausted, with the result that the matter is being dealt with on two fronts simultaneously. This is clearly a result of hastiness and ignorance of the fact that the rule of law prevails in the country. It also reflects a disregard for the truth which leaves the country defenceless, particularly bearing in mind that not only did the National Labour Inspection Directorate intervene to settle the dispute, but so did the Labour Relations Department of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, which attended various hearings to clarify matters related to the complaint submitted to the ILO.
.In view of all the foregoing, the Government seeks the dismissal of the complaint in its entirety.
.The Committee observes that in this case the complainant organization and the Ministry of Labour authorities basically agree (according to the indications in the Government's reply) as to the existence of anti-union acts on the part of the enterprise FERTICA SA (dismissal of officials and members of the Association of Workers of FERTICA SA, and violation of the collective agreement in its entirety). In this context the Committee notes that following a report from the labour inspectorate noting these abuses, committed in September , the Ministry of Labour initiated legal proceedings with a view to penalizing FERTICA and providing compensation for the injury caused, in particular by the immediate reinstatement of the workers affected and payment of the arrears of their wages and, in general, restitution of the rights which had been violated. The Committee regrets that, according to the labour inspectors' report, FERTICA engaged in unfair practices (arbitrary annulment of the collective agreement in its entirety and anti-trade union acts and trade union persecution in the form of dismissal of the executive and  members of the AFTE). The Committee also regrets that, following the dismissal of the trade unionists, the firm allegedly hired new workers.
.With regard to the alleged delaying of the conclusion of the proceedings, the Committee notes the Government's statements concerning the need to ensure that the rules of due process were applied throughout, including in the various interlocutory actions and appeals brought by FERTICA in the administrative proceedings and in its complaint of unconstitutionality (which was dismissed). The Committee observes that, according to the indications in the labour inspectors' report, FERTICA's violations of the law occurred on  September  and the above report is dated  November . The Committee also observes that the administrative and legal actions brought by FERTICA meant that the Government was unable to go to the judicial authority before the end of August  in order to obtain the penalties and compensation provided for in the legislation. The Committee notes that  months had passed by between the anti-union acts alleged by the complainant (September ) and the Ministry's judicial application for sanctions against the enterprise and compensation (end of August ).
.The Committee observes that the judicial authority has still not expedited the application for sanctions and the restitution of the rights which have been violated which is not satisfactory if one takes account of the length of time that trade union leaders and members have to wait before their rights are restored. In this connection, the Committee wishes to recall that ""cases concerning anti-union discrimination contrary to Convention No.  should be examined rapidly, so that the necessary remedies can be really effective. An excessive delay in processing cases of anti-union discrimination, and in particular a lengthy delay in concluding the proceedings concerning the reinstatement of the trade union leaders dismissed by the enterprise, constitutes a denial of justice and therefore a denial of the trade union rights of the persons concerned"" (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Committee on Freedom of Association, th (revised) edition, , para. ). The Committee expresses its concern at the slowness and the lack of efficiency of the procedures in a considerable number of cases and requests the Government to take measures to ensure that the procedures are carried out rapidly.
.In this case, bearing in mind the evidence of anti-union acts noted by the labour inspectors, their serious consequences for the trade union and its members, the time that has elapsed since the violations of trade union rights, and the delay that may still occur in the legal proceedings (possible appeals or further interlocutory actions), the Committee asks the Government to take further steps with a view to mediating between the parties so that the dispute between the AFTE and the FERTICA enterprise may be settled promptly through negotiations and taking fully into account the provisions of Conventions Nos.  and  ratified by Costa Rica. In particular, the Committee asks that all those who were dismissed on grounds of their trade union office or membership be reinstated in their jobs, and that the collective agreement be observed.
.Lastly, the Committee regrets that the Government has not answered the allegation that a riot squad was sent to break up a peaceful demonstration that the workers had been conducting outside the FERTICA premises since  September . In this context, the Committee points out to the Government that ""taking part in picketing and firmly but peacefully inciting other workers to keep away from their workplace cannot be considered unlawful. However, when picketing is accompanied by violence or coercion of non-strikers in an attempt to interfere with their freedom to work; such acts constitute criminal offences in many countries"" (see Digest, op. cit., para. ). The Committee asks the Government to ensure that in future this principle is observed.
.In light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee asks the Government to take further steps with a view to mediating between the parties so that the dispute between the AFTE and the FERTICA enterprise may be settled promptly through negotiations and taking fully into account the provisions of Conventions Nos.  and  ratified by Costa Rica. In particular, the Committee asks that all those who were dismissed on grounds of their trade union office or membership be reinstated in their jobs and that the collective agreement be observed.(b) The Committee expresses its concern at the slowness and lack of efficiency of the procedures concerning anti-union discrimination in a considerable number of cases and requests the Government to take measures to ensure that these procedures are carried out rapidly.(c) The Committee asks the Government to ensure observance, in future, of the principle that ""taking part in picketing and firmly but peacefully inciting other workers to keep away from their workplace cannot be considered unlawful. However, when picketing is accompanied by violence or coercion of non-strikers in an attempt to interfere with their freedom to work; such acts constitute criminal offences in many countries.""",1,1996,Costa Rica
109,".At its March  meeting the Committee made the following recommendation regarding the pending allegations of anti-union discrimination (see the Committee's th Report, para. ): ""The Committee requests the Government to take measures to facilitate the reinstatement in their jobs of the largest possible number of dismissed UNEIDA executive board members.""
.In its communications of  August and  September , the Government refers to the considerable efforts which it has made to comply with the Committee's recommendations, and indicates that the case is currently being heard by the courts of second instance, where the complainant must present its observations and objections at the appropriate time and in the appropriate form.
.The Government attaches documents indicating that the executive of the IDA as a gesture of good faith ordered the provisional reinstatement of four of the dismissed union leaders; five other union officials are still awaiting a decision.
.The Committee notes this information with interest, while recalling that the dismissals of the union leaders date from  and occurred in an autonomous state establishment. The Committee requests the Government to take measures that will bring about a rapid solution to the dismissals that are still pending, taking into account the favourable rulings already handed down in the lower court.
.The Committee examined this case at its November  meeting and presented an interim report to the Governing Body (see th Report of the Committee, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November )). The Government sent new observations in a communication dated  January . The Agrarian Development Institute Employees' Union (UNEIDA) (the organization concerned in the allegations of this case) sent information in a communication dated  January  and the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) transmitted information in a communication dated  February .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) as well as the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.With respect to the dismissal of trade union officers and representatives of the Agrarian Development Institute Employees' Union, the Committee notes the Government's reaffirmation that: () the terminations of employment were not carried out on the basis of the trade union status of the persons concerned but were instead due to the process of restructuring and structural and operative modernization of the IDA, and were in keeping with technical criteria duly approved by the Ministry of National Planning and Economic Policy; () the highest judicial body, the Constitutional Chamber, rejected on their merits the appeals lodged by the officials involved who alleged anti-union persecution, and ruled that the action taken by the administration was in conformity with the law. The Committee also observes that according to the information supplied by the Government  officials were dismissed (eight of whom were trade union officers) of a total of  (of which  were trade union officers belonging to the executive committees of UNEIDA and two other unions).
.On the other hand, the Committee notes that, according to UNEIDA and CLAT, the number of workers before and after the restructuring (without taking into account - as the Government did - the officials classified as ""day workers"" and those in ""special services"") were  and  respectively. According to UNEIDA and CLAT (which refer only to UNEIDA and not to the other two unions at IDA),  trade union officers and representatives were dismissed out of a total of ; of these , nine were on the executive committee which had a total of  members.
.On the basis of all the information, the Committee considers that the overall proportion of trade union officers of executive committees dismissed does not seem disproportionate from a numerical point of view taking into account the total number of workers affected by the restructuring process. Nevertheless, comparing the list of members () of the executive board furnished by UNEIDA with the names of the eight trade union officers who, according to the Government, were dismissed, it appears that seven out of the eight officers dismissed were members of the UNEIDA executive board. In the opinion of the Committee, an analysis of the facts tends to demonstrate that the UNEIDA leaders did not benefit from sufficient protection as trade union leaders.
.Consequently, the Committee requests the Government to take measures to facilitate the reinstatement in their jobs of the largest possible number of dismissed UNEIDA executive board members.
.As concerns the transfer of trade union officers Mr. Mario Moya Benavides and Ms. Iriabel Zumbado, the Committee notes the Government's comments with interest, and also notes that, in accordance with the Committee's request and in order to improve the industrial relations climate, the transfers of the officers mentioned have been annulled.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee requests the Government to take measures to facilitate the reinstatement in their jobs of the largest possible number of dismissed UNEIDA executive board members.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) dated  March . The CLAT sent additional information in a communication dated  May . The Government replied in a communication dated  July .
.Costa Rica has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communications dated  March and  May , the CLAT alleges that in the context of the restructuring of the public administration, tens of workers and a large number of trade union officers, in particular those of the Agrarian Development Institute Employees' Union (UNEIDA), have been dismissed or subjected to measures impairing the exercise of freedom of association; specifically, the complainant referred to the following trade union members (nine officers of the Executive Committee of UNEIDA, other representatives and members):- Walter Quesada Fernandez, general secretary of UNEIDA, dismissed on  January ;- Iriabel Zumbado, assistant general secretary of UNEIDA, was virtually forced to take leave in December  and was subsequently informed that she had been transferred to the Chorotega region;- Elieth Mara Rodrguez, representative of the women's secretariat of UNEIDA, was told to resign and was dismissed on  January ;- Walter Arturo Porras Campos, treasurer and disputes secretary of UNEIDA, was investigated by the auditor of the Agrarian Development Institute (IDA) for allegedly altering invoices; he was later forced to go on leave and received notification of his dismissal on  January ;- Jeannette Mac Quiddy Artavia, secretary of the minutes of UNEIDA, received her notification of dismissal on  January . She operated the IDA radio and enabled trade union messages to be transmitted;- Jos Fausto Osorno, secretary for regional affairs for UNEIDA, was notified of his dismissal on  January  while he was on leave;- Oscar Campos Hidalgo, representative of the Committee for Labour Affairs, Classification and Job Regrading of UNEIDA, was dismissed on  February ;- Mario Moya Benavides, a substitute officer, was unilaterally transferred to the rural development programme;- Alexis Cyrman Snchez, general secretary for regional affairs; Luis Fernando Araya Benavides, press secretary; Jos Francisco Molina Rojas, finance secretary; Dennis Castelln Toval, substitute officer; Patricia Viales Ortega, UNEIDA representative in the Chorotega region; Ivonne Segura Esquivel, UNEIDA representative in the central Turrialba region, and Marco Antonio Aguilar Vargas, UNEIDA representative in the Chorotega region, were also dismissed as of  January .
.The complainant adds that these measures were aimed at undermining the trade union, obstructing its work and consequently preventing the trade union from being involved in the restructuring process of the IDA. It should also be pointed out that the Board of Directors of the IDA did not take account of trade union immunity, the performance of these workers in their respective jobs or their seniority, and no final decision has been taken yet on the complaints presented.
.In its communication of  July , the Government states that, by agreement reached by the Board of Directors of the Agrarian Development Institute (IDA), a project for the structural and operational modernization of the IDA was approved on  October .
.The modernization of the IDA was dictated by the historical need for an instrument ensuring efficient and effective management for the benefit of the Costa Rican farmer. It is essential to point out that consultations were held concerning the approval of this project with associations of farmers involved in Costa Rican agriculture and trade unions, when the observations of the labour committees set up under the agreement signed on  April  were incorporated. As regards the termination of the employment relationship of the staff, included in the modernization project, this was based on technical grounds which had been duly approved by the Ministry of National Planning and Economic Policy.
.As regards the termination of employment of certain trade union officers included in the above-mentioned project, it is essential to point out that this did not take account of their trade union office; account was",1,1996,Costa Rica
110,"only taken of their status as officials of the IDA and the above-mentioned technical grounds; the IDA respected their right to be defended.
.It should be pointed out that in a letter dated  January , Mr. Walter Quesada Fernndez, general secretary of the IDA Employees' Union - UNEIDA, Elieth Mara Rodrguez, Jeannette Mac Quiddy Artavia, Walter Arturo Porras Campos, Jos Francisco Molina Rojas and Jos Fausto Osorno lodged an appeal for the protection of their constitutional rights (recurso de amparo) with the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice, objecting to the termination of their employment. In their appeal they alleged that there had been a violation of the legal provisions concerning freedom of association and trade union immunity and of ILO Conventions Nos.  and .
.The appellants alleged that in their capacity as trade union officers protected by legislation, they could not be included in the plan to modernize the institution, and that the action taken by the administration constituted anti-union persecution and denial of the right to a defence and due process. The Constitutional Chamber (the highest jurisdictional body), in Decision No. - of  January , rejected on its merits the appeal that had been lodged by the above-mentioned officials and ruled that the action taken by the administration was in conformity with the law. Clearly, in including trade union officers in the modernization process, the administration acted in conformity with the Political Constitution and international conventions, and the administrative measure does not constitute anti-union persecution.
.Similarly, in Decisions Nos. - and - handed down on  January , the Constitutional Chamber rejected on their merits appeals that had been lodged by officials included in the modernization plan.
.Notwithstanding the decisions handed down by the Constitutional Chamber, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security showed its willingness to enter into dialogue by acting as mediator and holding three meetings with representatives of the Federation of Public Service Workers. These meetings were attended by representatives of the different trade unions of the Institute, who drafted a list of demands to be presented to the Board of Directors of the Institute. In a definitive agreement dated  January , the Board of Directors stipulated that in accordance with the legislation in force, the demand made by the trade unions concerning the annulment of dismissals, compensatory alternatives and other incentives provided for in voluntary labour mobility procedures were not appropriate under the applicable legislation.
.The modernization process had been approved in accordance with the Constitution and the law, and to accept the demand would make it impossible to achieve the structural and operational modernization of the Institute, to the detriment of the service provided to the Costa Rican farmer, and would clearly impair the public service provided, since the efficiency and effectiveness of the administration would be affected.
.The Government concludes that there is no doubt that the allegations of anti-union persecution set forth in the complaint are rash accusations, since, as has been demonstrated, the goals of the plan to modernize the IDA never included staff reductions based on trade union membership, only on technical and objective grounds, all of which are supported by the legal framework in force.
.The Committee observes that in this case the complainant organization has alleged that officers and members of the Agrarian Development Institute Employees' Union (UNEIDA) were dismissed or transferred with the aim of undermining this trade union and preventing it from participating in the restructuring process of the Agrarian Development Institute (IDA).
.The Committee also observes that the Government emphasizes that () the terminations did not take account of the trade union membership of the persons concerned, but were part of a process of restructuring and structural and operational modernization of the IDA and were based on technical grounds which had been duly approved by the Ministry of National Planning and Economic Policy; () mediation by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security did not result in the IDA authorities' annulling the dismissals; () the highest jurisdictional body, the Constitutional Chamber, rejected on their merits the appeals lodged by the officials concerned, who had alleged anti-union persecution, and ruled that the action taken by the administration had been in conformity with the law.
.On previous occasions, the Committee has considered that it ""can examine allegations concerning economic rationalization programmes and restructuring processes, whether or not they imply redundancies or the transfer of enterprises or services from the public to the private sector, only in so far as they might have given rise to acts of discrimination or interference against trade unions"" (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th (revised) edition, , para. ). In this respect, although the Committee observes that the Constitutional Chamber rejected the allegations of anti-union persecution put forward by the officers and members of the trade union, it cannot but note that, according to the allegations of the complainant organization - which were not denied by the Government - the restructuring process resulted in the dismissal of nine officers on the executive committee of UNEIDA and several other representatives. The Committee notes that the complainant and the Government do not agree as to the anti-union nature of the dismissals. The Committee also emphasizes the advisability of giving priority to workers' representatives with regard to their retention in employment in case of reduction of the workforce, to ensure their effective protection (Digest, op. cit., para. ).
.In these circumstances, prior to reaching definitive conclusions, the Committee requests the Government and the complainant organization to indicate the total number of workers at the Agrarian Development Institute before and after the restructuring process, the number of trade union officers and representatives dismissed and the number of trade union officers and representatives prior to the restructuring process. In any event, the Committee requests the Government to respect the principles mentioned above and to investigate whether the dismissal of the UNEIDA officers and representatives in the context of the restructuring process was due to their trade union activities, in which case, they should be reinstated in their posts. Furthermore, the Committee requests the Government to review the transfers of Mr. Mario Moya Benavides and Ms. Iriabel Zumbado. The Committee requests the Government to provide information on the measures taken in this respect.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government and the complainant organization to indicate the total number of workers at the Agrarian Development Institute before and after the restructuring process, the number of trade union officers and representatives dismissed and the number of trade union officers and representatives prior to the restructuring process.(b) In any event, the Committee requests the Government to respect the principles mentioned in the conclusions and to investigate whether the dismissal of the UNEIDA officers and representatives in the context of the restructuring process was due to their trade union activities, in which case, they should be reinstated in their posts.(c) The Committee requests the Government to review the transfers of Mr. Mario Moya Benavides and Ms. Iriabel Zumbado.(d) The Committee requests the Government to provide information on the measures taken in this respect.",1,1996,Costa Rica
111,".The complaint in this case is contained in a joint communication from the National Service of Underground Waters, Irrigation and Drainage Professional Employees' Association (ASES) and the Costa Rican Workers' Movement (MTC), dated  January . The ASES subsequently sent additional information in a communication dated  January . The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  July and  October .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communications of  and  January , the SENARA Professional Employees' Association (ASES) and the Costa Rican Workers' Movement (MTC) allege that the SENARA dismissed  workers, including Miguel Cspedes Araya, the Association's general secretary, Greivin Madrigal Chavarra, recording and correspondence secretary, and recently Ana Njera Herrera, ex-secretary-general and active militant.
.The complainants add that the Ministry of Labour and the parties concerned agreed to the setting up of a tripartite committee to examine whether the dismissal of the first  persons was legally justified and the possible reinstatement of the workers entitled to be reinstated. The complainants add that although in October  this committee considered unjustified the dismissal of the trade union officials, Mr. Cspedes and Mr. Madrigal, the Government did not act upon this decision.
.In its communication of  June , the Government states that in accordance with national legislation and ILO Conventions Nos. ,  and , ratified by Costa Rica, any actions or oversights tending to avoid, limit, restrict or prevent in any way the free exercise of the collective rights of workers, their trade unions or workers' associations, are prohibited. The National Board of the Labour Inspectorate is the technical body officially delegated by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security to inquire into, by any means it considers necessary, infringements of legislation in connection with unfair labour practices of which it is aware. It is important to note that the ASES did not submit any complaint whatsoever to the above-mentioned board on the grounds of trade union persecution or unfair labour practices. The Government regrets that this organization appealed to the ILO without first having exhausted all the mechanisms of inquiry and settlement guaranteed by the national legal system in the event of cases such as that submitted by the complainants. This bears witness to a flagrant temerity on the part of the complainant organizations as well as an ignorance of the state of law prevailing in Costa Rica.
.Concerning the alleged dismissals carried out by the SENARA, including two trade union officials, the Government of Costa Rica points out that the Ministry of Labour, through the General Board of Labour Affairs, convened on numerous occasions SENARA representatives and workers from this organization with a view to examining the dismissals of several workers at this workplace. After a number of ministerial initiatives and meetings, a meeting was held on  August  in the office of the Minister of Agriculture and Livestock attended by representatives of this ministry, SENARA, ASES-MTC and the Ministry of Labour and Social Security; on this occasion, they agreed to set up a committee to look into the termination of contracts of a group of workers. On  October , the Department of Labour Relations issued its opinion on the complaint submitted by ASES alleging infringements of labour legislation and arbitrary dismissals by the employers. It is relevant to note in this paragraph that in accordance with the legal system in force, the Department of Labour Relations' role in cases of this nature is to try to prevent the development of disputes between employers and workers or to reach an out-of-court agreement, if these have already occurred, at the request of any of the parties concerned; and it was within this mandate that the Department intervened. It thus summoned the parties to hear their case and propose possible means of settlement, in accordance with the labour legislation. However, the proposals put forward by departments of this type are not of a binding nature, unlike those specifically stipulated by law - such as those issued by the Attorney-General of the Republic.
.For this reason, it is important to reproduce in full the reply to the hearing granted by the Ministry of Labour to the SENARA, pursuant to the complaint in question and in order not to undermine the right of hearing and legitimate defence:
.SENARA is an organization which respects of the free exercise of trade union rights and it has never, throughout its history, been subjected to any proceedings which questioned matters of this nature; neither has it ever been penalized for such facts.
.To meet a number of temporary needs occasioned by the implementation of the second stage of the Arenal-Tempisque irrigation project, SENARA was obliged to recruit officials in various branches of activity in addition to its permanent staff. Once the needs of this project were over, the contracts of the temporary staff in question came to an end.
.The former officials, Miguel Cspedes Araya, Greivin Madrigal Chavarra and Parmnides Furcal Beriguete, were never members of the SENARA permanent staff. They belonged to a group of employees recruited on a temporary basis as part of the special services. Their employment relationship terminated when their temporary contracts came to an end, as indicated in the documents issued by the Department of Human Resources of this institution which are enclosed herewith.
.The fact that amongst the group of temporary workers there were employees belonging to a trade union was in no way linked to the termination of their contracts and the claim made by the trade union sector that the tacit grounds for their dismissal was their involvement in trade union activities, hoping in this way to obtain benefit not due to them, is devoid of any substance. At the time the labour contracts were terminated, there was no dispute of a trade union nature that SENARA might settle or try to settle by unlawfully dismissing trade union officials; in these circumstances, this would have been as absurd as providing medicine to someone who was not sick.
.The burden of proof in this case lies with those who claim that the tacit grounds for terminating the labour contracts in question was the exercise of trade union rights and activities of the former officials.
.In August  a committee was set up by this ministry to analyse the termination of the labour contracts of the complainants. The following resulted from the work of this committee:(a) the committee was set up with a view to analyse the actual occurrences and to determine if there had been infringements of trade union rights;(b) within the committee, the trade union sector requested that the work should confine itself specifically to the reinstatement of six former officials. The employer was in agreement to discuss this subject pointing out specifically that:- in the case of officials with temporary posts, their reinstatement would involve the creation of permanent posts which was not within the competence of the commission but that of the Budgetary Authority;- in addition to the above-mentioned consideration, there would have to be a technical examination of each case to determine, in the light of the institution's needs, whether the creation of these posts was justified;- any decision taken would require the necessary funding and comply with the standards in force regulating this area;all the above was put down in writing before the final decision and contained in the respective file;(c) at the request of the trade union sector the committee did not discuss or examine evidence on the legal or financial aspects. The examination was restricted to the technical aspect of the case;(d) as might reasonably have been expected, the positions of SENARA and the trade union sector were opposed and the Ministry of Labour's opinion was awaited to settle the dispute;(e) we were surprised by the fact that the opinion finally put forward by the Ministry of Labour referred to freedom of association; although this had been vaguely referred to by the trade unionists, this aspect was not examined within the committee and no proof was furnished in relation to this subject. Our attention was also drawn to the fact that the ministry did not merely put forward an opinion but unilaterally decided on measures to implement a decision taken which was outside the competence and scope of the committee, such as the reinstatement of two officials, thus making this decision null and void;(f) SENARA subsequently requested the opinion of the budgetary authority which considered, in the same way as SENARA, that the termination of the labour contracts was in no way related to the freedom of association of the ex-officials in question and that their reinstatement would not be in line with our legislation in force.
.The Government adds that the role of the Labour Relations Department is that of an ""arbitrator"", unless the parties to the dispute agree that the final decision should be of a binding nature, which was not the case in this particular",0,1996,Costa Rica
112,"instance. On the contrary, the complainant organizations did not, in this particular case, as stated at the beginning, exhaust all the proceedings of the National Board of the Labour Inspectorate. This body is legally entitled, once the existence of unfair labour practices has been ascertained, to initiate legal proceedings with a view to safeguarding rights protected by law and to request penalties provided for under the labour legislation in force, irrespective of any other legal measures that might be taken.
.As regards the ruling handed down by the Budgetary Authority, dated  January , this upheld SENARA's arguments that the workers Miguel Cspedes Araya and Greivin Madrigal Chavarra were not permanent members of staff but employed on a temporary basis and that they were perfectly aware of the fact that they were recruited on a fixed-term contract. It confirmed that the termination of the employment relationship of the above-mentioned former officials was consistent with the period of time for which they were appointed and did not constitute an infringement of freedom of association on the part of SENARA.
.For the above reasons, the Government is of the opinion that the complainants, in this particular case, are clearly unaware of the national mechanisms for settling disputes, both administrative and legal, provided for in the present legal system. It is therefore totally unfounded to condemn the Government for an alleged cause of action which, up to now, has not been a subject of complaint brought before the competent administrative and legal authorities. Furthermore, it has been clearly demonstrated that the Ministry of Labour and Social Security's action was in full conformity with the law and that it took the necessary steps to attempt to safeguard workers' rights. The Government believes that the complaint should be rejected.
.In its communication of  October , the Government stated that Mrs. Ana Njera Herrera, ex-secretary-general of the ASES did not complain to the officials of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, and regrets that ASES did not exhaust internal procedures before presenting this complaint. The Government attached a copy of the reply of the management of SENARA concerning her dismissal, which indicates that the employment relationship of Mrs. Ana Njera Herrera was based on a contract for a specific task and that hiring her corresponded to the needs of this task. The employment relationship with Mrs. Ana Njera Herrera was terminated upon the completion of the task, without any anti-union motive. Mrs. Ana Njera Herrera received the indemnity provided for by the law and has made no administrative complaint.
.The Committee notes that in this complaint the complainant organizations have alleged: () the termination of the labour relationship of  workers from SENARA, including the trade union officials Cspedes Araya and Madrigal Chavarra; and () the subsequent dismissal of the trade union militant and former secretary-general of the ASES, Mrs. Ana Njera Herrera
.The Committee notes that according to the documentation sent by the Government, the matter of the  dismissed workers was submitted to a tripartite committee which decided to concentrate on the cases of six persons. The Committee subsequently upheld the dismissals of four of these (votes of the Ministry of Labour and SENARA - Ministry of Agriculture) and decided to leave without effect the dismissals of Cspedes Araya and Madrigal Chavarra. The representative of the Ministry of Labour also considered that there were violations of freedom of association in these two cases.
.The Committee notes, however, that the ruling of the tripartite committee is not in line with that of the budgetary authorities who stated that Cspedes Araya and Madrigal Chavarra were temporary workers and that the termination of their employment relationship was in keeping with the period of time for which they were appointed and did not constitute an infringement of freedom of association. The SENARA institution justifies the termination of the temporary contracts of the two officials on the grounds that they had come to an end and that the project undertaken was gradually completed. SENARA denies having been prompted by anti-union feelings and points out that at the time of the events there was no dispute of a trade union nature. Finally, the Government seems to deny that the conclusions of the tripartite committee were of a binding nature and points out that those concerned did not make use of the administrative and judicial proceedings provided for under the legislation.
.Taking into account all the available facts and in particular the findings of the work of the tripartite committee and the considerable delay which would be incurred if proceedings were brought before the administrative and legal appeal authorities, the Committee requests the Government to take steps to encourage the reinstatement in their jobs of trade union officials, Cspedes Araya and Madrigal Chavarra.
.Finally, as concerns the allegation concerning the dismissal of the trade union activist and ex-secretary-general of ASES, Mrs. Ana Njera Herrera, the Committee notes that the employment relationship was based on a contract for a specific task and that this relationship was terminated upon the completion of this task. The Committee notes that the Government denies the existence of any anti-union motive and that it states that the person concerned did not complain to the competent authorities, but rather that she accepted the indemnity provided by the law.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee requests the Government to take steps to encourage the reinstatement of the trade union officials of ASES, Cspedes Araya and Madrigal Chavarra.",1,1996,Costa Rica
113,".The complaint in this case is contained in communications from the Association of Customs Officials (ASEPA) dated  September,  and  October . Subsequently, ASEPA sent additional information in a communication dated  November . The Government sent its observations in communications dated  February and  May .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communications dated  September,  and  October and  November , the Association of Customs Officials (ASEPA) alleged the following anti-union acts on the part of the administrative authorities:- trade union harassment through the putative restructuring of posts, in order to curtail the activities of the Centre for Customs Documentation and Information which is run by the General Secretary of ASEPA and which the union uses as its office;- the removal from their posts of  public officials in November ,  of whom were members of ASEPA (some of them trade union leaders), following an offer by the authorities to transfer them or to provide occupational training in how to set up small enterprises. The complainant organization reports that the public officials accepted the Government's offer;- the refusal to allow the union to join round-table negotiations. The complainant organization states that the administration invited trade union leaders to informal talks and information sessions on customs modernization, but only to let them know what had happened, not to ask them their opinion or give them the chance to make alternative proposals;- the persecution, obstruction and violation of the trade union autonomy (anti-union persecution) of ASEPA. In this regard, the complainant organization encloses the text of a notice which states that the judicial authorities ordered the State to pay damages in July  (the complainant organization does not, however, give details of the specific actions censured nor the persons affected);- anti-union acts against the General Secretary and members of the ASEPA leadership (although the complainant organization refers to a judicial ruling ordering the State to pay damages, it has not sent the text of the verdict nor specified the anti-union acts committed);- hold-ups in cases alleging anti-union acts brought before the courts by ASEPA (the complainant organization mentions three cases in which ""delaying tactics"" are thought to have been used);- the refusal by the authorities to sign an agreement on freedom of association which has taken three years to negotiate (the complainant organization points out that it has applied to the courts for the enforcement of its constitutional rights (recurso de amparo) in this regard);- the refusal to allow ASEPA use of an official vehicle round the clock (all governments have allowed ASEPA to use an official state vehicle since it was set up).
.In its communications dated  February and  May , the Government states that it is untrue and ill-considered to claim that anti-union harassment is being practised through the restructuring of posts and the consequent conversion of the office known as the Centre for Customs Documentation and Information. In this regard, consideration should be given to Decision No. - of the Constitutional Court concerning the application for the enforcement of constitutional rights (recurso de amparo) lodged by Mr. Lora Arias, General Secretary of ASEPA, which orders that Executive Decree No. -H- on the implementation of the regulations governing the organization, competence and functions of the National Customs Service, should remain in force to avoid further damage to national interests. It should be pointed out that the application was changed to a legal action to have the decision to restructure declared unconstitutional, which is being considered pending a decision on its admissibility. The Government also states that the union will continue to use the centre as its office, as was the rule till now.
.With regard to the allegation concerning the removal from office of  officials, including trade union leaders, the Government finds it ambiguous and inconsistent. Although the customs service was restructured, a much needed measure if it were to be modernized and provide a better service to the public, it should be pointed out that officials freely chose between being transferred to other institutions and being paid the benefits due to them. The Government states that it is not aware of any active trade union leader having been affected by the restructuring process, since that was never taken into account in determining which posts should remain or be abolished in the customs system. Furthermore, the complainant organization does not name any officials as having found themselves in this situation and its allegations are therefore groundless.
.The Government states that the complainant organization does not specify which round-table negotiations it is referring to. The Government points out that all workers, whether trade union leaders or not, are fully entitled to make serious proposals to the Ministry on any matter they feel has a bearing on their interests.
.With regard to the allegation concerning the anti-union persecution of ASEPA, the National Labour Inspection Directorate of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security found, in November , that the alleged activities had been proven and declared that ASEPA's allegation against the Customs Supervisory and Inspection Body was admissible. As a result, and in accordance with section  of the Act on constitutional jurisdiction, the application for the enforcement of constitutional rights (recurso de amparo) No. - was declared admissible in terms of compensation and costs, but the substance of the application was rejected because the complaint lodged by the appellant had already been dealt with and settled by the central administration. In this regard, it was proved that the officials responsible for the acts were the six people who worked at the Customs Supervisory and Inspection Body. The chief customs officer sent a report to the Office of the Minister of Finance, according to an official letter of  October , which was passed on to the personnel department, the competent body in disciplinary matters, so that it could take appropriate action. It should be pointed out that three of the officials no longer work for the public administration. As things stand, it is clear that from the outset the present administration has tried to establish responsibilities, although the alleged trade union persecution took place during the previous administration.
.With regard to the complainant's version of anti-union acts against the General Secretary and members of the ASEPA leadership, the Government explains that it is incorrect and states that, although the Constitutional Court did indeed declare that the application for amparo was admissible in part, it also noted that the acts that were limiting the right of assembly and of information had been discontinued and the workers' petitions had already been taken up by the central administration. The Government states that the person held responsible for those actions has resigned his post in the public administration. The Government enclosed with its reply a copy of the judicial notice stating that the General Secretary had been persecuted by his superior officer and that the judicial authorities have ordered the Customs Office to refrain from hindering the General Secretary and members of ASEPA from engaging in trade union activity and have ordered the State to pay damages. With regard to the alleged delays in the judicial procedures concerning anti-union acts, the Government has no evidence that this is true.
.With regard to the alleged refusal by the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Labour to sign an agreement on freedom of association, the complainant organization's statement is incorrect, is too subjective and fails to mention the fact that in a State governed by the rule of law the administration must act in accordance with the law (the principle of legality) and may act or provide public services only where so authorized. The Government enclosed with its reply a copy of the Ministry of Finance's answer to the application for the enforcement of constitutional rights (recurso de amparo) lodged by the complainant organization with the courts. The reply states, inter alia, that the matter is not being delayed and that all the documents have been studied and analysed pursuant to the provisions of the regulations on collective bargaining; with regard to the deadlock in procedures for subscription, it recalls that this is the fault of ASEPA since the agreement submitted to the Ministry does not fully conform to observations duly made by the Office of Legal Affairs of the Ministry of Labour.
.As regards the alleged refusal to allow ASEPA use of an official vehicle round the clock, the Government states that this allegation is incorrect and that the complainant organization has had access to state vehicles each time it has made a request and that it has always been granted the right to use them in order to carry out its activities. The Government also adds that the use of state vehicles is governed by traffic regulations which contain the relevant restrictions.
.The Committee notes that the allegations made in this case concern various anti-union acts on",0,1994,Costa Rica
114,"the part of the administrative authorities against the Association of Customs Officials (ASEPA); some of these acts took place during the restructuring process.
.With regard to the alleged trade union harassment of ASEPA on the basis of the putative restructuring of posts to curtail the activities of the Centre for Customs Documentation and Information (which is run by the ASEPA General Secretary and which the union uses as its office), the Committee notes that the Government denies the allegation. It further maintains that ASEPA continues to have the use of its office. In view of the contradiction between the allegations and the Government's reply, the Committee is not in a position to decide if there was an anti-union motive behind the restructuring in question. Nevertheless, noting that according to the Government a legal action to have the decision to restructure declared unconstitutional is currently before the courts, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the procedure. In any case, the Committee considers that, as far as possible, the union should not be prevented from having premises at the workplace.
.With regard to the removal from office of  officials in November  ( of whom, according to the complainant organization, were members of ASEPA, and some of whom were trade union leaders), the Committee notes that the Government states that the customs service was restructured and that this was a much needed measure if it were to be modernized; that the officials freely chose between a transfer to other institutions or the payment of the benefits due to them; that it has no evidence that any active trade union leader was affected by the restructuring process; and that the complainant organization has not provided any names in that regard.
.Although it notes that there are discrepancies between the statements made by the complainant organization and the Government as to whether restructuring affected ASEPA trade union leaders, the Committee observes that the complainant organization has not provided any leaders' names and that both the complainant organization and the Government acknowledge that the officials concerned accepted the offer made by the authorities. The Committee wishes to recall that on various occasions it has stated that ""under its mandate it is required to examine allegations concerning the violation of trade union rights, and therefore it can examine allegations concerning economic rationalization programmes and processes - whether or not they imply redundancies - only in so far as they might have given rise to acts of discrimination or interference against trade unions"". At any rate, the Committee cannot but regret the failure to consult or try to reach agreement with trade union organizations on the rationalization and staff-reduction processes (see st Report, Case No.  (Peru), paragraph , th Report, Case No.  (Peru), paragraph , and nd Report, Cases Nos.  and  (Colombia)). The Committee notes that the restructuring referred to by the complainant organization was of a global nature, affecting many workers, not just ASEPA members. However, it does not have enough information to determine whether the complainant organization was duly consulted. Therefore, the Committee emphasizes, in general, the importance of consulting the trade union organizations concerned whenever restructuring takes place.
.With regard to the general allegation - without further details - concerning anti-union acts against ASEPA, the Committee notes that the Government states that: () the National Labour Inspection Directorate of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security considered that the allegations had been proven and that the accusation made by ASEPA was admissible; () the central administration has taken up the matter; and () the personnel department of the Ministry of Finance has been requested to take the corresponding disciplinary measures (three of the officials responsible no longer work in the public administration). The Committee notes this information and the fact that the documentation sent by the complainant organization shows that the judicial authorities ordered the State to pay damages. The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that in future senior officials are instructed to refrain from hindering the trade union activities of officials in their departments.
.With regard to the allegation concerning anti-union acts against the General Secretary (harassment by his superior) and members of the ASEPA leadership, the Committee notes that the Government states that it has confirmed that the anti-union activities have been discontinued, that the workers' petitions have been duly received at the central administration and that the person responsible for the alleged acts has resigned his post.
.In this regard, the Committee notes that although the complainant organization does not specify the nature of the anti-union acts against the General Secretary and the ASEPA leaders, the Government does not deny that they took place, refers to actions against the rights of assembly and information and encloses a copy of a judicial notice acknowledging that the General Secretary had been persecuted by his superior and that the State had been ordered to pay damages. In the circumstances, while it notes that the Government affirms that the anti-union activities aimed at harassing trade union leaders have been discontinued, and that the person responsible no longer works in the public administration, the Committee emphasizes the principle that no one should be subjected to discrimination or prejudice with regard to employment because of his legitimate trade union activities or membership, and that the persons responsible for such acts should be punished. The Committee requests the Government to take measures to guarantee that this principle is respected in the future.
.With respect to the allegation that the authorities of the Ministry of Finance are refusing to sign an agreement on freedom of association, the Committee notes that both the complainant organization and the Government state that judicial recourse has been sought in the matter and that no ruling has been handed down as yet (the Government states, inter alia, that the agreement should be brought into line with legislation and that it does not conform to observations made by the Office of Legal Affairs of the Ministry of Labour). Given that there is no specific information in the complaint relating to this allegation, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the judicial proceedings so that it can consider the problems related to this matter.
.As regards the allegation concerning hold-ups and delaying tactics used in three of the court cases brought by ASEPA relating to anti-union acts, the Committee notes that the Government states that it has no evidence that this is true. While it observes that the complainant organization refers to three court cases in which it believes that ""delaying tactics"" have been used to influence the decision, the Committee notes that the complainant organization does not provide specific information on the extent of and reasons for any possible delays which would prove the allegations to the Committee.
.In respect of the alleged refusal to allow ASEPA to join ""round-table negotiations"" (according to the complainant organization, it is merely informed of the measures adopted by the authorities in terms of modernizing customs services, while its opinions or alternative proposals are disregarded), the Committee notes that the Government replies that the complainant organization has failed to specify which round-table negotiations it was not allowed to attend, and that it states that all workers are fully entitled to make serious and relevant proposals regarding their interests to the Ministry. In the circumstances, the Committee notes that the allegations are too vague and that, as it has pointed out previously, it does not have enough evidence to decide whether or not genuine consultations were held on the customs restructuring process. The Committee must therefore confine itself to emphasizing the importance it attaches to the promotion of dialogue and consultations on matters of mutual interest between the public authorities and the most representative occupational organizations of the sector involved (see th Report, Case No.  (Spain), para. ).
.With regard to the allegation concerning the refusal to allow ASEPA to use an official vehicle round the clock, as it had done before, the Committee takes note of the information provided by the Government and considers that the failure to authorize the use of a State vehicle does not in itself violate the principles of freedom of association.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) With regard to the allegation of trade union harassment against the ASEPA, in the form of the putative restructuring of posts in order to curtail the activities of the Centre for Customs Documentation and Information (which is run by the General Secretary of ASEPA and which the union uses as its office), the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the judicial proceedings under way on the matter. The Committee considers that, in any case, the trade union should not be prevented, as far as possible, from having premises at the workplace.(b) In respect of the allegation relating to anti-union acts against ASEPA, the Committee requests",1,1994,Costa Rica
115,"the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that in future senior officials are instructed to refrain from hindering the trade union activities of officials in their departments.(c) With regard to the allegations of anti-union acts against the General Secretary and other ASEPA leaders - which have been confirmed and punished by the courts - the Committee emphasizes the principle that no one should be subjected to discrimination or prejudice with regard to employment on the grounds of their legitimate trade union activities or membership, and that the persons responsible for such acts should be punished. The Committee requests the Government to take measures to guarantee respect for this principle in the future.(d) In respect of the allegation concerning the refusal by authorities in the Ministry of Finance to sign an agreement on freedom of association, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the judicial proceedings under way, so that it may examine the problems related to this matter.",1,1994,Costa Rica
116,".At its meeting in March , the Committee made the following recommendations on the pending allegations (see nd Report, para. ):- As regards the collective dispute in the LACSA enterprise (Case No. ), the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the appeal lodged by the representative of the Pilots' Association against the administrative resolution DRT-- and on the decision adopted by the National Labour Inspectorate Board on the complaint submitted by the Pilots' Association against LACSA for having violated the collective agreement.- As regards the collective dispute in Geest Caribbean Limited (Case No. ), the Committee:- - insists on the need that the agreement of  May , signed by the parties, be fully applied, including clause  concerning dismissals;- - requests the Government to ensure that trade union rights in the above-mentioned enterprise are fully respected, in particular protection against anti-union dismissals, the right of trade union officials to enter into contact with plantation workers with due respect for property rights and the guarantee that ""standing workers' committees"" (non-unionized) do not undermine the role of the representative trade unions in the enterprise. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the measures it takes in this respect and the outcome of the appeal lodged with the Constitutional Chamber against the administrative decision of  May ;- - requests the Government to keep it informed of the evolution of proceedings under way concerning the acts of violence which occurred in May  during the collective dispute in question, and to send it the text of the sentence handed down. The Committee insists that an investigation be undertaken on the allegations of acts of violence which were said to have been committed as much by the workers as by the police.
.In a detailed communication of  September , the Government indicated a number of steps which had been taken by the Ministry of Labour to resolve the dispute concerning the LACSA enterprise. The Government also mentioned the appeals and procedural tactics used by the parties which has delayed the outcome of the administrative procedure concerning the violation of the collective agreement, and which is still not over. As concerns the collective dispute at Geest Caribbean Ltd., the Government indicated that, in response to the Committee's recommendation, it carried out conciliation and mediation between the parties so that the agreement of  May , including section  concerning dismissals, be applied. The Government pointed out, however, that Geest Caribbean Ltd. ceased operating in May ; it has retained its legal personality but does not employ any workers in the country. The Government adds that, by Circular DM - of  June  (a copy of which was annexed), the Ministry of Labour gave instructions to the Labour Inspectorate for inspectors to ensure that trade union rights be fully respected in Geest Caribbean Ltd. and in the other companies in the country, including on the plantations, as well as to guarantee that ""the standing workers' committees"" (not unionized) not interfere with the role of representatives at the undertaking. Furthermore, circular DM - of  December  gives priority as a matter of urgency to any investigative procedures concerning disloyal work practices contrary to trade union rights, which should be transmitted immediately to the National Labour Inspectorate Board. The Government also indicates that it is not aware of any appeal before the Constitutional Court which was referred to by SITGAH. As concerns the evolution of the procedure concerning the violent acts which occurred in May  during the collective dispute at Geest Caribbean Ltd., the Government points out that the accused (former workers in the company and most of them Nicaraguans without papers) have not been found and that the procedures have been suspended, except as concerns one of them which was found to be without basis.
.The Committee takes note of this information. As concerns the collective dispute at LACSA (Case No. ), the Committee, while noting the delaying tactics evoked by the Government, deplores the delay in the administrative procedure concerning the violation of the collective agreement and recalls that the facts alleged in the complaint date to . The Committee emphasizes that procedures concerning violations of Convention No.  should be rapid so that the necessary measures of redress may be truly effective. An excessive delay in the examination of cases and, in particular, the absence of a decision for a long period of time is equivalent to the denial of justice and thus to the negation of trade union rights for the persons concerned.
.As concerns Case No. , the Committee takes note with interest of the steps taken by the Ministry of Labour along the lines of some of the recommendations previously made by the Committee concerning the collective dispute at Geest Caribbean Ltd. The Committee also takes note of the information provided by the Government according to which the penal procedures have been suspended since the persons concerned have not been found. The Committee notes that the company in question ceased operating in May  and requests the Government to indicate, according to the terms of the legislation, the possibilities for applying the agreement of  May  given the recent cessation of activities by the company in question.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) As regards the collective dispute in the LACSA enterprise (Case No. ), the Committee requests the Government to take steps to allow the  pilots dismissed from LACSA to be reinstated in their jobs if they so wish. The Committee also requests the Government to take measures to amend the legislation so that the right to strike may be guaranteed in the air transport sector and generally in all services which are not essential in the strict sense of the term.(b) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the appeal lodged by the representative of the Pilots' Association against the administrative resolution DRT-- and on the decision adopted by the National Labour Inspectorate Board on the complaint submitted by the Pilots' Association against LACSA for having violated the collective agreement.(c) As regards the collective dispute in Geest Caribbean Limited (Case No. ), the Committee:- insists on the need that the agreement of  May , signed by the parties, be fully applied, including clause  concerning the dismissals;- requests the Government to ensure that trade union rights in the above-mentioned enterprise are fully respected, in particular protection against anti-union dismissals, the right of trade union officials to enter into contact with plantation workers with the respect due for property rights and the guarantee that ""standing workers' committees"" (which do not belong to the union) do not undermine the role of the representative trade unions in the enterprise. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the measures it takes in this respect and the outcome of the appeal lodged with the Constitutional Chamber; and- requests the Government to keep it informed of the evolution of proceedings under way concerning the acts of violence which occurred in May  during the collective dispute in question, and to send it the text of the sentence handed down. The Committee insists that an investigation be undertaken on the allegations of acts of violence which were to have been committed as much by the workers as by the police.
.The complaints in Cases Nos.  and  are contained in communications from the Workers' Confederation (Rerum Novarum) (CTRN), dated  September and  October , and  January,  and  March . The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) expressed its support for the complaints in a communication dated  June .
.The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) presented additional information and new allegations in communications dated  August  and  March  respectively.
.The complaint in Case No.  is contained in a communication from the Heredia Union of Workers in Agriculture, Livestock and Allied Occupations (SITAGAH), dated  June .
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  May,  and  June and  and  October , and  February,  March,  and  April,  September and  October .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ) and the Workers' Representatives Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  June , the Heredia Union of Workers in Agriculture, Livestock and Allied Occupations (SITAGAH) also referred to the events mentioned in ICFTU's allegations made in its communication dated  June  (Case No. ). It explains that since  in the central district of the Sarapiqu canton in the province of Heredia, Republic of Costa Rica, banana plantations have been set up, belonging to the transnational English-funded banana marketing company Geest Caribbean Americas Ltd., Costa Rican branch. They employ , agricultural labourers, approximately",1,1994,Costa Rica
117," of whom were directly hired by the employer and the rest of whom are subcontracted.
.SITAGAH alleges that Geest Caribbean Americas Ltd. has, since , hired and subcontracted many migrant workers who did not have residence papers (Nicaraguans), who are not entitled to rights under Costa Rican labour law, using them as reserve labour and thus forcing Costa Rican banana plantation workers to accept below-average conditions of work, safety and pay. The employer's arbitrary actions led the workers to contact the SITAGAH union leadership in September , and hundreds of them joined the union, but the enterprise suppressed the union and prevented it from functioning, including by: dismissing workers who had joined the union, and elected union representatives; discriminating in terms of pay and conditions of work; unfair practices against the SITAGAH trade union; rescinding the freedom of trade union officers to meet with workers without the employer's prior authorization; promoting solidarist interference in trade union matters and resorting to violence (with a private police force to prevent unionization) and armed repression (workers were injured and beaten by the police force), in order to break the workers' legitimate strike.
.SITAGAH adds that since September  it has been applying for recognition and calling for a solution to its members' labour problems. Even though it has formally recognized the SITAGAH trade union, the employer continues to take up all labour issues with workers' standing committees affiliated to solidarist organizations, refusing to discuss them with SITAGAH.
.In April , the employer's arbitrary acts went as far as cutting workers' wages by more than , colones per fortnight, which provoked a three-day strike (,  and  April ), as a result of which the employer enterprise promised to negotiate with SITAGAH on wage issues, on the basis of an agenda drawn up by the trade union. However, the employer did not sit down to the negotiating table, but instead launched mass dismissals of workers belonging to the trade union, and subcontracted workers were removed from the plantation. The enterprise immediately called the migration authorities to ensure that the migrant workers who had no residence papers and who had joined the union were expelled from the country. This situation compelled the workers to call a further strike for - May . However, on  May, using a court order to open up a public right of way as an excuse, the Costa Rican police force, supported by Geest Caribbean private guards, under orders from the employer's representative, moved in on the strikers,  of whom received bullet wounds, three of them serious, leaving some workers unable ever fully to work again, and imprisoned  workers. To date, two workers are still missing. It should be pointed out that the workers were engaged in a peaceful strike - the strike had not been declared illegal because there were no grounds for doing so in view of the employer's arbitrary acts and the legitimacy and fairness of the workers' demands - however, the enterprise dismissed more than  workers, violating the trade union immunity (fuero sindical) to which they were entitled as the dismissals included representatives, elected by workers, on standing committees on the negotiating committee that discussed labour issues on the plantation with the Government and enterprise, and on grass-roots trade union committees, and included members of the trade union executive committee.
.Furthermore, SITAGAH points out that despite the fact that the problem has not been resolved and that SITAGAH boasts considerable membership among workers still in employment, the employer is preventing trade union officers from meeting freely with workers, using private guards to deny them access to plantations, preventing workers from holding meetings and communicating with persons outside the plantation. As these workers have stated, the Geest Caribbean plantation in Sarapiqu is a concentration camp with flowers, where trade union officers must ask permission of the employers even to speak with members, but may not communicate with other workers or hold union meetings. SITAGAH encloses a memorandum from the banana plantation manager, written and signed in his own handwriting, addressed to the private guards and stating that Mr. Pablo Zuiga is authorized to speak with trade union members. Nevertheless, the private guards have been present during conversations and workers could not express themselves freely.
.Meanwhile, the enterprise and the advisory body belonging to the banana industry solidarist movement in Costa Rica, the John XXIII Social School, in the midst of a labour dispute, in an effort to interfere in the dispute and pressurize workers to join the solidarist association, have set up four solidarist associations which have been approved by the Ministry of Labour without questioning their illegal origin.
.According to the complainant, the Government of Costa Rica adopted an Act on trade union immunity (fuero sindical) but in practice, as in cases such as this, it is not being applied. The Constitutional Chamber legitimized trade union immunity in an erga omnes ruling which is also not being implemented by any state judicial or administrative body in Costa Rica. The State approved legislation prohibiting solidarist associations from interfering in collective bargaining or acting against trade unions. However, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security continues to approve solidarist associations set up to damage trade unions, and approve the collective bargaining carried out between the employer and standing committees belonging to solidarist organizations, thereby excluding the trade union. In the specific case mentioned in this allegation, the employer has set up four solidarist associations and negotiates remuneration with the standing committee.
.The first labour policy move by the present government was to fire on and suppress the workers of the Geest Caribbean Americas company, who were engaged in legal strike action.
.In its communications dated  May,  and  October , the Government stated that the essence of the allegations contained in the general part of these cases harked back to the issues dealt with in Case No.  by the Committee on Freedom of Association and the most recent observations of the Committee of Experts, and that these matters were examined by a direct contacts mission to Costa Rica from  to  October . The Government points out that the current administration has shown particular interest in bringing labour legislation into line with the principles contained in Conventions Nos. ,  and , has set up a legal framework specifically designed to protect trade union organizations and their officers, and introduced various bills applying, with ILO technical assistance, the recommendations made by the Committee on Freedom of Association in its th Report, and by the Committee of Experts. The Government refers specifically to a recent Act, No.  of  November , which, inter alia, amends the Labour Code (with regard to trade union guarantees) and the Act on solidarist associations, bringing them into line with the provisions of the aforementioned Conventions. The Government adds that the claims of inequality between solidarism and trade unionism are false. On the contrary, the Government, on the basis of the recommendations made by the Committee as mentioned above, submitted a Bill to the Legislative Assembly on the establishment of an occupational capitalization and economic democratization fund, which changes the regulations governing compensation upon termination of a contract, thus making it a genuine right for all workers and placing trade unions and solidarist associations on an equal footing with regard to acting as administrators of these funds. Similarly, the Act of  November  reduces the minimum number of workers needed to set up a trade union to  (in other words, the same number as that required to set up solidarist associations), provides adequate protection against anti-union discrimination and updates the fines for violation of the Labour Code and ILO Conventions.
.With regard to the allegation of restrictions on collective bargaining and strikes in the public sector, the Government points out that it has been negotiating specific legislation on public employment which contains express provisions on the settlement of collective disputes and the right to strike in this sector since the beginning of  with trade union organizations (including the complainant). With regard to ruling No. - of Constitutional Chamber IV, the Government points out that, under the constitutional guidelines in force, the employment relationship between the public administration and its public servants is subject to ""particular or special criteria"" which do not allow the application of labour legislation on arbitration since the latter was drawn up to cover labour relations in the private sector alone. The Government adds that since public sector workers are barred access to arbitration machinery on the basis of the aforementioned ruling, on  March , following discussion with the Central Labour Council (a tripartite body), the Regulations on collective bargaining for public servants were issued, allowing collective bargaining and the exercise of trade union rights in the public administration. These Regulations remain temporarily in force while the corresponding legislation is being passed since, as a result of tripartite consultation, a Bill on the settlement of collective disputes in the public sector will be submitted to the",-1,1994,Costa Rica
118,"Legislative Assembly; this is part of the Bill on public employment and takes account of observations made by the ILO.
.With regard to the allegations concerning new legislation and bills supposedly undermining freedom of association and labour stability, the Government, in its communication dated  June , points out that the list of annexes sent by the complainants contains extracts from legislation, regulations and bills, and from doctrinaire magazine articles. The Government is therefore unable to comment since in order to do so an objective legal analysis would be required, which would be completely out of place in the present context.
.With regard to the refusal to grant the union leader Mario Rojas Vilchez unpaid leave for union business, the Government states that the refusal was based on the fact that Mr. Rojas Vilchez is not a permanent official because he has still not finished his probationary period as required under section  of the civil service statutes. Furthermore, the Government points out that it is willing to amend legislation on the teaching profession so that state teachers in particular and public servants in general may enjoy unrestricted trade union leave, bringing legislation into line with Convention No. . This amendment will be submitted for the approval of the Central Labour Council which is a tripartite body.
.With regard to the allegation of trade union persecution in several private sector enterprises, in its communications dated  October  and  February , the Government points out that with regard to:- The Confecciones Imperio S.A. enterprise: the CTRN requested that a meeting be held in the Ministry of Labour so that workers' representatives could settle the case, together with the enterprise, of a number of unjustified dismissals, assumed to have been reprisals against workers who had refused to join a solidarist association as they were members of the National Association of Private Enterprise Workers (ANTEP). During the hearing on  July , an agreement was reached whereby the workers who had been dismissed accepted the compensation due, instead of reinstatement.The Government refutes the information relating to alleged trade union persecution in the aforementioned enterprise since the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, through the National Labour Inspection Directorate and the National Labour Relations Directorate, has no record of any complaints, nor has it had through any other suitable channel any reliable evidence of such persecution.However, particular mention should be made of the effective intervention on the part of the Ministry, through its labour relations department, at the time of the alleged dismissals, and the subsequent favourable settlement under which compensation was paid, the minutes of the meeting showing that no reservations were entered by the trade union suggesting harassment.- The TALMANA S.A. enterprise: the labour inspector has heard the allegation made by the president of ANTEP concerning harassment of a number of workers on grounds of union membership and declared it receivable. He intends to institute the legal proceedings called for in the case of violation of labour laws. On  June  the complainant who had appealed for enforcement of constitutional rights (amparo) requested that the proceedings and appeal be withdrawn, upon which the Labour Inspectorate closed the case. Subsequently, the president of ANTEP was removed from office by a workers' assembly following internal disputes in the union, and the new representative asked that proceedings be resumed. The Labour Inspectorate agreed and is in the process of investigating the new allegations.In this regard, it should be pointed out that the National Labour Inspection Directorate issued a ruling on  February  in which it declared admissible the complaint of union persecution made against TALMANA S.A. by Mr. Carlos Acua Castro, president of the National Association of Private Enterprise Workers (ANTEP). This clearly shows that the Government of Costa Rica is prepared thoroughly to investigate trade union organizations' complaints of violation of the labour laws which protect trade union activity.However, as provided by law, and authorized under the legal system, the legal representative of the TALMANA S.A. enterprise appealed against the ruling. The ruling has not become absolute, since it was challenged as described and the National Association of Private Enterprise Workers (ANTEP) also filed an appeal for enforcement of constitutional rights (amparo) against the enterprise. As things stand, it is not true that the Ministry has not become involved in the aforementioned case, bearing in mind that it has gone as far as it is allowed under the legal system and there is no evidence of voluntary omission or violation of legal provisions.- The Corporacin Peter S.A. enterprise: there are no complaints of violation of freedom of association at this enterprise before the Labour Inspectorate, so it is surprising that a complaint has been made to the Committee before referring to the competent national bodies.- The Patisand S.A. enterprise: the inspection carried out at this enterprise confirmed that Elizabeth Salas had been dismissed at the time she was nursing her child, which is a violation of labour laws. A complaint was therefore lodged with the Labour Court. It was not proven that she was dismissed as a result of trade union persecution, but that this was on the aforementioned grounds.In this case, the allegation is repetitive and groundless because the case had already been referred to the Labour Inspection services, which had taken the Patisand S.A. enterprise before the courts alleging violation of labour and social security legislation.This was because it was proved that the enterprise in question failed to comply with section  of the Labour Code, since despite the fact that the worker was nursing her child at the time, the enterprise failed to notify the National Directorate and General Labour Inspectorate of the dismissal and thus prove the misconduct given as the reason for justified dismissal, in accordance with the Labour Code.- The Corporacin Rojas Corts S.A. enterprise: on the basis of inquiries carried out by the Labour Inspectorate in various establishments belonging to the enterprise, the complaint was dismissed. The decision stands firm as it has not been challenged by those concerned.More specifically, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, through its Labour Inspectorate and labour affairs services, has dealt with all the requests for help to establish violations of various legal provisions, including the allegations of union persecution. The latter allegations have been dismissed because it has been impossible to prove that measures designed to hinder or stamp out trade union activity have been taken. A photocopy of the decision of the National Labour Inspection Directorate dated  June  and background information have been enclosed.- The Compaa Bananera Agropecuaria Ro Jimnez S.A.: the ANTEP representative requested a hearing in the Ministry of Labour to discuss a number of labour issues with employers' representatives. However, this meeting did not take place as the enterprise replied that labour relations were discussed with the workers' standing committee. The Government points out that at no time did the trade union in question lodge any complaint of union persecution against the workers dismissed, mentioned by the complainant. More specifically, the Government refutes the information on alleged union persecution, since the Ministry of Labour and Social Security has not been informed of any such complaint. Affidavits from the National Director and General Labour Inspector are appended.- The Industrias Realtex S.A. enterprise: this case is similar to that of the Corporacin Peter S.A., and Compaa Bananera Agropecuaria Ro Jimnez S.A. enterprises. The Government refutes the information provided since the alleged complaint of mass dismissals, including of branch members, in addition to the fact that there is no reliable proof, has not been registered with the Ministry of Labour and Social Security.In any case, there should be some indication of how the Department of Labour Relations of the Ministry in question has dealt with the requests for intervention made by ANTEP with regard to possible bankruptcies and dismissals at the enterprise. Representatives of the enterprise and the trade union were called to a meeting and the settlement reached was satisfactory to and signed by both parties.From the above it can be concluded that the additional information in question is groundless..Furthermore, the Government points out that the trade union organizations have gone as far as presenting complaints to an international body relating to situations which they made no attempt to resolve in due form by, first of all, exhausting national procedures. It is obvious that many of these problems could have been avoided if they had availed themselves of these procedures. In reality, and as has been observed, when they did refer disputes to the courts, the latter correctly applied both the ordinary law and ILO Conventions.
.Furthermore, the Government points out that the trade union organizations have gone as far as presenting complaints to an international body relating to situations which they made no attempt to resolve in due form by, first of all, exhausting national procedures. It is obvious that many of these problems could have been avoided if they had availed themselves of these procedures. In reality, and as has been observed, when they",1,1994,Costa Rica
119,"did refer disputes to the courts, the latter correctly applied both the ordinary law and ILO Conventions.
.In its communication dated  September , the Government states that it should be pointed out that the information on the legislative situation in Costa Rica affecting the exercise of the right to organize is littered with rash allegations designed to cast aspersions on the Government's resolve to do its utmost to improve the labour legislation in force in accordance with international standards. The Government recalls the report of the direct contacts mission to Costa Rica (October ) and the report of the Committee of Experts, , which includes Costa Rica in its list of cases of progress, specifically with regard to Conventions Nos. ,  and . Both reports clearly and openly state the improvements which have been made in labour legislation, improvements which go even further than the observations made by the ILO supervisory bodies, which is why the allegations are no longer relevant or have any legal basis.
.The Government adds that, contrary to what is stated by the complainants, the Government of Costa Rica, pursuant to the agreement reached with representatives of the major trade union organizations in November , began drafting regulations to improve the understanding and implementation of Act No. . The draft was transmitted for consultation to the representatives of the major trade unions, so that they could suggest amendments to the text and then, on the basis of consensus, the final version could be drawn up.
.It is essential to point out that the Government of Costa Rica, on  August , through a unique move in the history of labour legislation in Costa Rica, designed to bring the country up to date, reinstated the Central Labour Council and submitted a total of  international Conventions and  Recommendations adopted by the International Labour Conference for consultation to this national tripartite body. The Government is willing now and in the future to maintain permanent and open dialogue with this body on issues of national interest.
.The Government states that the administration or management of termination funds does not fall to solidarist associations alone. In practice there are provisions, on the basis of a collective agreement, governing trade union participation in the administration of dismissal compensation funds. At all events, the Government reaffirms its decision to support and make the necessary improvements to the Bill on occupational capitalization and economic democratization fund which was submitted to the Legislative Assembly by the previous Government. Of interest to this case, and as called for by the Committee of Experts, is the fact that the Bill does not restrict the administration of dismissal compensation funds to solidarist associations but has clearly made provision for trade union and cooperative organizations to be involved.
.The Government points out that the complainants' comments on section  of the Labour Code which prohibits strikes in the public services and the agricultural sector are no longer valid because a Bill on public employment drawn up with ILO technical assistance has been finalized and put before the Legislative Assembly. This Bill, inter alia, governs the right to strike by public servants in non-essential services in public institutions and defines the public services in which strikes are prohibited or restricted, in particular, through the establishment of minimum services. The provisions which drastically restricted strikes are therefore being repealed. As the situation stands, and since the Bill was drafted with ILO technical assistance, it is clear that the exercise of the right to strike, in general terms, complies with the principles of ILO supervisory bodies, which is why the comments made by the complainants in this regard have no legal or factual basis.
.With regard to collective bargaining in the public administration, the Bill on public employment was submitted to the Legislature in April  and published in the Official Journal (La Gaceta) on  July , in accordance with the national and international commitments made by the previous government. The Bill, inter alia, sets out the principles and general standards governing individual and collective relationships between the central and decentralized public administration and their employees, in accordance with the relevant legal principles. Thus, in respect of collective bargaining in the public sector, Title V of the Bill clearly recognizes the right of association and trade union membership of public employees and the rights derived therefrom. Similarly, it governs the collective bargaining system in the public sector, establishing the scope of application, guarantees for the efficient operation and continuity of essential services, in addition to the aims, conditions, procedures and limits of collective bargaining recognized at the national, occupational and institutional levels.
.In its communication dated  October , the Government reports that the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, through its competent administrative bodies, has dealt diligently and objectively with all the proceedings instituted by workers and their representative organizations with regard to the dispute in the Geest Caribbean Americas Ltd., Proyecto Islas enterprise. These administrative proceedings ultimately led to far-reaching agreements which ended the dispute.
.In a document dated  April , Mr. Luis Pablo Zuiga Morales, representing SITAGAH and FENTRAP, informed the Ministry of Labour and Social Security that workers on banana plantations , ,  and  belonging to the Geest Caribbean Americas Ltd. had been on strike for three days because the enterprise was refusing to negotiate the rates of pay for various tasks with standing committees, in accordance with the direct agreement. He also requested that the representatives of the enterprise be summoned to a meeting with a view to reaching a settlement. It should be noted that, far from criticizing the workers' standing committee, the union's request defends and promotes it, contrary to what is stated in the complaint presented to the ILO. On the same day,  April, there was a meeting between the parties to the dispute, at the request of the Minister of Labour and Social Security, at which an agreement was reached, thus ending the strike. On  April  the parties met to begin the negotiations provided for in the formal statement ending the strike. The negotiations were delayed on several occasions between then and  May  because the employer's representatives failed to attend. The Ministry of Labour and Social Security, throughout this situation, remained diligent and committed to establishing dialogue and understanding, as the records show.
.Nevertheless, the Government adds, although another meeting had been called for  May , a new unexpected strike broke out throughout the plantations belonging to Geest Caribbean, Proyecto Islas, Sarapiqu, in the province of Heredia. At that point, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security took steps once again to reach a settlement. In this context, a number of meetings were organized, which in some cases met with opposition from the enterprise, and it was arranged for the parties to the dispute to meet on  May . On the same day, through the mediation of the Minister of Labour and Social Security, the parties, namely the representatives of the SITAGAH organization and the Geest Caribbean Americas Ltd. enterprise met in the office of the Minister and signed an agreement to end the dispute. Subsequently, several meetings were held in the Ministry of Labour and Social Security to monitor compliance with the terms set out in the agreement.
.To date, the third item in the agreement is still to be resolved, hopefully in the next few days, since the legal representatives of the enterprise and the trade union organization attended the tenth meeting of the Committee on Work on Plantations held at the ILO, Geneva, Switzerland.
.The Government considers that the complainants are misrepresenting the facts by contradicting what they themselves stated in item  of the aforementioned agreement dated  May , to the effect that ""both parties place on record their gratitude to the Minister of Labour and Social Security, Dr. Farid Ayales Esna, for his timely and valuable mediation in this matter. Thanks to his diligence, the parties reached an acceptable agreement in the interests of industrial peace in the Sarapiqu area."" ""Both parties"" means the Geest Caribbean Americas enterprise and the SITAGAH trade union. This was how the situation stood and on the principle of good-faith bargaining and legal security, The Ministry of Labour and Social Security, by acting as mediator and finding a solution to the dispute has shown its commitment to ensuring respect for the terms agreed between the parties, and the case of Geest Caribbean has been no exception, as is clear from the documents appended. They show the Government's repeated efforts to ensure implementation of the terms of the oft-mentioned agreement dated  May , in full respect of the ""pacta sunt servanda"" principle.
.In this context, the Government considers that the complaint is rash, irrelevant and damaging to the principle of good faith since the process leading to implementation of the items in the agreement is under way, and the SITAGAH union leadership signed an agreement settling the dispute, but days later lodged a complaint with the ILO against the",0,1994,Costa Rica
120,"Government of Costa Rica alleging violation of freedom of association and interference by solidarist associations in union matters and collective bargaining at Sarapiqu banana plantations.
.One example to be noted is the incongruity in the union's position as it tries to take two different tacks at the same time. According to a memorandum dated  June  after the complaint referred to in this report had been lodged, the Secretary-General of SITAGAH asked the Ministry of Labour and Social Security to review the procedures for examining dismissals, as provided for in item  of the document dated  May. In the memorandum, he also provided information on the appointment by his organization of representatives to sit on the ""tripartite committee"" provided for in the document to look into the dismissals. In view of all this, the Government of Costa Rica cannot understand why the complainant organization is turning to an international body to make accusations against a government which has always been willing to deal with its problems. Furthermore, on  August  the Secretary-General of SITAGAH once again requested that, pursuant to labour legislation and the institution's rules of procedure, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security should summon the Geest Caribbean Americas Ltd. enterprise with a view to resolving the following problems: follow-up to the document dated  May  and the deduction of trade union dues, as requested by members and the trade union.
.As can be seen from the above, in terms of ministerial mediation, a series of efforts were made which resulted in a far-reaching agreement that ended the dispute. This confirms the rashness of the complaint in question in so far as it has neither a factual nor a legal basis, which is why it should be rejected outright, bearing in mind that it was lodged after the dispute was settled. Furthermore, it should be noted that the Government has gone beyond conciliation and mediation efforts. It went as far as carrying out labour inspections, through the National Directorate and General Labour Inspectorate of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security. Its efforts in dealing with the union claim of persecution and unfair labour practices are set out below.
.The National Directorate and General Labour Inspectorate have, at all times, carried out the necessary procedure to deal with the complaint of union persecution lodged by SITAGAH against the Geest Caribbean Americas Ltd. enterprise. At present, as can be seen from the information enclosed, the investigation into the matter is at the stage of receiving and analysing the documents provided by the complainant union.
.On the other hand, and since the complaint mentions alleged violent incidents between the Costa Rican Civil Guard and a number of workers, it is important to point out that the Civil Guard acted in compliance with a warrant from the office of the mayor of Sarapiqu, in the province of Heredia, on the basis of a decision of  May  that the police should re-establish access to the highway and remove obstacles preventing free circulation, as the highway had been blocked by a group of demonstrators. In any case, it should be noted that the security forces operate in accordance with the constitutional legal system and the competent judicial authority. The actions of the security forces which were present at the scene of the events and are mentioned in the complaint were in conformity with the prevailing legal order and institutional structures of our country.
.It should be pointed that the complainants instituted legal proceedings. However, their efforts came to nothing because they were badly planned, as the case was within the competence of ordinary labour courts, and not the Constitutional Chamber, where they lodged their grievance.
.Finally, the remaining allegations of unfair labour practices, including: the dismissal of workers belonging to trade unions, solidarist interference in union affairs, and the use of private police forces to prevent trade union expansion by the Geest Caribbean Americas Ltd. enterprise (Costa Rica branch) against the complainant trade union are being examined by the National Labour Inspection Directorate, which will submit a report.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee notes with satisfaction the recent legal provisions concerning protection against anti-union discrimination and guarantees preventing solidarist associations from engaging in trade union activities and that trade unions are not given unfavourable treatment as compared with solidarist associations.(b) The Committee urges that the Bill on the statutory regulations governing public employment and the civil service, collective bargaining and strikes in the public sector, and the Bill on the occupational capitalization and economic democratization fund (which provides that trade unions, as well as solidarist associations, may administer dismissal compensation funds) be adopted in the near future and that they will be in full confomity with the requirements laid down in ratified ILO Conventions. The Committee urges the Government to expedite the passage of both Bills and to continue this process with ILO technical assistance.(c) With regard to the Bills on the ""democratization of the public sector"", and ""the National Port Council"", the Committee requests the authorities engaged in consultations with trade union organizations, if they have not already done so, also to take measures to ensure that the prospective Act will allow workers of the National Port Council to enjoy the right to strike as a consequence of their freedom of action.(d) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of proceedings before the judicial authority relating to the alleged anti-union dismissal of ten workers at the TALMANA S.A. enterprise.(e) The Committee recommends that the Government take the necessary measures to enable the trade union leaders and members of the Corporacin Peter S.A., Compaia Agropecuraria Ro Jimnez S.A. and Industrias Realtex S.A. enterprises who have been dismissed because of their legitimate trade union activities to secure reinstatement in their posts.(f) The Committee urges the Government to reply to the allegations of anti-union dismissals and practices at the LACSA enterprise, on which it has not sent its observations.(g) The Committee takes note of the Government's intention to amend the legislation concerning trade union dismissal and urges the Government to take measures to ensure that, henceforth, the trade union official Mr. Rojas Vilchez is not prevented from taking trade union leave to which he is entitled.(h) With regard to the allegations surrounding the dispute between banana plantation workers and the Geest Caribbean Americas Ltd. enterprise, the Committee notes the Government's explanations and the fact that the National Labour Inspection Directorate will submit a report on the matter in the near future. While noting the serious nature of the allegations, the Committee will postpone consideration of them pending this report and requests the Government to inform it whether a judicial inquiry has been opened into the violent incidents which took place and left a number of workers injured.",-1,1994,Costa Rica
121,".The complaint in this case is contained in a communication from the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) dated  June . The Government sent its observations in communications dated  October  and  May .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  June , the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) alleges that on  May  the Trade Union of Construction, Metallurgical and Related Workers (SICMA) was set up in the SARET Group of Costa Rica S.A. enterprise, in the free zone of Alajuela, and that between  and  of the same month  workers were dismissed, including the members of the executive board of the trade union, on grounds of serious misconduct. The complainant allegation states that the Ministry of Labour was informed immediately, but that the workers have not been reinstated in their workplaces.
.In its communications of  October  and  May , the Government states in connection with the allegations that in accordance with the Organic Law of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security No.  of  April , its amendments and Reorganization and Rationalization Regulations, Executive Decree No. -TBS of  February , conciliation and administrative mediation measures were immediately taken as a matter of priority. The Government adds that the institutional objective of such administrative action was to achieve a solution to the dispute through dialogue and understanding by the parties, with account being taken of the Government's sense of deep respect for the right to freedom of association as set forth in article  of the Political Constitution, Conventions Nos.  and  and the Labour Code.
.The Government lists the following actions which the Ministry of Labour and Social Security took in conformity with legal procedures. On  May : request for intervention addressed to the Department of Labour Relations by a group of workers in the SARET enterprise of Costa Rica, for the purpose of convening officials of this enterprise following the dismissal of the said workers, supposedly for holding meetings on the setting up of a trade union organization. On the same date, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security fixed the date of the conciliation hearing for  May ; on  May , in the presence of the workers concerned, as well as trade union representatives and the legal adviser of the enterprise, and following the latter's statement that he was willing to meet again with the workers, with the mediation of the Ministry, the parties agreed to hold a new meeting on  May. On  May , the employer's representative did not turn up at the agreed meeting, and for this reason the workers requested the Office of Labour Affairs to make a complaint to the General Labour Inspectorate in respect of trade union persecution against several workers who were organizing the establishment of a trade union, and their dismissal. These workers reserved the right to bring the matter before the competent courts. On  May , the Directorate of Labour Affairs informed the SARET, S.A. enterprise of its concern at the attitude adopted by its legal adviser towards commitments entered into. The same note stated that the parties were convened to a further meeting on  May . In addition to these initiatives, on  May  the General Directorate of Labour Affairs, in response to an express request by the workers concerned, formally requested the General Directorate of Labour Inspection of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security to carry out an inquiry into the matter of trade union persecution; on  May , the representatives of the workers - Movement of Costa Rican Workers - the workers concerned and the representative of the enterprise met following the convocation from the Office of Labour Affairs. The employer's representative refuted that there had been trade union persecution and refused to reinstate the dismissed workers. Given the impossibility of achieving any extra-judicial settlement, the workers rejected the employer's position and, for the purposes of exhausting the administrative procedure, recorded in a document dated  May  that they would carry out ""all the legal and constitutional procedures on behalf of the workers' right to free organization"". In the institutional context of Costa Rica, such constitutional and legal acts are referred to the courts of justice as the only state power with the authority for the final settlement of such disputes, whether individual or collective, on matters of law or interests. In this particular case there is no record in the Ministry of Labour of any legal action taken by the workers, as required by the legal system.
.As regards the ministerial inquiry into the complaint of trade union persecution, the Government states that on  June , following an express request from the Director of Labour Affairs for an investigation into trade union persecution in the said enterprise, the National Directorate of Labour Inspection issued a resolution instructing the labour inspector of the province of Alajuela to carry out the said inquiry and to deliver a report as soon as possible. The parties were informed that an inquiry had been initiated and were granted a period of ten working days to produce the necessary evidence. On  June  a request was made to the Deputy Secretary of the Trade Union of Construction, Metallurgical and Related Workers (SICMA) to give the exact address at which the workers who had been the object of alleged trade union persecution could be located. On  June  a group of  workers signed a document containing the reasons and evidence substantiating the complaint which had been made. On  July , the inspector responsible for the inquiry ordered the employer to produce documents concerning the complaint within a period of eight days. On  July , the employer's representative responded to the above-mentioned order by denying the existence of the trade union and producing in evidence certified photocopies from the Department of Social Organizations of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security. Under Act No. , of  November , section  of which deals with trade union protection, whenever an organization of this nature is set up or is in the process of being set up, the workers who are members of the said trade union must notify the Department of Social Organizations of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security and the employer of their intention to set up a trade union, along with the names and status of those who in their opinion should benefit from protection against dismissal. On  August , the inspector carrying out the inquiry requested from the General Secretary of SICMA, documentation on the establishment of the organization and the number and names of its members and notification, if any, of the existence of the trade union. On  September , the said inspector received a communication from the representative of the enterprise which rejected all the terms of the complaint. On  September , the inspector requested the suspension of the inquiry until the organization in question had provided the information requested on  June and  August. On  September , the Directorate issued a resolution in which it called upon the complainant organization to furnish the information requested on  June and  August, and informed the inspector that the inquiry should continue and that his report should be delivered as soon as possible. The Government states that it is clear from the above that it had complied with its obligation of guaranteeing full freedom of association, as established in the Political Constitution, international Conventions, the Labour Code, its amendments and other related laws. The objective of all the measures taken by the administrative authorities was to protect the exercise of the right to organize by workers against the alleged acts of interference and all these measures comply with the principle of legality which governs all acts by the public administration.
.The Government appends to its reply the final report of the National Directorate of Labour Inspection, dated  May , which shows that once the labour inspector was appointed to carry out the inquiry, ""compulsory notification was given to the parties to present evidence relating to the complaint in question within ten working days""; ""that despite the fact that the above-mentioned resolution was duly notified to the parties concerned, the necessary evidence required in this kind of inquiry was not presented""; that the labour inspector stated that ""without the information requested from the trade union organization, it is impossible to carry out the inquiry which has been ordered""; and that finally, at the request of the labour inspector, it was decided ""to close the inquiry into allegations of trade union persecution in the enterprise known as the SARET Group of Costa Rica, S.A."". In the same way the voluminous documentation on the administrative procedure carried out, which",0,1994,Costa Rica
122,"the Government appends to its reply, contains a communication from the trade union, dated  January , addressed to the National Directorate of Labour Inspection which states the following:We were informed by Labour Inspector Rodriguez that he wanted to interview each and every person who had been dismissed, which we believed was correct, although it raised an objective problem, namely that each of us has to earn his living to support our families, and many of us have had to go to different parts of the country to do so, which makes it difficult to locate all our colleagues. Thus we decided to ask those colleagues with whom we had established contact to go to Inspector Rodriguez's office, but they were neither received nor interviewed by Inspector Rodriguez, which was undoubtedly prejudicial to the valuable information which these colleagues might have been able to give the inspector.Thus, although it is true that our colleagues were not interviewed, this was not due to any negligence or lack of interest, but to the material impossibility of locating persons who as a result of their compulsory dismissal have had to travel to other parts of the country to earn their living.
.Finally, the Government also includes amongst other documents the constitution of the Trade Union of Construction, Metallurgical and Related Workers (SICMA), its bylaws and a communication from the Department of Social Organizations addressed to the trade union concerned on  June  on the subject of its registration.
.The Committee observes that the allegations made in this case refer to the dismissal of  workers from the SARET Group of Costa Rica S.A. enterprise, located in the free trade zone of Alajuela, for having established the Trade Union of Construction, Metallurgical and Related Workers (SICMA), including the members of the executive board of the trade union organization.
.The Committee notes that the Government states that: () it took immediate and urgent steps for conciliation and administrative mediation and that the institutional objective of this administrative action was to achieve dialogue and understanding by the parties with a view to settling their dispute; () the National Directorate of Labour Inspection carried out an inquiry into the complaint of trade union persecution and that it was finally decided to close the case since the parties did not produce the necessary evidence for the inquiry to be completed; () the enterprise denies having been informed of the existence of a trade union in the enterprise.
.Furthermore, the Committee observes that the Government encloses the following with its reply: (i) a communication from the trade union, dated  January , addressed to the National Directorate of Labour Inspection in which it states that although there were some difficulties in locating the dismissed workers during the administrative inquiry procedure because they had gone to different parts of the country following their dismissal, the workers who had presented themselves were not received or interviewed; and (ii) a communication from the Department of Social Organizations, dated  June , addressed to the Trade Union of Construction, Metallurgical and Related Workers (SICMA) on the procedure for the registration of the trade union (the trade union was set up on  May; the dismissals occurred between  and  May ).
.In this respect, although it notes that the Government made repeated efforts for the parties to reach an agreement to settle the dispute and that an administrative inquiry was carried out into the alleged acts, the Committee can only observe and deplore the extremely long period of time necessary (from June  to May ) for the carrying out of an inquiry which furthermore was finally closed because of a lack of evidence and information, according to the labour inspector. In the Committee's view, the fact that the dismissals of the trade union officials and trade unionists were made just two to five days after the setting up of their trade union and the fact that notwithstanding the statement by the enterprise in the free trade zone that it was unaware of the existence of the trade union the Government encloses in its reply a communication from the Department of Social Organizations which shows that the registration of the trade union was being processed just before the time of the dismissals, as well as the mass nature of the latter, are all clear indications of the anti-union nature of the dismissals. In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to take rapidly the necessary measures to enable the workers dismissed as a result of the exercise of their legitimate trade union activities to be reinstated in their jobs in the said enterprise in the free trade zone of Alajuela. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the measures taken in this respect.
.Furthermore, the Committee draws the attention of the Government to the fact that ""the dismissal of workers on grounds of membership of an organization or trade union activities violates the principles of freedom of association"" (see st Report, Case No.  (Paraguay), para. ) and that ""an excessive delay in processing cases of anti-trade union discrimination is tantamount to a denial of due process"" (see th Report, Case No.  (Nicaragua), para. ). The Committee therefore requests the Government to take measures to ensure that whenever complaints are made of violations of trade union rights, workers in enterprises in free trade zones, as well as elsewhere, benefit from speedy inquiry procedures with a view to providing effective protection. The Committee draws the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to this aspect of the case.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures rapidly to enable the workers dismissed as a result of the exercise of their legitimate trade union activities to be reinstated in their jobs in the SARET Group of Costa Rica S.A. enterprise in the free trade zone of Alajuela. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of measures taken in this respect.(b) The Committee recommends that the Government take measures to ensure that whenever complaints are made of violations of trade union rights, workers in enterprises in free trade zones, as well as elsewhere, benefit from speedy inquiry procedures with a view to providing effective protection. Moreover, it draws the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to this aspect of the case.",1,1994,Costa Rica
123,".The Trade Union of Employees of the University of Costa Rica presented this complaint in communications dated  December  and  January . The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  September .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In this case the complainant organization objects that as a result of strike action a list of strike participants was made out and one day's salary was deducted from their remuneration, despite the fact that the Government had agreed not to impose sanctions.
.The Committee notes the Government's declarations and more specifically that: () the list of strikers ( officials) was not intended as anti-union persecution but was for the wage deduction corresponding to the day of the strike; () this wage deduction is not a sanction and is based on constitutional and legal rules that prohibit the Administration incurring undue payments, and also on the consent of the complainant organization which requested that the wage deduction to be made in two instalments; () upon the request of the complainant organization only the first instalment was deducted and the second was dropped; () the University authorities are only obliged to pay those who have effectively worked; () the complainant organization unilaterally broke off negotiations regarding wage deductions.
.The Committee notes that in the agreement of  July  between the Government and the trade union organizations to solve the conflict, an agreement had not been reached between the parties on the wage deduction, although subsequently the University authorities carried out negotiations on this matter and some results were achieved although these were not totally to the satisfaction of the complainant trade union.
.In this respect the Committee wishes to recall that in a previous case the question arose of the admissibility of wage deductions as a consequence of strike action and the Committee considered that ""salary reductions for days of strike give rise to no objection from the point of view of the principles of freedom of association"". (See th Report, Case No.  (Canada), para. .)
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.",0,1993,Costa Rica
124,".In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) As regards the collective dispute in the LACSA enterprise (Case No. ), the Committee requests the Government to take steps to allow the  pilots dismissed from LACSA to be reinstated in their jobs if they so wish. The Committee also requests the Government to take measures to amend the legislation so that the right to strike may be guaranteed in the air transport sector and generally in all services which are not essential in the strict sense of the term.(b) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the appeal lodged by the representative of the Pilots' Association against the administrative resolution DRT-- and on the decision adopted by the National Labour Inspectorate Board on the complaint submitted by the Pilots' Association against LACSA for having violated the collective agreement.(c) As regards the collective dispute in Geest Caribbean Limited (Case No. ), the Committee:- insists on the need that the agreement of  May , signed by the parties, be fully applied, including clause  concerning the dismissals;- requests the Government to ensure that trade union rights in the above-mentioned enterprise are fully respected, in particular protection against anti-union dismissals, the right of trade union officials to enter into contact with plantation workers with the respect due for property rights and the guarantee that ""standing workers' committees"" (which do not belong to the union) do not undermine the role of the representative trade unions in the enterprise. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the measures it takes in this respect and the outcome of the appeal lodged with the Constitutional Chamber; and- requests the Government to keep it informed of the evolution of proceedings under way concerning the acts of violence which occurred in May  during the collective dispute in question, and to send it the text of the sentence handed down. The Committee insists that an investigation be undertaken on the allegations of acts of violence which were to have been committed as much by the workers as by the police.
.The complaints in Cases Nos.  and  are contained in communications from the Workers' Confederation (Rerum Novarum) (CTRN), dated  September and  October , and  January,  and  March . The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) expressed its support for the complaints in a communication dated  June .
.The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) presented additional information and new allegations in communications dated  August  and  March  respectively.
.The complaint in Case No.  is contained in a communication from the Heredia Union of Workers in Agriculture, Livestock and Allied Occupations (SITAGAH), dated  June .
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  May,  and  June and  and  October , and  February,  March,  and  April,  September and  October .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ) and the Workers' Representatives Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  June , the Heredia Union of Workers in Agriculture, Livestock and Allied Occupations (SITAGAH) also referred to the events mentioned in ICFTU's allegations made in its communication dated  June  (Case No. ). It explains that since  in the central district of the Sarapiqu canton in the province of Heredia, Republic of Costa Rica, banana plantations have been set up, belonging to the transnational English-funded banana marketing company Geest Caribbean Americas Ltd., Costa Rican branch. They employ , agricultural labourers, approximately  of whom were directly hired by the employer and the rest of whom are subcontracted.
.SITAGAH alleges that Geest Caribbean Americas Ltd. has, since , hired and subcontracted many migrant workers who did not have residence papers (Nicaraguans), who are not entitled to rights under Costa Rican labour law, using them as reserve labour and thus forcing Costa Rican banana plantation workers to accept below-average conditions of work, safety and pay. The employer's arbitrary actions led the workers to contact the SITAGAH union leadership in September , and hundreds of them joined the union, but the enterprise suppressed the union and prevented it from functioning, including by: dismissing workers who had joined the union, and elected union representatives; discriminating in terms of pay and conditions of work; unfair practices against the SITAGAH trade union; rescinding the freedom of trade union officers to meet with workers without the employer's prior authorization; promoting solidarist interference in trade union matters and resorting to violence (with a private police force to prevent unionization) and armed repression (workers were injured and beaten by the police force), in order to break the workers' legitimate strike.
.SITAGAH adds that since September  it has been applying for recognition and calling for a solution to its members' labour problems. Even though it has formally recognized the SITAGAH trade union, the employer continues to take up all labour issues with workers' standing committees affiliated to solidarist organizations, refusing to discuss them with SITAGAH.
.In April , the employer's arbitrary acts went as far as cutting workers' wages by more than , colones per fortnight, which provoked a three-day strike (,  and  April ), as a result of which the employer enterprise promised to negotiate with SITAGAH on wage issues, on the basis of an agenda drawn up by the trade union. However, the employer did not sit down to the negotiating table, but instead launched mass dismissals of workers belonging to the trade union, and subcontracted workers were removed from the plantation. The enterprise immediately called the migration authorities to ensure that the migrant workers who had no residence papers and who had joined the union were expelled from the country. This situation compelled the workers to call a further strike for - May . However, on  May, using a court order to open up a public right of way as an excuse, the Costa Rican police force, supported by Geest Caribbean private guards, under orders from the employer's representative, moved in on the strikers,  of whom received bullet wounds, three of them serious, leaving some workers unable ever fully to work again, and imprisoned  workers. To date, two workers are still missing. It should be pointed out that the workers were engaged in a peaceful strike - the strike had not been declared illegal because there were no grounds for doing so in view of the employer's arbitrary acts and the legitimacy and fairness of the workers' demands - however, the enterprise dismissed more than  workers, violating the trade union immunity (fuero sindical) to which they were entitled as the dismissals included representatives, elected by workers, on standing committees on the negotiating committee that discussed labour issues on the plantation with the Government and enterprise, and on grass-roots trade union committees, and included members of the trade union executive committee.
.Furthermore, SITAGAH points out that despite the fact that the problem has not been resolved and that SITAGAH boasts considerable membership among workers still in employment, the employer is preventing trade union officers from meeting freely with workers, using private guards to deny them access to plantations, preventing workers from holding meetings and communicating with persons outside the plantation. As these workers have stated, the Geest Caribbean plantation in Sarapiqu is a concentration camp with flowers, where trade union officers must ask permission of the employers even to speak with members, but may not communicate with other workers or hold union meetings. SITAGAH encloses a memorandum from the banana plantation manager, written and signed in his own handwriting, addressed to the private guards and stating that Mr. Pablo Zuiga is authorized to speak with trade union members. Nevertheless, the private guards have been present during conversations and workers could not express themselves freely.
.Meanwhile, the enterprise and the advisory body belonging to the banana industry solidarist movement in Costa Rica, the John XXIII Social School, in the midst of a labour dispute, in an effort to interfere in the dispute and pressurize workers to join the solidarist association, have set up four solidarist associations which have been approved by the Ministry of Labour without questioning their illegal origin.
.According to the complainant, the Government of Costa Rica adopted an Act on trade union immunity (fuero sindical) but in practice, as in cases such as this, it is not being applied. The Constitutional Chamber legitimized trade union immunity in an erga omnes ruling which is also not being implemented by any state judicial or administrative body in Costa Rica. The State approved legislation prohibiting solidarist associations from interfering in collective bargaining or acting against trade unions. However, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security continues to approve solidarist associations set up to damage trade unions, and approve the collective bargaining carried out between the",1,1993,Costa Rica
125,"employer and standing committees belonging to solidarist organizations, thereby excluding the trade union. In the specific case mentioned in this allegation, the employer has set up four solidarist associations and negotiates remuneration with the standing committee.
.The first labour policy move by the present government was to fire on and suppress the workers of the Geest Caribbean Americas company, who were engaged in legal strike action.
.In its communications dated  May,  and  October , the Government stated that the essence of the allegations contained in the general part of these cases harked back to the issues dealt with in Case No.  by the Committee on Freedom of Association and the most recent observations of the Committee of Experts, and that these matters were examined by a direct contacts mission to Costa Rica from  to  October . The Government points out that the current administration has shown particular interest in bringing labour legislation into line with the principles contained in Conventions Nos. ,  and , has set up a legal framework specifically designed to protect trade union organizations and their officers, and introduced various bills applying, with ILO technical assistance, the recommendations made by the Committee on Freedom of Association in its th Report, and by the Committee of Experts. The Government refers specifically to a recent Act, No.  of  November , which, inter alia, amends the Labour Code (with regard to trade union guarantees) and the Act on solidarist associations, bringing them into line with the provisions of the aforementioned Conventions. The Government adds that the claims of inequality between solidarism and trade unionism are false. On the contrary, the Government, on the basis of the recommendations made by the Committee as mentioned above, submitted a Bill to the Legislative Assembly on the establishment of an occupational capitalization and economic democratization fund, which changes the regulations governing compensation upon termination of a contract, thus making it a genuine right for all workers and placing trade unions and solidarist associations on an equal footing with regard to acting as administrators of these funds. Similarly, the Act of  November  reduces the minimum number of workers needed to set up a trade union to  (in other words, the same number as that required to set up solidarist associations), provides adequate protection against anti-union discrimination and updates the fines for violation of the Labour Code and ILO Conventions.
.With regard to the allegation of restrictions on collective bargaining and strikes in the public sector, the Government points out that it has been negotiating specific legislation on public employment which contains express provisions on the settlement of collective disputes and the right to strike in this sector since the beginning of  with trade union organizations (including the complainant). With regard to ruling No. - of Constitutional Chamber IV, the Government points out that, under the constitutional guidelines in force, the employment relationship between the public administration and its public servants is subject to ""particular or special criteria"" which do not allow the application of labour legislation on arbitration since the latter was drawn up to cover labour relations in the private sector alone. The Government adds that since public sector workers are barred access to arbitration machinery on the basis of the aforementioned ruling, on  March , following discussion with the Central Labour Council (a tripartite body), the Regulations on collective bargaining for public servants were issued, allowing collective bargaining and the exercise of trade union rights in the public administration. These Regulations remain temporarily in force while the corresponding legislation is being passed since, as a result of tripartite consultation, a Bill on the settlement of collective disputes in the public sector will be submitted to the Legislative Assembly; this is part of the Bill on public employment and takes account of observations made by the ILO.
.With regard to the allegations concerning new legislation and bills supposedly undermining freedom of association and labour stability, the Government, in its communication dated  June , points out that the list of annexes sent by the complainants contains extracts from legislation, regulations and bills, and from doctrinaire magazine articles. The Government is therefore unable to comment since in order to do so an objective legal analysis would be required, which would be completely out of place in the present context.
.With regard to the refusal to grant the union leader Mario Rojas Vilchez unpaid leave for union business, the Government states that the refusal was based on the fact that Mr. Rojas Vilchez is not a permanent official because he has still not finished his probationary period as required under section  of the civil service statutes. Furthermore, the Government points out that it is willing to amend legislation on the teaching profession so that state teachers in particular and public servants in general may enjoy unrestricted trade union leave, bringing legislation into line with Convention No. . This amendment will be submitted for the approval of the Central Labour Council which is a tripartite body.
.With regard to the allegation of trade union persecution in several private sector enterprises, in its communications dated  October  and  February , the Government points out that with regard to:- The Confecciones Imperio S.A. enterprise: the CTRN requested that a meeting be held in the Ministry of Labour so that workers' representatives could settle the case, together with the enterprise, of a number of unjustified dismissals, assumed to have been reprisals against workers who had refused to join a solidarist association as they were members of the National Association of Private Enterprise Workers (ANTEP). During the hearing on  July , an agreement was reached whereby the workers who had been dismissed accepted the compensation due, instead of reinstatement.The Government refutes the information relating to alleged trade union persecution in the aforementioned enterprise since the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, through the National Labour Inspection Directorate and the National Labour Relations Directorate, has no record of any complaints, nor has it had through any other suitable channel any reliable evidence of such persecution.However, particular mention should be made of the effective intervention on the part of the Ministry, through its labour relations department, at the time of the alleged dismissals, and the subsequent favourable settlement under which compensation was paid, the minutes of the meeting showing that no reservations were entered by the trade union suggesting harassment.- The TALMANA S.A. enterprise: the labour inspector has heard the allegation made by the president of ANTEP concerning harassment of a number of workers on grounds of union membership and declared it receivable. He intends to institute the legal proceedings called for in the case of violation of labour laws. On  June  the complainant who had appealed for enforcement of constitutional rights (amparo) requested that the proceedings and appeal be withdrawn, upon which the Labour Inspectorate closed the case. Subsequently, the president of ANTEP was removed from office by a workers' assembly following internal disputes in the union, and the new representative asked that proceedings be resumed. The Labour Inspectorate agreed and is in the process of investigating the new allegations.In this regard, it should be pointed out that the National Labour Inspection Directorate issued a ruling on  February  in which it declared admissible the complaint of union persecution made against TALMANA S.A. by Mr. Carlos Acua Castro, president of the National Association of Private Enterprise Workers (ANTEP). This clearly shows that the Government of Costa Rica is prepared thoroughly to investigate trade union organizations' complaints of violation of the labour laws which protect trade union activity.However, as provided by law, and authorized under the legal system, the legal representative of the TALMANA S.A. enterprise appealed against the ruling. The ruling has not become absolute, since it was challenged as described and the National Association of Private Enterprise Workers (ANTEP) also filed an appeal for enforcement of constitutional rights (amparo) against the enterprise. As things stand, it is not true that the Ministry has not become involved in the aforementioned case, bearing in mind that it has gone as far as it is allowed under the legal system and there is no evidence of voluntary omission or violation of legal provisions.- The Corporacin Peter S.A. enterprise: there are no complaints of violation of freedom of association at this enterprise before the Labour Inspectorate, so it is surprising that a complaint has been made to the Committee before referring to the competent national bodies.- The Patisand S.A. enterprise: the inspection carried out at this enterprise confirmed that Elizabeth Salas had been dismissed at the time she was nursing her child, which is a violation of labour laws. A complaint was therefore lodged with the Labour Court. It was not proven that she was dismissed as a result of trade union persecution, but that this was on the aforementioned grounds.In this case, the allegation is repetitive and groundless because the case had already been referred to the Labour Inspection",-1,1993,Costa Rica
126,"services, which had taken the Patisand S.A. enterprise before the courts alleging violation of labour and social security legislation.This was because it was proved that the enterprise in question failed to comply with section  of the Labour Code, since despite the fact that the worker was nursing her child at the time, the enterprise failed to notify the National Directorate and General Labour Inspectorate of the dismissal and thus prove the misconduct given as the reason for justified dismissal, in accordance with the Labour Code.- The Corporacin Rojas Corts S.A. enterprise: on the basis of inquiries carried out by the Labour Inspectorate in various establishments belonging to the enterprise, the complaint was dismissed. The decision stands firm as it has not been challenged by those concerned.More specifically, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, through its Labour Inspectorate and labour affairs services, has dealt with all the requests for help to establish violations of various legal provisions, including the allegations of union persecution. The latter allegations have been dismissed because it has been impossible to prove that measures designed to hinder or stamp out trade union activity have been taken. A photocopy of the decision of the National Labour Inspection Directorate dated  June  and background information have been enclosed.- The Compaa Bananera Agropecuaria Ro Jimnez S.A.: the ANTEP representative requested a hearing in the Ministry of Labour to discuss a number of labour issues with employers' representatives. However, this meeting did not take place as the enterprise replied that labour relations were discussed with the workers' standing committee. The Government points out that at no time did the trade union in question lodge any complaint of union persecution against the workers dismissed, mentioned by the complainant. More specifically, the Government refutes the information on alleged union persecution, since the Ministry of Labour and Social Security has not been informed of any such complaint. Affidavits from the National Director and General Labour Inspector are appended.- The Industrias Realtex S.A. enterprise: this case is similar to that of the Corporacin Peter S.A., and Compaa Bananera Agropecuaria Ro Jimnez S.A. enterprises. The Government refutes the information provided since the alleged complaint of mass dismissals, including of branch members, in addition to the fact that there is no reliable proof, has not been registered with the Ministry of Labour and Social Security.In any case, there should be some indication of how the Department of Labour Relations of the Ministry in question has dealt with the requests for intervention made by ANTEP with regard to possible bankruptcies and dismissals at the enterprise. Representatives of the enterprise and the trade union were called to a meeting and the settlement reached was satisfactory to and signed by both parties.From the above it can be concluded that the additional information in question is groundless..Furthermore, the Government points out that the trade union organizations have gone as far as presenting complaints to an international body relating to situations which they made no attempt to resolve in due form by, first of all, exhausting national procedures. It is obvious that many of these problems could have been avoided if they had availed themselves of these procedures. In reality, and as has been observed, when they did refer disputes to the courts, the latter correctly applied both the ordinary law and ILO Conventions.
.Furthermore, the Government points out that the trade union organizations have gone as far as presenting complaints to an international body relating to situations which they made no attempt to resolve in due form by, first of all, exhausting national procedures.

In reality, and as has been observed, when they did refer disputes to the courts, the latter correctly applied both the ordinary law and ILO Conventions.
.In its communication dated  September , the Government states that it should be pointed out that the information on the legislative situation in Costa Rica affecting the exercise of the right to organize is littered with rash allegations designed to cast aspersions on the Government's resolve to do its utmost to improve the labour legislation in force in accordance with international standards. The Government recalls the report of the direct contacts mission to Costa Rica (October ) and the report of the Committee of Experts, , which includes Costa Rica in its list of cases of progress, specifically with regard to Conventions Nos. ,  and . Both reports clearly and openly state the improvements which have been made in labour legislation, improvements which go even further than the observations made by the ILO supervisory bodies, which is why the allegations are no longer relevant or have any legal basis.
.The Government adds that, contrary to what is stated by the complainants, the Government of Costa Rica, pursuant to the agreement reached with representatives of the major trade union organizations in November , began drafting regulations to improve the understanding and implementation of Act No. . The draft was transmitted for consultation to the representatives of the major trade unions, so that they could suggest amendments to the text and then, on the basis of consensus, the final version could be drawn up.
.It is essential to point out that the Government of Costa Rica, on  August , through a unique move in the history of labour legislation in Costa Rica, designed to bring the country up to date, reinstated the Central Labour Council and submitted a total of  international Conventions and  Recommendations adopted by the International Labour Conference for consultation to this national tripartite body. The Government is willing now and in the future to maintain permanent and open dialogue with this body on issues of national interest.
.The Government states that the administration or management of termination funds does not fall to solidarist associations alone. In practice there are provisions, on the basis of a collective agreement, governing trade union participation in the administration of dismissal compensation funds. At all events, the Government reaffirms its decision to support and make the necessary improvements to the Bill on occupational capitalization and economic democratization fund which was submitted to the Legislative Assembly by the previous Government. Of interest to this case, and as called for by the Committee of Experts, is the fact that the Bill does not restrict the administration of dismissal compensation funds to solidarist associations but has clearly made provision for trade union and cooperative organizations to be involved.
.The Government points out that the complainants' comments on section  of the Labour Code which prohibits strikes in the public services and the agricultural sector are no longer valid because a Bill on public employment drawn up with ILO technical assistance has been finalized and put before the Legislative Assembly. This Bill, inter alia, governs the right to strike by public servants in non-essential services in public institutions and defines the public services in which strikes are prohibited or restricted, in particular, through the establishment of minimum services. The provisions which drastically restricted strikes are therefore being repealed. As the situation stands, and since the Bill was drafted with ILO technical assistance, it is clear that the exercise of the right to strike, in general terms, complies with the principles of ILO supervisory bodies, which is why the comments made by the complainants in this regard have no legal or factual basis.
.With regard to collective bargaining in the public administration, the Bill on public employment was submitted to the Legislature in April  and published in the Official Journal (La Gaceta) on  July , in accordance with the national and international commitments made by the previous government. The Bill, inter alia, sets out the principles and general standards governing individual and collective relationships between the central and decentralized public administration and their employees, in accordance with the relevant legal principles. Thus, in respect of collective bargaining in the public sector, Title V of the Bill clearly recognizes the right of association and trade union membership of public employees and the rights derived therefrom. Similarly, it governs the collective bargaining system in the public sector, establishing the scope of application, guarantees for the efficient operation and continuity of essential services, in addition to the aims, conditions, procedures and limits of collective bargaining recognized at the national, occupational and institutional levels.
.In its communication dated  October , the Government reports that the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, through its competent administrative bodies, has dealt diligently and objectively with all the proceedings instituted by workers and their representative organizations with regard to the dispute in the Geest Caribbean Americas Ltd., Proyecto Islas enterprise. These administrative proceedings ultimately led to far-reaching agreements which ended the dispute.
.In a document dated  April , Mr. Luis Pablo Zuiga Morales, representing SITAGAH and FENTRAP, informed the Ministry of Labour and Social Security that workers on banana plantations , ,  and  belonging to the Geest Caribbean Americas Ltd. had been on",1,1993,Costa Rica
127,"strike for three days because the enterprise was refusing to negotiate the rates of pay for various tasks with standing committees, in accordance with the direct agreement. He also requested that the representatives of the enterprise be summoned to a meeting with a view to reaching a settlement. It should be noted that, far from criticizing the workers' standing committee, the union's request defends and promotes it, contrary to what is stated in the complaint presented to the ILO. On the same day,  April, there was a meeting between the parties to the dispute, at the request of the Minister of Labour and Social Security, at which an agreement was reached, thus ending the strike. On  April  the parties met to begin the negotiations provided for in the formal statement ending the strike. The negotiations were delayed on several occasions between then and  May  because the employer's representatives failed to attend. The Ministry of Labour and Social Security, throughout this situation, remained diligent and committed to establishing dialogue and understanding, as the records show.
.Nevertheless, the Government adds, although another meeting had been called for  May , a new unexpected strike broke out throughout the plantations belonging to Geest Caribbean, Proyecto Islas, Sarapiqu, in the province of Heredia. At that point, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security took steps once again to reach a settlement. In this context, a number of meetings were organized, which in some cases met with opposition from the enterprise, and it was arranged for the parties to the dispute to meet on  May . On the same day, through the mediation of the Minister of Labour and Social Security, the parties, namely the representatives of the SITAGAH organization and the Geest Caribbean Americas Ltd. enterprise met in the office of the Minister and signed an agreement to end the dispute. Subsequently, several meetings were held in the Ministry of Labour and Social Security to monitor compliance with the terms set out in the agreement.
.To date, the third item in the agreement is still to be resolved, hopefully in the next few days, since the legal representatives of the enterprise and the trade union organization attended the tenth meeting of the Committee on Work on Plantations held at the ILO, Geneva, Switzerland.
.The Government considers that the complainants are misrepresenting the facts by contradicting what they themselves stated in item  of the aforementioned agreement dated  May , to the effect that ""both parties place on record their gratitude to the Minister of Labour and Social Security, Dr. Farid Ayales Esna, for his timely and valuable mediation in this matter. Thanks to his diligence, the parties reached an acceptable agreement in the interests of industrial peace in the Sarapiqu area."" ""Both parties"" means the Geest Caribbean Americas enterprise and the SITAGAH trade union. This was how the situation stood and on the principle of good-faith bargaining and legal security, The Ministry of Labour and Social Security, by acting as mediator and finding a solution to the dispute has shown its commitment to ensuring respect for the terms agreed between the parties, and the case of Geest Caribbean has been no exception, as is clear from the documents appended. They show the Government's repeated efforts to ensure implementation of the terms of the oft-mentioned agreement dated  May , in full respect of the ""pacta sunt servanda"" principle.
.In this context, the Government considers that the complaint is rash, irrelevant and damaging to the principle of good faith since the process leading to implementation of the items in the agreement is under way, and the SITAGAH union leadership signed an agreement settling the dispute, but days later lodged a complaint with the ILO against the Government of Costa Rica alleging violation of freedom of association and interference by solidarist associations in union matters and collective bargaining at Sarapiqu banana plantations.
.One example to be noted is the incongruity in the union's position as it tries to take two different tacks at the same time. According to a memorandum dated  June  after the complaint referred to in this report had been lodged, the Secretary-General of SITAGAH asked the Ministry of Labour and Social Security to review the procedures for examining dismissals, as provided for in item  of the document dated  May. In the memorandum, he also provided information on the appointment by his organization of representatives to sit on the ""tripartite committee"" provided for in the document to look into the dismissals. In view of all this, the Government of Costa Rica cannot understand why the complainant organization is turning to an international body to make accusations against a government which has always been willing to deal with its problems. Furthermore, on  August  the Secretary-General of SITAGAH once again requested that, pursuant to labour legislation and the institution's rules of procedure, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security should summon the Geest Caribbean Americas Ltd. enterprise with a view to resolving the following problems: follow-up to the document dated  May  and the deduction of trade union dues, as requested by members and the trade union.
.As can be seen from the above, in terms of ministerial mediation, a series of efforts were made which resulted in a far-reaching agreement that ended the dispute. This confirms the rashness of the complaint in question in so far as it has neither a factual nor a legal basis, which is why it should be rejected outright, bearing in mind that it was lodged after the dispute was settled. Furthermore, it should be noted that the Government has gone beyond conciliation and mediation efforts. It went as far as carrying out labour inspections, through the National Directorate and General Labour Inspectorate of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security. Its efforts in dealing with the union claim of persecution and unfair labour practices are set out below.
.The National Directorate and General Labour Inspectorate have, at all times, carried out the necessary procedure to deal with the complaint of union persecution lodged by SITAGAH against the Geest Caribbean Americas Ltd. enterprise. At present, as can be seen from the information enclosed, the investigation into the matter is at the stage of receiving and analysing the documents provided by the complainant union.
.On the other hand, and since the complaint mentions alleged violent incidents between the Costa Rican Civil Guard and a number of workers, it is important to point out that the Civil Guard acted in compliance with a warrant from the office of the mayor of Sarapiqu, in the province of Heredia, on the basis of a decision of  May  that the police should re-establish access to the highway and remove obstacles preventing free circulation, as the highway had been blocked by a group of demonstrators. In any case, it should be noted that the security forces operate in accordance with the constitutional legal system and the competent judicial authority. The actions of the security forces which were present at the scene of the events and are mentioned in the complaint were in conformity with the prevailing legal order and institutional structures of our country.
.It should be pointed that the complainants instituted legal proceedings. However, their efforts came to nothing because they were badly planned, as the case was within the competence of ordinary labour courts, and not the Constitutional Chamber, where they lodged their grievance.
.Finally, the remaining allegations of unfair labour practices, including: the dismissal of workers belonging to trade unions, solidarist interference in union affairs, and the use of private police forces to prevent trade union expansion by the Geest Caribbean Americas Ltd. enterprise (Costa Rica branch) against the complainant trade union are being examined by the National Labour Inspection Directorate, which will submit a report.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee notes with satisfaction the recent legal provisions concerning protection against anti-union discrimination and guarantees preventing solidarist associations from engaging in trade union activities and that trade unions are not given unfavourable treatment as compared with solidarist associations.(b) The Committee urges that the Bill on the statutory regulations governing public employment and the civil service, collective bargaining and strikes in the public sector, and the Bill on the occupational capitalization and economic democratization fund (which provides that trade unions, as well as solidarist associations, may administer dismissal compensation funds) be adopted in the near future and that they will be in full confomity with the requirements laid down in ratified ILO Conventions. The Committee urges the Government to expedite the passage of both Bills and to continue this process with ILO technical assistance.(c) With regard to the Bills on the ""democratization of the public sector"", and ""the National Port Council"", the Committee requests the authorities engaged in consultations with trade union organizations, if they have not already done so, also to take measures to ensure that the prospective Act will allow workers",1,1993,Costa Rica
128,"of the National Port Council to enjoy the right to strike as a consequence of their freedom of action.(d) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of proceedings before the judicial authority relating to the alleged anti-union dismissal of ten workers at the TALMANA S.A. enterprise.(e) The Committee recommends that the Government take the necessary measures to enable the trade union leaders and members of the Corporacin Peter S.A., Compaia Agropecuraria Ro Jimnez S.A. and Industrias Realtex S.A. enterprises who have been dismissed because of their legitimate trade union activities to secure reinstatement in their posts.(f) The Committee urges the Government to reply to the allegations of anti-union dismissals and practices at the LACSA enterprise, on which it has not sent its observations.(g) The Committee takes note of the Government's intention to amend the legislation concerning trade union dismissal and urges the Government to take measures to ensure that, henceforth, the trade union official Mr. Rojas Vilchez is not prevented from taking trade union leave to which he is entitled.(h) With regard to the allegations surrounding the dispute between banana plantation workers and the Geest Caribbean Americas Ltd. enterprise, the Committee notes the Government's explanations and the fact that the National Labour Inspection Directorate will submit a report on the matter in the near future. While noting the serious nature of the allegations, the Committee will postpone consideration of them pending this report and requests the Government to inform it whether a judicial inquiry has been opened into the violent incidents which took place and left a number of workers injured.",1,1993,Costa Rica
129,".At its meeting in March , the Committee made the following recommendations on the pending allegations (see nd Report, para. ):- As regards the collective dispute in the LACSA enterprise (Case No. ), the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the appeal lodged by the representative of the Pilots' Association against the administrative resolution DRT-- and on the decision adopted by the National Labour Inspectorate Board on the complaint submitted by the Pilots' Association against LACSA for having violated the collective agreement.- As regards the collective dispute in Geest Caribbean Limited (Case No. ), the Committee:- - insists on the need that the agreement of  May , signed by the parties, be fully applied, including clause  concerning dismissals;- - requests the Government to ensure that trade union rights in the above-mentioned enterprise are fully respected, in particular protection against anti-union dismissals, the right of trade union officials to enter into contact with plantation workers with due respect for property rights and the guarantee that ""standing workers' committees"" (non-unionized) do not undermine the role of the representative trade unions in the enterprise. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the measures it takes in this respect and the outcome of the appeal lodged with the Constitutional Chamber against the administrative decision of  May ;- - requests the Government to keep it informed of the evolution of proceedings under way concerning the acts of violence which occurred in May  during the collective dispute in question, and to send it the text of the sentence handed down. The Committee insists that an investigation be undertaken on the allegations of acts of violence which were said to have been committed as much by the workers as by the police.
.In a detailed communication of  September , the Government indicated a number of steps which had been taken by the Ministry of Labour to resolve the dispute concerning the LACSA enterprise. The Government also mentioned the appeals and procedural tactics used by the parties which has delayed the outcome of the administrative procedure concerning the violation of the collective agreement, and which is still not over. As concerns the collective dispute at Geest Caribbean Ltd., the Government indicated that, in response to the Committee's recommendation, it carried out conciliation and mediation between the parties so that the agreement of  May , including section  concerning dismissals, be applied. The Government pointed out, however, that Geest Caribbean Ltd. ceased operating in May ; it has retained its legal personality but does not employ any workers in the country. The Government adds that, by Circular DM - of  June  (a copy of which was annexed), the Ministry of Labour gave instructions to the Labour Inspectorate for inspectors to ensure that trade union rights be fully respected in Geest Caribbean Ltd. and in the other companies in the country, including on the plantations, as well as to guarantee that ""the standing workers' committees"" (not unionized) not interfere with the role of representatives at the undertaking. Furthermore, circular DM - of  December  gives priority as a matter of urgency to any investigative procedures concerning disloyal work practices contrary to trade union rights, which should be transmitted immediately to the National Labour Inspectorate Board. The Government also indicates that it is not aware of any appeal before the Constitutional Court which was referred to by SITGAH. As concerns the evolution of the procedure concerning the violent acts which occurred in May  during the collective dispute at Geest Caribbean Ltd., the Government points out that the accused (former workers in the company and most of them Nicaraguans without papers) have not been found and that the procedures have been suspended, except as concerns one of them which was found to be without basis.
.The Committee takes note of this information. As concerns the collective dispute at LACSA (Case No. ), the Committee, while noting the delaying tactics evoked by the Government, deplores the delay in the administrative procedure concerning the violation of the collective agreement and recalls that the facts alleged in the complaint date to . The Committee emphasizes that procedures concerning violations of Convention No.  should be rapid so that the necessary measures of redress may be truly effective. An excessive delay in the examination of cases and, in particular, the absence of a decision for a long period of time is equivalent to the denial of justice and thus to the negation of trade union rights for the persons concerned.
.As concerns Case No. , the Committee takes note with interest of the steps taken by the Ministry of Labour along the lines of some of the recommendations previously made by the Committee concerning the collective dispute at Geest Caribbean Ltd. The Committee also takes note of the information provided by the Government according to which the penal procedures have been suspended since the persons concerned have not been found. The Committee notes that the company in question ceased operating in May  and requests the Government to indicate, according to the terms of the legislation, the possibilities for applying the agreement of  May  given the recent cessation of activities by the company in question.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) As regards the collective dispute in the LACSA enterprise (Case No. ), the Committee requests the Government to take steps to allow the  pilots dismissed from LACSA to be reinstated in their jobs if they so wish. The Committee also requests the Government to take measures to amend the legislation so that the right to strike may be guaranteed in the air transport sector and generally in all services which are not essential in the strict sense of the term.(b) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the appeal lodged by the representative of the Pilots' Association against the administrative resolution DRT-- and on the decision adopted by the National Labour Inspectorate Board on the complaint submitted by the Pilots' Association against LACSA for having violated the collective agreement.(c) As regards the collective dispute in Geest Caribbean Limited (Case No. ), the Committee:- insists on the need that the agreement of  May , signed by the parties, be fully applied, including clause  concerning the dismissals;- requests the Government to ensure that trade union rights in the above-mentioned enterprise are fully respected, in particular protection against anti-union dismissals, the right of trade union officials to enter into contact with plantation workers with the respect due for property rights and the guarantee that ""standing workers' committees"" (which do not belong to the union) do not undermine the role of the representative trade unions in the enterprise. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the measures it takes in this respect and the outcome of the appeal lodged with the Constitutional Chamber; and- requests the Government to keep it informed of the evolution of proceedings under way concerning the acts of violence which occurred in May  during the collective dispute in question, and to send it the text of the sentence handed down. The Committee insists that an investigation be undertaken on the allegations of acts of violence which were to have been committed as much by the workers as by the police.
.The complaints in Cases Nos.  and  are contained in communications from the Workers' Confederation (Rerum Novarum) (CTRN), dated  September and  October , and  January,  and  March . The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) expressed its support for the complaints in a communication dated  June .
.The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) presented additional information and new allegations in communications dated  August  and  March  respectively.
.The complaint in Case No.  is contained in a communication from the Heredia Union of Workers in Agriculture, Livestock and Allied Occupations (SITAGAH), dated  June .
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  May,  and  June and  and  October , and  February,  March,  and  April,  September and  October .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ) and the Workers' Representatives Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  June , the Heredia Union of Workers in Agriculture, Livestock and Allied Occupations (SITAGAH) also referred to the events mentioned in ICFTU's allegations made in its communication dated  June  (Case No. ). It explains that since  in the central district of the Sarapiqu canton in the province of Heredia, Republic of Costa Rica, banana plantations have been set up, belonging to the transnational English-funded banana marketing company Geest Caribbean Americas Ltd., Costa Rican branch. They employ , agricultural labourers, approximately",1,1992,Costa Rica
130," of whom were directly hired by the employer and the rest of whom are subcontracted.
.SITAGAH alleges that Geest Caribbean Americas Ltd. has, since , hired and subcontracted many migrant workers who did not have residence papers (Nicaraguans), who are not entitled to rights under Costa Rican labour law, using them as reserve labour and thus forcing Costa Rican banana plantation workers to accept below-average conditions of work, safety and pay. The employer's arbitrary actions led the workers to contact the SITAGAH union leadership in September , and hundreds of them joined the union, but the enterprise suppressed the union and prevented it from functioning, including by: dismissing workers who had joined the union, and elected union representatives; discriminating in terms of pay and conditions of work; unfair practices against the SITAGAH trade union; rescinding the freedom of trade union officers to meet with workers without the employer's prior authorization; promoting solidarist interference in trade union matters and resorting to violence (with a private police force to prevent unionization) and armed repression (workers were injured and beaten by the police force), in order to break the workers' legitimate strike.
.SITAGAH adds that since September  it has been applying for recognition and calling for a solution to its members' labour problems. Even though it has formally recognized the SITAGAH trade union, the employer continues to take up all labour issues with workers' standing committees affiliated to solidarist organizations, refusing to discuss them with SITAGAH.
.In April , the employer's arbitrary acts went as far as cutting workers' wages by more than , colones per fortnight, which provoked a three-day strike (,  and  April ), as a result of which the employer enterprise promised to negotiate with SITAGAH on wage issues, on the basis of an agenda drawn up by the trade union. However, the employer did not sit down to the negotiating table, but instead launched mass dismissals of workers belonging to the trade union, and subcontracted workers were removed from the plantation. The enterprise immediately called the migration authorities to ensure that the migrant workers who had no residence papers and who had joined the union were expelled from the country. This situation compelled the workers to call a further strike for - May . However, on  May, using a court order to open up a public right of way as an excuse, the Costa Rican police force, supported by Geest Caribbean private guards, under orders from the employer's representative, moved in on the strikers,  of whom received bullet wounds, three of them serious, leaving some workers unable ever fully to work again, and imprisoned  workers. To date, two workers are still missing. It should be pointed out that the workers were engaged in a peaceful strike - the strike had not been declared illegal because there were no grounds for doing so in view of the employer's arbitrary acts and the legitimacy and fairness of the workers' demands - however, the enterprise dismissed more than  workers, violating the trade union immunity (fuero sindical) to which they were entitled as the dismissals included representatives, elected by workers, on standing committees on the negotiating committee that discussed labour issues on the plantation with the Government and enterprise, and on grass-roots trade union committees, and included members of the trade union executive committee.
.Furthermore, SITAGAH points out that despite the fact that the problem has not been resolved and that SITAGAH boasts considerable membership among workers still in employment, the employer is preventing trade union officers from meeting freely with workers, using private guards to deny them access to plantations, preventing workers from holding meetings and communicating with persons outside the plantation. As these workers have stated, the Geest Caribbean plantation in Sarapiqu is a concentration camp with flowers, where trade union officers must ask permission of the employers even to speak with members, but may not communicate with other workers or hold union meetings. SITAGAH encloses a memorandum from the banana plantation manager, written and signed in his own handwriting, addressed to the private guards and stating that Mr. Pablo Zuiga is authorized to speak with trade union members. Nevertheless, the private guards have been present during conversations and workers could not express themselves freely.
.Meanwhile, the enterprise and the advisory body belonging to the banana industry solidarist movement in Costa Rica, the John XXIII Social School, in the midst of a labour dispute, in an effort to interfere in the dispute and pressurize workers to join the solidarist association, have set up four solidarist associations which have been approved by the Ministry of Labour without questioning their illegal origin.
.According to the complainant, the Government of Costa Rica adopted an Act on trade union immunity (fuero sindical) but in practice, as in cases such as this, it is not being applied. The Constitutional Chamber legitimized trade union immunity in an erga omnes ruling which is also not being implemented by any state judicial or administrative body in Costa Rica. The State approved legislation prohibiting solidarist associations from interfering in collective bargaining or acting against trade unions. However, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security continues to approve solidarist associations set up to damage trade unions, and approve the collective bargaining carried out between the employer and standing committees belonging to solidarist organizations, thereby excluding the trade union. In the specific case mentioned in this allegation, the employer has set up four solidarist associations and negotiates remuneration with the standing committee.
.The first labour policy move by the present government was to fire on and suppress the workers of the Geest Caribbean Americas company, who were engaged in legal strike action.
.In its communications dated  May,  and  October , the Government stated that the essence of the allegations contained in the general part of these cases harked back to the issues dealt with in Case No.  by the Committee on Freedom of Association and the most recent observations of the Committee of Experts, and that these matters were examined by a direct contacts mission to Costa Rica from  to  October . The Government points out that the current administration has shown particular interest in bringing labour legislation into line with the principles contained in Conventions Nos. ,  and , has set up a legal framework specifically designed to protect trade union organizations and their officers, and introduced various bills applying, with ILO technical assistance, the recommendations made by the Committee on Freedom of Association in its th Report, and by the Committee of Experts. The Government refers specifically to a recent Act, No.  of  November , which, inter alia, amends the Labour Code (with regard to trade union guarantees) and the Act on solidarist associations, bringing them into line with the provisions of the aforementioned Conventions. The Government adds that the claims of inequality between solidarism and trade unionism are false. On the contrary, the Government, on the basis of the recommendations made by the Committee as mentioned above, submitted a Bill to the Legislative Assembly on the establishment of an occupational capitalization and economic democratization fund, which changes the regulations governing compensation upon termination of a contract, thus making it a genuine right for all workers and placing trade unions and solidarist associations on an equal footing with regard to acting as administrators of these funds. Similarly, the Act of  November  reduces the minimum number of workers needed to set up a trade union to  (in other words, the same number as that required to set up solidarist associations), provides adequate protection against anti-union discrimination and updates the fines for violation of the Labour Code and ILO Conventions.
.With regard to the allegation of restrictions on collective bargaining and strikes in the public sector, the Government points out that it has been negotiating specific legislation on public employment which contains express provisions on the settlement of collective disputes and the right to strike in this sector since the beginning of  with trade union organizations (including the complainant). With regard to ruling No. - of Constitutional Chamber IV, the Government points out that, under the constitutional guidelines in force, the employment relationship between the public administration and its public servants is subject to ""particular or special criteria"" which do not allow the application of labour legislation on arbitration since the latter was drawn up to cover labour relations in the private sector alone. The Government adds that since public sector workers are barred access to arbitration machinery on the basis of the aforementioned ruling, on  March , following discussion with the Central Labour Council (a tripartite body), the Regulations on collective bargaining for public servants were issued, allowing collective bargaining and the exercise of trade union rights in the public administration. These Regulations remain temporarily in force while the corresponding legislation is being passed since, as a result of tripartite consultation, a Bill on the settlement of collective disputes in the public sector will be submitted to the",-1,1992,Costa Rica
131,"Legislative Assembly; this is part of the Bill on public employment and takes account of observations made by the ILO.
.With regard to the allegations concerning new legislation and bills supposedly undermining freedom of association and labour stability, the Government, in its communication dated  June , points out that the list of annexes sent by the complainants contains extracts from legislation, regulations and bills, and from doctrinaire magazine articles. The Government is therefore unable to comment since in order to do so an objective legal analysis would be required, which would be completely out of place in the present context.
.With regard to the refusal to grant the union leader Mario Rojas Vilchez unpaid leave for union business, the Government states that the refusal was based on the fact that Mr. Rojas Vilchez is not a permanent official because he has still not finished his probationary period as required under section  of the civil service statutes. Furthermore, the Government points out that it is willing to amend legislation on the teaching profession so that state teachers in particular and public servants in general may enjoy unrestricted trade union leave, bringing legislation into line with Convention No. . This amendment will be submitted for the approval of the Central Labour Council which is a tripartite body.
.With regard to the allegation of trade union persecution in several private sector enterprises, in its communications dated  October  and  February , the Government points out that with regard to:- The Confecciones Imperio S.A. enterprise: the CTRN requested that a meeting be held in the Ministry of Labour so that workers' representatives could settle the case, together with the enterprise, of a number of unjustified dismissals, assumed to have been reprisals against workers who had refused to join a solidarist association as they were members of the National Association of Private Enterprise Workers (ANTEP). During the hearing on  July , an agreement was reached whereby the workers who had been dismissed accepted the compensation due, instead of reinstatement.The Government refutes the information relating to alleged trade union persecution in the aforementioned enterprise since the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, through the National Labour Inspection Directorate and the National Labour Relations Directorate, has no record of any complaints, nor has it had through any other suitable channel any reliable evidence of such persecution.However, particular mention should be made of the effective intervention on the part of the Ministry, through its labour relations department, at the time of the alleged dismissals, and the subsequent favourable settlement under which compensation was paid, the minutes of the meeting showing that no reservations were entered by the trade union suggesting harassment.- The TALMANA S.A. enterprise: the labour inspector has heard the allegation made by the president of ANTEP concerning harassment of a number of workers on grounds of union membership and declared it receivable. He intends to institute the legal proceedings called for in the case of violation of labour laws. On  June  the complainant who had appealed for enforcement of constitutional rights (amparo) requested that the proceedings and appeal be withdrawn, upon which the Labour Inspectorate closed the case. Subsequently, the president of ANTEP was removed from office by a workers' assembly following internal disputes in the union, and the new representative asked that proceedings be resumed. The Labour Inspectorate agreed and is in the process of investigating the new allegations.In this regard, it should be pointed out that the National Labour Inspection Directorate issued a ruling on  February  in which it declared admissible the complaint of union persecution made against TALMANA S.A. by Mr. Carlos Acua Castro, president of the National Association of Private Enterprise Workers (ANTEP). This clearly shows that the Government of Costa Rica is prepared thoroughly to investigate trade union organizations' complaints of violation of the labour laws which protect trade union activity.However, as provided by law, and authorized under the legal system, the legal representative of the TALMANA S.A. enterprise appealed against the ruling. The ruling has not become absolute, since it was challenged as described and the National Association of Private Enterprise Workers (ANTEP) also filed an appeal for enforcement of constitutional rights (amparo) against the enterprise. As things stand, it is not true that the Ministry has not become involved in the aforementioned case, bearing in mind that it has gone as far as it is allowed under the legal system and there is no evidence of voluntary omission or violation of legal provisions.- The Corporacin Peter S.A. enterprise: there are no complaints of violation of freedom of association at this enterprise before the Labour Inspectorate, so it is surprising that a complaint has been made to the Committee before referring to the competent national bodies.- The Patisand S.A. enterprise: the inspection carried out at this enterprise confirmed that Elizabeth Salas had been dismissed at the time she was nursing her child, which is a violation of labour laws. A complaint was therefore lodged with the Labour Court. It was not proven that she was dismissed as a result of trade union persecution, but that this was on the aforementioned grounds.In this case, the allegation is repetitive and groundless because the case had already been referred to the Labour Inspection services, which had taken the Patisand S.A. enterprise before the courts alleging violation of labour and social security legislation.This was because it was proved that the enterprise in question failed to comply with section  of the Labour Code, since despite the fact that the worker was nursing her child at the time, the enterprise failed to notify the National Directorate and General Labour Inspectorate of the dismissal and thus prove the misconduct given as the reason for justified dismissal, in accordance with the Labour Code.- The Corporacin Rojas Corts S.A. enterprise: on the basis of inquiries carried out by the Labour Inspectorate in various establishments belonging to the enterprise, the complaint was dismissed. The decision stands firm as it has not been challenged by those concerned.More specifically, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, through its Labour Inspectorate and labour affairs services, has dealt with all the requests for help to establish violations of various legal provisions, including the allegations of union persecution. The latter allegations have been dismissed because it has been impossible to prove that measures designed to hinder or stamp out trade union activity have been taken. A photocopy of the decision of the National Labour Inspection Directorate dated  June  and background information have been enclosed.- The Compaa Bananera Agropecuaria Ro Jimnez S.A.: the ANTEP representative requested a hearing in the Ministry of Labour to discuss a number of labour issues with employers' representatives. However, this meeting did not take place as the enterprise replied that labour relations were discussed with the workers' standing committee. The Government points out that at no time did the trade union in question lodge any complaint of union persecution against the workers dismissed, mentioned by the complainant. More specifically, the Government refutes the information on alleged union persecution, since the Ministry of Labour and Social Security has not been informed of any such complaint. Affidavits from the National Director and General Labour Inspector are appended.- The Industrias Realtex S.A. enterprise: this case is similar to that of the Corporacin Peter S.A., and Compaa Bananera Agropecuaria Ro Jimnez S.A. enterprises. The Government refutes the information provided since the alleged complaint of mass dismissals, including of branch members, in addition to the fact that there is no reliable proof, has not been registered with the Ministry of Labour and Social Security.In any case, there should be some indication of how the Department of Labour Relations of the Ministry in question has dealt with the requests for intervention made by ANTEP with regard to possible bankruptcies and dismissals at the enterprise. Representatives of the enterprise and the trade union were called to a meeting and the settlement reached was satisfactory to and signed by both parties.From the above it can be concluded that the additional information in question is groundless..Furthermore, the Government points out that the trade union organizations have gone as far as presenting complaints to an international body relating to situations which they made no attempt to resolve in due form by, first of all, exhausting national procedures. It is obvious that many of these problems could have been avoided if they had availed themselves of these procedures. In reality, and as has been observed, when they did refer disputes to the courts, the latter correctly applied both the ordinary law and ILO Conventions.
.Furthermore, the Government points out that the trade union organizations have gone as far as presenting complaints to an international body relating to situations which they made no attempt to resolve in due form by, first of all, exhausting national procedures. It is obvious that many of these problems could have been avoided if they had availed themselves of these procedures. In reality, and as has been observed, when they",1,1992,Costa Rica
132,"did refer disputes to the courts, the latter correctly applied both the ordinary law and ILO Conventions.
.In its communication dated  September , the Government states that it should be pointed out that the information on the legislative situation in Costa Rica affecting the exercise of the right to organize is littered with rash allegations designed to cast aspersions on the Government's resolve to do its utmost to improve the labour legislation in force in accordance with international standards. The Government recalls the report of the direct contacts mission to Costa Rica (October ) and the report of the Committee of Experts, , which includes Costa Rica in its list of cases of progress, specifically with regard to Conventions Nos. ,  and . Both reports clearly and openly state the improvements which have been made in labour legislation, improvements which go even further than the observations made by the ILO supervisory bodies, which is why the allegations are no longer relevant or have any legal basis.
.The Government adds that, contrary to what is stated by the complainants, the Government of Costa Rica, pursuant to the agreement reached with representatives of the major trade union organizations in November , began drafting regulations to improve the understanding and implementation of Act No. . The draft was transmitted for consultation to the representatives of the major trade unions, so that they could suggest amendments to the text and then, on the basis of consensus, the final version could be drawn up.
.It is essential to point out that the Government of Costa Rica, on  August , through a unique move in the history of labour legislation in Costa Rica, designed to bring the country up to date, reinstated the Central Labour Council and submitted a total of  international Conventions and  Recommendations adopted by the International Labour Conference for consultation to this national tripartite body. The Government is willing now and in the future to maintain permanent and open dialogue with this body on issues of national interest.
.The Government states that the administration or management of termination funds does not fall to solidarist associations alone. In practice there are provisions, on the basis of a collective agreement, governing trade union participation in the administration of dismissal compensation funds. At all events, the Government reaffirms its decision to support and make the necessary improvements to the Bill on occupational capitalization and economic democratization fund which was submitted to the Legislative Assembly by the previous Government. Of interest to this case, and as called for by the Committee of Experts, is the fact that the Bill does not restrict the administration of dismissal compensation funds to solidarist associations but has clearly made provision for trade union and cooperative organizations to be involved.
.The Government points out that the complainants' comments on section  of the Labour Code which prohibits strikes in the public services and the agricultural sector are no longer valid because a Bill on public employment drawn up with ILO technical assistance has been finalized and put before the Legislative Assembly. This Bill, inter alia, governs the right to strike by public servants in non-essential services in public institutions and defines the public services in which strikes are prohibited or restricted, in particular, through the establishment of minimum services. The provisions which drastically restricted strikes are therefore being repealed. As the situation stands, and since the Bill was drafted with ILO technical assistance, it is clear that the exercise of the right to strike, in general terms, complies with the principles of ILO supervisory bodies, which is why the comments made by the complainants in this regard have no legal or factual basis.
.With regard to collective bargaining in the public administration, the Bill on public employment was submitted to the Legislature in April  and published in the Official Journal (La Gaceta) on  July , in accordance with the national and international commitments made by the previous government. The Bill, inter alia, sets out the principles and general standards governing individual and collective relationships between the central and decentralized public administration and their employees, in accordance with the relevant legal principles. Thus, in respect of collective bargaining in the public sector, Title V of the Bill clearly recognizes the right of association and trade union membership of public employees and the rights derived therefrom. Similarly, it governs the collective bargaining system in the public sector, establishing the scope of application, guarantees for the efficient operation and continuity of essential services, in addition to the aims, conditions, procedures and limits of collective bargaining recognized at the national, occupational and institutional levels.
.In its communication dated  October , the Government reports that the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, through its competent administrative bodies, has dealt diligently and objectively with all the proceedings instituted by workers and their representative organizations with regard to the dispute in the Geest Caribbean Americas Ltd., Proyecto Islas enterprise. These administrative proceedings ultimately led to far-reaching agreements which ended the dispute.
.In a document dated  April , Mr. Luis Pablo Zuiga Morales, representing SITAGAH and FENTRAP, informed the Ministry of Labour and Social Security that workers on banana plantations , ,  and  belonging to the Geest Caribbean Americas Ltd. had been on strike for three days because the enterprise was refusing to negotiate the rates of pay for various tasks with standing committees, in accordance with the direct agreement. He also requested that the representatives of the enterprise be summoned to a meeting with a view to reaching a settlement. It should be noted that, far from criticizing the workers' standing committee, the union's request defends and promotes it, contrary to what is stated in the complaint presented to the ILO. On the same day,  April, there was a meeting between the parties to the dispute, at the request of the Minister of Labour and Social Security, at which an agreement was reached, thus ending the strike. On  April  the parties met to begin the negotiations provided for in the formal statement ending the strike. The negotiations were delayed on several occasions between then and  May  because the employer's representatives failed to attend. The Ministry of Labour and Social Security, throughout this situation, remained diligent and committed to establishing dialogue and understanding, as the records show.
.Nevertheless, the Government adds, although another meeting had been called for  May , a new unexpected strike broke out throughout the plantations belonging to Geest Caribbean, Proyecto Islas, Sarapiqu, in the province of Heredia. At that point, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security took steps once again to reach a settlement. In this context, a number of meetings were organized, which in some cases met with opposition from the enterprise, and it was arranged for the parties to the dispute to meet on  May . On the same day, through the mediation of the Minister of Labour and Social Security, the parties, namely the representatives of the SITAGAH organization and the Geest Caribbean Americas Ltd. enterprise met in the office of the Minister and signed an agreement to end the dispute. Subsequently, several meetings were held in the Ministry of Labour and Social Security to monitor compliance with the terms set out in the agreement.
.To date, the third item in the agreement is still to be resolved, hopefully in the next few days, since the legal representatives of the enterprise and the trade union organization attended the tenth meeting of the Committee on Work on Plantations held at the ILO, Geneva, Switzerland.
.The Government considers that the complainants are misrepresenting the facts by contradicting what they themselves stated in item  of the aforementioned agreement dated  May , to the effect that ""both parties place on record their gratitude to the Minister of Labour and Social Security, Dr. Farid Ayales Esna, for his timely and valuable mediation in this matter. Thanks to his diligence, the parties reached an acceptable agreement in the interests of industrial peace in the Sarapiqu area."" ""Both parties"" means the Geest Caribbean Americas enterprise and the SITAGAH trade union. This was how the situation stood and on the principle of good-faith bargaining and legal security, The Ministry of Labour and Social Security, by acting as mediator and finding a solution to the dispute has shown its commitment to ensuring respect for the terms agreed between the parties, and the case of Geest Caribbean has been no exception, as is clear from the documents appended. They show the Government's repeated efforts to ensure implementation of the terms of the oft-mentioned agreement dated  May , in full respect of the ""pacta sunt servanda"" principle.
.In this context, the Government considers that the complaint is rash, irrelevant and damaging to the principle of good faith since the process leading to implementation of the items in the agreement is under way, and the SITAGAH union leadership signed an agreement settling the dispute, but days later lodged a complaint with the ILO against the",0,1992,Costa Rica
133,"Government of Costa Rica alleging violation of freedom of association and interference by solidarist associations in union matters and collective bargaining at Sarapiqu banana plantations.
.One example to be noted is the incongruity in the union's position as it tries to take two different tacks at the same time. According to a memorandum dated  June  after the complaint referred to in this report had been lodged, the Secretary-General of SITAGAH asked the Ministry of Labour and Social Security to review the procedures for examining dismissals, as provided for in item  of the document dated  May. In the memorandum, he also provided information on the appointment by his organization of representatives to sit on the ""tripartite committee"" provided for in the document to look into the dismissals. In view of all this, the Government of Costa Rica cannot understand why the complainant organization is turning to an international body to make accusations against a government which has always been willing to deal with its problems. Furthermore, on  August  the Secretary-General of SITAGAH once again requested that, pursuant to labour legislation and the institution's rules of procedure, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security should summon the Geest Caribbean Americas Ltd. enterprise with a view to resolving the following problems: follow-up to the document dated  May  and the deduction of trade union dues, as requested by members and the trade union.
.As can be seen from the above, in terms of ministerial mediation, a series of efforts were made which resulted in a far-reaching agreement that ended the dispute. This confirms the rashness of the complaint in question in so far as it has neither a factual nor a legal basis, which is why it should be rejected outright, bearing in mind that it was lodged after the dispute was settled. Furthermore, it should be noted that the Government has gone beyond conciliation and mediation efforts. It went as far as carrying out labour inspections, through the National Directorate and General Labour Inspectorate of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security. Its efforts in dealing with the union claim of persecution and unfair labour practices are set out below.
.The National Directorate and General Labour Inspectorate have, at all times, carried out the necessary procedure to deal with the complaint of union persecution lodged by SITAGAH against the Geest Caribbean Americas Ltd. enterprise. At present, as can be seen from the information enclosed, the investigation into the matter is at the stage of receiving and analysing the documents provided by the complainant union.
.On the other hand, and since the complaint mentions alleged violent incidents between the Costa Rican Civil Guard and a number of workers, it is important to point out that the Civil Guard acted in compliance with a warrant from the office of the mayor of Sarapiqu, in the province of Heredia, on the basis of a decision of  May  that the police should re-establish access to the highway and remove obstacles preventing free circulation, as the highway had been blocked by a group of demonstrators. In any case, it should be noted that the security forces operate in accordance with the constitutional legal system and the competent judicial authority. The actions of the security forces which were present at the scene of the events and are mentioned in the complaint were in conformity with the prevailing legal order and institutional structures of our country.
.It should be pointed that the complainants instituted legal proceedings. However, their efforts came to nothing because they were badly planned, as the case was within the competence of ordinary labour courts, and not the Constitutional Chamber, where they lodged their grievance.
.Finally, the remaining allegations of unfair labour practices, including: the dismissal of workers belonging to trade unions, solidarist interference in union affairs, and the use of private police forces to prevent trade union expansion by the Geest Caribbean Americas Ltd. enterprise (Costa Rica branch) against the complainant trade union are being examined by the National Labour Inspection Directorate, which will submit a report.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee notes with satisfaction the recent legal provisions concerning protection against anti-union discrimination and guarantees preventing solidarist associations from engaging in trade union activities and that trade unions are not given unfavourable treatment as compared with solidarist associations.(b) The Committee urges that the Bill on the statutory regulations governing public employment and the civil service, collective bargaining and strikes in the public sector, and the Bill on the occupational capitalization and economic democratization fund (which provides that trade unions, as well as solidarist associations, may administer dismissal compensation funds) be adopted in the near future and that they will be in full confomity with the requirements laid down in ratified ILO Conventions. The Committee urges the Government to expedite the passage of both Bills and to continue this process with ILO technical assistance.(c) With regard to the Bills on the ""democratization of the public sector"", and ""the National Port Council"", the Committee requests the authorities engaged in consultations with trade union organizations, if they have not already done so, also to take measures to ensure that the prospective Act will allow workers of the National Port Council to enjoy the right to strike as a consequence of their freedom of action.(d) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of proceedings before the judicial authority relating to the alleged anti-union dismissal of ten workers at the TALMANA S.A. enterprise.(e) The Committee recommends that the Government take the necessary measures to enable the trade union leaders and members of the Corporacin Peter S.A., Compaia Agropecuraria Ro Jimnez S.A. and Industrias Realtex S.A. enterprises who have been dismissed because of their legitimate trade union activities to secure reinstatement in their posts.(f) The Committee urges the Government to reply to the allegations of anti-union dismissals and practices at the LACSA enterprise, on which it has not sent its observations.(g) The Committee takes note of the Government's intention to amend the legislation concerning trade union dismissal and urges the Government to take measures to ensure that, henceforth, the trade union official Mr. Rojas Vilchez is not prevented from taking trade union leave to which he is entitled.(h) With regard to the allegations surrounding the dispute between banana plantation workers and the Geest Caribbean Americas Ltd. enterprise, the Committee notes the Government's explanations and the fact that the National Labour Inspection Directorate will submit a report on the matter in the near future. While noting the serious nature of the allegations, the Committee will postpone consideration of them pending this report and requests the Government to inform it whether a judicial inquiry has been opened into the violent incidents which took place and left a number of workers injured.",-1,1992,Costa Rica
134,".In its last interim report on this case (see th Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November )), the Committee requested certain information from the Government and, noting that the points of view expressed by the complainant organisation and the Government differed on several important issues, recommended the Governing Body to invite the Government to accept a direct contacts mission to Costa Rica so as to examine the allegations in full knowledge of the facts (see th Report of the Committee, paras.  and (h)). The Government accepted the mission in a communication dated  January .
.The Committee notes that the mission took place from  to  April  and was headed by Mr. Enrique Marn Quijada, Professor of Labour Law at the Central University of Venezuela and the Andrs Bello Catholic University; he was accompanied by Messrs. Bernard Gernigon, Chief of the Freedom of Association Branch of the ILO, and Alberto Odero, member of that Branch.
.The Committee notes that the mission was received by His Excellency, the President of the Republic, Rafael Angel Caldern Fournier, the Vice-President of the Republic, Germn Serrano Pinto, the Minister of Labour and Social Security, Carlos Monge Rodrguez, and several officials of the Ministry of Labour, and held meetings with the most representative workers' and employers' organisations, senior representatives of the Legislature and the Judiciary and professors of labour law, representatives of solidarist associations and other persons aware of the questions raised in the ICFTU's complaint. (Annexed to this paper are the mission report and the full list of persons and organisations with whom meetings were held.)
.The Committee observes with interest that the Government supplied the widest possible facilities to ensure the smooth running of the mission, and notes the strong spirit of cooperation shown by the authorities and the other interlocutors. It wishes to express its thanks to Mr. Enrique Marn for his detailed report on the issues raised in the complaint, of which it has taken due note. The Committee has also taken note of a communication from the Government dated  April , delivered by hand to the mission, the contents of which are reproduced below.
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  April , the Government states that the ICFTU's accusations concerning alleged violations of freedom of association are not true and requests the closing of this complaint. The Government indicates that in Costa Rica it is not only the solidarist associations who administer or participate in the management of the termination funds. There is no factual or legal monopoly in favour of the solidarist movement in this area, or discrimination against the trade union movement. What has happened in reality is that a normative process has begun, through collective labour agreements, which governs trade union participation in the administration of the termination funds of the workers. An example of this is the collective agreements concluded in the Grecia municipality, in the Council for the Administration of Ports and Development of the Atlantic Zone (JAPDEVA in Spanish) and in the Costa Rican Petroleum Refinery (RECOPE), where clauses covering this very point have been included.
.The Government adds that it is still willing and has decided to prepare legislative amendments to revise the standards covering the activities of solidarism in Costa Rica (the Solidarist Act), guaranteeing that the scope of union action will not be subject to discrimination.
.With regard to the ballots organised to determine the certification of a union for negotiation purposes when there is a request from a permanent committee of workers to negotiate a direct settlement, the Government repeats the statements it made in November  to the effect that, on this particular issue, only one ballot had been organised by the Ministry of Labour (General Labour Inspectorate) to solve the case of the BANDECO banana company when, on  June , the voters favoured the direct settlement instead of the conventional instrument (the collective agreement).
.In addition, the Government sends statistics on the number of unions and solidarist associations and on the total number of workers belonging to each of them. This shows that, despite the existence of a higher number of registered solidarist associations, in a process of joining together, the number of workers affiliated to unions is in fact the higher. The Government also sends statistics on the number of collective agreements and direct settlements by branch of activities and indicates that, in total, there are also more collective agreements than direct settlements (the Government no doubt refers to the total number of collective agreements and direct settlements throughout the period under examination). According to the Government's statistics, in  there were  unions (having , members) and  solidarist associations (having , members) and in ,  unions (with , members) and , solidarist associations (with , members); as for collective agreements and direct settlements, in -,  collective agreements and  direct settlements were concluded, in -,  collective agreements and  direct settlements, and in  to  February ,  collective agreements and  direct settlements were signed.
.Since the report of the direct contacts mission gives a summary of the allegations, of the Government's replies and of the Committee's conclusions in its two previous examinations of the case, the Committee can proceed directly to its conclusions.
.The Committee observes that this case raises three basic issues: () the alleged interference of solidarist associations in union activities including collective bargaining through the signing of ""direct settlements""; () the alleged existence of dismissals or other prejudicial acts based on trade union reasons or favouring membership of solidarist associations and the inadequate legal protection against this type of act; () the alleged unequal treatment between solidarist associations and unions in the legislation.
.As regards the alleged interference of solidarist associations in trade union activities including collective bargaining through ""direct settlements"" (concluded between an employer and a group of non-unionised workers, even when a union existed in the enterprise), the Committee observes that according to the report submitted by the representative of the Director-General, labour-related action (by the solidarist organisations) had resulted in the signature of a series of direct setlements. In addition, according to the mission report which cites government sources, the total number of current collective agreements in the private sector alone is , whereas there are  direct settlements. The Committee also notes that according to the mission report: ""The interference by solidarist associations in trade union activities was shown to the mission by representatives of the Government, of the academic world, or by union representatives and employer representatives and at least by a portion of the solidarist representatives interviewed."" The mission report goes on: ""In particular, the President and the First Vice-President of the Republic agreed that, in practice, solidarism was carrying out trade union functions and that it was necessary to separate by law their roles. Government authorities gave assurances that there was a willingness to adopt shortly appropriate legislative or other types of measures to guarantee the real separation of functions between unions and solidarist associations.""
.As for the alleged dismissals or other prejudicial acts based on trade union reasons or aimed at encouraging membership of solidarist associations, and the inadequate legal protection against this type of act, the Committee notes that the legislation does allow dismissal without the grounds being specified if the corresponding commpensation is paid (including cases involving trade union leaders) and that the fines for violations of the provisions of the Labour Code (at least those relating to freedom of association) are clearly outdated as the amount cited is  to , colones which is equivalent to less than US$. The Committee also notes that, according to the mission report, there was ""evidence from trade unions and from labour authorities that dismissals and other prejudicial acts based on trade union reasons had taken place and were continuing to take place"". The mission report ""noted wide consensus on the need to introduce detailed and appropriate legislation regarding trade union immunity (fuero sindical) which would grant effective protection. The Government, and in particular the President of the Republic, demonstrated the greatest willingness towards adopting effective legislation along these lines. The employers were not opposed to the principle of protection of trade union leaders (although they had misgivings regarding certain modalities) as long as the obligations concerning their leadership were laid out"". The Committee also notes that there is currently draft legislation elaborated by the Ministry of Labour which would considerably strengthen the fines for violations of the Labour Code and which would establish a new system.
.As regards the treatment under the legislation of solidarist associations and trade union organisations, the Committee notes from the mission report that: ""... there was no doubt that the law granted a series of advantages to solidarist associations over unions in certain areas (the minimum number of workers required, the possibility of engaging",0,1988,Costa Rica
135,"in profit-making activities, access to compensation in cases of justified dismissal, the possibility of managing termination funds, etc.)"". In this respect, the Committee observes that for a solidarist association to be formed  workers were needed, whereas a union required ; and yet most enterprises in Costa Rica employed barely  workers or less. The Committee also observes that, according to the mission report, ""There was wide agreement (Government, trade union organisations and employer organisations) on the need to abolish the discrimination which presently existed concerning the termination funds between workers who were members of a solidarist association and other workers; this could be done through legislation which extended the advantages contained in the Act on Solidarist Associations and which would declare access to such funds as a right of all workers, no matter how their employment relationship had been terminated"".
.From the information provided by the Director-General's representative in his mission report, the Committee concludes that the interference of solidarist associations in trade union activities including collective bargaining, through direct settlements signed between an employer and a group of non-unionised workers even when a union existed in the undertaking, does not promote collective bargaining as set out in Article  of Convention No.  which refers to the development of negotiations between employers or their organisations and workers' organisations. The Committee also considers that, since solidarist associations are financed partly by employers, are comprised of workers but also of senior staff and personnel having the employers' confidence and are often started up by employers, they cannot play the role of independent organisations in the collective bargaining process, a process which should be carried out between an employer (or an employers' organisation) and one or more workers' organisations totally independent of each other. This situation therefore gives rise to problems in the application of Article  of Convention No.  which sets out the principle of full independence of workers' organisations in carrying out their activities. The Committee therefore expresses the hope that the Government will urgently take the necessary legislative measures and other measures to guarantee that solidarist associations do not get involved in trade union activities.
.The Committee also observes that the current Labour Code allows dismissal without giving reasons if the corresponding compensation is paid (including the case of trade union leaders and of workers involved in trade union activities) and provides anachronistic fines for infringements of the provisions concerning freedom of association (between  and , colones, or less than US$). It concludes that this situation does not provide adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination as set out in Article  of Convention No. . The Committee observes that the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations is of the opinion that the law concerning protection against anti-union discrimination is not in conformity with Article  of Convention No. . It thus expresses the hope that the Government will urgently adopt the necessary legislative measures or other measures to guarantee the effective protection against any form of anti-union discrimination.
.Lastly, as regards the treatment in the legislation of solidarist associations and trade union organisations, the Committee concludes that the legislation does grant solidarist associations a series of major advantages over unions in certain areas, in particular as regards the minimum number of workers required, access to compensation in cases of justified dismissal, the possibility of managing the termination funds, etc. In this respect, the Committee takes note of the Government's intention to give statutory recognition of access to termination funds as a right of all workers, no matter how their employment relationship had been terminated. It considers that the legislation should also set out equal requirements for unions and solidarist associations as regards the minimum number of workers required for their creation. The Committee therefore expresses the hope that the Government will urgently take the necessary legislative measures and other measures to abolish any inequalities of treatment.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)The Committee takes note of the report of the direct contacts mission which took place in Costa Rica from  to  April  and observes with interest that the Government supplied the widest possible facilities to ensure the smooth running of the mission and the strong spirit of cooperation shown by the authorities and the other interlocutors.(b)The Committee notes that the legislative and practical situation has given rise to problems in Costa Rica concerning its application of Convention No. , and it notes with interest the Government's willingness to introduce legislation to ensure the real separation of functions between unions and solidarist associations and to adopt effective trade union immunity and other measures that would guarantee adequate protection against anti-union discrimination.(c)The Committee expresses the hope that the Government will urgently take the necessary legislative measures and other measures to guarantee that solidarist associations do not get involved in trade union activities, as well as measures to guarantee effective protection against any form of anti-union discrimination and to abolish any inequalities of treatment.(d)The Committee draws this case to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, and recalls that the ILO is at the Government's disposal to provide technical assistance in preparing draft legislation on the questions at issue.(e)The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in these matters.

.The complaint is contained in a letter from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) dated  December . The Government replied by letter of  March . At its meeting of May , the Committee asked the Office to obtain supplementary information from the complainants and the Government in order to proceed to the examination of this matter in full knowledge of the facts (see th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its May-June  Session, para. ). Subsequently, the ICFTU sent additional information in support of its complaint in a communication of  September . The Government sent its comments and observations in reply to this additional information in a communication of  January .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the first place, the Committee takes note with interest of both the additional specific information furnished by the complainant organisation and the observations furnished by the Government. The complainant organisation has raised questions concerning the existence and development of the so-called ""solidarist associations"" and the regulations governing them from the point of view of their conformity with Conventions Nos.  and . In particular the complainant has alleged that the solidarist associations are controlled by employers, aim to destroy the trade union movement and have given rise to a number of anti-union practices which, in recent years, have resulted in a considerable weakening of the trade union movement and the disappearance of many trade union organisations, presenting voluminous documentation to this effect. The Government has stressed that the solidarist movement is an expression of the constitutional right of association and that the growing popularity of the solidarist movement at the expense of the trade union movement is due in many cases to internal factors of trade union management which are beyond the competence of the Government. The latter denies the allegation that the solidarist associations have been set up by law as a means of manipulation by sectors outside the working class and that workers are obliged by law to belong to these associations. Lastly, the Government points out that section  of the Act respecting solidarist associations provides that such associations, their executive and administrative bodies and their legal representatives may not undertake any type of activity aimed at preventing or in any way impeding the establishment and operation of trade union and co-operative organisations, and that failure to comply with this provision is punishable by the dissolution of the association.
.The Committee observes that the  Act on solidarist associations provides that such associations may be formed by  or more workers. Section  defines the associations as follows:Solidarist associations are bodies of indeterminate duration which have their own legal personality and which, to achieve their purposes (the promotion of justice and social peace, harmony between employers and workers and the general advancement of their members), may acquire goods of all kinds, conclude any type of contract and undertake legal operations of any sort aimed at improving their members' social and economic conditions so as to raise their standard of living and enhance their dignity. To this effect they may undertake savings, credit and investment operations and any other financially viable operations. They may also organise programmes in the areas of housing, science, sport, art, education and recreation, cultural and spiritual matters and social and economic affairs and any other programme designed legally to promote co-operation between workers and between workers and their employers.Section  of the Act lists the income of solidarist associations as",0,1988,Costa Rica
136,"coming from the following:(a) The members' minimum monthly savings, the percentage of which shall be determined by the general meeting. The percentage may in no case be less than  per cent nor more than  per cent of the remuneration ... Members may save a higher sum or percentage voluntarily ... Members authorise their employer to deduct the relevant amount from their remuneration and to pay it to the association ...(b) The employer's monthly contribution on behalf of his workers, which shall be determined by common agreement between the two sides in accordance with solidarist principles ....The Committee expresses its serious concern at the weakening of the trade union movement in Costa Rica and the considerable decline in the number of trade union organisations in recent years. It appears to the Committee on the evidence so far available that these phenomena are connected with the development of solidarist associations. The Committee emphasises in this connection the fundamental importance of the principle of tripartism advocated by the ILO, which presupposes organisations of workers and of employers which are independent of each other and of the public authorities. Given the importance of this principle, the Committee expresses the hope that the Government will take measures, in consultation with the trade union confederations, to create the necessary conditions for strengthening the independent trade union movement and for developing its activities in the social field.

.So as to be able to examine more thoroughly the important questions raised in the present case, the Committee requests the Government to supply urgently precise information on the points to which it has not yet fully replied, namely: the specific cases of anti-union discrimination and pressure on workers to join solidarist associations referred to by the ICFTU; the scope of the legal protection available to workers and union leaders who are affected by such action; the existence of financial support given by employers to the solidarist associations and the form of any such assistance; the amount of financial assistance given by the Government to the solidarist associations and any assistance given to the trade union organisations; the cases of plebiscites organised within undertakings and the reasons why such plebiscites are held; the legal nature and the contents of direct settlements, as well as the circumstances in which they can be concluded; the cases where direct settlements were concluded although a union and a collective agreement were in existence; the participation of trade unions in economic activities as compared with the role played therein by the solidarist associations; the functions which might be or in fact are exercised by solidarist associations in the industrial relations domain; the functions which unions might be able to exercise or in fact exercise in the management of social funds and facilities.

137,".The complaint is contained in a communication of the National Association of Public Employees (ANEP) dated  February . The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  January .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The National Association of Public Employees (ANEP) alleges in its communication dated  February  that, as a result of strikes which it held in June  in order to obtain better working conditions and wages for the employees of the General Directorate for Social Rehabilitation (Ministry of Justice), criminal action was brought (and was still pending at the time of the complaint) against numerous workers, including trade union leaders Luis Arturo Chaves Alvarado and Johnny Garca Campos, for civil disobedience and contempt, and incitement to collective dereliction of public duties. These are criminal offences punishable by one or two years' imprisonment. The complainant organisation states that the trial was held despite the fact that the General Directorate for Social Rehabilitation and the ANEP had reached an agreement on  June , in which the Directorate undertook to refrain from carrying out reprisals against the strikers.
.In its communication dated  January , the Government states that the criminal action referred to by the complainant organisation was brought by the judiciary, through the body attached to it, the Public Prosecutor's Office, for alleged crimes of civil disobedience and contempt of public authority, since it involved a strike in a penitentiary, which was considered to disrupt the public order and the security which should be provided to citizens. The case was subsequently tried by the Third Criminal Court of San Jos, which rendered judgement No. - of  March , which concluded that there had been no disobedience, contempt or incitement to collective dereliction of public duties (punishable crimes according to sections ,  and  of the Penal Code), since it could not be proved during the trial and in the course of public oral debate that the trade union leaders Luis Arturo Chaves Alvarado and Johnny Garca Campos had committed such punishable acts; they were therefore acquitted, together with the other defendants. The Government encloses a copy of the judgement.
.Lastly, the Government emphasises that the complaint lodged by the ANEP against the Government is out of order as regards the object of such an action, because, although the plaintiff (the judiciary, through the Public Prosecutor's Office) constitutes part of the State, it does so as an authority which is independent of the executive power, and therefore the role of the Government or executive power should be to draw the attention of the judiciary to the need for obligatory compliance with Convention No. .
.The Committee observes that this complaint refers to the trial of trade union leaders and officials of the General Directorate for Social Rehabilitation for their participation in the strike movement of June . In this respect, the Committee notes that the judicial authority has acquitted the persons concerned and considers that this case does not call for further examination.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.",0,1987,Costa Rica
138,".The World Confederation of Organisations of the Teaching Profession submitted a complaint of infringement of trade union rights in Costa Rica in communications dated  and  October l. The Government replied on the matter in a letter dated  September l.
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, l (No.), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, l (No.).
.The World Confederation of Organisations of the Teaching Profession alleges that the premises of a member organisation, the National Association of Teachers, were searched and that the members of the Association were prosecuted in breach of an agreement signed by the Government and the unions of teachers represented by the Teachers' Front.
.The Confederation explains that on  July l an agreement was signed between the above-mentioned parties putting an end to the strike organised by the Teachers' Front. This agreement made provision for negotiations on a list of claims in support of which the teachers had gone on strike. The list related to salaries, the cost of school transport, the prices of certain goods and services (electricity, telephones, fuel, drinking water, transport) and the adjustment of increases in the salaries of public servants.Section  of the agreement provided that the Government undertook to take no measure of reprisal against workers of the Ministry of National Education, or against teacher-leaders or students because of the activities of the Teachers' Front. Lastly, in accordance with the agreement, the Government committed itself to negotiating with the Teachers' Front or alternatively to taking the measures provided for in the said agreement.
.However, according to the complainant Confederation, the premises of the National Association of Teachers in the town of Cartago were searched, documents were removed by the judicial authorities, and subsequently  teachers were taken to court for having - according to the National Association of Teachers - claimed improvements in social conditions and increases in salaries which the Government had been owing them for over two years.
.In respect of the searching of trade union premises and the court action taken against a number of unionised teachers, the Government replies that the executive authorities were not involved in these activities. They were carried out by the Office of the State Prosecutor, coming under the judicial authorities and therefore totally independent of the executive authorities.
.The Government explains that in Costa Rica strikes in the public sector and in public education, which is considered to be a high priority public service, are illegal since they infringe article  of the Constitution which provides for the right to education, which is compulsory. Furthermore, the Government states, book II, title XV of the Penal Code (section ) provides that an official or public servant who abandons his post without having legally terminated his functions, to the detriment of his service, shall be liable to a fine of  to  days' pay. Likewise, section , dealing with incitement to a collective abandonment of work in the public service, provides that any person inciting public servants or employees in the public service to abandon their work shall be liable to imprisonment of six months to two years and to a fine of  to  days' pay. Lastly, article  of the Constitution recognises the right to strike except in the case of workers in the public service.
.The Government maintains that the provisions in question are designed to ensure the normal running of public services for the population since, in its view, a strike in these services would undermine the very existence of the State.
.With its reply the Government encloses the text of a letter sent to the Ministry of Labour by the Head of the State Prosecutor's Office, stating that the Office in question comes under the judicial authorities and acts in complete independence as regards penal action. Consequently, the executive authorities played no part whatsoever in the proceedings taken against the teachers who took part in a strike that had been declared illegal. The letter admits that a number of trade union premises were searched, with a legal warrant, at the request of a representative of the State Prosecutor's Office since the law was looking for written proof of the connection between the trade union and the offence covered by article  of the Penal Code. The searches were carried out in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Penal Procedure and the trade union representatives in question have so far not proved that any administrative irregularities or abuse of power by the authorities occurred. The letter also refers to the statements made by the Government concerning the illegal nature of the strike in the public services, and points out that article  of the Penal Code, in respect of the collective abandonment of work by public servants or employees, causing prejudice to their service, is similar to article  of the Italian Penal Code.
.The Government adds that the examining magistrate of Puntarenas, who dealt with the initial stages of the case in November l, ruled that the case should be withdrawn and subsequently, and as an exceptional measure, adjourned the proceedings for one year. Furthermore, the examining magistrate of Cartago, who was also seized of the affair, likewise ruled that the case be dismissed but the State Prosecutor's Office appealed against this ruling and won its appeal before the Higher Penal Court (second chamber). However, the Government goes on, the judge of Cartago, who once again judged the substance of the case, acquitted the teachers on the grounds that the stoppage of their classes caused no prejudice to the teaching system and that, although the strike had been declared illegal by the Higher Civil Court, a large nummber of pupils had stayed away from school. The Government includes copies of the above-mentioned court rulings in its reply.
.Regarding the conversations with the Teachers' Front, the Government agrees that these did not take place but explains that this was because of divergencies within the organisation itself. It adds that it reached agreements in February and July l with the National Association of Teachers and includes in its reply a copy of the said agreements relating to increases in the salaries of public servants and the setting up of a joint committee to determine the increase in the number of articles to be added to the ""housewife's basket"".
.Furthermore, the Government furnishes the text of a Decree dated  June l to revise the said ""housewife's basket"", to which  articles have been added as compared with l in compliance with the agreement of  February  between the Government and representatives of the National Association of Teachers. The Government also forwards the text of another agreement whereby the manual describing classes and teaching jobs, drawn up by the General Directorate of the Civil Service in agreement with the union, is to be submitted to the Chairman and General Secretary of the National Association of Teachers; the manual is to be included in the draft budget for l as soon as its financial implications have been studied.
.In conclusion, the Government considers that, contrary to what the complainants alleged, it has acted responsibly in this case vis--vis the teachers of Costa Rica.
.The present case relates to reprisals said to have been taken against unionised teachers following a strike they had called to secure acceptance of claims of an essentially economic and occupational nature. The trade unionists in question were prosecuted under Costa Rican law for having taken part in a strike and the premises of their trade union were searched to discover the link between the trade union and the strike. The Government does not deny the facts, but explains that in accordance with Costa Rican law, teachers are public sector employees who do not enjoy the right to strike. Consequently the strike was declared illegal by the judicial authorities and, on the orders of the said judicial authorities, the trade union premises were searched and the teachers prosecuted. However, they were acquitted by the courts. The Government further maintains that agreements were reached with the persons concerned to bring this labour dispute to an end.
.The Committee notes with interest that, according to the Government, the trade unionists who had been prosecuted were acquitted and that agreements were reached with the National Association of Teachers to bring the dispute to an end.
.Nevertheless the Committee is obliged to draw the Government's attention to the importance it has always attached to the right to strike as a legitimate means of defending the economic and social interests of workers and their organisations. (See, in particular, Fourth Report, Case No.  (India), para. .)
.Although the Committee has recognised the principle that there may be restrictions on the right to strike, or even that strikes may be prohibited in the public service or in essential services (whether public, semi-public or private), it has frequently stated that this principle would become meaningless if the legislation defined the public service or essential services too broadly. Consequently the Committee, like",0,1984,Costa Rica
139,"the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, considers that any prohibition or restriction should be confined to public servants acting in their capacity as agents of the public authority or to essential services whose interruption would endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population. (See th Report, Case No. , (Canada/British Columbia), para. , and Case No.  (Brazil), para. .) The Committee considers that the teachers do not come under this category. (See, for example, st Report, Case No.  (Poland), para. ; th Report, Case No.  (Honduras), para. ; and th Report, Case No.  (Canada/British Columbia), para. , already cited.)
.The Committee therefore invites the Government to re-examine its legislation and, in particular, the provisions of the Labour Code (article  (a)) and of the Penal Code (sections  and ) so that the list of activities in which strikes are prohibited is confined to the public service and to essential services in the strict sense of the term.
.In the circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present report and, in particular, the following conclusions:a) The Committee notes with interest that in the present case the unionised teachers who had been prosecuted for having taken part in a strike were acquitted and that agreements were reached with the National Association of Teachers putting an end to this dispute.c) The Committee invites the Government to re-examine its legislation so that the list of activities in which strikes are prohibited is confined to public servants acting in their capacity as agents of the public authority or to essential services whose interruption would endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population.",-1,1984,Costa Rica
140,".The Committee examined this case at its May  Session and submitted an interim report to the Governing Body (see th Report of the Committee, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (May-June )).
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No.) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No.)
.In this case the complainant organisation had alleged that, as a result of an appeal lodged with the administrative authorities on  August  by one of the candidates not elected to the new national executive committee of the National Association of Public Employees (ANEP), the Ministry of Labour and Social Security took measures which resulted in the suspension of the registration of the election results until a decision had been taken on the objection, the freezing of the ANEP's bank accounts and retention of the check-off funds amounting to administrative suspension of the ANEP.
.The Government stated that its decision to investigate the validity of the elections was legally based on the Ministry of Labour's obligation to ensure that the unions operated in conformity with the provisions of the Labour Code concerning democratic voting procedures. The Government also stated that the decision to carry out an investigation arose out of a complaint by a candidate in the elections that there had been irregularities in the election procedures which justified their annulment.
.The Committee formulated, in particular, the following recommendations (see th Report, para. ): The Committee draws the Government's attention to the principle that in cases where the results of trade union elections are challenged such questions should be referred to the judicial authorities in order to guarantee an impartial and objective procedure which should also be expeditious. The Committee requests the Government to supply full and detailed information on the results of the inquiries that have been undertaken and to indicate whether any procedure exists for application to the courts concerning any administrative decision that may be taken in the matter. In order to avoid the danger of serious limitations on the right of workers to elect their representatives in full freedom, cases involving a challenge to the results of trade union elections should not - pending the final outcome of the proceedings - have the effect of paralysing the operations of trade unions. The Committee hopes that the measures taken by the Government will be lifted and that the workers' representatives who won the ANEP elections in August  will be authorised to fulfil their duties in full freedom until a decision on the validity of the elections is reached and that, if necessary, an appeal may be made to the courts for a final decision in the matter.
.The Government transmits, as an annex to its communication of  July , the text of judgement No.  of the First Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice, dated  December , dealing with an application for amparo (enforcement of constitutional rights) lodged by the General Secretary of the ANEP. In this judgement, it is decided, in particular, that the following shall be without effect: the administrative procedure suspending the registration of the executive committee of the ANEP, the retention of cheques representing members' dues and the non-payment of cheques drawn on the various current bank accounts.
.The preambular part of judgement No.  states in particular the following: The Ministry of Labour suspended the functioning of the National Association of Public Employees by refusing to register the new composition of the national executive committee and thus, to certify the legal capacity of the body and also by ordering administrative establishments and public corporations to retain the dues of the Association's members. It took those measures pending the outcome of an appeal lodged by one of the Association's members against the assembly that elected the members of the governing board. The case is therefore one of suspension of trade union activities by administrative order. This suspension violates freedom of association because it obstructs or prevents, albeit provisionally, the free functioning of the Association and restricts the right of association. The Ministry was empowered only to verify compliance with the legal requirements that the documentation must satisfy (a rule implied in section  of the Labour Code), for any questions that may arise between the members concerning anomalies in the assembly which do not appear in the record must be settled by the members before the labour courts. There is certainly no specific rule to that effect, but suspension of the registration of the governing board on grounds unconnected with the formalities of the documentation itself amounts to depriving the trade union of its legal existence pending an administrative ruling in a dispute which is of a judicial nature since the union cannot function without its executive organ (section , ibid). The foregoing criterion does not conflict with the provisions of section  already mentioned and section  of the Ministry of Labour Organisation Act because, although it is the Ministry's duty to watch over social organisations in order to ensure that they function strictly in accordance with the law, this does not imply freedom to take measures which prevent the normal activity of the body. Consequently, the measures referred to above are in breach of sections , ,  and  of the Political Constitution.
.The Government states that, after a delivery of judgement No.  dealing with the application for amparo lodged by the National Association of Public Employees, the Department of Social Organisations of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security proceeded to leave without effect the administrative procedure which had been started, to register the new governing board of the ANEP, to cancel the communications ordering retention of the check-off funds which had been sent out in virtue of the procedure started, to extend the approprate certification of the legal capacity of the ANEP and to inform those who had challenged the elections that their petition must be lodged through the judicial channel.
.The Government adds that, on the basis of judgement No. , the Department of Social Organisations of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security has rejected every application made to it for the purpose of challenging the results of trade union elections, indicating that representations on such matters must be examined through the judicial channel. Similarly, the practice followed by the Department of Social Organisations since the delivery of the aforementioned judgement has been to register the appointment of new executive committees as it occurs, without awaiting the outcome of any judicial proceedings challenging such appointments. The result is that the functioning of a trade union organisation whose executive committee is challenged is at no time paralysed by administrative order.
.The Committee observes with interest that judgement No.  of the First Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice, dated  December , expresses principles consistent with those enunciated by the Committee at its last session, objecting to the measures of administrative suspension of the ANEP, the freezing of the ANEP's bank accounts and the retention of check-off funds, which had been taken on the basis of an administrative appeal lodged by a defeated candidate for election to the new executive committee of the ANEP.
.The Committee observes in this connection that, as a result of judgement No. , the Department of Social Organisations of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security registered the new ANEP executive committee which had been elected, cancelled the communications sent out ordering retention of the check-off funds, and extended the appropriate certification of the legal capacity of the ANEP. Furthermore, in accordance with judgement No.  and with the principle advanced by the Committee at its last session, the Department of Social Organisations informed those who had challenged the elections through the administrative channel that any complaint on that subject must be made through the judicial channel.
.In these circumstances, having regard to the measures adopted by the administrative authorities as described above, the Committee considers that this case does not call for further examination.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.
.The National Association of Public Employees (ANEP) presented a complaint of violations of trade union rights in a communication dated  September ; it sent additional information in communications dated  October and  November . The Government sent its observations in communications dated  November  and  February .
.Costa Rica has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No.) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No.).
.In its communication of  September , the ANEP alleges that the Government violated Articles  and  of Convention No.  in that it suspended this organisation by administrative authority and at the same time it froze its assets and refused to hand over the check-off funds paid by ANEP's members.
.According to ANEP, in accordance with its duly registered by-laws, on  August , it held",0,1984,Costa Rica
141,"its annual general meeting which elected a new national executive committee. As required by the labour legislation, the new committee communicated the results of the election to the Department of Social Organisations of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security for it to update its records and issue the corresponding certificate of legal personality. The group which lost the elections lodged with the Department an appeal against the results and the Department decided to investigate the validity of the elections.
.The ANEP states that the authorities consequently suspended the registration of the election results until a decision bad been taken on the objection. They froze the ANEP's bank accounts and instructed the autonomous and semi-autonomous institutions and central bodies to refuse to hand over the check-off funds they collected from ANEP's membership. This, claims the ANEP, amounts to administrative suspension of a trade union organisation. It stresses that the Ministry has no power to do this under the national legislation and observes that the provisions of Act No.  on the functions of the Ministry of Labour do not empower the authorities to interfere in the internal affairs of a trade union, or in its elections, or after its elections in order to decide if they were valid or not.
.Lastly, the complainant cites several previous decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association concerning government intervention in the internal administration of unions and in elections.
.In its communication of  October , the ANEP states that on  September  it formally challenged the Ministry's decision to investigate the validity of the elections. In a decision dated  September, the Minister rejected this appeal and authorised the investigation to continue.
.In its communication of  November , the ANEP alleges that members of the Intelligence and Security Directorate of the Ministry of Public Security violently broke into the ANEP headquarters and took possession of some of its property. According to the ANEP, these persons also detained, without any reason being given, five leaders of the trade union, namely the Executive Director and Messrs. Johnny Garca Campos, Franklin Benavides, Hermn Guardiola and Vctor Arce. It claims that this action is part of the policy aimed at impairing the development of the trade union movement in the country.
.In its communication of  November , the Government states that it has not violated Convention No.  since the Convention itself (in Articles .  and ) obliges workers' organisations to respect the law of the land. The Labour Code of Costa Rica, continues the Government, in s. , requires that trade unions ""be governed by the democratic principles of majority rule, the secret ballot and one vote per person"" and, in s. , it empowers the Ministry of Labour and Social Security ""to exercise the strictest possible supervision over social organisations for the exclusive purpose of ensuring that the said organisations operate in conformity with the statutory provisions"". The Government states that the authorities are therefore obliged to inspect, prosecute and intervene to ensure compliance with the legislation and the legal principles which govern the functioning of trade unions. This obligation is especially important when a request is made by a member of a trade union who considers that his rights have been violated.
.According to the Government, in the present case, on  August , a member of the ANEP and unsuccessful candidate for the post of Secretary-General in the elections of  August , Mr. Jos Gerardo Riba Bazo, presented an objection to the Department of Social Organisations requesting nullification of the general assembly and therefore of the election results. The Government supplies a copy of his objection from which it appears that he disputes the election proceedings on the following grounds: the electoral committee criticised the candidates presented by Mr. Bazo's fa ction within the ANEP; the ballot paper presented by the other faction in the ANEP contained the names of candidates who were not workers employed by the State, which is contrary to ANEP's constitution, some ANEP officers delayed processing membership applications of  prospective members which were lodged by representatives of Mr. Bazo's faction  days before the date fixed for the general assembly; some ANEP officers concealed the general list of voters from representatives of Mr. Bazo's faction until  August  and the additional list was not presented until  August; these lists contained serious errors such as the repetition of the same name or identity number and the inclusion of persons who did not have the right to vote; the electoral committee met in the same place as the elections.
.The Government adds that the decision of  September  to reject the appeal against Mr. Bazo's objection was correctly made by the Ministry of Labour since it followed the principle of legality which governs the public administration.
.In conclusion, the Government stresses that the Department of Social Organisations is acting on the request of a member of the ANEP and not ex officio and that its investigation is not at all arbitrary. Its states it respects freedom of association and that the authorities' action is not aimed at obstructing or interfering in the formation of or affiliation to trade unions.
.In its communication of  February , the Government reiterates the background to the complaint and adds that the faction within the ANEP which won the elections sought injunctions (amparo) against three employees of the Ministry of Labour in an attempt to halt the inquiry into the election results and held public demonstrations criticising the Minister. According to the Government, bills were posted depicting the Minister as having committed a series of ""offences"". Without the Minister having so requested, the authorities decided to watch the ANEP headquarters with a view to seizing this offensive propaganda. Consequently, on  November  the following persons were apprehended carrying about  posters ready for distribution throughout the country: Vctor Arce Quesada, Franklin Benavides Flores, Rafael A. Cordero Herrera and Fidel Hermn Guardiola Sols. On the same day, following a judicial order and in accordance with the legal formalities, the ANEP's premises were raided. Various posters were confiscated and Mr. Johnny Garca Campos was detained. The Government, accordingly, denies that any other property belonging to the union was taken away and points out that all those detained were released at  p.m. the same day.
.The Committee notes that this case concerns a dispute over trade union elections in the ANEP which allegedly gave rise to the suspension of that organisation by administrative authority and, subsequently, a raid on its premises by the authorities and detention of five ANEP officers.
.The Committee notes the Government's statement that its decision to investigate the validity of the elections was legally based on the Ministry of Labour's obligation to ensure that the unions operate in conformity with the provisions of the Labour Code concerning democratic voting procedures. It also notes that the decision to carry out an investigation arose out of a complaint by a candidate in the elections that there were irregularities in the election procedures which justified their annulment.
.The Committee would first point out that the ILO supervisory bodies have frequently had occasion to formulate principles and considerations relating to intervention by the authorities in matters concerning contested elections in trade union organisations. Generally, it has been considered that the principles of freedom of association do not preclude outside control of the internal activities of an organisation if it is alleged that the law or rules have been infringed. Since measures taken by the administrative authorities are liable to be arbitrary, however, the supervisory bodies have considered that, while inquiries may be necessary in cases where irregularities have occurred or are alleged, such questions should be referred to the judicial authorities in order to guarantee an expeditious, impartial and objective procedure.
.The Committee requests the Government to supply full information on the results of the inquiries that have been undertaken and to indicate whether any procedure exists for application to the courts concerning any administrative decision that may be taken in the matter.
.Secondly, as regards the interim measures that have been taken against the union, the Committee notes that nothing in the Labour Code or Act No.  on the functions of the Ministry of Labour would appear to authorise the administrative authorities to suspend the registration of the election results, to freeze the union' s bank accounts and to defer payment of check-off funds while the investigation is being carried out. In this connection, the Committee has stated in previous cases (See, for example, th Report, Case No.  (Cyprus), para. .) that in order to avoid the danger of serious limitations on the right of workers to elect their representatives in full freedom, cases in which the results of trade union elections are challenged should not - pending the final outcome of the proceedings - have the effect of paralysing the operations of trade unions.
.The Committee accordingly trusts that the measures taken by the Government will be lifted and that the elected workers' representatives will be authorised",1,1984,Costa Rica
142,"to fulfil their duties in full freedom until such time as a decision on the validity of the elections is reached and that an appeal to the courts may be made, if necessary, for a final decision in the matter.
.As regards the raid by the authorities on ANEP's premises on  November , the Committee notes the Government's statement that this was carried out following a judicial order and in accordance with the legal formalities with a view to seizing propaganda documents that were considered offensive. Since confiscation was restricted to the various posters that were said to constitute the offence and no other union property was seized, the Committee considers that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.
.As regards the detention of five named ANEP leaders on  November , the Committee observes that they were held in connection with the legal confiscation of certain literature and were, according to the Government, released the same day without charges being brought. The Committee would generally draw the Government's attention to the principle that the detention of trade union leaders for reasons connected with the exercise of trade union activities, without specific charges being made against them involves a restriction on trade union rights. (th Report, Case No.  (Nicaragua), para. .)
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:(a) The Committee draws the Government's attention to the principle that in cases where the results of trade union elections are challenged such questions should be referred to the judicial authorities in order to guarantee an impartial and objective procedure which should also be expeditious.(b) The Committee requests the Government to supply full and detailed information on the results of the inquiries that have been undertaken and to indicate whether any procedure exists for application to the courts concerning any administrative decision that may be taken in the matter.(c) In order to avoid the danger of serious limitations on the right of workers to elect their representatives in full freedom, cases involving a challenge to the results of trade union elections should not - pending the final outcome of the proceedings - have the effect of paralysing the operations of trade unions.(d) The Committee hopes that the measures taken by the Government will be lifted and that the workers' representatives who won the ANEP elections in August  will be authorised to fulfil their duties in full freedom until a decision on the validity of the elections is reached and that, if necessary, an appeal may be made to the courts for a final decision in the matter.(e) The Committee considers that the raid on ANEP's headquarters on  November  does not call for further examination.(f) As regards the temporary detention of five named ANEP leaders on  November  in connection with the legal confiscation of certain literature, the Committee would generally draw the Government's attention to the principle that the detention of trade union leaders for reasons connected with the exercise of trade union activities without specific charges being brought against them involves a restriction on trade union rights.",1,1984,Costa Rica
143,".The Committee already examined this case at its February  meeting, when it presented an interim report approved by the Governing Body. (See th Report, paras. -.) . Since then, the Government has sent its observations in a communication dated  November .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No.), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No.).
.The Committee notes that the Government has supplied specific informationon the complainant's allegations, in particular, that examining magistrateshave investigated the matters and ruled, in one case, that the charges bedismissed, and in the other, that the matter remain under investigation for aperiod of one year in the absence of the witnesses for the prosecution. Sincethen (i.e. since  November ) the second matter has likewise been closed,no new information having been brought to the attention of the examiningmagistrate. Consequently, the Committee considers that this aspect of the caseno longer calls for further examination.
.The Committee likewise notes that, according to the Government only LuisRosales and Franklin Guzmn died during the strike.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that the case does not call for further examination.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the World Federation of Trade Unions dated  August . The Government replied by a letter of  November .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainant alleges that the Government brutally repressed the strike that was started on  July  by over , workers of the banana plantations belonging to the Banana Company of Costa Rica (most of which are owned by United Brands and the Standard Fruit Company) who were claiming wage increases and the negotiation of a new collective agreement.
.The complainant states that United Brands and the Standard Fruit Company secured from the Government a declaration that the strike was illegal. On the strength of this, on  July  the police took action against the strikers, killing Franklin Guzman and injuring an unspecified number of strikers. After  days' strike, the police opened fire, causing the death of strikers Luis Rosales and Jess Rosales and wounding ten other persons.
.The Government disputes the allegation that it took repressive action against the Costa Rican trade union movement either before or on the occasion of the strike held by the banana workers in July . Nor is it true to say that the Government granted United Brands and the Standard Fruit Company a declaration that the strike was illegal since such a declaration lies within the sole jurisdiction of the judicial authorities. The Government goes on to say that the illegality of the strike movement in question was declared by decisions of the Labour Court of Golfito ( July ) and of the Labour Court of Osa-Ciudad Corts ( July ), confirmed by decisions of the Higher Labour Court dated  and  July  respectively. The Government encloses a copy of the court decisions in question which indicate, as grounds for declaring the strike unlawful, the fact that the union had not started the conciliation and arbitration procedure provided for by law and that the trade unionists had barred the access of workers who wished to enter the plantations. In accordance with the provisions in force, the court authorities ordered the police to ""guarantee the continuation of work by all possible means, ensuring the safety of those workers who did not wish to join in the illegal movement but wanted to carry on with their work and providing protection for the assets of the Banana Company of Costa Rica"". The Government refers in this connection to section  of the Labour Code which provides that ""in the event of a legally declared strike or work stoppage, the labour courts shall immediately give orders to the police authorities for the establishments or businesses affected by the dispute to be kept closed and for due protection to be given to people and property. In the event of an illegal strike or work stoppage, the labour courts shall order the police authorities to guarantee the continuation of activities by all means within their power ..."".
.With regard to the strike and its consequences, the Government makes the following statements:- In July a strike broke out on the banana and palm oil plantations of the Banana Company of Costa Rica, in the area of Coto y Palmar Sur, which unexpectedly took on a violent character.- From the beginning the strike movement was unusually violent, involving a number of confrontations between the participants and the authorities of the civil guard who were trying to ensure access to the plantations for those workers who wanted to get on with their work.- It was regrettably in one of these confrontations, on  July , that Mr. Franklin Guzman lost his life and on  August  Mr. Luis Rosales Villegas, these deaths coming as a complete surprise to the civil guards who were in no way responsible for causing them apart from being obliged to deal with the strikers' violent action.- In the days preceding the incident, members of the civil guard had been in the area in which the events took place, passing in front of strikers organised into groups of regular size, without there having been any sort of harrassment or violence. During these days, the strikers' attitude was one of open dialogue and co-operation.- On the day of the events which led up to the death of Franklin Guzman an unusual number of strikers had gathered together from early in the day in the place where the event took place - some  at the time of the confrontation.- Only  civil guards, compared with a massive number of strikers, took part in the attack. The few civil guards who were attacked exhausted the means at their disposal for dissuading the strikers from continuing, as they had with them only a small number of tear-gas bombs. In the final resort, finding themselves practically surrounded by hostile workers and with several of their companions injured by stones thrown from various parts of the undergrowth, the civil guards used their regulation weapons, shooting into the air to intimidate the strikers and get them to disperse, which is what eventually happened.- At no time during these disturbances did the officers or privates who were present see any worker fall after being shot. It was only an hour after the confrontation had ended that a bus arrived on the scene carrying Mr. Guzman who was injured but still alive, and who died shortly after entering the Ciudad Neuilly hospital to which he was taken by police car.- The worker who died had been obliged to join the strike movement in the early hours of the morning, when he was practically dragged from his house, despite his wife's protests, to join the strike.- According to a verbal statement from the doctor at the Ciudad Neuilly hospital, who is a specialist in injuries of this kind, the wounded man's death was in fact due to the delay in taking him to the health centre since his life could have been saved by timely medical intervention and he could then have been sent to a hospital with a specialised medical and surgical team in San Jos.- In the confrontation Mr. Freddy Bustamante Mata, Mr. Jos Prez Prez, Mr. Lorenzo Muoz Esquivel and Mr. Eusebio Ruiz Noguera were also injured. Nevertheless in no case were the injuries caused by shots fired by the police.- With regard to the events of  August , which ended with the death of Mr. Luis Rosales Villegas, the facts were as follows: a noisy group of workers were on the Palmar banana plantations Nos.  and , seeking to bar the way of the civil guard authorities and throwing stones and sticks at them and at some houses, presumably those of the workers who had not joined the strike. In these circumstances and in order to safeguard private property, individuals and themselves, the civil guards after exhausting the possibilities of dialogue and persuasion had no alternative but to use tear gas. As this did not have the desired effect, they resorted to firing shots in the air.- In all the cases of confrontation the civil guard were undertaking routine duties at the time of the attack and there was no question of any operation prepared with the deliberate intention of repressing the strike movement. The injuries that occurred were all caused by the confusion arising out of the said confrontation and never as a result of isolated or deliberate action by the civil guard.
.The Government states that different offices of the judicial authorities (examining magistrates) are dealing with various cases to investigate all the events surrounding the deaths or injury of the strikers and to decide whether criminal liability can be attributed. According to",0,1984,Costa Rica
144,"the Government, so far nothing definite is known of the manner or circumstances in which the deaths occurred.
.The Government concludes by stating that the purposes of the strike movement had ceased to concern economic and social claims and had taken on a purely political character, as can readily be seen by the fact there are even workers who were forced to strike who are taking proceedings against communist leaders and representatives for payment of the wages they lost as a result of the strike movement.
.The Committee notes that the complainant alleges that, on the basis of a declaration that the strike started on  July  by workers of the Banana Company of Costa Rica was illegal, the police intervened on a number of occasions against strikers, causing the death of three strikers and injuring an unspecified number of others. According to the complainant, it was the employers who had secured from the Government the declaration that the strike was illegal.
.With regard to this declaration of illegality, the Committee notes the Government's statement that such declarations are a matter for the judicial authorities and not for the Government. The Committee observes in this connection that the Government has furnished the text of court decisions declaring the illegality of the strike started by banana workers on  July  for failing to meet the legal requirements: in particular because the trade union had not followed the conciliation and arbitration procedure provided for by law and because trade unionists had prevented workers who wished to continue working from having access to their workplaces. The Committee notes that, according to the court decisions referred to and the Labour Code, the workers of the Banana Company of Costa Rica may exercise the right to strike and the arbitration procedure takes place only by agreement between the parties.
.In this respect the Committee has stated on previous occasions (see, for example, th Report, Case No.  (Costa Rica), para. ) that legislation which provides for voluntary conciliation and arbitration in industrial disputes before a strike may be called cannot be regarded as an infringement of freedom of association. In these circumstances the Committee considers that the declaration that the strike started on  July  by the banana workers was illegal cannot be objected to from the point of view of the principles of freedom of association.
.As regards the intervention of the civil guard during the strike, the Committee notes that, as stated in the court decisions provided by the Government, the judicial authorities, in accordance with the law in force in respect of illegal strikes, gave orders to the police to guarantee the continuation of work, ensuring the safety of workers who did not wish to join the strike and protecting the property of the Banana Company of Costa Rica.
.With regard to the alleged consequences of the intervention of the civil guard during the strike which, according to the complainant, caused death and injuries among the strikers, the Committee notes that the Government only supplies information on two of the three workers who, according to the complainant, died (Mr. Franklin Guzman and Mr. Luis Rosales). The Committee also notes that, according to the Government, the exact form or circumstances of these two deaths have not been established and that the civil guards played no part in these deaths. The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the alleged death of the striking worker, Jess Rosales, to which it makes no reference in its reply.
.The Committee also observes that the Government recognises the fact that on the days when the two workers died the police fired shots in the air after having been attacked and having used tear gas. Nevertheless it cannot be established from the Government's statements that there was any connection between the shots fired and the deaths. In the case of Mr. Franklin Guzman, the Government states that he was brought by bus, injured but still alive, to the place where the confrontation had taken place between the strikers and the police on  July , an hour after the confrontation had ceased. In the case of Mr. Luis Rosales, who died on the same day as the confrontation between the strikers and police of  August , the Government has no concrete information to provide on the death of this worker.
.In the circumstances, the Committee deeply regrets the death of the workers Franklin Guzman and Luis Rosales, as well as the attacks which took place during the strike of the banana workers in July and August . It requests the Government to supply information on the outcome of the judicial investigations being carried out into the deaths and injuries which occurred.
.The Committee requests the Governing Body to approve this interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:(a) The Committee considers that the declaration of illegality concerning the strike which was started on  July  by banana workers cannot be objected to from the point of view of the principles of freedom of association since - as the judicial authorities pointed out - the trade union had failed to comply with the legal requirement of prior conciliation and arbitration laid down in the Labour Code;(b) The Committee deeply regrets the death of workers Franklin Guzman and Luis Rosales, and the physical attacks that took place during the aforementioned strike. The Committee requests the Government to supply information on the outcome of the judicial inquiries that are under way into the deaths and injuries that took place.(c) The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the alleged death of the striking worker Jess Rosales to which it makes no reference in its reply.",0,1984,Costa Rica
145,".The complaint is made in a communication from the National Federation of Electrical and Postal Communications Employees dated  May . The Government replied by a communication dated  June .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No.) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No.).
.The complainant alleges in its communication of  May  that, in violation of the collective agreement, Mr. Guido Nez Romn, General Secretary of the Industrial Union of Electrical and Telecommunications Workers, was dismissed in May  for having denounced cases of discrimination in the National Power and Light Company and corruption in certain quarters in the use of that company's property. The complainant states that the First Labour Court ruled in Mr. Nez Romn's favour, observing that the collective agreement had been violated by failure to follow the prescribed procedure. The Company appealed to the superior Labour Court which, in , delivered judgement on the same lines as the Court of First Instance. In April  the Company filed an application for cassation.
.The complainant further alleges that the collective agreement in force is repeatedly violated in the National Power and Light Company, specifically in the following instances:a) wage adjustment of  per cent for certain workers (section );b) seniority adjustment of . per cent in accordance with the collective agreement (section );c) appointment of staff at foreman level without holding a competition (section );d) refusal to give the Savings and Loan Fund to the workers, leaving it in the Company's name (section );e) refusal to grant other rights established for all workers in the collective agreement (sections , , ,  and others).
.Lastly the complainant makes a series of allegations which go back many years or which do not refer to violations of freedom of association.
.The Government states in its communication of  June  that, in the case of the dismissal of Guido Nez Romn, the procedure of dismissal without employer's liability was applied to him for having insulted, libelled and defamed the management and high officials of the undertaking in various documents which were signed or authorised by Guido Nez and which were circulated not only within the Company but also among the public. Although the case was, relatively speaking, won by Guido Nez at first instance, the Court stated:""There is no claim to lost wages under section  of the Labour Code because, although the offence with which the plaintiff was charged was not sufficiently serious to warrant dismissal, the fact is that, in the opinion of the undersigned, there was always a disrespect for the employer's representatives ..."". Later in the same judgement, the Court explained that the plaintiff had uttered his expressions with ""animus defendendi"" and not with ""animus injuriandi"", and on that ground it declared the dismissal null and void. Both parties appealed against the judgement delivered at first instance inasmuch as the plaintiff, among other petitions, asked for reinstatement, which had been refused at first instance; then the Superior Labour Court declared: ""And there is no doubt that, in view of the foregoing, the conclusion reached is that the grounds for dismissal were not met because the ""intention to insult"" was lacking, since the expression was framed in general terms, without specifying persons ..."". For these reasons the Court considered that, although the offence had been committed, dismissal was not the right penalty in view of the circumstances surrounding the case.
.The Government adds that, on  April , Guido Nez and the Company appealed against the judgement of the Superior Labour Court. The Second Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice concluded on  October  that ""in view of the phrases which occur repeatedly in the dossier - and which therefore need not be repeated - if we take into account this background, the plaintiff's position in defence of the workers and what he said in this letter in, perhaps, rather rough phrases, the truth is that he did not address them to a particular person or persons but in general terms to those running the Company. In these circumstances, there were insufficient grounds for punishing the plaintiff with dismissal rather than a disciplinary penalty of another magnitude, because the truth is that he did not use those phrases in his personal capacity ... . Therefore he must be excused payment of the costs because, although he committed the offence, it was not of such gravity as to warrant his removal from his post, in this case owing to the circumstances surrounding the events"". Guido Nez was again refused reinstatement by this Court, so that the only thing he was granted by the aforementioned courts at the conclusion of the proceedings was the award of costs.
.Lastly, with regard to the alleged violations of certain provisions of the collective agreement in force in the National Power and Light Company, the Government states that the instances referred to by the complainant are being discussed and clarified before the courts.
.With regard to the alleged dismissal of Mr. Guido Nez Romn, the trade union leader, in May  for having denounced cases of discrimination and corruption in the National Power and Light Company, the Committee notes that that Company applied to him the procedure of dismissal without employer's liability for having insulted, libelled and defamed the management and high officials of the undertaking.
.The Committee observes that, on  October , the Second Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice concluded at last instance that Mr. Guido Nez Romn's conduct constituted ""insufficient grounds for punishing the plaintiff with dismissal rather than a disciplinary penalty of another magnitude, because the truth is that he did not use those phrases in his personal capacity ...""; later, furthermore, the Supreme Court states that the offence was not of such gravity as to warrant his removal from his post. The Committee further observes that, although the aforementioned judicial decision recognised Mr. Nez Romn's right to payment of his costs, it denied him reinstatement in his employment.
.In these circumstances, the Committee can only conclude that the dismissal of Mr. Guido Nez Romn, the trade union leader, was motivated by his trade union activities, and constituted anti-trade union discrimination contrary to Convention No. . The Committee consequently requests the Government to take steps with a view to the reinstatement of this trade union leader in his employment.
.More generally the Committee wishes to point out that section  of the Labour Code of Costa Rica provides in its second subsection that:""If a dispute arises subsequent to the dismissal and due proof of the reason is not forthcoming, the employee shall be entitled to payment of the wages due in lieu of notice and to any leaving grant which may be due to him and, by way of damages, to the wages which he would have earned from the date of the termination of the contract to the date on which a final judgment is given against the employer"". In this connection, the Committee draws the Government's attention to the principle that it does not appear that sufficient protection against acts of anti-union discrimination - as set out in Convention No.  - is accorded by legislation which, in practice, enables employers, on condition that they pay the compensation prescribed by law for cases of unjustified dismissal, to get rid of any worker when the true reason for the dismissal is his trade union membership or activity. This in fact means that an employer, by paying compensation, can dismiss any member of his staff, for trade union or other activities, the public authorities being powerless to prevent him from doing so. Protection is particularly desirable in the case of trade union officials who, in order to be able to carry out their duties in full independence, must have the guarantee that they will not be prejudiced on account of the mandate which they hold from their trade unions. This guarantee is also necessary to secure respect for the principle that workers' organisations have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom (see, for example, th Report, Case No.  (Dominican Republic), para. ). Furthermore the Committee observes that the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has been emphasising to the Government for some years the importance of adopting specific provisions to establish remedies and sanctions for acts of anti-union discrimination. The Committee requests the Government to take steps in that direction.
.Lastly, with regard to the allegation concerning violations of certain provisions of the collective agreement in force in the Power and Light Company, the Committee wishes to recall that the relevant principle is that disputes arising over the interpretation or application of the provisions of collective agreements should be settled by bodies independent of the parties (see, for example, th Report, Case No.  (Peru), para. ). In this connection the Committee observes that the alleged violations are being clarified before the courts.",0,1984,Costa Rica
146,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the Trade Unions International of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur Workers dated  October . The Government replied in a communication of  January .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No.), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  October , the Trade Unions International of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur Workers alleges that the members of its affiliated organisation, the National Union of Workers in the Clothing, Textiles and Similar Industries, are victims of anti-union discrimination.
.The Trade Unions International states that during a visit made by its Deputy Secretary-General to Costa Rica in September , the latter observed that as soon as employers in the textiles and clothing factories learn that a worker belongs to a trade union, he is immediately dismissed; in cases where the employer refuses to pay the necessary compensation, he transfers the worker to jobs for which he does not possess the necessary qualifications. Consequently, the worker commits mistakes for which he is often penalised, giving a pretext to dismiss him without paying any compensation whatsoever and without calling into question the employers' responsibility. The complainant adds that on several occasions, the management of the undertaking has offered money to a worker suspected of belonging to a trade union in exchange for the names of other trade union members.
.The complainant states that in June  the management of the undertaking ""Interfasons Industries"" convened all the staff, after having dismissed a woman worker belonging to a trade union, to tell them that ""trade unionism is evil as it undermines society and democracy, and the lowest and most deplorable thing a worker can do is to join a trade union"".
.The complainant refers to undertakings in which as soon as a trade union is set up, the said undertakings immediately declare that they are bankrupt and dismiss all the staff; then, after a certain time, they reopen under a different name. The complainant cites as examples the YOLANDA undertaking which closed down in October , only to reopen under the name of TODOCEST in November ; the same happened to HILATURA NACIONAL which closed in May  and reopened in August of the same year. The complainant organisation concludes by stating that these examples bear witness to the efforts deployed by the management of the undertakings to prevent workers from exercising the rights contained in the Constitution and Labour Code of Costa Rica and in the ILO Conventions and Recommendations.
.In its communication of  January , the Government states, in the first place, that it notes with concern that many trade union organisations turn to the ILO without having availed themselves of the opportunity offered them by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security and the law courts of the country to settle this type of dispute.
.With respect to the allegation made by the Trade Unions International of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur Workers that several textile undertakings allegedly prevented workers from exercising their rights contained in the Constitution, the Labour Code and the ILO Conventions and Recommendations, the Government states that no cases of violation of freedom of association have been brought before the courts of the country. The only lawsuits brought before the First Communal Court (Menor Cuanta) and others within the Republic have been lodged against the Hilatura National undertaking for having dismissed some of its workers. The Government adds that no complaints whatsoever have been made against the other undertakings mentioned by the complainant.
.As far as the Hilatura National undertaking is concerned, the Government explains that this undertaking had closed down and declared that it was bankrupt as a result of the difficult economic situation; indeed, it was not alone, as several undertakings throughout the country had suffered the same fate. The Government concludes by stating that the dismissed workers and the undertaking finally reached a settlement, in which it was agreed that the legal compensation would be paid, thus putting an end to the dispute.
.The Committee notes that the present case refers to the dismissal of workers in textile and clothing undertakings. It also notes that, according to the complainant organisation, these dismissals had been prompted by the fact that the dismissed workers were members of its affiliated trade union organisation, the National Union of Workers in the Clothing, Textiles and Similar Industries.
.In this respect, the Committee notes the Government's statement, according to which these workers did not avail themselves of the opportunities provided by the national legal channels to assert their rights and settle these disputes. It also notes that the only case brought before the courts on the grounds of dismissal concerned the Hilatura National undertaking and that the latter had declared itself bankrupt as a result of the difficult economic situation; indeed, it was not the only undertaking in the country to be in this situation. In spite of this, the dismissed workers and the undertaking reached a settlement in which it was agreed that the legal compensation would be paid, thereby finding a solution to the dispute.
.In these circumstances, the Committee wishes to point out to the Government, as it has already done on previous occasions, the need to lay down explicitly in the legislation remedies and penalties for acts of anti-union discrimination and acts of interference by employers in workers' organisations in order to ensure the effective application of Articles  and  of Convention No. , ratified by Costa Rica. The same comments were also made by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations in its  General Report, when it examined the report submitted by the Government of Costa Rica on the above-mentioned Convention.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this report and, in particular, the following conclusions:(a) the Committee notes that, according to the Government, the dismissed workers did not, apart from one case, avail themselves of the national legal channels open to them to assert their rights;(b) it draws to the Government's attention, as the Committee of Experts has already done, the need to lay down explicitly in the legislation remedies and penalties for acts of anti-union discrimination and acts of interference by employers in workers' organisations in order to ensure the effective application of Articles  and  of Convention No. .",0,1983,Costa Rica
147,".The complaint presented by the Unitary Confederation of Workers (CUT) is contained in a communication dated  June . The Government replied in a communication dated  August .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The CUT alleges in its communication of  June  that the trade unionists Ricardo Quirs Castro, Edgar Salazar Murillo and Luis Angel Gamboa Venegas were arrested by the metropolitan police on  June  as they were putting up posters of the Committee on Central American of Trade Union Unity in the Amn district of the capital. According to the CUT, during the period of their detention, which lasted until almost midnight on  June, these trade unionists were subjected to numerous acts of ill-treatment and torture (blows, kicks, threats with dogs, insults, etc.) by officers of the National Security Agency, and remained blindfolded for more than  hours and without eating or drinking for more than  hours.
.The CUT includes a copy of the complaint lodged by the above-mentioned trade unionists against the National Security Agency, and which provides a detailed account of what happened.
.In its communication of  August  the Government states that it appears from the files of the Second Agency of the Public Prosecutor, of the Supreme Court of Justice, that the event which led to the arrest of the trade unionists is typical of those covered by legislation in force, in Title VI of the Penal Code referring to violations against property and patrimony, section , second paragraph of which reads as follows: ""Imprisonment of between three and  days and a fine will be imposed for: () Notices on walls. On those persons who, for the purposes of advertisement or propaganda and without the permission of the owner or possessor, or of the respective authority, as the case may be, writes or draws on or attaches papers or posters to the exterior part of a building, whether public or private, residential house or wall"". On the basis of this legal provision, the trade unionists referred to by the complainant were found guilty of disturbing the peace and defacing public property.
.Furthermore - the Government continues - it should be stressed that the propaganda in question did not concern a trade union activity in the strict sense of the term but made statements such as ""End the foreign invasion in Central America"" which are in no way related to trade union matters.
.As regards the allegations concerning the supposed treatment of the trade unionists during the period of their detention, the Government states that the national security officers accused before the courts say that they fully respected human rights as regards the treatment given to the detainees and that they acted in accordance with the procedure established by regulations of the ministry of Public Security concerning interrogations.
.However, the Government points out that the proceedings against the security officers in question are still pending in the First Penal Court. At the same time, a detailed enquiry is being held by the Office of Human Rights of the Attorney-General of the Republic, the results of which will be immediately communicated as soon as they are available.
.The Committee notes that the allegations concern the arrest of three trade unionists (Messrs. Ricardo Quirs, Edgar Salazar and Luis Angel Gamboa) for two days, as well as acts of torture and the unsatisfactory conditions of their detention.
.The Committee notes that it appears from the allegations and the Government's reply that the event which led to the arrest of the trade unionists was the posting of bills in public places without authorisation, an act which is punishable under the second paragraph of section  of the Penal Code by the deprivation of liberty when the fixing of posters is carried out ""without the permission of the owner or possessor, or of the respective authority"". The Committee accordingly considers that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.
.As regards the unsatisfactory conditions of detention and the acts of torture to which these trade unionists were allegedly subjected, and which are described in detail in the complaint lodged, by the latter before the judicial authorities of Costa Rica, the Committee expresses its deep concern at these allegations. The Committee notes that, according to the Government, a detailed investigation is being carried out by the First Penal Court and by the Office of Human Rights of the Attorney-General, the results of which will be transmitted. The Committee hopes that the Government will inform it shortly of the results.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this report and in particular the following conclusions:(a) The Committee notes that the trade unionists Ricardo Quirs, Edgar Salazar and Luis Angel Gamboa remained in detention for two days for putting up, in public places, posters without authorisation. It considers that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.(b) The Committee expresses its deep concern at the allegations concerning unsatisfactory conditions of detention and the acts of torture which according to the complainant, were suffered by the above-mentioned trade unionists. The Committee hopes that the Government will send it shortly the results of the inquiry into the matter.",0,1983,Costa Rica
148,".The complaint is contained in communications of the Sole Confederation of workers, dated  March and  April . The Government replied in communications dated  May and  August .
.Costa Rica has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  March  the Sole Confederation of Workers (CUT) alleged that the Trade Union Association of Water Supply and Sewage Workers (ASTRAA) was violently ejected from its premises with the intervention of the police.
.The CUT then refers in its communication of  April  to the collective dispute that arose in the Chiriqui Land Company and PAIS, S.A. banana plantations in September . The complainant alleges that on  September  a totally unsuitable collective agreement was signed between the Chiriqui Land Company Workers' Union (SITRACHIRI) and the undertaking and that, in violation of the provisions of section (c) of the Labour Code this agreement was not submitted to the general meeting for final approval. The complainant adds that in the face of this situation the workers sought the assistance of the Union of Agricultural Workers of Limn (UTRAL) in denouncing the collective agreement that had been signed - which it described as a management manoeuvre since, according to the complainant, the SITRACHIRI was set up by the Chiriqui Land Company - and in getting a new collective agreement signed which would really settle the problems created by the difficult conditions of work and life of the workers. From then on workers began leaving the SITRACHIRI in large numbers and at the same time joining the UTRAL, whose membership now includes  out of the  workers of the Chiriqui Land Company. Despite this, the company refused to grant the workers' requests that the union dues deducted from their wages be handed over to the UTRAL.
.At about the same time, continues the complainant, the PAIS, S.A. undertaking put pressure on its workers to sign a direct settlement which disregarded the workers' interests, as a result of which large numbers of workers joined the UTRAL and called for the negotiation of a genuine collective agreement. In the end, the undertaking imposed the direct settlement.
.The complainant points out that on  January , having received no communication from either the Chiriqui Land Company or PAIS, S.A. nor from the authorities since the dispute began, a strike was called and received the support of  per cent of the workforce it all the plantations belonging to the Chiriqui Land Company and PALS, S.A. According to the complainant, both before and after the strike began the following incidents occurred, which it considers violations of trade union rights:- days before the strike was called, the plantations were occupied and controlled by three companies of the civil guard;  workers were detained, as were the members of a CUT delegation who had travelled to plantation  for the purposes of familiarising themselves with the facts and offering their solidarity. According to the complainant, the civil guard detained the trade union leaders Luis Carlos Montero, Jess Garbanzo, Jess Campos, Felipe Rodriguez, Herminio Dover and Mauricio Solana, following a skirmish with the civil guard. The complainant does admit, however, that some of the workers possessed small calibre weapons which they used for hunting in the region. Furthermore, in plantation , after the workers had held a meeting with their leaders, the latter together with the majority of the workers were detained. The complainant declares that the total number of trade union leaders and workers detained amounted to ;- at  a.m. on  January  a worker named Narciso Morales Valdelomar was shot and later died. One of his children, a daughter aged , had her leg shattered by a gunshot and Juan Luis Aguilar, a negotiator and former executive of SITRACHIRI, was also wounded;- the civil guard forced striking workers on several occasions to return to their work posts, and the homes of many of them were broken into with, in some cases, the doors being forced with the butts of guns;- as a result of the strike, foreign workers, with and without residence permits, were expelled from the country and many workers were dismissed. According to the complainant the civil guard also detained a delegation of trade union leaders comprising Dr. Marielos Giralt Bermdez (Vice-President of the CUT), Ignacio Robles Oropeza (General Secretary of the Workers' Union of the University of Costa Rica) and other trade union leaders who were bringing food to relieve the inhuman situation in which the dismissed workers found themselves. These persons have been able to confirm that the conditions in which they and the others were detained were extremely distressing (minimum conditions of existence, psychological torture and sexual assault).
.The complainant concludes by pointing out that criminal charges have been brought against trade union leaders and workers who participated in the strike.
.In its communication of  May  the Government declared that when the General Secretary of the ASTRAA notified the office of the Minister of Labour and Social Security of the cancellation of permission to use the trade union premises assigned to the ASTRAA by the management of the Costa Rican Institute of Water Supply and Sewerage, the Labour Inspectorate was ordered to carry out an investigation. This investigation found that there had been violations of Convention No.  and in particular management interference in the organisation and conduct of trade union activities. The Government adds that as the management of the Institute had paid no heed to the request of the labour inspector that the ASTRAA be permitted to use the premises and be granted similar facilities to those it had previously enjoyed, the Minister of Labour ordered the Labour Inspectorate to institute legal proceedings with a view to obtaining the imposition of the sanctions provided for in cases of non-observance of the labour laws, the outcome of which will be communicated to the Committee. However, the Government states that in the light of the investigations carried out by the Labour Inspectorate it can be concluded that the civil guard were not called in to eject the trade unionists from the premises.
.As regards the collective disputes that arose in the Chiriqui Lard Company and PAIS, S.A. undertakings, the Government encloses a communication from the Ministry of Labour and Social Security in which it points out that in January  there was a physical confrontation between a democratic trade union and a leftist trade union and that the Ministry is not, competent to deal with the allegations concerning confrontations with the police, detention of trade union leaders and other acts of violence, or the acts of sabotage denounced by the management. As to the validity of the collective agreement concluded between the Chiriqui Land Company and SITRACHIRI, the Government states that it was legally registered after the Ministry's legal assistant had declared that it complied with the labour provisions in force. The Government adds that, according to the legislation in force, case law and doctrine, it is not possible for the Ministry to intervene at the request of a trade union body other than the one signing the collective agreement in question with a view to obtaining the management's agreement to negotiate a new draft collective agreement. Nevertheless, continues the Government, the point of view expressed by the complainant organisation in declaring the collective agreement in force to be a ""pseudo agreement"" is very subjective. Proof of this is the fact, for example, that the basic wage rate approved in this collective agreement at the time of its registration was the highest in all the country's banana plantations.
.The Committee notes that this case refers, on the one hand, to the cancellation of permission to use the trade union premises of the Trade Union Association of Water Supply and Sewage Workers (ASTRAA), and, on the other hand, to the causes and consequences of the collective dispute that arose in the Chiriqui Land Company and PAIS, S.A. undertakings.
.As regards the cancellation of permission to use the ASTRAA trade union premises, the Committee notes that the management of the Costa Rican Institute of Water Supply and Sewerage ignored the request of the Labour Inspectorate to permit the ASTRAA to use the trade union premises previously available to it once the Inspectorate found that the cancellation of such permission was an infringement of Convention No. . The Committee also notes that the Minister of Labour ordered the Labour Inspectorate to institute legal proceedings against the Institute with a view to obtaining the imposition of the penalties in force for non-observance of the labour laws. In these circumstances, the Committee can only urge the Government to continue to do all in its power to ensure that, as soon as possible, the ASTRAA is enabled to use its trade union premises once again and to request it to inform the Committee of the outcome of the proceedings instituted against the Costa Rican",0,1982,Costa Rica
149,"Institute of Water Supply and Sewerage.
.As regards the matters which, according to the allegations, gave rise to the collective dispute in the Chiriqui Land Company (invalidity of the collective agreement signed on  September  and failure of the undertaking to respond to the request to sign a new agreement), the Committee notes the information supplied by the complainant and the Government and observes that, according to the latter, the collective agreement signed on  September  conformed to the labour provisions in force. The Committee considers in this regard that it cannot form conclusions as to the validity of the said collective agreement, not only because it does not have sufficient information, but also because of the time that elapsed between the date on which the collective agreement was signed ( September ) and that on which the complainant formulated the allegations ( April ), a period of more than six months during which the collective agreement had in principle been in effect without apparently any of the parties having appealed to the courts with a view to contesting its validity. In this regard, the Committee recalls, as it has pointed out on previous occasions, that recognition by an employer of the main unions represented in his undertaking or the most representative of these unions is the very basis for any procedure for collective bargaining on conditions of employment at the level of the undertaking. The Committee has already insisted that the competent authorities must take appropriate conciliatory measures with a view to obtaining such recognition by the employer concerned.,
.As regards the allegations concerning the consequences of the collective dispute and the strike in the Chiriqui Land Company and PAIS, S.A. undertakings, the Committee notes that it has already made recommendations on this matter in Case No.  and consequently refers to the conclusions made during the examination of that case, in which, in particular, it deeply deplored the death of the worker, Narciso Morales Valdelomar which occurred during the dispute.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this report and in particular the following conclusions:(a) As regards the cancellation of permission to use the trade union premises of the ASTRAA, the Committee urges the Government to continue to do all in its power to ensure that, as soon as possible, the ASTRAA is enabled to use its premises once again and requests it to inform the Committee about the outcome of the proceedings instituted against the Costa Rican Institute of Water Supply and Sewerage.(b) As regards the consequences of the collective dispute in the Chiriqui Land Company undertaking:(i) the Committee considers that it cannot form conclusions as to the validity of the collective agreement signed on  September  between the Chiriqui Land Company and SITRACHIRI because it has insufficient information and because of the long period of time that has elapsed since the signing of the collective agreement;(ii) the Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that recognition by an employer of the main unions represented in his undertaking or the most representative of these unions is the very basis for any procedure for collective bargaining on conditions of employment at the level of the undertaking.(c) As regards the consequences of the collective dispute and the strike in the Chiriqui Land Company and PAIS, S.A. undertakings, the Committee notes that it has already made recommendations on this matter in Case No. . Consequently the Committee refers to the conclusions made during the examination of that case, in which, in particular, it deeply deplored the death of the worker, Narciso Morales Valdelomar, which occurred during the dispute.",1,1982,Costa Rica
150,".In a telegram dated  January , the world Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) presented a complaint relating to the violation of freedom of association in Costa Rica. Shortly thereafter in a telegram dated  February , the Trade Unions International of Agricultural, Forestry and Plantation Workers (TUIAFPW) associated itself with the initial complaint by the WFTU. The Government forwarded its observations in letters dated  and  February .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their telegrams, both the WFTU and the TUIAFPW denounce the repressive action against striking workers in the Sixaola area in the Chiriqui Land Company banana plantations. The complainants strongly protest against the brutal violation of the right to strike of the Costa Rican workers.
.They allege that one of the workers, Narciso Morales Valdelomar, was murdered and that dozens of workers were wounded and over  arrested, including the Under-Secretary General of the Sole Federation of Workers (CUT), Luis Carlos Montero, and the Secretary-General of the National Federation of Plantation Workers. These two trade union leaders have apparently been brought to trial.
.In its communication dated  February , the Government firstly makes the general statement that these allegations are completely unfounded, puerile and intended only to prejudice the Government politically and undermine national prestige.
.The Government then gives the following explanations of the events. It claims that there has been no general or legal strike in the agricultural enterprise mentioned by the complainants. Eight months before, the Sitrachiri trade union, which is affiliated to the Costa Rican Confederation of Democratic Workers (CCTD), signed a collective agreement with the enterprise which was still valid and legally registered with the ministry of Labour. However, on  January  the trade union submitted a list of claims in order to have the agreement revised.
.Also according to the Government, the Union of Workers of Limon (UTRAL), affiliated to the Marxist-Leninist-biased CUT organised on  January  a two-day blockage of the places of work by using pickets formed by trade unionists, some of whom worked on the banana plantations but a large number of whom were outside elements who had come to the area to prevent the workers from going to work. Faced with this abnormal situation whereby the workers were attempting to obtain representation by force and illegally in order to sign a new collective agreement, the Government declared the movement illegal in exercise of its lawful powers. It obtained a court order for police to be sent to the area to guarantee free access to the places of work and the basic right to work and to eliminate the elements that were using force and intimidation to deny the workers these rights.
.As a result of the confrontations caused by resistance to police intervention, a worker was accidentally killed. The Government explains that, when the civil guard fired to disperse a group that was offering open and violent resistance, this worker was hit by a fragment of a projectile which had ricocheted off a solid surface, as was established by the ballistic tests carried out by the competent body at the request of the judiciary.
.Moreover, adds the Government, all the participants in the confrontation were arrested, along with the persons responsible for damaging , metres of cable used for the transportation of fruit and for causing damage of the order of  million colones. The Government acknowledges that the Marxist-Leninist union leaders, Luis Carlos Montero and Erminio Dover were among those arrested. It explains that the latter have been charged by the Attorney-General of the Republic with sedition, aggression, threatening behaviour and causing bodily harm with firearms and that their union status does not in any way exempt them from penal action.
.The Government states that the two leaders and the other participants in these unlawful acts have been released pending further legal action but are still under the orders of the regular courts by which they will be tried.
.The Government adds that most of the workers returned to work normally as soon as their places of work were cleared of subversive elements and that the atmosphere in the Sixaola area is one of the absolute peace, harmonious employer-employee relations and normal working conditions, as was confirmed by a public declaration by the CCTD, a copy of which the Government attaches to its reply.
.The Government also attaches a press cutting dated  January  reporting the expulsion of several foreigners without work permits, including four Panamanians, ten Nicaraguans and one Salvadorian, who are thought to have instigated the acts of violence that occurred in the Sixaola area.
.Finally, in an additional communication dated  February , the Government adds that the CCTD is sending a telegram to the ILO vehemently denouncing the CUT's aggression against the Confederation, which it describes as trade union piracy. The text of the telegram is as follows: ""The problem of the strike in the Sitrachiri banana plantation is a move by the Communist Workers' Confederation against us as signatories of the collective agreement; there has been no violation of freedom of association but an aggression against the right to bargain collectively by the Communist Confederation. We request that you take note of this fact and take action against these acts of trade union piracy"". It is signed by the Secretary-General of the CCTD, Luis Arando Gutierrez Rodriguez.
.The Committee notes that this case concerns the violent death of a worker and the many arrests during the labour dispute in the Sixaola area in the Chiriqui Land Company banana plantations.
.The Committee also notes that, without denying the facts, the Government explains how, according to it, the events took place, claiming, on the one hand, that they derive from inter-union rivalry and that the most representative union, the CCTD, did not agree to call a work stoppage and, on the other, that the forces of order intervened in a number of violent clashes as a result of which one worker was killed.
.The Committee notes that, as the Government itself says, the civil guard fired to disperse the demonstrators and it deeply deplores the death of the worker, Narciso Morales Valdelomar, which the Government claims was accidental, as shown by the ballistic tests ordered by the judiciary. It requests the Government to take steps to ensure that such a situation does not recur.
.As regards the arrest of two trade union leaders and many participants in the disturbances in the area, the Committee notes that the persons concerned are at present free and that same of them are to be tried for common law offences.
.Finally, the Committee notes that the atmosphere in the area is now one of the absolute peace, according to both the Government and the CCTD. On the other hand, the complainants, who were offered the possibility of supplying additional information in support of their complaints, have not chosen to do so.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the following conclusions:(a) The Committee deeply deplores the death of the worker, Narciso Morales Valdelomar, which occurred when the civil guard fired to disperse the demonstrators but which, according to the Government, was accidental as shown by the ballistic tests ordered by the judiciary. In this respect, the Committee requests the Government to take measures to ensure that such a situation does not recur.(b) The Committee notes that the trade union leaders and many participants in the disturbances who had been arrested have been released and that some of them are to be tried for common law offences.(c) Finally, as regards the labour disputes that arose in the Chiriqui Land Company banana plantations the Committee notes that, according to the most representative union, the CCTD, an atmosphere of absolute peace reigns in the Sixaola area. The Committee also notes that the complainant organisations have not supplied additional information in support of their complaints, as they had been invited to do. In these circumstances, the Committee considers that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.",0,1982,Costa Rica
151,".The Committee already considered this case at its meeting in November  when it presented an interim report to the Governing Body. Since then, the Government forwarded its observations in a communication of  February , which arrived too late to be considered by the Committee at its previous meeting.
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its original communication, the Sole Confederation of Costa Rican Workers (CTC), an organisation affiliated to the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), alleged that the enterprise known as the Tempisque Sugar Works, where a union was formed for the protection of workers' rights, the Tempisque Sugar Workers' Trade Union (UTRACAT), affiliated in turn to the CTC, had repeatedly persecuted a number of the workers through penalties and dismissals.
.According to the complainant, in October , the UTRACAT trade union leader, Claudio Gamboa Valverde, was dismissed without grounds because he was a member of the union's executive Committee. Furthermore, in May , the enterprise, taking advantage of the fact that harvesting was over, is alleged to have dismissed about  workers with permanent jobs because they belonged to the UTRACAT. Moreover, in May , the enterprise allegedly dismissed a trade union leader named Santos Gmez Hernndez and, in June , Fernndez Gimnez, the union's secretary for training.
.Attached to the complainant's communication was a letter addressed by it on  June  to the Minister of Labour, requesting the latter's intervention in obtaining the reinstatement of the dismissed trade union leaders. The complainant explained that Mr. Santos Gmez Hernndez, before belonging to the UTRACAT's executive Committee, had been chairman of the Standing Committee of the Workers, at which time he had encountered no difficulties. However, according to the complainant, when Mr. Gmez became a union member and denounced the illegal persecutions imposed by the enterprise, which refused to draw up and enforce internal works rules, he was dismissed on a false accusation of drunkenness. As regards the dismissal of the secretary for training, Mr. Fernndez Gimnez, the complainants explained that he was dismissed on grounds of ""reorganisation"" whereas his own supervisors had stated that ""in view of his output, he could keep his job and would not be dismissed during the reorganisation that was to take place"". One month later, nevertheless, he was dismissed on the grounds of reorganisation. In the complainants' view, the true reason for this dismissal originated in the fact that Fernndez Gimnez had come to the assistance of a group of peasants who were being forced by their boss, Mr. Hernndez, in teams of  workers to spray  bags of fertilizer which, in the climatic conditions in which the work is performed, constitutes unfair and inhumane condition of work. Mr. Hernndez, having learned the name of the person making claims on their behalf, namely Mr. Alfonso Fernndez Gimnez, had him dismissed.
.As regards the allegation of dismissal of the three trade union leaders, the Minister of labour stated that, on receipt of the complaint, his department had requested the enterprise to state the reasons why it had terminated the contracts of Claudio Gamboa Valverde, Santos Gmez Hernndez and Alfonso Fernndez Gimnez. Although he considered that there had not been any antiunion discrimination, the Minister explained that an inquiry was under way.
.As regards the allegation that, in May , the enterprise, taking advantage of the fact that the harvest was over, terminated the contracts of  workers because of their union membership, the Minister of Labour stated that, under the terms of the inquiry that was carried out on his instructions at the time when the enterprise needed the maximum number of workers for harvesting, the total workforce amounted to , workers,  of whom belonged to the UTRACAT; at the end of the harvest, the total dropped to ,,  of whom belonged to the union; and that, when the temporary work was over, the total number of employees was ,  of whom belonged to the UTRACAT. Thus, the enterprise showed that it had terminated the temporary contracts of a larger number of non-union workers than of workers actually belonging to the union.
.At its meeting in November , the Committee accordingly recommended the Governing Body to note that, as regards the allegation concerning the dismissal of three trade union leaders quoted by the complainant, an inquiry had been ordered by the Ministry of Labour. The Committee requested the Government to keep it informed of the results of the inquiry and expressed the hope that if it were found that the trade union leaders had not committed any serious offence and were dismissed only on account of trade union membership or activities, the Government would endeavour to obtain their reinstatement. Concerning the alleged dismissal of approximately  permanent workers because they belonged to the UTRACAT, the Committee requested the Government to specify whether workers enjoying permanent employment and belonging to the UTRACAT were dismissed by the enterprise to which the complaint refers and, if so, for what reason.
.In its communication of  February , the Government explains that the inquiry carried out by a labour inspector proved that the allegations of dismissal of trade union leaders constituting acts of anti-union discrimination were unfounded.
.Thus, according to the Government, the cancellation of the contract of employment of Santos Gmez Hernndez is lawful, considering that he committed on several occasions offences which, under sections (c) and () of the Labour Code, authorise the employer to terminate the contract of employment unilaterally. The documents attached in support of the Government's observations on the dismissal of Mr. Santos Gmez Hernndez reveal that he was severely admonished for turning up to work in a state of drunkenness and that he was warned that he would be dismissed if he did so again.
.As far as Alfonso Fernndez Gimnez is concerned, the enterprise proved that he was dismissed within the context of a necessary reduction in staff due to economic difficulties. The Government explains that the person concerned, who at first was a foreman during the sugar cane harvest, was transferred at the end of the harvest to statistical duties and that economic difficulties had led the enterprise to terminate the contracts of employment of several persons, including Alfonso Fernndez Gimnez.
.Finally, concerning the dismissal of Claudio Gamboa Valverde, the facts are, according to the Government, the following: he was the chief industrial relations officer of the enterprise, a position of trust since, as an employers' representative, be was responsible for the conduct of and improvement in relations between the workers and the enterprise. These duties were judged to be incompatible with his trade union membership. The Government states that the employer, like the ministry of Labour, considered that his membership was prejudicial to the exclusive loyalty owed by a senior executive to the interests he represented and which he must scrupulously respect. Faced with this breach of trust, the enterprise decided to terminate the contract of employment of Claudio Gamboa. However, the Government adds, neither the enterprise nor the authorities subjected him to any discrimination whatsoever. On the contrary, on  December , the Executive appointed him as one of the workers' members of the National Wages Council for the period -, as attested by Decree No.  TSS of  December , a copy of which is attached to the Government's communication.
.Concerning the allegation of the dismissal of about  permanent workers because they belonged to the UTRACAT, the Government explains that, as far as activities related to harvesting are concerned, it is impossible to speak of ""permanent work"", since the national practice is that, at the beginning of the harvest, employers take on staff to whom other jobs which depend on the volume of work to be done for the period in question, will be assigned for a certain time. In these circumstances, these staff cannot be classified as staff having permanent contracts, so that criteria of anti-union discrimination can be applied to it, as the complainant seeks to show. Thus, the permanent contracts which do exist in the firm are limited to other categories of persons who were not affected by the dismissals.
.The Committee notes that in this matter of allegations concerning the dismissal of trade union leaders and militants, the complainant's and the Government's versions contradict each other. According to the complainant, the Tempisque Sugar Works launched a campaign of persecution against unionised workers by dismissing union leaders and militants on the pretext that the sugar cane harvest was over. On the other hand, according to the Government some of the dismissals were for specific reasons: Santos Gmez Hernndez was dismissed for turning up for work several times in a state of drunkenness and Claudio Gamboa Valverde for engaging in trade union activities, when at the same time as chief industrial relations officer, he occupied a position of trust in the management of the enterprise; others took place for economic reasons: this was",0,1981,Costa Rica
152,"the case of the workers mentioned by the complainant, including the trade union leader, Alfonso Fernndez Gimnez.
.On numerous occasions, the Committee has recalled that, while the appropriateness of dismissing workers for economic reasons obviously does not come within its sphere of competence, it nevertheless considers it appropriate to reiterate the importance of effective protection against dismissals for trade union reasons and that this protection must particularly extend to trade union leaders. The Committee points out that, as far as cases of dismissals for economic reasons are concerned, acts of anti-union discrimination ought not to occur under the pretext of such circumstances.
.The Committee further recalls that, as far as Costa Rica more particularly is concerned, in comments made over many years and again in March , on the application of Convention No. , the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations requested the Government to adopt measures to protect workers against acts of anti-union discrimination. The Committee on Freedom of Association, for its part, has several times pointed out as regards Costa Rica the need to make explicit provision in the legislation for appeal procedures and sanctions to ensure the effective application of Article  of Convention No. . The Committee therefore considers that one way of protecting trade unionists is to provide that they cannot be dismissed either during the performance of their duties or for a certain period of time after the expiry of their mandate unless a serious offence has been committed. A further means of ensuring effective protection for workers would be to make it compulsory for each employer to prove that the motive of his intention to dismiss a worker has no connection with the worker's union activities.
.In this case, the Committee notes that one of the trade union leaders cited by the complainant was dismissed for turning up at his place of work in a state of drunkenness, as shown by the documents attached to the Government's reply. As far as this person is concerned, the Committee considers that his dismissal is not an infringement of freedom of association. On the other hand, according to the Government, another leader was dismissed for belonging to the union at the same time as he occupied a position of trust in the management of the enterprise. On this point, the Committee, like the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, considers that the right to join joint organisations with the rest of the workers of the enterprise can be denied to management staff and persons holding positions of trust on condition that they can join their own organisation. The Committee further notes with interest that, in this case, the person in question was appointed by the Government as a workers' representative to the National Wages Council.
.As regards the trade union leader and the unionised workers who, it is claimed, were dismissed for economic reasons, the Committee, while noting the information communicated by the Government, recalls the importance which it attaches to the fact that no act of anti-union discrimination should take place under the pretext of such circumstances.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the following conclusions:(a) the Committee again brings to the Government's attention the importance which it attaches to the fact that no act of antiunion discrimination should take place under the pretext of dismissals for economic reasons;(b) the Committee trusts that, as requested by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, the Government will take legislative measures to protect workers against acts of anti-union discrimination.
.The complaint by the Sole Confederation of Costa Rican Workers (CTC) is contained in a communication dated  June . The Government, for its part, supplied its observations in a letter dated  August .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  June , the CTC, an organisation which it states is affiliated to the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), alleges that the Tempisque Sugar Works (Central Azucarera de Tempisque S.A.), where a union was formed for the protection of workers' rights, the Tempisque Sugar Workers' Trade Union (UTRACAT), affiliated in turn to the CTC, has repeatedly persecuted a number of the workers through penalties and dismissals.
.For example, the complainant explains, in October  the UTRACAT trade union leader, Claudio Gamboa Valverde, was dismissed without grounds because he was a member of the union's executive Committee. Although the Minister of Labour was asked to intervene in his favour, the complainant states that no action has yet been taken.
.It also states that in May  the enterprise in question, taking advantage of the fact that harvesting was over, dismissed about  workers with permanent jobs because they belonged to the UTRACAT.
.The complainant further alleges that in May  the enterprise dismissed the trade union leader, Santos Gmez Hernndez, and, in June , Fernndez Gimnez, the union's secretary for training.
.Attached to the complainant's communication is a letter addressed by it on  June  to the Minister of Labour, requesting the latter's intervention for obtaining the reinstatement of the trade union leaders dismissed. The complainant explains that Mr. Santos Gmez Hernndez, before belonging to the UTRACAT's executive Committee, had been chairman of the permanent works Committee, at which time he had encountered no difficulties. When he became a union member, the illegal persecutions by the enterprise commenced, and on several occasions it refused to draw up and enforce an internal works rule. Mr. Gmez was then dismissed on d false accusation of drunkenness.
.The complainant states that the dismissal of the secretary for training, Mr. Fernndez Gimnez, was inconsistent in that he was dismissed on grounds of ""reorganisation"" whereas his own supervisors had, at the end of the harvest, stated that ""in view of his output, he could keep his job and would not be dismissed during the reorganisation that was to take place"". One month later, nevertheless, he was dismissed on grounds of reorganisation. The complainant states that the true reasons for his dismissal were the following. A group of peasants had asked Mr. Fernndez Gimnez for the union's help because their boss, Mr. Hernndez, was obliging each team of  workers to spray  bags of fertilizer which, in the climatic conditions in which the work is performed, constitutes unfair and inhumane conditions of work. Mr. Hernndez, having learned the name of the person making claims on their behalf, namely Mr. Alfonso Hernndez Gimnez, had him dismissed.
.In his reply of  August , the Minister of Labour states that, on receipt of the complaint, his ministerial department requested the enterprise to state the reasons why it had terminated the contracts of Claudio Gamboa Valverde, Santos Gmez Hernndez and Alfonso Fernndez Gimnez. According to the Government, it could not be concluded from the reports supplied that the dismissals were due to anti-union discrimination; however, the Minister continues, he ordered an inquiry himself and sent a labour inspector to verify the facts and instructed him to draw up an exhaustive report as quickly as possible, which was known to the complainants.
.As regards the allegation that in May  the enterprise, taking advantage of the fact that the harvest was over, terminated the contracts of  workers for union membership, the Minister of Labour states that an inquiry has been carried on his instructions. The inquiry shows that at the time when the enterprise needed the maximum number of workers for harvesting, the total workforce amounted to , workers,  of whom belonged to the UTRACAT. At the end of the harvest, the total dropped to l,,  of whom belonged to the union. Now that the temporary work is over, the total number of employees is ,  of whom belong to the UTRACAT. This shows that the enterprise terminated the temporary contracts of a larger number of non-union workers than of workers actually belonging to the union. According to the Government, therefore, there has been no anti-union discrimination.
.The Committee notes that the present case relates primarily to alleged dismissals of trade union militants and leaders. More precisely, according to the complainant, the dismissals took place in October  in the case of Mr. Gamboa Valverde and in May and June , respectively, in the cases of Mr. Gmez Hernndez and Mr. Fernndez Gimnez, leaders of the UTRACAT, a trade union affiliated to the complainant organisation. The complainant also alleges that approximately  permanent workers were dismissed at the end of the harvest in May  because of their membership of that union.
.When considering allegations of this nature, the Committee usually draws the attention of governments to one of the fundamental principles of freedom of association, namely that workers should enjoy adequate protection against all acts of antiunion discrimination in respect of their employment, including dismissal. This protection is particularly desirable in the case of trade union officials because in order to",0,1981,Costa Rica
153,"perform their trade union duties in full independence they must have the guarantee that they will not be prejudiced on account of the mandate which they hold from their trade unions.
.As regards the allegation relating to the dismissal of three trade union leaders mentioned by the complainant, the Committee notes that the Government has ordered an inquiry in these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the results of the inquiry and expresses the hope that, if it is found that the trade union leaders dismissed have not committed any serious offence, the Government will endeavour to obtain their reinstatement.
.Concerning the alleged dismissal of approximately  permanent workers, the Committee notes that the opinion of the complainant and that of the Government on the matter conflict. In the opinion of the complainant, the workers, though permanent, were dismissed because of their membership of the UTRACAT, whereas in the opinion of the Government, following the inquiry it made, the enterprise terminated the temporary contracts of more non-union workers than union workers.
.The Committee observes that the Government, though it has carried out an inquiry, has not stated whether permanent workers belonging to the UTRACAT were dismissed or, if they were, for what reason. Accordingly, the Committee requests the Government for precise information on this aspect of the case.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report, in particular the following conclusions:As regards the alleged dismissal of three trade union leaders mentioned by the complainant, the Committee notes that an inquiry has been ordered by the Minister of Labour. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the results of the inquiry and expresses the hope that, if it is found that the trade union leaders did not commit any serious offence and were dismissed only on account of trade union membership or activities, the Government will endeavour to obtain their reinstatement in their jobs in accordance with the principle of freedom of association.Concerning the alleged dismissal of approximately  permanent workers because they belonged to the UTRACAT, the Committee requests the Government to specify whether workers enjoying permanent employment and belonging to the UTRACAT were dismissed by the enterprise to which the complaint refers and, if so, for what reason.Geneva,  November .

154,".The Committee examined this case at its meeting in February  when it presented an interim report to the Governing Body which requested certain information from the Government. The Government furnished additional information in a communication dated  April .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations concerned the labour dispute which occurred in the Costa Rica Banana Company during the months of July and August . At its examination of the case during its meeting of February , the Committee left pending the question of the arrest of dozens of trade union leaders, including the alleged arrest of Edwin Oviedo, General Secretary of the Union of Workers of El Golfillo. The Government replied that the authorities had never arrested citizens for the mere fact of holding trade union office. The Committee recommended the Governing Body to ask the Government to provide precise information on the reasons for the arrests mentioned by the complainant and on the present situation of the arrested trade unionists.
.In its communication of  April , the Government states that as a result of the disturbances which occurred during the banana conflict, several citizens were arrested, including workers in the banana company, trade union leaders and other individuals for having committed various offences which resulted in a breach of the peace (riot, disobedience, contempt, public incitement, etc.). The Government repeats that the trade union militants, amongst others, were not arrested because of their trade union status but because they had committed punishable acts. The Government goes on to say that all the persons arrested were quickly released and now enjoy absolute liberty pending a decision by the courts on their alleged guilt.
.As regards the trade union leader Edwin Oviedo, the Government states that he was arrested on charges of obstruction of public services, riot, disobedience and contempt; however, since there was insufficient evidence upon which to base a judgement of innocence or guilt, he has now been released and enjoys absolute liberty.
.As concerns the arrest of the trade union leader Edwin Oviedo, the Committee notes that as a result of insufficient evidence upon which to convict him of the offences with which he was charged, he has been released and now enjoys absolute liberty.
.As concerns the other leaders arrested as a result of the dispute in the banana company, the Committee notes the statement by the Government that they have been released pending an investigation by the courts of the allegation that they committed offences punishable under ordinary law.
.In theses circumstances, and since the complainant has furnished no precise information on the reasons for the arrests and the identity of the persons arrested, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the Trade Unions International of Agricultural, Forestry and Plantation Workers (UISTABP) dated  August . The Government replied by a communication of  October .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  August  the UISTABP alleges repression of the banana workers, the militarisation of their work, government intervention in the Union of Workers of El Golfillo (UTG) and the imprisonment of dozens of workers, including Edwin Oviedo, General Secretary of UTG.
.In its communication of  October  the Government states that at no time has it practised a policy of repression against the banana workers, that the public authorities do not even possess statutory powers to militarise any form of labour and that the Government has not intervened in UTG. As regards the arrest of trade union leaders, continues the Government, the authorities have not arrested citizens for the mere fact of holding trade union office.
.The Government states that, following talks between the representatives of UTG and the Costa Rica Banana Company on matters related to the collective agreement in force, which failed to result in an agreement on wages and the dismissal of workers, a strike was called - which was later to be declared illegal by the courts - on  July , despite the repeated efforts at conciliation by the ministry of Labour and Social Security, which remained unsuccessful even after the strike had begun. In these circumstances, continues the Government, and pursuant to the Labour Code, the Executive issued a decree on  August  to place the plantations under temporary control as they were regarded as a public service under private ownership, and to regulate the conduct of labour-management relations. The Government indicates that the strike was ended by the trade union leaders on  August, when the Ministry of Labour and Social Security replied favourably to the proposals made by trade union organisations respecting the Decree of  August . These proposals, made by Edwin Oviedo, among others, on  August , referred to the continuity of contracts of employment, the undertaking that there would be no reprisals against those who had participated in the strike, the action to be taken as regards the dismissals made before the strike began, etc.
.The Government reports that there has been full labour and social peace in the banana zone of the South Pacific area of the country since the strike ended.
.The Committee notes that the labour dispute in the Banana Company has ended and that the present labour and social situation in the zone is peaceful.
.The Committee nevertheless wishes to point out that the Government has not given a concrete reply to the allegation of the complainant regarding the arrest of trade union leaders. In this connection the Committee would like to obtain detailed information on any arrests of trade union leaders arising out of the labour dispute and on the present situation of any persons that may have been arrested, in particular on the alleged arrest of Edwin Oviedo, General Secretary of the UTG, even though the Committee has noted that the signature of Mr. Oviedo appears on the document of  August  in which the trade union organisations made proposals to the Ministry regarding the Decree of  August .
.The Committee also observes that the Government has not indicated the grounds on which the strike of  July  was declared illegal. For its part, the Committee notes that all strikes in public services are unlawful under section  of the Labour Code, and that section (b) includes in this category of, services work performed by employees engaged in the care or harvesting of agricultural products. In this respect the Committee would like to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that prohibitions on the right to strike are admissible only to the extent which they apply to civil servants or workers in essential services in the strict sense, i.e., services whose interruption would endanger the existence or well-being of the whole or part of the population. The Committee wishes to recall that the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, in its General Survey on freedom of association and collective bargaining, mentions agriculture as not forming part of essential services in the strict sense of the term.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to adopt the present interim report and in particular the following conclusions;The Committee must draw the attention of the Government to the fact that the prohibition of strikes is admissible only to the extent which it applies to the civil service or to essential services in the strict sense.The Committee requests precise information from the Government on the reasons for the arrests mentioned by the complainants and on the present situation of the arrested trade unionists.",0,1980,Costa Rica
155,".The Committee examined this case in November , when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body.
.Since its last examination of the case, the Committee has received a communication from the Government dated  December  and another dated  January .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations in this case related to the strike held on  May  by the workers of Staves, Barrels and Parquet Inc. (STABAPARI), following repeated demands by the complainant organisation for the application of the collective agreement in force and the dismissal of  workers without respecting the terms of that agreement. The complainant also referred to the dismissal of another  workers on the day after the agreement putting an end to the strike was signed, and to the failure on the part of the Government and the undertaking to observe that agreement.
.It further referred to alleged acts of physical assault by the undertaking's manager against workers and to alleged antiunion interference by the Ministry of Labour (officials of the Ministry of Labour had called a meeting in order to induce the workers to give up their trade union organisation and appoint in its place a labour relations board).
.Regarding the pending questions, the Committee recommended to the Governing Body to request the Government for the text of the judgement in the case against the manager of the undertaking and for its observations on the alleged anti-union interference.
.In its communication of  January , the Government states that as the Public Prosecutor had considered that there was no proof to support the allegation of assault made by the complainant against the undertaking's manager and in the absence of charges laid against him by the trade union leaders of the complainant organisation or by anyone else - regarding which the Government sends a certification - the criminal courts did not intervene in the matter.
.In its communications, the Government also states that the alleged anti-union interference referred to by the complainant in its confused communication of  August  does not relate to the labour dispute at the STABAPARI undertaking but concerns a dispute at another undertaking, which terminated in an agreement, signed by the trade union representatives among others, agreeing to the establishment of the labour relations board mentioned in the allegations.
.The Committee notes that the complainant organisation did not bring charges before the courts in relation to the alleged intent of the manager of the STABAPARI undertaking to commit physical assault against workers and that the criminal courts did not intervene in the matter as the Public Prosecutor found there to be no proof in this respect.
.The Committee also notes that the allegations relating to the alleged anti-union interference referred to by the complainant does not relate to the labour dispute at the STABAPARI undertaking but concern another dispute at another undertaking which terminated in an agreement, signed by the trade union representatives and agreeing to the establishment of the labour relations board mentioned in the allegations.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.
.The complaint is contained in communications from the National Union of Workers in the Construction, Wood and Building Materials industries dated  July and  August . The Government replied by communication of  September .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  July  the National Union of Workers in the Construction, Wood and Building Materials Industries alleges that in response to its repeated demands for the application of the collective agreement in force, the undertaking Staves, Barrels and Parquet Inc. (STABAPARI) dismissed  workers, including  trade union leaders, without respecting the terms of the agreement in certain cases. For this reason, adds the complainant, a strike began on  May , which was subsequently declared illegal. Furthermore, says the complainant, the manager of STABAPARI drove his car at a number of workers who were standing at the entrance to the undertaking and later used a firearm. On  June , continues the complainant, an agreement was signed between the trade union and the representatives of the Government under which the workers undertook to put an end to the strike and the Government to grant a can be cover the statutory benefits to which the dismissed workers were entitled and the benefits for any workers who had taken part in the strike and who might later be dismissed for this reason. The complainant adds that  workers were dismissed on the day following the signature of the agreement and that the workers were later told that they would have to reimburse the loans which they had received in the event that the courts pronounced the dismissals justified.
.In its communication of  August  the complainant organisation states that neither the Government nor the undertaking has kept its promises. The complainant adds that officials of the Ministry of Labour, with the consent of the STABAPARI undertaking, called a meeting in which the union leadership was prevented from taking part in order to induce the workers to abandon their trade union organisation and appoint in its place a ""labour relations board"" in harmony with the interests of the undertaking.
.In its communication of  September  the Government states that the alleged acts of physical assault of which the complainant accuses the manager of the undertaking are awaiting confirmation by the courts. The Government adds that the Ministry of Labour granted economic aid to the dismissed workers out of its own funds and that, thanks to its intervention, the STABAPARI undertaking paid the sums it owed to the workers for the remaining period of their contract. As for the other statutory benefits (pay in lieu of notice and severance pay), the Government states that since these were granted in the form of loans under the agreement of  June  the workers concerned are obliged to reimburse them if the courts consider the dismissals to be justified. The Government has sent information on the initiation of the procedure for the granting of such cans.
.As regards the alleged acts of physical assault against workers of which the manager of STABAPARI is accused, the Committee takes note of the Government's statement that proceedings have been brought before the courts.
.The Committee also notes that the Government has granted the dismissed workers economic assistance and that the undertaking has paid all the sums which it owed to the dismissed workers at the time of dismissal.
.As regards pay in lieu of notice and severance pay, the Committee observes that the agreement of  June , concluded between the Government authorities and the trade union, provides for the granting of a loan for the payment of this compensation. The Committee also observes that according to the said agreement, any workers whose dismissal is held to be justified by the court will have to reimburse the sums received under these headings. Finally, the Committee observes that although it would appear that the Government has initiated the procedure for obtaining the loans, this procedure is not yet completed.
.As regards the dismissals recorded at the STABAPARI undertaking the Committee notes that  of them took place after the repeated demands made by the trade union for the application of the collective agreements and that the remaining  took place on the day after the signature of the agreement which put an end to the strike. In this connection the Committee must point out that such a large number of dismissals (the undertaking had  workers) on the occasion of labour disputes involves serious risks of abuse and serious threats to freedom of association and may impair the development of labour relations. For this reason the Committee feels that it would be advisable to take measures to review the situation of the dismissed workers as far as possible, particularly any workers who have been dismissed from their posts for reasons connected with their trade union activities.
.Lastly, the Committee remarks that the Government has so far made no response to the complainant's communication of  August  regarding the purported interference of ministry of Labour officials in STABAPARI to induce the workers to abandon their trade union organisation.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to request the Government to send the text of the judgement in the case against the manager of the STABAPARI undertaking;(b) to request the Government to take the necessary steps to conclude the procedure which it has initiated for the grant of the loans promised to the dismissed workers;(c) to draw the Government's attention to the principles set forth in paragraph  above regarding the serious risks to the development of labour relations that may be involved if very large numbers",0,1980,Costa Rica
156,"of workers are dismissed on the occasion of labour disputes and to the advisability of re-examining the situation of the dismissed workers as far as possible;(d) to request the Government to send its observations on the allegations relating to the purported interference of the Ministry of labour in trade union matters;(e) to take note of the present interim report.Geneva,  November .

.In its communication of  July , CGT alleges that the workers of the Zublin-Carrez undertaking engaged in the construction of a wharf at Puerto Limn were again obliged to resort to strike action on  June  because the company had failed to honour the commitments it had entered into in a settlement that had put an end to an earlier strike. Once again, continues the complainant, instead of negotiating seriously with the union, the undertaking is manoeuvring to defeat the workers' struggle, and is even obliging the Government to send in the forces of order to ""protect the interests of the workers"".
.CGT alleges that on  July  a member of the forces' of order cold-bloodedly shot Alvaro Picado, a worker who was on a loading machine, when a group of unarmed workers were attempting to persuade strike-breakers not to enter the workplace, although there had been no clashes either with the forces of order or with the strike-breakers.
.In its communication of  October  the Government states that the strike which began on  June  was declared illegal by the courts. The employer was accordingly entitled to terminate the contracts of employment of the strikers (section  of the Labour Code), and the courts had the power to order the police authorities to guarantee the continuation of work (section  of the Labour Code). Given the consequences of the illegal strike, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, with a view to ensuring social peace, decided to act as a mediator; the result of this action was a settlement between the parties on the basis of proposals by the Government concerning reinstatement of the workers, termination of individual contracts and statutory benefits, trade union activity and the establishment of a Labour Relations Board. These proposals were accepted by the parties on  July .
.The Government remarks that the intervention of the police at the workplace was not due to pressure by the employer, but, given the illegal nature of the strike, was the result of a court order to apply section  of the Labour Code for the purpose of ensuring that workers who wished to continue work could enter the workplace.
.As regards the death of the worker Alvaro Picado, the Government states that a detachment of police was at the entrance to the worksite of the harbour installation in order to guarantee that workers who wished to continue work might enter the workplace and to protect the installations which were intended as a public service in accordance with section  of the Labour Code, when a group of workers attacked the authorities, throwing stones and other blunt objects. At a certain moment, Alvaro Picado, who was driving a vehicle equipped with a mechanical shovel, pushed with the shovel a loading vehicle against a but containing a number of policemen. The Government adds that the police fired into the air and warned the strikers to stop the violence. It was then discovered that Alvaro Picado, who was to die later, was lying on the ground with a bullet wound. Faced with this situation, most of the aggressors fled.
.The Government does not accept the complainant's accusation of responsibility for the incidents, as the action taken by the Civil Guard was in any case undoubtedly defensive. Furthermore, continues the Government, caches of arms of a type not used by the police were found on the premises, and various witnesses heard exchanges of shots of different calibres.
.In addition the Government remarks that during the preliminary investigation for homicide the civil guard who was originally held responsible for the death of Alvaro Picado was acquitted for lack of evidence because of the absence of any witness who could testify that the police had opened fire on the victim and because it was not even possible to determine that it was the shots fired by the forces of order that had caused his death.
.Although the Government has not explained the precise reasons, the Committee notes that the strike which began on  June  in the Zublin-Carrez undertaking was declared illegal and also notes that it was brought to an end when the parties accepted the settlement proposed by the Government. The Committee wishes to point out, as it has done in earlier cases, that the conditions required by law for a strike to be considered lawful must be reasonable, and in any case should not imply a serious limitation on the potential activities of trade unions, such as the requirement that a high proportion of the workers should be in agreement with the strike before it can be considered lawful.
.As regards the presence of the police at the workplace due to the labour dispute, the Committee notes the statement of the Government that the purpose of this was to ensure that workers who so wished could continue their work and to protect public service installations in accordance with the provisions of the Labour Code respecting illegal strikes. As regards the death of the worker, Alvaro Picado, the Committee observes that the allegations of the complainant and the statement of the Government are contradictory; the complainant states that a member of the forces of order fired on unarmed workers, although there had been no clashes either with the forces of order or with the strike-breakers, whereas the Government states that the workers had committed acts of aggression and that it was not possible to determine whether the shot which caused the victim's death came from the police. As it has already done on similar occasions, the Committee wishes to recall that it has always attached great importance to the institution of an impartial inquiry and the guarantee of due process of law in order to determine responsibilities and apply the corresponding sanctions in cases where disturbances have occurred involving the loss of human lives, In this sense the Committee observes that a preliminary investigation was carried out and that one of the civil guards was acquitted for lack of evidence.
.Lastly, given the violence of the incidents which occurred during the strike and which reached their climax with the death of the worker, Alvaro Picado, the Committee, while deploring these incidents, wishes to stress the desirability of giving the police appropriate instructions whenever they have to intervene in collective labour disputes, in order to avoid serious consequences of this kind.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to deplore the death of the worker Alvaro Picado and the violence of the incidents which took place during the strike, and to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that conditions required by law for a strike to be considered lawful should not constitute a serious limitation on the potential activities of trade union organisations.",0,1980,Costa Rica
158,".The complaint presented by the National Association of Public Employees (ANEP) is contained in a communication of  October  and that of the General Confederation of workers (CGT) in two communications of  November and  December . In a communication dated  January , the world Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) associated itself with the complaint presented by the CGT. The Government sent its observations on the ANEP complaint in a communication dated  April  (received on  May) and its observations on the CGT complaint in another communication dated  July .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee wishes to recall that, under Article  of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), which Costa Rica has ratified, measures appropriate to national conditions shall be taken, where necessary, to encourage and promote the full development and utilisation of machinery for voluntary negotiations between employers or employers' organisations and workers' organisations, with a view to the regulation of terms and conditions of employment by means of collective agreements. Under the terms of Article , this Convention does not deal with the position of public servants engaged in the administration of the State. The Committee has stated that Convention No. , and in particular Article  thereof concerning the encouragement and promotion of collective bargaining, applies both to the private sector and to nationalised undertakings and public bodies, it being possible to exclude from such application public servants engaged in the administration of the State. In the same spirit, the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has expressed the view that a distinction should be drawn in this respect between civil servants employed in various capacities in government ministries or comparable bodies, that is, public servants who by their functions are directly engaged in the administration of the State as well as lower-ranking officials who act as supporting elements in these activities, and other persons employed by the Government, by public undertakings or by autonomous public institutions.,
.In these circumstances, the Committee feels it must draw the Government's attention to the considerations outlined in the foregoing paragraph and to the desirability of ensuring that no measure liable to hamper the collective bargaining process is applied to the latter category of workers.
.In these circumstances and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with respect to the allegations relating to the attitude of the authorities towards the National Association of Public Employees and in the light of the considerations contained in paragraphs  and  above, to take note that the issues raised in the complaint have been settled and to decide that these aspects of the case do not call for further examination;(b) with regard to the allegations concerning the attitude of the authorities towards the General Confederation of Workers:(i) bearing in mind the principles and considerations outlined in paragraphs  to  above, to take note that the complainants have not provided proof that the statements made by government personalities referred to in the complaint, constitute an infringement of freedom of association;(ii) to take note of the information supplied by the Government regarding the collective disputes referred to in the complaint and to point out that compulsory conciliation before calling a strike does not constitute an infringement of freedom of association;(iii) with respect to the provisions of Articles  and  of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), to draw the Government's attention to the considerations contained in paragraph  above and to the desirability of ensuring that no measure liable to hamper the process of collective bargaining is applied to workers in the public sector who are not public servants in the administration of the State;(iv) to draw these conclusions to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.",0,1978,Costa Rica
159,".The Committee already examined these cases in November  and in May and November ; on each occasion it submitted interim conclusions, which are to be found in its nd Report (paragraphs  to ), st Report (paragraphs  to ) and th Report (paragraphs  to ). The Governing Body approved these reports in November  and in June and November  (th, th and th Sessions), respectively. The Government handed over various documents with a bearing on the case at an interview on  June  between the Minister of Labour and the Chairman of the Committee, and supplied further information in a communication dated  July .
.Costa Rica has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.At its sessions in June and November , the Committee made certain comments in relation to the question of principle raised by the alleged interference by the Costa Rican Social Security Fund in the affairs of its employees' union. In September  the Government sent information with respect to one aspect of the question, namely the reasons for the dismissal of a trade union official.
.Recalling its conclusions in an earlier case relating to Costa Rica, the Committee pointed out that ratification of Convention No.  involved an undertaking, under the terms of Article  of that Convention, to ensure that workers' organisations in particular were provided by the legislation with the means to protect themselves against interference by employers or their organisations. Costa Rican legislation contained no specific provisions to this effect.
.On the Committee's recommendation, in June , the Governing Body urged the Government to adopt the necessary provisions without delay in a communication dated  September , the Government stated that it had taken note of these recommendations, which the Governing Body reiterated in November  when it approved paragraph  of the Committee's th Report.
.In its further observations of  July  the Government states that the alleged interference by the Costa Rican Social Security Fund in the union UNDECA never took place. Among the documents supplied is an attestation by the authorities of the Fund to the effect that an examination of the accounts for the period to which the complaint refers ( and ) shows that the Fund did not pay the travelling expenses of workers as an inducement to attend a certain trade union meeting, as has been claimed by the complainants. The Government also draws attention to the information furnished earlier to the effect that a judgement pronounced in August  had declared it not proven that Mr. Carlos Acua Castro, an official of the union, had been dismissed on account of his trade union activities. The Government supplies the text of this judgement. In addition, in letters sent to the ILO by Mr. Acuo Castro - now a Ministry of Labour official - and a number of the UNDECA officials who had signed the complaint, it is acknowledged that the facts were not as serious as was claimed in the first place.
.The Committee notes this information. It nevertheless considers that its general conclusions as to the need for legislative provisions which will protect workers' organisations against possible interference by employers are still applicable. In effect, to give the necessary publicity to provisions such as those of Article  of the Convention and ensure that full effect is given to them in practice, even in cases where ratification has the effect of incorporating the international standard in municipal law, it is highly important that these provisions, accompanied by provision for appeals and penalties to ensure that they are complied with, should be embodied explicitly in the relevant legislation. The Committee is therefore of the opinion that the recommendations already approved by the Governing Body in this respect should be maintained.
.The other matters still outstanding concern the dismissal from their jobs of three other officials of unions of employees in the public sector and the criminal proceedings brought by the authorities against two of them. These events occurred in  and . According to the allegations, Luis Fernando Alfaro Ziga, General Secretary of the Trade Union Association of Employees of the Costa Rican Electricity Institute, and Mario Devandas Brenes, General Secretary of the National Federation of Public Service workers, were dismissed from their jobs. Subsequently, according to the complainants, because of strikes called by workers belonging to their respective unions, they were charged with incitement to strike and other offences and imprisoned. The Government stated that Alfaro Ziga had made subversive speeches during a strike in July  at the Costa Rican Electricity Institute and that the Public Prosecutor had charged both him and Devandas Brenes with riot, incitement to a collective stoppage of public services and conduct prejudicial to public order. Both were to be brought to trial and the court had allowed them to be released on bail.
.Bearing in mind the principles it had upheld in this connection, the Committee examined the provisions of the Labour Code which prohibit strikes in the public services and make it compulsory for any disputes between employers and workers in this sector to be referred to the labour courts. The Committee pointed out in particular that where strikes were prohibited or restricted in essential services or in the civil service, adequate guarantees should be ensured to safeguard the interest of the workers to the full, including in particular the existence of adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures in which the parties could take part at every stage and in which the awards were binding in all cases on both parties and must be fully and promptly implemented. In this connection the Government confirmed that the procedure for the peaceful settlement of disputes prescribed in the Labour Code was applicable to disputes at the Costa Rican Electricity Institute and the National Institute of Housing and Town Planning.
.On the Committee's recommendation, in November  the Governing Body requested the Government to transmit the texts of the judgements pronounced in the cases of Messrs. Alfaro Ziga and Devandas Brenes, with the reasons adduced therefore.
.The remaining dismissal involved Mr. Cristin Sobrado Chaves, General Secretary of the Union of Bank Employees of Costa Rica. He had been dismissed in February , according to the complainants, on the false pretext of unjustified absences from work. The Government stated inter alia that legal proceedings were pending in connection with this matter. In November  the Committee and the Governing Body drew attention to the importance of a rapid procedure for examining alleged cases of dismissal because of trade union activities. The Government was requested to supply the text of the judgement handed down in the case relating to the dismissal of Mr. Sobrado Chaves.
.The documents and observations communicated by the Government on  June and  July  include the texts of the judgements requested. As concerns Mr. Devandas Brenes, it is stated in the judgements pronounced by the labour court and the Higher Labour Court in September and October  that he was discharged on  March  by the institute of Housing and Town Planning together with other workers, as part of a retrenchment of staff rendered necessary by financial difficulties. The judges considered it proven that Mr. Devandas Brenes had been dismissed for this reason and not arbitrarily or as a means of anti-union persecution, and that the employer had obtained authorisation in advance from an advisory board as required by the collective agreement. As regards Mr. Alfaro Ziga, the judgements, likewise of first and second instance, pronounced in March and May  state that he was dismissed in February  by the Costa Rican Electricity Institute. The union had filed a complaint with the Legislative Assembly against the authorities of the Institute, accusing them of corruption and mismanagement. The Assembly set up a commission of inquiry. Later the union executive had a statement published in the press accusing the authorities of the institute of anti-union persecution. The latter enjoined Mr. Alfaro Ziga to substantiate some of the charges made, which he did not do himself, but left it to the union, whereupon he was dismissed. The court considered that the dismissal was justified, observing, inter alia, that while the union was a separate legal entity from its members, this fact did not exonerate Mr. Alfaro Ziga from his responsibilities as an employee in his relations with his employer. According to the court, the statement published by the union was based on charges made personally by this employee, who did not substantiate them as instructed by his employer, and was thus guilty of dishonesty and disloyalty. The court considered that there was just cause for dismissal on the ground of serious non-compliance with the obligations deriving from a contract of employment as specified in the Labour Code.
.The Government also supplies information concerning the criminal proceedings initiated in  against Messrs. Devandas Brenes and Alfaro Ziga on charges of riot",0,1975,Costa Rica
160,"and incitement to a collective stoppage of public services. According to the indictment put before the criminal court, on the occasion of a strike at the Costa Rican Electricity Institute in July of that year, these persons, who had no connection with the Institute (Mr. Alfaro Ziga having been dismissed from it a few months earlier, as stated above), insinuated themselves into the movement and by haranguing them and making subversive speeches incited some  workers to take part in a collective cessation of their public duties; they succeeded in persuading them to stop work, thus paralysing the main electricity supply plant. Also according to the indictment, the strike had been declared unlawful that very same day by the labour court - a ruling not found acceptable by the strikers, who insulted and stoned the Civil Guardsmen who arrived two days later to enforce the court order.
.The Government furnishes a judicial attestation to the effect that in May , when Mr. Devandas Brenes was elected to be a member of the Legislative Assembly, the examining magistrate eliminated him from the proceedings, which he continued with respect to the other accused. The Government considers that it has demonstrated that these persons participated in an unlawful strike staged in an institution for which they did not work and not ""in strikes called by workers belonging to their respective unions"" it further states that neither the dismissals nor the measures taken to preserve law and order constituted breaches of the ILO Conventions on freedom of association.
.With regard to Mr. Sobrado Chaves, who, as stated above, was General Secretary of the Onion of Bank Employees of Costa Rica at the time of his dismissal, the Government also supplies the text of the judgement pronounced by the labour judge and confirmed on appeal, rejecting his claim against the bank. These judgements state that in connection with a collective dispute, Mr. Sobrado Chaves was appointed by the employees of the bank to be one of their representatives at a conciliation tribunal. The bank authorities considered that he was subsequently guilty of unjustified absences and requested authorisation from the courts to dismiss him, which was refused so long as the collective dispute was still pending. The bank dismissed him as soon as the dispute was settled in the judgement it is declared proven that this person absented himself from work  times over a period of two months without having given due notice. The court states that employers may not refuse time off to employees appointed to represent the workers at conciliation proceedings, but that this right of an employee is not unrestricted, but is limited to the time required to attend such proceedings and does not extend to other activities unconnected with the conciliation tribunal. In the case in question, according to the judgement, the repeated absences did not coincide with any of the hearings of the conciliation tribunal.
.The Committee observes that the Government has now supplied detailed information about these events, which occurred some time ago. It considers nevertheless that the texts of the judgements in question have been useful in helping it to reach its conclusions.
.The Committee and the Governing Body have constantly emphasised the importance of the principle that workers should enjoy adequate protection against all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment. In this very case, the Committee has pointed out that such a guarantee is also necessary in the case of trade union officials in order to give effect to the fundamental principle that workers' organisations must have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom. The Committee has nevertheless stated that this principle does not necessarily imply that the fact that a person holds trade union office confers on him immunity against dismissal irrespective of the circumstances. In certain cases the Committee has expressed the view that dismissal for absence from work without the employer's permission does not appear in itself to constitute an infringement of freedom of association.
.As concerns the dismissal of three general secretaries of organisations of workers in the public sector, the Committee observes that they took place in different circumstances and for different reasons, two of the persons concerned being accused of failing in their duty as employees to an extent considered by the country's courts to be sufficiently serious to justify their dis-missal in the other case, the official concerned was one of a group of workers who lost their jobs as a result of a forced reduction in staff.
.In these circumstances, the Committee notes that in the cases to which the complaints refer it has not been proved that there was any infringement of freedom of association. Nevertheless, whatever the grounds for these dismissals may have been, it appears desirable to draw attention to the inevitably prejudicial effects upon trade union organisations and their members, and upon industrial relations, deriving from situations of this kind. The Committee wishes to point out that in the public sector an effective means of helping to prevent such situations may be to put into practice measures inspired by the principles of the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ), not only as concerns the protection of public employees against anti-union discrimination (Article  of the Convention) but also as regards the determination, through negotiation or other methods as provided for in the Convention, of the nature and scope of the facilities to be afforded, without prejudice to the efficient operation of the service concerned, to the representatives of recognised public employees' organisations (Articles  and ).
.In these circumstances, with regard to these cases as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as concerns the question of the protection of workers' organisations against possible acts of interference by employers, to draw the Government's attention once again, for the reasons indicated in paragraph  above, to the desirability of adopting special legislative measures in order to give full effect to this principle;(b) with regard to the dismissal of trade union officials in the public sector:(i) to take note of the fact that the Government has supplied the texts of the judgements pronounced in these cases, from which it appears that in the cases in question there has been no infringement of freedom of association;(ii) nevertheless, with a view to preventing possible acts of anti-union discrimination and the harmful consequences deriving from the dismissal of trade union officials, to draw attention to the importance of putting into practice the measures indicated in paragraph  above;(c) to bring this report to the notice of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.
.The Committee already examined these cases in November  and in May ; on each occasion it submitted interim conclusions, in paragraphs  to  of its nd Report and in paragraphs  to  of its st Report, respectively. The Governing Body approved the first of these reports at its th Session (November ) and the second at its th Session (June ). The Government sent further information in a letter dated  September .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.When it last examined these cases, the Committee's conclusions related to the dismissal and arrest of trade union leaders and to interference by the Social Security Fund in a trade union assembly.
.With regard to the latter point, the complainants had alleged that the Costa Rican Social Security Fund had interfered with the holding of the union's general assemblies; in particular, it had engaged in manoeuvres to impose certain persons on the trade union leadership and to remove the new executive Committee which had been legally elected. The Government had made no observations on this point and the Committee had expressed its regret that the Government had not done so.
.Referring to the conclusions it had reached in an earlier case relating to Costa Rica, the Committee pointed out that in ratifying Convention No.  the Government had undertaken to secure the implementation of the guarantees contained in Article  of the said Convention and was accordingly under the obligation to take steps to ensure that workers' organisations, in particular, were provided by the national legislation with the means to protect themselves against interference by employers or their associations. Although Costa Rican legislation contained no specific provisions to this effect, a draft law concerning collective labour relations did contain them; the draft law had been submitted to the legislative assembly but had not yet been adopted.
.On the recommendation of the Committee, the Governing Body, in June , urged the Government to adopt without delay the draft provisions regarding the protection of workers' organisations against acts of interference by employers or their organisations. In its letter of  September , the Government states that it has taken note of these observations.
.The allegations outstanding also refer to the arrest of Luis Fernando Alfaro Ziga, General Secretary of the Trade Union Association of",-1,1975,Costa Rica
161,"Employees of the Costa Rican Electricity Institute, and of Mario Devanda Brenes, General Secretary of the National Federation of Public Service Workers (FENATRAP) and of the National Institute of Housing and Town Planning. According to the complainants, both had first been dismissed from their jobs; subsequently, because of the strike called by the workers of the establishments in which they had been employed, they were charged by the public prosecutor's office with incitement to strike and other offences. Both were being held at the public prison of Heredia, along with common criminals.
.The Government had replied that Luis Fernando Alfaro Ziga had made subversive speeches during the strike called on  July  at the Costa Rican Electricity Institute. The Public Prosecutor had brought charges against him of riot, incitement to a collective stoppage of services and conduct prejudicial to public order. Mario Devanda Brenes had been charged with the same offences. The Government stated that these two persons were to be brought to trial before the Higher Court of San Jose, which had ordered them to be released on bail of , colons each.
.Proceedings had therefore been instituted against the two trade unionists for strikes in public services. The Committee recalled, in this connection, that recognition of the right of public employees to organise did not imply the right to strike. Nevertheless, since the right to strike is an essential means available to the workers and their organisations for defending and promoting their occupational interests, where strikes are prohibited or severely restricted in essential services or in the civil service, adequate guarantees should be ensured to safeguard the interests of the workers to the full. Among such guarantees the Committee has made special mention of adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures in which the parties can take part at every stage and in which the awards are binding in all cases on both parties; these awards, once they have been made, should be fully and promptly implemented.
.In the present case, section  of the Labour Code prohibits strikes in the public services, and any disputes which may arise between employers and workers in these sectors must be referred to the labour courts for compulsory settlement. Nevertheless, in an earlier case relating to Costa Rica, the complainants alleged that, under the special law setting up the Costa Rican Electricity institute, this body was not obliged to submit to compulsory arbitration. The Government had supplied no information on this point. The Committee considered that, if the allegation was correct, the workers of the Institute would be deprived not only of the right to strike but also of the other safeguards mentioned to protect their occupational interests. In June , the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, had requested the Government to state whether the procedure for the peaceful settlement of disputes provided for under section  of the Labour Code was applicable to disputes in the Costa Rican Electricity Institute and the National Institute of Housing and Town Planning. The Governing Body had also requested the Government to transmit the texts of the judgements pronounced in the cases of Alfaro Ziga and Devandas Brenes.
.In its letter of  September , the Government states that it has taken note of the principles and considerations outlined above and specifies that section  of the Labour code is fully applicable to the National Institute of Housing and Town Planning and the Costa Rican Electricity Institute, pursuant to section , paragraphs (a) and (d), of the Code:For the purposes of the last preceding section () the following shall be deemed to be public services:(a) all work performed by persons in the employment of the State or a state institution, if the work in question is not of the same nature as work performed also by private undertakings carried on for profit;(d) work performed by employees who are strictly indispensable for the maintenance in operation of private undertakings which cannot suspend their services without causing serious and immediate prejudice to public health or public economy in general, such as clinics and hospitals, and municipal hygiene, cleaning and lighting services;The Government adds that the trial of Alfaro Ziga and Devanda Brenes is still before the Higher Penal Court, following an appeal by the defence.
.The Committee takes note of this information.
.Finally, the Committee had received allegations relating to the dismissal of trade union officials. According to the Complainants, Carlos Manuel Acua Castro, Deputy General Secretary of the National Union of Social Security Employees (UNDECA), had been dismissed on  June  from his post as legal inspector at the Social Security Fund on the grounds that he had been attending courses at the law faculty, whereas in reality, according to the complainants, he had merely sat for the examinations with the authorisation of his employer. The complainants considered that this situation was the consequence of the complaint presented to the Council of State on the subject of the interference of the Social Security Fund in the general assembly of the union and the participation of Acua Castro in the elections. It was further alleged that Cristin Sobrado Chaves, General Secretary of the Union of Bank Employees of Costa Rica (UNEBANCO), had been dismissed without due cause on  February , after the Higher Labour Court had pronounced the dismissal unjustified. Furthermore, according to the complainants, this measure was a violation of the arbitration award in force at the Bank. Sobrado Chaves had been reproached with unjustified absence from work although, according to the complainants, he had absented himself with the authorisation of his immediate supervisors to carry out activities related to a collective dispute which the bank workers had brought before the labour judge.
.The Government affirmed that, according to the Social Security Fund, Acua Castro's dismissal constituted a sanction for a misdemeanour committed by a worker and should not be artificially connected with other events which had nothing to do with the case. Nevertheless, the Labour Court and, subsequently, the Higher Labour Court of San Jos had judged that the suit filed by Acua Castro against the Social Security Fund was receivable. On  August , the Division of Cassation of the Supreme Court had confirmed this decision. It stated that the judges considered that the reasons given by the employer for the dismissal of Acua Castro were unjustified and ordered the Fund to pay him nine months' wages as compensation, taking account of his seniority in employment. The judges nevertheless considered that Acua Castro had not proved that he had been dismissed on account of his trade union activities and was accordingly not entitled to compensation on this account.
.The Government further stated that, on  August , the Bank of Costa Rica had applied to the labour courts which were examining the collective labour dispute raised by the bank workers for authorisation to dismiss Cristin Sobrado Chaves. The Bank had alleged that the accused had committed unpardonable breaches of discipline. On  February , Sobrado Chaves was dismissed on the grounds of unjustified absences from work. The Bank informed him that, since the arbitration of the collective labour dispute was completed, it was at full liberty to apply the disciplinary sanctions corresponding to the misdemeanour concerned. The Government indicated that the case in question was now under examination by the labour judge of San Jos but that the proceedings, which began on  April , were not yet completed.
.The Committee noted the decision of the Supreme Court concerning Acua Castro. In this connection, it pointed out on a number of occasions that a worker may frequently find it difficult or even impossible to furnish proof that he has been the victim of anti-union discrimination. In the present case, the competent courts had judged that the trade union official had been dismissed without just cause. In these circumstances, the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, had requested the Government to envisage the possibility of reinstating Acua Castro in his employment. The Committee further noted that Sobrado Chaves had been dismissed a long time ago and that the legal proceedings were not yet completed. It recalled the importance which it attaches to the application of a rapid procedure for the examination of alleged cases of dismissal because of trade union activities, and the Governing Body had requested the Government to transmit, as soon as it was pronounced, the text of the judgement handed down in the case of Sobrado Chaves, with the reasons adduced therefor.
.In its letter of  September , the Government states that Acua Castro held for several months the post of chief of the technical co-operation and international affairs unit of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, which he had left of his own free will to take up a post in the private sector. As regards Sobrado Chaves, adds the Government, this case is still before the Labour Court but the judgement is expected to be handed down very soon and will be communicated to the ILO as soon",-1,1975,Costa Rica
162,"as it is pronounced.
.The Committee takes note of this information. However, it feels bound to draw attention once again to the considerable time that elapsed between the dismissal of Sobrado Chaves on  February  and the institution of legal proceedings. It wishes to repeat that a particularly rapid procedure should be applied for the examination of alleged cases of dismissal because of trade union activities. Any worker who is dependent on his employment will inevitably have difficulty in waiting for a long time once he has been deprived of his job because of what appears to him to be antiunion discrimination. Some countries have tackled this problem by means of emergency summary procedures; in the view of the Committee, adoption of such procedures on a temporary or permanent basis would undoubtedly help to improve the system of protection against forms of anti-union discrimination, especially dismissals.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to urge the Government once again to secure the adoption without delay of the draft provisions regarding the protection of workers' organisations against acts of interference by employers;(b) to take note of the information communicated by the Government concerning the existence of a compulsory arbitration procedure where strikes are prohibited, as in the case of the Costa Rican Electricity Institute and the National Institute of Housing and Town Planning and to request it to transmit the texts of the judgements pronounced in the cases of Alfaro Ziga and Devandas Brenes, with the reasons adduced therefor;(c) to draw the Government's attention, for the reasons set forth in paragraph , to the importance of a rapid procedure for examining alleged cases of dismissal because of trade union activities, to request it to communicate, as soon as it is pronounced, the text of the judgement handed down in respect of Sobrado Chaves, with the reasons adduced therefor, and to note further the information provided by the Government on Acua Castro;(d) to take note of the present interim report.
.The Committee already examined these cases in November , when it submitted the interim conclusions contained in paragraphs  to  of its nd Report. The Governing Body approved this report at its th Session (November ).
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations outstanding refer to the dismissal or arrest of trade union officials and to interference by the Social Security Fund in a trade union assembly. The Government sent further information by a letter of  April .
.According to the National Union of Social Security Employees (UNDECA), Mr. Carlos Manuel Acua Castro, Deputy General Secretary UNDECA, had been dismissed on  June  from his post as legal inspector at the Social Security Fund on the grounds that he had been attending courses at the law faculty, whereas in reality, according to the complainants, he had merely sat for the examinations with the authorisation of his employer. The complainants considered that this situation was the consequence of the complaint presented to the Council of State (Contralora general de la Repblica) on the subject of the interference of the Social Security Fund in the general assembly of the union and the participation of Mr. Acua Castro in the elections.
.The General Confederation of Workers (CGT) and the Union of Bank Employees of Costa Rica (UNEBANCO) referred to the situation of Mr. Christin Sobrado Chaves, General Secretary of UNEBANCO. It was alleged that Mr. Sobrado Chaves had been dismissed without due cause on  February , after the Higher Labour Court had pronounced the dismissal unjustified. Furthermore, according to the complainants, this measure was a violation of the arbitration award in force at the bank. Mr. Sobrado Chaves had been reproached with unjustified absence from work although, according to the complainants, he had absented himself with the authorisation of his immediate supervisors to carry out activities related to a collective dispute which the bank workers had brought before the labour judge.
.As regards the dismissal of Mr. Carl Os Manuel Acua Castro, the Government referred to a circular issued by the office of the Chairman of the Social Security Fund. It affirmed that the versions given of the case were untrue and that the measure in question constituted a sanction for a misdemeanour committed by a worker and should not be artificially connected with other events which had nothing to do with the case. The Government stated that on  January  the court of first instance, the San Jos labour court, judged that the suit filed by Mr. Acua Castro against the Social Security Fund was receivable. On  April  the court of second instance, the Higher Labour Court of San Jos, upheld this judgement. Finally, the Social Security Fund had filed an appeal before the Supreme Court for the quashing of the sentence. The Supreme Court had not yet given judgement.
.The Government further indicated that on  August  the Bank of Costa Rica had applied to the labour courts which were examining the collective labour dispute raised by the bank workers for, authorisation to dismiss Mr. Christin Sobrado Chaves. The bank had alleged that the accused had committed unpardonable breaches of discipline. The courts considered that the dismissal was unjustified. On  February , Mr. Sobrado Chaves was dismissed on the grounds of unjustified absences from work. The bank informed him that, since the arbitration of the collective labour dispute was completed, it was at full liberty to apply the disciplinary sanctions corresponding to the misdemeanour concerned. The Government indicated that the case in question was now under examination by the judicial authorities as the judges had expressed the view that the grounds for dismissal were controversial and might be diversely construed.
.In November , the Committee noted that these two cases had been brought before the competent courts, where they were still pending. On its recommendations, the Governing Body had requested the Government to supply the text of any judgements rendered.
.The Government attaches to its communication of  April  the judgement rendered by the Division of Cassation of the Supreme Court concerning the dismissal of Mr. Acua Castro by the Costa Rican Social Security Fund. This decision, dated  August , confirms those of the lower jurisdictions. It states that the judges consider that the reasons given by the employer for the dismissal of Mr. Acua Castro were unjustified and orders the Fund to pay him nine months' wages as compensation, taking account of his seniority in employment. The judges nevertheless consider that Mr. Acua Castro did not prove that he had been dismissed on account of his trade union activities and was accordingly not entitled to compensation on this account.
.In addition, states the Government, proceedings have been instituted before the San Jos labour court against the Bank of Costa Rica in the case of Mr. Sobrado Chaves. The proceedings, which began on  April , are not yet completed.
.The Committee notes the decision of the Supreme Court concerning the first of the persons cited by the complainants. In this connection, the Committee has pointed out on a number of occasions that a worker may frequently find it difficult or even impossible to furnish proof that he has been the victim of an act of anti-union discrimination. In the present case, the competent courts judged that Mr. Acua Castro, Deputy General Secretary of the National Union of Social Security Employees, had been dismissed without just cause. In these circumstances, the Committee considers it desirable that the Government should re-examine this case and envisage the possibility of reinstating Mr. Acua Castro.
.In addition, the Committee feels obliged to point out that, although the aforementioned order of the Supreme Court is dated  August , the Government made no mention of it in its earlier communications (dated  May ). The Committee can only regret that this was not done, and trusts that the Government will communicate a copy of the judgement given in the case of Mr. Sobrado Chaves as soon as this has been rendered. In the latter connection, the Committee notes that Mr. Sobrado Chaves was dismissed over a year ago and that the legal proceedings are not yet completed. It wishes to recall the importance which it attaches to the application of a rapid procedure for the examination of alleged cases of dismissal because of trade union activities
.The CGT also alleged that Mr. Luis Fernando Alfaro Ziga, General Secretary of the Trade Union Association of Employees of the Costa Rican Electricity Institute, had first been removed from his job and subsequently, owing to a strike which had been called by the general assembly of the union for  to  July , had been charged by the public prosecutor's office with incitement to strike and other offences. He was imprisoned and was refused bail.
.In addition, stated the complainants, Mr. Mario Devandas Brenes, General Secretary of the National Federation of Public Service Workers (FENATRAP), had",1,1975,Costa Rica
163,"been dismissed from his job at the National Institute of Housing and Town Planning (where he was also general secretary of the union) and subsequently, on the grounds of a strike called by the workers of the institute, had been charged with the same offences as Mr. Alfaro Ziga and detained under the same conditions. These two persons were being held at the public prison of Heredia, along with common law offenders.
.The Government replied that Mr. Luis Fernando Alfaro Ziga had made subversive speeches during the strike called on  July  at the Costa Rican Electricity Institute. For this reason, the Public Prosecutor of the Republic had charged him before the municipal court of Tibs with riot, incitement to a collective stoppage of services and conduct prejudicial to public order. The trial had not yet been completed.
.As regards the case of Mr. Mario Devandas Brenes, continued the Government, he had been charged with the same offences as Mr. Alfaro Ziga, for which he was also being prosecuted before the municipal court of Tibs.
.The Committee took note of this information. It nevertheless noted that the facts impugned go back to July  and that the trade unionists concerned have not yet been brought to trial. Moreover, it was not possible to determine with any certainty whether the persons concerned were still detained. The Committee recalled the importance it attached to the principle that in all cases, including those in which trade unionists are charged with offences of a political nature or under common law, which the Government considers to have no bearing on their trade union activities, the persons concerned should be tried rapidly by an impartial and independent judicial authority. On its recommendations, the Governing Body had drawn the Government's attention to this principle and requested it to supply the texts of the judgements rendered in the two cases.
.In its letter of  April  the Government states that proceedings have been instituted against the two abovementioned trade unionists before the Higher Court of San Jos, which has ordered them to be released on , colons bail each
.It would appear from available information that proceedings have been instituted against two trade union officials for strikes in public services. They have nevertheless been released on bail. The Committee has stressed on a number of occasions that recognition of the right of public employees to organise does not imply the right to strike.
.Nevertheless, since the right to strike is an essential means available to the workers and their organisations for defending and promoting their occupational interests, the Committee has pointed out in a number of cases concerning Costa Rica that, where strikes are prohibited or severely restricted in essential services or in the civil service, adequate guarantees should be ensured to safeguard the interests of the workers to the full. Among such guarantees the Committee has made special mention of adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures in which the parties can take part at every stage and in which the awards are binding in all cases on both parties; these awards, once they have been made, should be fully and promptly implemented. In the present case, section  of the Labour code prohibits strikes in the public services, and any disputes which may arise between employers and workers in these sectors must be referred to the labour courts for settlement.
.Nevertheless, in one of the above-mentioned cases relating to Costa Rica, the complainants alleged that, under the special act setting up the Costa Rican Electricity Institute, this body was not obliged to submit to compulsory arbitration. The Government had supplied no information on this point. The Committee considered that, if the allegation was correct, the workers of the institute would be deprived not only of the right to strike but also of the other safeguards mentioned to protect their occupational interests. The Committee therefore feels it to be necessary, in the present case, for the Government to specify whether section  was applicable to the collective labour disputes at the Costa Rican Electricity Institute and the National Institute of Housing and Town Planning.
.The National Union of Social Security Employees alleged that the Costa Rican Social Security Fund had interfered with the holding of the union's general assemblies; in particular, it had engaged in manoeuvres to impose certain persons on the trade union leadership and to remove the new executive Committee which had been legally elected.
.The Government had supplied no comments in this connection. In November  the Committee recalled that freedom of assembly and election by trade union organisations, without interference by employers and the public authorities, constitutes an essential guarantee of the free exercise of trade union rights. Furthermore, Article  of Convention no.  stipulates that workers' organisations shall enjoy adequate protection against any acts of interference by employers (either directly, or by their agents or members) in their establishment, functioning or administration. In particular, acts which are designed to support workers' organisations by financial or other means, with the object of placing such organisations under the control of employers or employers' organisations, are deemed to constitute acts of interference. The Governing Body had requested the Government to communicate its observations on this aspect of the case.
.The Government has still not supplied comments in this connection.
.The Committee regrets that the Government has not yet seen fit to reply to these allegations, which refer to incidents that took place three years ago. In an earlier case relating to Costa Rica, the Committee pointed out that in ratifying Convention No.  the Government had undertaken to secure the implementation of the guarantees contained in Article  of the said Convention, and was accordingly under the obligation to take steps to ensure that the occupational organisations were provided by the national legislation with the means to enforce the rights guaranteed to them under the said provisions.) The Committee subsequently noted that Costa Rican legislation contained no specific provisions to protect workers' organisations from acts of interference by employers and their organisations. According to section  of the Labour Code ""any case not provided for by this Code, the regulations hereunder or acts supplementary or related thereto shall be decided in accordance with the general principles of labour law, equity and local custom and usage; in default thereof the provisions laid down in the Conventions and Recommendations adopted by the International Labour Organisation shall be applied in the first place, in so far as they are not contrary to the laws of the country, and thereafter the principles and enactments of ordinary law"". The Committee had also pointed out that Convention No. , by virtue of its ratification by Costa Rica, had been incorporated in the national legislation, and accordingly considered that it would be most appropriate for the Government to examine the possibility of adopting clear and precise provisions ensuring the adequate protection of workers' organisations against any acts of interference by employers and their organisations.
.The Committee considers that these conclusions are also applicable in the present case. It would appear from an observation made by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations in  that a draft law concerning collective labour relations containing provisions giving protection to workers' organisations against acts of interference has been submitted to the legislative assembly but has not yet been adopted.
.In these circumstances, and as regards the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the dismissal of two trade union officials, to request the Government, for the reasons set forth in paragraph , to envisage the possibility of reinstating Mr. Acua Castro in his employment, and also to request it to transmit the text of the judgement given in the case of Mr. Sobrado Chaves, with the reasons adduced therefor;(b) as regards the arrest of two other trade union officials:(i) to recall the considerations and principles set forth in paragraphs  and  regarding strikes in public services;(ii) to request the Government, for the reasons set forth in paragraphs  and , to state whether the procedure for the peaceful settlement of disputes provided for under section  of the Labour Code is applicable to disputes in the Costa Rican Electricity Institute and the National Institute of Town Planning;(iii) to note that Messrs. Alfaro Ziga and Devandas Brenes have been released on bail, and to request the Government to transmit the texts of the judgements pronounced in their cases, with the reasons adduced therefor;(c) as regards the interference by the Social Security Fund in a trade union assembly, to urge the Government, for the reasons set forth in paragraphs  and , to adopt without delay the draft provisions regarding the protection of workers' organisations against acts of interference by employers or their organisations;(d) to take note of the present interim report.
.The complaints of the National Union of Social Security Employees, the General Confederation of workers and the Union of Bank Employees of Costa Rica are contained in communications dated  June ,  August ",-1,1975,Costa Rica
164,"and  March  respectively. The texts of these communications were transmitted to the Government, which furnished its observations in letters of  May .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to request the Government to communicate its observations on the allegations relating to interference by the Social Security Fund in the general assembly of the Union of Social Security Employees in June ;(b) to draw the attention of the Government to the terms of the Workers' Representatives Recommendation,  (No. ), quoted in paragraph  above;(c) to request the Government to transmit the texts of the judgements rendered in the cases concerning the dismissal of Mr. Acua Castro and Mr. Sobrado Chaves;(d) to draw attention to the principle set forth in paragraph  above concerning guarantees of rapid judicial procedure, and to request the Government to supply the texts of the judgements rendered in the proceedings against Mr. Alfaro Ziga and Mr. Devandas Brenes. Mr. Devandas Brenes;(e) to take note of the present interim report.",0,1975,Costa Rica
165,".The Committee already examined these cases in November  and in May and November ; on each occasion it submitted interim conclusions, which are to be found in its nd Report (paragraphs  to ), st Report (paragraphs  to ) and th Report (paragraphs  to ). The Governing Body approved these reports in November  and in June and November  (th, th and th Sessions), respectively. The Government handed over various documents with a bearing on the case at an interview on  June  between the Minister of Labour and the Chairman of the Committee, and supplied further information in a communication dated  July .
.Costa Rica has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.At its sessions in June and November , the Committee made certain comments in relation to the question of principle raised by the alleged interference by the Costa Rican Social Security Fund in the affairs of its employees' union. In September  the Government sent information with respect to one aspect of the question, namely the reasons for the dismissal of a trade union official.
.Recalling its conclusions in an earlier case relating to Costa Rica, the Committee pointed out that ratification of Convention No.  involved an undertaking, under the terms of Article  of that Convention, to ensure that workers' organisations in particular were provided by the legislation with the means to protect themselves against interference by employers or their organisations. Costa Rican legislation contained no specific provisions to this effect.
.On the Committee's recommendation, in June , the Governing Body urged the Government to adopt the necessary provisions without delay in a communication dated  September , the Government stated that it had taken note of these recommendations, which the Governing Body reiterated in November  when it approved paragraph  of the Committee's th Report.
.In its further observations of  July  the Government states that the alleged interference by the Costa Rican Social Security Fund in the union UNDECA never took place. Among the documents supplied is an attestation by the authorities of the Fund to the effect that an examination of the accounts for the period to which the complaint refers ( and ) shows that the Fund did not pay the travelling expenses of workers as an inducement to attend a certain trade union meeting, as has been claimed by the complainants. The Government also draws attention to the information furnished earlier to the effect that a judgement pronounced in August  had declared it not proven that Mr. Carlos Acua Castro, an official of the union, had been dismissed on account of his trade union activities. The Government supplies the text of this judgement. In addition, in letters sent to the ILO by Mr. Acuo Castro - now a Ministry of Labour official - and a number of the UNDECA officials who had signed the complaint, it is acknowledged that the facts were not as serious as was claimed in the first place.
.The Committee notes this information. It nevertheless considers that its general conclusions as to the need for legislative provisions which will protect workers' organisations against possible interference by employers are still applicable. In effect, to give the necessary publicity to provisions such as those of Article  of the Convention and ensure that full effect is given to them in practice, even in cases where ratification has the effect of incorporating the international standard in municipal law, it is highly important that these provisions, accompanied by provision for appeals and penalties to ensure that they are complied with, should be embodied explicitly in the relevant legislation. The Committee is therefore of the opinion that the recommendations already approved by the Governing Body in this respect should be maintained.
.The other matters still outstanding concern the dismissal from their jobs of three other officials of unions of employees in the public sector and the criminal proceedings brought by the authorities against two of them. These events occurred in  and . According to the allegations, Luis Fernando Alfaro Ziga, General Secretary of the Trade Union Association of Employees of the Costa Rican Electricity Institute, and Mario Devandas Brenes, General Secretary of the National Federation of Public Service workers, were dismissed from their jobs. Subsequently, according to the complainants, because of strikes called by workers belonging to their respective unions, they were charged with incitement to strike and other offences and imprisoned. The Government stated that Alfaro Ziga had made subversive speeches during a strike in July  at the Costa Rican Electricity Institute and that the Public Prosecutor had charged both him and Devandas Brenes with riot, incitement to a collective stoppage of public services and conduct prejudicial to public order. Both were to be brought to trial and the court had allowed them to be released on bail.
.Bearing in mind the principles it had upheld in this connection, the Committee examined the provisions of the Labour Code which prohibit strikes in the public services and make it compulsory for any disputes between employers and workers in this sector to be referred to the labour courts. The Committee pointed out in particular that where strikes were prohibited or restricted in essential services or in the civil service, adequate guarantees should be ensured to safeguard the interest of the workers to the full, including in particular the existence of adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures in which the parties could take part at every stage and in which the awards were binding in all cases on both parties and must be fully and promptly implemented. In this connection the Government confirmed that the procedure for the peaceful settlement of disputes prescribed in the Labour Code was applicable to disputes at the Costa Rican Electricity Institute and the National Institute of Housing and Town Planning.
.On the Committee's recommendation, in November  the Governing Body requested the Government to transmit the texts of the judgements pronounced in the cases of Messrs. Alfaro Ziga and Devandas Brenes, with the reasons adduced therefore.
.The remaining dismissal involved Mr. Cristin Sobrado Chaves, General Secretary of the Union of Bank Employees of Costa Rica. He had been dismissed in February , according to the complainants, on the false pretext of unjustified absences from work. The Government stated inter alia that legal proceedings were pending in connection with this matter. In November  the Committee and the Governing Body drew attention to the importance of a rapid procedure for examining alleged cases of dismissal because of trade union activities. The Government was requested to supply the text of the judgement handed down in the case relating to the dismissal of Mr. Sobrado Chaves.
.The documents and observations communicated by the Government on  June and  July  include the texts of the judgements requested. As concerns Mr. Devandas Brenes, it is stated in the judgements pronounced by the labour court and the Higher Labour Court in September and October  that he was discharged on  March  by the institute of Housing and Town Planning together with other workers, as part of a retrenchment of staff rendered necessary by financial difficulties. The judges considered it proven that Mr. Devandas Brenes had been dismissed for this reason and not arbitrarily or as a means of anti-union persecution, and that the employer had obtained authorisation in advance from an advisory board as required by the collective agreement. As regards Mr. Alfaro Ziga, the judgements, likewise of first and second instance, pronounced in March and May  state that he was dismissed in February  by the Costa Rican Electricity Institute. The union had filed a complaint with the Legislative Assembly against the authorities of the Institute, accusing them of corruption and mismanagement. The Assembly set up a commission of inquiry. Later the union executive had a statement published in the press accusing the authorities of the institute of anti-union persecution. The latter enjoined Mr. Alfaro Ziga to substantiate some of the charges made, which he did not do himself, but left it to the union, whereupon he was dismissed. The court considered that the dismissal was justified, observing, inter alia, that while the union was a separate legal entity from its members, this fact did not exonerate Mr. Alfaro Ziga from his responsibilities as an employee in his relations with his employer. According to the court, the statement published by the union was based on charges made personally by this employee, who did not substantiate them as instructed by his employer, and was thus guilty of dishonesty and disloyalty. The court considered that there was just cause for dismissal on the ground of serious non-compliance with the obligations deriving from a contract of employment as specified in the Labour Code.
.The Government also supplies information concerning the criminal proceedings initiated in  against Messrs. Devandas Brenes and Alfaro Ziga on charges of riot",0,1975,Costa Rica
166,"and incitement to a collective stoppage of public services. According to the indictment put before the criminal court, on the occasion of a strike at the Costa Rican Electricity Institute in July of that year, these persons, who had no connection with the Institute (Mr. Alfaro Ziga having been dismissed from it a few months earlier, as stated above), insinuated themselves into the movement and by haranguing them and making subversive speeches incited some  workers to take part in a collective cessation of their public duties; they succeeded in persuading them to stop work, thus paralysing the main electricity supply plant. Also according to the indictment, the strike had been declared unlawful that very same day by the labour court - a ruling not found acceptable by the strikers, who insulted and stoned the Civil Guardsmen who arrived two days later to enforce the court order.
.The Government furnishes a judicial attestation to the effect that in May , when Mr. Devandas Brenes was elected to be a member of the Legislative Assembly, the examining magistrate eliminated him from the proceedings, which he continued with respect to the other accused. The Government considers that it has demonstrated that these persons participated in an unlawful strike staged in an institution for which they did not work and not ""in strikes called by workers belonging to their respective unions"" it further states that neither the dismissals nor the measures taken to preserve law and order constituted breaches of the ILO Conventions on freedom of association.
.With regard to Mr. Sobrado Chaves, who, as stated above, was General Secretary of the Onion of Bank Employees of Costa Rica at the time of his dismissal, the Government also supplies the text of the judgement pronounced by the labour judge and confirmed on appeal, rejecting his claim against the bank. These judgements state that in connection with a collective dispute, Mr. Sobrado Chaves was appointed by the employees of the bank to be one of their representatives at a conciliation tribunal. The bank authorities considered that he was subsequently guilty of unjustified absences and requested authorisation from the courts to dismiss him, which was refused so long as the collective dispute was still pending. The bank dismissed him as soon as the dispute was settled in the judgement it is declared proven that this person absented himself from work  times over a period of two months without having given due notice. The court states that employers may not refuse time off to employees appointed to represent the workers at conciliation proceedings, but that this right of an employee is not unrestricted, but is limited to the time required to attend such proceedings and does not extend to other activities unconnected with the conciliation tribunal. In the case in question, according to the judgement, the repeated absences did not coincide with any of the hearings of the conciliation tribunal.
.The Committee observes that the Government has now supplied detailed information about these events, which occurred some time ago. It considers nevertheless that the texts of the judgements in question have been useful in helping it to reach its conclusions.
.The Committee and the Governing Body have constantly emphasised the importance of the principle that workers should enjoy adequate protection against all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment. In this very case, the Committee has pointed out that such a guarantee is also necessary in the case of trade union officials in order to give effect to the fundamental principle that workers' organisations must have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom. The Committee has nevertheless stated that this principle does not necessarily imply that the fact that a person holds trade union office confers on him immunity against dismissal irrespective of the circumstances. In certain cases the Committee has expressed the view that dismissal for absence from work without the employer's permission does not appear in itself to constitute an infringement of freedom of association.
.As concerns the dismissal of three general secretaries of organisations of workers in the public sector, the Committee observes that they took place in different circumstances and for different reasons, two of the persons concerned being accused of failing in their duty as employees to an extent considered by the country's courts to be sufficiently serious to justify their dis-missal in the other case, the official concerned was one of a group of workers who lost their jobs as a result of a forced reduction in staff.
.In these circumstances, the Committee notes that in the cases to which the complaints refer it has not been proved that there was any infringement of freedom of association. Nevertheless, whatever the grounds for these dismissals may have been, it appears desirable to draw attention to the inevitably prejudicial effects upon trade union organisations and their members, and upon industrial relations, deriving from situations of this kind. The Committee wishes to point out that in the public sector an effective means of helping to prevent such situations may be to put into practice measures inspired by the principles of the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ), not only as concerns the protection of public employees against anti-union discrimination (Article  of the Convention) but also as regards the determination, through negotiation or other methods as provided for in the Convention, of the nature and scope of the facilities to be afforded, without prejudice to the efficient operation of the service concerned, to the representatives of recognised public employees' organisations (Articles  and ).
.In these circumstances, with regard to these cases as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as concerns the question of the protection of workers' organisations against possible acts of interference by employers, to draw the Government's attention once again, for the reasons indicated in paragraph  above, to the desirability of adopting special legislative measures in order to give full effect to this principle;(b) with regard to the dismissal of trade union officials in the public sector:(i) to take note of the fact that the Government has supplied the texts of the judgements pronounced in these cases, from which it appears that in the cases in question there has been no infringement of freedom of association;(ii) nevertheless, with a view to preventing possible acts of anti-union discrimination and the harmful consequences deriving from the dismissal of trade union officials, to draw attention to the importance of putting into practice the measures indicated in paragraph  above;(c) to bring this report to the notice of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.
.The Committee already examined these cases in November  and in May ; on each occasion it submitted interim conclusions, in paragraphs  to  of its nd Report and in paragraphs  to  of its st Report, respectively. The Governing Body approved the first of these reports at its th Session (November ) and the second at its th Session (June ). The Government sent further information in a letter dated  September .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.When it last examined these cases, the Committee's conclusions related to the dismissal and arrest of trade union leaders and to interference by the Social Security Fund in a trade union assembly.
.With regard to the latter point, the complainants had alleged that the Costa Rican Social Security Fund had interfered with the holding of the union's general assemblies; in particular, it had engaged in manoeuvres to impose certain persons on the trade union leadership and to remove the new executive Committee which had been legally elected. The Government had made no observations on this point and the Committee had expressed its regret that the Government had not done so.
.Referring to the conclusions it had reached in an earlier case relating to Costa Rica, the Committee pointed out that in ratifying Convention No.  the Government had undertaken to secure the implementation of the guarantees contained in Article  of the said Convention and was accordingly under the obligation to take steps to ensure that workers' organisations, in particular, were provided by the national legislation with the means to protect themselves against interference by employers or their associations. Although Costa Rican legislation contained no specific provisions to this effect, a draft law concerning collective labour relations did contain them; the draft law had been submitted to the legislative assembly but had not yet been adopted.
.On the recommendation of the Committee, the Governing Body, in June , urged the Government to adopt without delay the draft provisions regarding the protection of workers' organisations against acts of interference by employers or their organisations. In its letter of  September , the Government states that it has taken note of these observations.
.The allegations outstanding also refer to the arrest of Luis Fernando Alfaro Ziga, General Secretary of the Trade Union Association of",-1,1975,Costa Rica
167,"Employees of the Costa Rican Electricity Institute, and of Mario Devanda Brenes, General Secretary of the National Federation of Public Service Workers (FENATRAP) and of the National Institute of Housing and Town Planning. According to the complainants, both had first been dismissed from their jobs; subsequently, because of the strike called by the workers of the establishments in which they had been employed, they were charged by the public prosecutor's office with incitement to strike and other offences. Both were being held at the public prison of Heredia, along with common criminals.
.The Government had replied that Luis Fernando Alfaro Ziga had made subversive speeches during the strike called on  July  at the Costa Rican Electricity Institute. The Public Prosecutor had brought charges against him of riot, incitement to a collective stoppage of services and conduct prejudicial to public order. Mario Devanda Brenes had been charged with the same offences. The Government stated that these two persons were to be brought to trial before the Higher Court of San Jose, which had ordered them to be released on bail of , colons each.
.Proceedings had therefore been instituted against the two trade unionists for strikes in public services. The Committee recalled, in this connection, that recognition of the right of public employees to organise did not imply the right to strike. Nevertheless, since the right to strike is an essential means available to the workers and their organisations for defending and promoting their occupational interests, where strikes are prohibited or severely restricted in essential services or in the civil service, adequate guarantees should be ensured to safeguard the interests of the workers to the full. Among such guarantees the Committee has made special mention of adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures in which the parties can take part at every stage and in which the awards are binding in all cases on both parties; these awards, once they have been made, should be fully and promptly implemented.
.In the present case, section  of the Labour Code prohibits strikes in the public services, and any disputes which may arise between employers and workers in these sectors must be referred to the labour courts for compulsory settlement. Nevertheless, in an earlier case relating to Costa Rica, the complainants alleged that, under the special law setting up the Costa Rican Electricity institute, this body was not obliged to submit to compulsory arbitration. The Government had supplied no information on this point. The Committee considered that, if the allegation was correct, the workers of the Institute would be deprived not only of the right to strike but also of the other safeguards mentioned to protect their occupational interests. In June , the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, had requested the Government to state whether the procedure for the peaceful settlement of disputes provided for under section  of the Labour Code was applicable to disputes in the Costa Rican Electricity Institute and the National Institute of Housing and Town Planning. The Governing Body had also requested the Government to transmit the texts of the judgements pronounced in the cases of Alfaro Ziga and Devandas Brenes.
.In its letter of  September , the Government states that it has taken note of the principles and considerations outlined above and specifies that section  of the Labour code is fully applicable to the National Institute of Housing and Town Planning and the Costa Rican Electricity Institute, pursuant to section , paragraphs (a) and (d), of the Code:For the purposes of the last preceding section () the following shall be deemed to be public services:(a) all work performed by persons in the employment of the State or a state institution, if the work in question is not of the same nature as work performed also by private undertakings carried on for profit;(d) work performed by employees who are strictly indispensable for the maintenance in operation of private undertakings which cannot suspend their services without causing serious and immediate prejudice to public health or public economy in general, such as clinics and hospitals, and municipal hygiene, cleaning and lighting services;The Government adds that the trial of Alfaro Ziga and Devanda Brenes is still before the Higher Penal Court, following an appeal by the defence.
.The Committee takes note of this information.
.Finally, the Committee had received allegations relating to the dismissal of trade union officials. According to the Complainants, Carlos Manuel Acua Castro, Deputy General Secretary of the National Union of Social Security Employees (UNDECA), had been dismissed on  June  from his post as legal inspector at the Social Security Fund on the grounds that he had been attending courses at the law faculty, whereas in reality, according to the complainants, he had merely sat for the examinations with the authorisation of his employer. The complainants considered that this situation was the consequence of the complaint presented to the Council of State on the subject of the interference of the Social Security Fund in the general assembly of the union and the participation of Acua Castro in the elections. It was further alleged that Cristin Sobrado Chaves, General Secretary of the Union of Bank Employees of Costa Rica (UNEBANCO), had been dismissed without due cause on  February , after the Higher Labour Court had pronounced the dismissal unjustified. Furthermore, according to the complainants, this measure was a violation of the arbitration award in force at the Bank. Sobrado Chaves had been reproached with unjustified absence from work although, according to the complainants, he had absented himself with the authorisation of his immediate supervisors to carry out activities related to a collective dispute which the bank workers had brought before the labour judge.
.The Government affirmed that, according to the Social Security Fund, Acua Castro's dismissal constituted a sanction for a misdemeanour committed by a worker and should not be artificially connected with other events which had nothing to do with the case. Nevertheless, the Labour Court and, subsequently, the Higher Labour Court of San Jos had judged that the suit filed by Acua Castro against the Social Security Fund was receivable. On  August , the Division of Cassation of the Supreme Court had confirmed this decision. It stated that the judges considered that the reasons given by the employer for the dismissal of Acua Castro were unjustified and ordered the Fund to pay him nine months' wages as compensation, taking account of his seniority in employment. The judges nevertheless considered that Acua Castro had not proved that he had been dismissed on account of his trade union activities and was accordingly not entitled to compensation on this account.
.The Government further stated that, on  August , the Bank of Costa Rica had applied to the labour courts which were examining the collective labour dispute raised by the bank workers for authorisation to dismiss Cristin Sobrado Chaves. The Bank had alleged that the accused had committed unpardonable breaches of discipline. On  February , Sobrado Chaves was dismissed on the grounds of unjustified absences from work. The Bank informed him that, since the arbitration of the collective labour dispute was completed, it was at full liberty to apply the disciplinary sanctions corresponding to the misdemeanour concerned. The Government indicated that the case in question was now under examination by the labour judge of San Jos but that the proceedings, which began on  April , were not yet completed.
.The Committee noted the decision of the Supreme Court concerning Acua Castro. In this connection, it pointed out on a number of occasions that a worker may frequently find it difficult or even impossible to furnish proof that he has been the victim of anti-union discrimination. In the present case, the competent courts had judged that the trade union official had been dismissed without just cause. In these circumstances, the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, had requested the Government to envisage the possibility of reinstating Acua Castro in his employment. The Committee further noted that Sobrado Chaves had been dismissed a long time ago and that the legal proceedings were not yet completed. It recalled the importance which it attaches to the application of a rapid procedure for the examination of alleged cases of dismissal because of trade union activities, and the Governing Body had requested the Government to transmit, as soon as it was pronounced, the text of the judgement handed down in the case of Sobrado Chaves, with the reasons adduced therefor.
.In its letter of  September , the Government states that Acua Castro held for several months the post of chief of the technical co-operation and international affairs unit of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, which he had left of his own free will to take up a post in the private sector. As regards Sobrado Chaves, adds the Government, this case is still before the Labour Court but the judgement is expected to be handed down very soon and will be communicated to the ILO as soon",-1,1975,Costa Rica
168,"as it is pronounced.
.The Committee takes note of this information. However, it feels bound to draw attention once again to the considerable time that elapsed between the dismissal of Sobrado Chaves on  February  and the institution of legal proceedings. It wishes to repeat that a particularly rapid procedure should be applied for the examination of alleged cases of dismissal because of trade union activities. Any worker who is dependent on his employment will inevitably have difficulty in waiting for a long time once he has been deprived of his job because of what appears to him to be antiunion discrimination. Some countries have tackled this problem by means of emergency summary procedures; in the view of the Committee, adoption of such procedures on a temporary or permanent basis would undoubtedly help to improve the system of protection against forms of anti-union discrimination, especially dismissals.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to urge the Government once again to secure the adoption without delay of the draft provisions regarding the protection of workers' organisations against acts of interference by employers;(b) to take note of the information communicated by the Government concerning the existence of a compulsory arbitration procedure where strikes are prohibited, as in the case of the Costa Rican Electricity Institute and the National Institute of Housing and Town Planning and to request it to transmit the texts of the judgements pronounced in the cases of Alfaro Ziga and Devandas Brenes, with the reasons adduced therefor;(c) to draw the Government's attention, for the reasons set forth in paragraph , to the importance of a rapid procedure for examining alleged cases of dismissal because of trade union activities, to request it to communicate, as soon as it is pronounced, the text of the judgement handed down in respect of Sobrado Chaves, with the reasons adduced therefor, and to note further the information provided by the Government on Acua Castro;(d) to take note of the present interim report.
.The Committee already examined these cases in November , when it submitted the interim conclusions contained in paragraphs  to  of its nd Report. The Governing Body approved this report at its th Session (November ).
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations outstanding refer to the dismissal or arrest of trade union officials and to interference by the Social Security Fund in a trade union assembly. The Government sent further information by a letter of  April .
.According to the National Union of Social Security Employees (UNDECA), Mr. Carlos Manuel Acua Castro, Deputy General Secretary UNDECA, had been dismissed on  June  from his post as legal inspector at the Social Security Fund on the grounds that he had been attending courses at the law faculty, whereas in reality, according to the complainants, he had merely sat for the examinations with the authorisation of his employer. The complainants considered that this situation was the consequence of the complaint presented to the Council of State (Contralora general de la Repblica) on the subject of the interference of the Social Security Fund in the general assembly of the union and the participation of Mr. Acua Castro in the elections.
.The General Confederation of Workers (CGT) and the Union of Bank Employees of Costa Rica (UNEBANCO) referred to the situation of Mr. Christin Sobrado Chaves, General Secretary of UNEBANCO. It was alleged that Mr. Sobrado Chaves had been dismissed without due cause on  February , after the Higher Labour Court had pronounced the dismissal unjustified. Furthermore, according to the complainants, this measure was a violation of the arbitration award in force at the bank. Mr. Sobrado Chaves had been reproached with unjustified absence from work although, according to the complainants, he had absented himself with the authorisation of his immediate supervisors to carry out activities related to a collective dispute which the bank workers had brought before the labour judge.
.As regards the dismissal of Mr. Carl Os Manuel Acua Castro, the Government referred to a circular issued by the office of the Chairman of the Social Security Fund. It affirmed that the versions given of the case were untrue and that the measure in question constituted a sanction for a misdemeanour committed by a worker and should not be artificially connected with other events which had nothing to do with the case. The Government stated that on  January  the court of first instance, the San Jos labour court, judged that the suit filed by Mr. Acua Castro against the Social Security Fund was receivable. On  April  the court of second instance, the Higher Labour Court of San Jos, upheld this judgement. Finally, the Social Security Fund had filed an appeal before the Supreme Court for the quashing of the sentence. The Supreme Court had not yet given judgement.
.The Government further indicated that on  August  the Bank of Costa Rica had applied to the labour courts which were examining the collective labour dispute raised by the bank workers for, authorisation to dismiss Mr. Christin Sobrado Chaves. The bank had alleged that the accused had committed unpardonable breaches of discipline. The courts considered that the dismissal was unjustified. On  February , Mr. Sobrado Chaves was dismissed on the grounds of unjustified absences from work. The bank informed him that, since the arbitration of the collective labour dispute was completed, it was at full liberty to apply the disciplinary sanctions corresponding to the misdemeanour concerned. The Government indicated that the case in question was now under examination by the judicial authorities as the judges had expressed the view that the grounds for dismissal were controversial and might be diversely construed.
.In November , the Committee noted that these two cases had been brought before the competent courts, where they were still pending. On its recommendations, the Governing Body had requested the Government to supply the text of any judgements rendered.
.The Government attaches to its communication of  April  the judgement rendered by the Division of Cassation of the Supreme Court concerning the dismissal of Mr. Acua Castro by the Costa Rican Social Security Fund. This decision, dated  August , confirms those of the lower jurisdictions. It states that the judges consider that the reasons given by the employer for the dismissal of Mr. Acua Castro were unjustified and orders the Fund to pay him nine months' wages as compensation, taking account of his seniority in employment. The judges nevertheless consider that Mr. Acua Castro did not prove that he had been dismissed on account of his trade union activities and was accordingly not entitled to compensation on this account.
.In addition, states the Government, proceedings have been instituted before the San Jos labour court against the Bank of Costa Rica in the case of Mr. Sobrado Chaves. The proceedings, which began on  April , are not yet completed.
.The Committee notes the decision of the Supreme Court concerning the first of the persons cited by the complainants. In this connection, the Committee has pointed out on a number of occasions that a worker may frequently find it difficult or even impossible to furnish proof that he has been the victim of an act of anti-union discrimination. In the present case, the competent courts judged that Mr. Acua Castro, Deputy General Secretary of the National Union of Social Security Employees, had been dismissed without just cause. In these circumstances, the Committee considers it desirable that the Government should re-examine this case and envisage the possibility of reinstating Mr. Acua Castro.
.In addition, the Committee feels obliged to point out that, although the aforementioned order of the Supreme Court is dated  August , the Government made no mention of it in its earlier communications (dated  May ). The Committee can only regret that this was not done, and trusts that the Government will communicate a copy of the judgement given in the case of Mr. Sobrado Chaves as soon as this has been rendered. In the latter connection, the Committee notes that Mr. Sobrado Chaves was dismissed over a year ago and that the legal proceedings are not yet completed. It wishes to recall the importance which it attaches to the application of a rapid procedure for the examination of alleged cases of dismissal because of trade union activities
.The CGT also alleged that Mr. Luis Fernando Alfaro Ziga, General Secretary of the Trade Union Association of Employees of the Costa Rican Electricity Institute, had first been removed from his job and subsequently, owing to a strike which had been called by the general assembly of the union for  to  July , had been charged by the public prosecutor's office with incitement to strike and other offences. He was imprisoned and was refused bail.
.In addition, stated the complainants, Mr. Mario Devandas Brenes, General Secretary of the National Federation of Public Service Workers (FENATRAP), had",-1,1975,Costa Rica
169,"been dismissed from his job at the National Institute of Housing and Town Planning (where he was also general secretary of the union) and subsequently, on the grounds of a strike called by the workers of the institute, had been charged with the same offences as Mr. Alfaro Ziga and detained under the same conditions. These two persons were being held at the public prison of Heredia, along with common law offenders.
.The Government replied that Mr. Luis Fernando Alfaro Ziga had made subversive speeches during the strike called on  July  at the Costa Rican Electricity Institute. For this reason, the Public Prosecutor of the Republic had charged him before the municipal court of Tibs with riot, incitement to a collective stoppage of services and conduct prejudicial to public order. The trial had not yet been completed.
.As regards the case of Mr. Mario Devandas Brenes, continued the Government, he had been charged with the same offences as Mr. Alfaro Ziga, for which he was also being prosecuted before the municipal court of Tibs.
.The Committee took note of this information. It nevertheless noted that the facts impugned go back to July  and that the trade unionists concerned have not yet been brought to trial. Moreover, it was not possible to determine with any certainty whether the persons concerned were still detained. The Committee recalled the importance it attached to the principle that in all cases, including those in which trade unionists are charged with offences of a political nature or under common law, which the Government considers to have no bearing on their trade union activities, the persons concerned should be tried rapidly by an impartial and independent judicial authority. On its recommendations, the Governing Body had drawn the Government's attention to this principle and requested it to supply the texts of the judgements rendered in the two cases.
.In its letter of  April  the Government states that proceedings have been instituted against the two abovementioned trade unionists before the Higher Court of San Jos, which has ordered them to be released on , colons bail each
.It would appear from available information that proceedings have been instituted against two trade union officials for strikes in public services. They have nevertheless been released on bail. The Committee has stressed on a number of occasions that recognition of the right of public employees to organise does not imply the right to strike.
.Nevertheless, since the right to strike is an essential means available to the workers and their organisations for defending and promoting their occupational interests, the Committee has pointed out in a number of cases concerning Costa Rica that, where strikes are prohibited or severely restricted in essential services or in the civil service, adequate guarantees should be ensured to safeguard the interests of the workers to the full. Among such guarantees the Committee has made special mention of adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures in which the parties can take part at every stage and in which the awards are binding in all cases on both parties; these awards, once they have been made, should be fully and promptly implemented. In the present case, section  of the Labour code prohibits strikes in the public services, and any disputes which may arise between employers and workers in these sectors must be referred to the labour courts for settlement.
.Nevertheless, in one of the above-mentioned cases relating to Costa Rica, the complainants alleged that, under the special act setting up the Costa Rican Electricity Institute, this body was not obliged to submit to compulsory arbitration. The Government had supplied no information on this point. The Committee considered that, if the allegation was correct, the workers of the institute would be deprived not only of the right to strike but also of the other safeguards mentioned to protect their occupational interests. The Committee therefore feels it to be necessary, in the present case, for the Government to specify whether section  was applicable to the collective labour disputes at the Costa Rican Electricity Institute and the National Institute of Housing and Town Planning.
.The National Union of Social Security Employees alleged that the Costa Rican Social Security Fund had interfered with the holding of the union's general assemblies; in particular, it had engaged in manoeuvres to impose certain persons on the trade union leadership and to remove the new executive Committee which had been legally elected.
.The Government had supplied no comments in this connection. In November  the Committee recalled that freedom of assembly and election by trade union organisations, without interference by employers and the public authorities, constitutes an essential guarantee of the free exercise of trade union rights. Furthermore, Article  of Convention no.  stipulates that workers' organisations shall enjoy adequate protection against any acts of interference by employers (either directly, or by their agents or members) in their establishment, functioning or administration. In particular, acts which are designed to support workers' organisations by financial or other means, with the object of placing such organisations under the control of employers or employers' organisations, are deemed to constitute acts of interference. The Governing Body had requested the Government to communicate its observations on this aspect of the case.
.The Government has still not supplied comments in this connection.
.The Committee regrets that the Government has not yet seen fit to reply to these allegations, which refer to incidents that took place three years ago. In an earlier case relating to Costa Rica, the Committee pointed out that in ratifying Convention No.  the Government had undertaken to secure the implementation of the guarantees contained in Article  of the said Convention, and was accordingly under the obligation to take steps to ensure that the occupational organisations were provided by the national legislation with the means to enforce the rights guaranteed to them under the said provisions.) The Committee subsequently noted that Costa Rican legislation contained no specific provisions to protect workers' organisations from acts of interference by employers and their organisations. According to section  of the Labour Code ""any case not provided for by this Code, the regulations hereunder or acts supplementary or related thereto shall be decided in accordance with the general principles of labour law, equity and local custom and usage; in default thereof the provisions laid down in the Conventions and Recommendations adopted by the International Labour Organisation shall be applied in the first place, in so far as they are not contrary to the laws of the country, and thereafter the principles and enactments of ordinary law"". The Committee had also pointed out that Convention No. , by virtue of its ratification by Costa Rica, had been incorporated in the national legislation, and accordingly considered that it would be most appropriate for the Government to examine the possibility of adopting clear and precise provisions ensuring the adequate protection of workers' organisations against any acts of interference by employers and their organisations.
.The Committee considers that these conclusions are also applicable in the present case. It would appear from an observation made by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations in  that a draft law concerning collective labour relations containing provisions giving protection to workers' organisations against acts of interference has been submitted to the legislative assembly but has not yet been adopted.
.In these circumstances, and as regards the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the dismissal of two trade union officials, to request the Government, for the reasons set forth in paragraph , to envisage the possibility of reinstating Mr. Acua Castro in his employment, and also to request it to transmit the text of the judgement given in the case of Mr. Sobrado Chaves, with the reasons adduced therefor;(b) as regards the arrest of two other trade union officials:(i) to recall the considerations and principles set forth in paragraphs  and  regarding strikes in public services;(ii) to request the Government, for the reasons set forth in paragraphs  and , to state whether the procedure for the peaceful settlement of disputes provided for under section  of the Labour Code is applicable to disputes in the Costa Rican Electricity Institute and the National Institute of Town Planning;(iii) to note that Messrs. Alfaro Ziga and Devandas Brenes have been released on bail, and to request the Government to transmit the texts of the judgements pronounced in their cases, with the reasons adduced therefor;(c) as regards the interference by the Social Security Fund in a trade union assembly, to urge the Government, for the reasons set forth in paragraphs  and , to adopt without delay the draft provisions regarding the protection of workers' organisations against acts of interference by employers or their organisations;(d) to take note of the present interim report.
.The complaints of the National Union of Social Security Employees, the General Confederation of workers and the Union of Bank Employees of Costa Rica are contained in communications dated  June ,  August ",-1,1975,Costa Rica
170,"and  March  respectively. The texts of these communications were transmitted to the Government, which furnished its observations in letters of  May .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to request the Government to communicate its observations on the allegations relating to interference by the Social Security Fund in the general assembly of the Union of Social Security Employees in June ;(b) to draw the attention of the Government to the terms of the Workers' Representatives Recommendation,  (No. ), quoted in paragraph  above;(c) to request the Government to transmit the texts of the judgements rendered in the cases concerning the dismissal of Mr. Acua Castro and Mr. Sobrado Chaves;(d) to draw attention to the principle set forth in paragraph  above concerning guarantees of rapid judicial procedure, and to request the Government to supply the texts of the judgements rendered in the proceedings against Mr. Alfaro Ziga and Mr. Devandas Brenes. Mr. Devandas Brenes;(e) to take note of the present interim report.",0,1975,Costa Rica
171,".The Latin American Federation of Workers in the Timber and Construction Industry (FLATICOM) presented a complaint by a communication of  August  alleging violation of freedom of association in Costa Rica.
.The text of this communication was transmitted to the Government, which submitted its comments by a letter dated  May .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.FLATICOM alleged in its complaint that members of the Executive Council of the union of the Association of Prefabricated Houses of the firm Terrenos, Urbanizaciones y Casas SA (TUCASA), which is affiliated to it, had been persecuted. The complainant organisation stated that on  July  seven leaders of that union, including the general secretary, had been unfairly dismissed.
.According to the complainants, this action proved clearly that there was anti-union discrimination in that undertaking. FLATICOM enclosed with its letter a communication which it had addressed to the Minister of Labour and Social Security, in which it called for the reinstatement of these union leaders.
.In its reply, the Government stated that it was quite possible that the undertaking was experiencing a difficult financial situation during the year , which would have explained the large-scale dismissals of workers from the undertaking during that period, since it was already evident that the firm was going bankrupt. Thus, continued the Government, from January to July ,  workers were dismissed, including the seven union leaders, and other persons had resigned.
.The dismissal of the union leaders resulted in the filing of a complaint for union persecution, on  July, by the Costa Rican Workers' Confederation with the National Directorate of Labour Inspection of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security. The text of the complaint in question is appended to the Government's communication.
.The Government also enclosed with its communication a copy of the report which the Inspector responsible for the case addressed to the National Director of Labour Inspection. In this document, the Inspector concluded that on the basis of the evidence produced ""there was persecution of the workers forming the union's executive council"". The matter was transmitted to a higher authority but, whilst the necessary complaints were being prepared for submission to the courts, the company filed a bankruptcy petition with the Civil Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice. Considering that it was of little importance to pursue the complaint for anti-trade union discrimination, but that it was more important to solve the serious social problem of unemployment, the Government endeavoured to help the workers and to ensure the payment of their entitlements and compensation. Consequently, the Government asked that the complaint be rejected.
.The Committee has always considered as a basic principle of freedom of association that workers must be adequately protected against all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment. This protection is particularly desirable in the case of trade union delegates, since, in order to perform their trade union functions in complete independence, they must have the assurance that their trade union activities will not cause them any prejudice.
.In the present case, the Committee notes that an inquiry was carried out by the labour inspectorate after the dismissals, and that the matter was about to be referred to the courts when the undertaking went bankrupt.
.In these circumstances, and in view of the bankruptcy of the undertaking in question, whilst recalling the principles mentioned in paragraph  above, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that no purpose would be served in pursuing its examination of this case.",0,1975,Costa Rica
172,".The Committee already examined these cases in November  and in May and November ; on each occasion it submitted interim conclusions, which are to be found in its nd Report (paragraphs  to ), st Report (paragraphs  to ) and th Report (paragraphs  to ). The Governing Body approved these reports in November  and in June and November  (th, th and th Sessions), respectively. The Government handed over various documents with a bearing on the case at an interview on  June  between the Minister of Labour and the Chairman of the Committee, and supplied further information in a communication dated  July .
.Costa Rica has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.At its sessions in June and November , the Committee made certain comments in relation to the question of principle raised by the alleged interference by the Costa Rican Social Security Fund in the affairs of its employees' union. In September  the Government sent information with respect to one aspect of the question, namely the reasons for the dismissal of a trade union official.
.Recalling its conclusions in an earlier case relating to Costa Rica, the Committee pointed out that ratification of Convention No.  involved an undertaking, under the terms of Article  of that Convention, to ensure that workers' organisations in particular were provided by the legislation with the means to protect themselves against interference by employers or their organisations. Costa Rican legislation contained no specific provisions to this effect.
.On the Committee's recommendation, in June , the Governing Body urged the Government to adopt the necessary provisions without delay in a communication dated  September , the Government stated that it had taken note of these recommendations, which the Governing Body reiterated in November  when it approved paragraph  of the Committee's th Report.
.In its further observations of  July  the Government states that the alleged interference by the Costa Rican Social Security Fund in the union UNDECA never took place. Among the documents supplied is an attestation by the authorities of the Fund to the effect that an examination of the accounts for the period to which the complaint refers ( and ) shows that the Fund did not pay the travelling expenses of workers as an inducement to attend a certain trade union meeting, as has been claimed by the complainants. The Government also draws attention to the information furnished earlier to the effect that a judgement pronounced in August  had declared it not proven that Mr. Carlos Acua Castro, an official of the union, had been dismissed on account of his trade union activities. The Government supplies the text of this judgement. In addition, in letters sent to the ILO by Mr. Acuo Castro - now a Ministry of Labour official - and a number of the UNDECA officials who had signed the complaint, it is acknowledged that the facts were not as serious as was claimed in the first place.
.The Committee notes this information. It nevertheless considers that its general conclusions as to the need for legislative provisions which will protect workers' organisations against possible interference by employers are still applicable. In effect, to give the necessary publicity to provisions such as those of Article  of the Convention and ensure that full effect is given to them in practice, even in cases where ratification has the effect of incorporating the international standard in municipal law, it is highly important that these provisions, accompanied by provision for appeals and penalties to ensure that they are complied with, should be embodied explicitly in the relevant legislation. The Committee is therefore of the opinion that the recommendations already approved by the Governing Body in this respect should be maintained.
.The other matters still outstanding concern the dismissal from their jobs of three other officials of unions of employees in the public sector and the criminal proceedings brought by the authorities against two of them. These events occurred in  and . According to the allegations, Luis Fernando Alfaro Ziga, General Secretary of the Trade Union Association of Employees of the Costa Rican Electricity Institute, and Mario Devandas Brenes, General Secretary of the National Federation of Public Service workers, were dismissed from their jobs. Subsequently, according to the complainants, because of strikes called by workers belonging to their respective unions, they were charged with incitement to strike and other offences and imprisoned. The Government stated that Alfaro Ziga had made subversive speeches during a strike in July  at the Costa Rican Electricity Institute and that the Public Prosecutor had charged both him and Devandas Brenes with riot, incitement to a collective stoppage of public services and conduct prejudicial to public order. Both were to be brought to trial and the court had allowed them to be released on bail.
.Bearing in mind the principles it had upheld in this connection, the Committee examined the provisions of the Labour Code which prohibit strikes in the public services and make it compulsory for any disputes between employers and workers in this sector to be referred to the labour courts. The Committee pointed out in particular that where strikes were prohibited or restricted in essential services or in the civil service, adequate guarantees should be ensured to safeguard the interest of the workers to the full, including in particular the existence of adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures in which the parties could take part at every stage and in which the awards were binding in all cases on both parties and must be fully and promptly implemented. In this connection the Government confirmed that the procedure for the peaceful settlement of disputes prescribed in the Labour Code was applicable to disputes at the Costa Rican Electricity Institute and the National Institute of Housing and Town Planning.
.On the Committee's recommendation, in November  the Governing Body requested the Government to transmit the texts of the judgements pronounced in the cases of Messrs. Alfaro Ziga and Devandas Brenes, with the reasons adduced therefore.
.The remaining dismissal involved Mr. Cristin Sobrado Chaves, General Secretary of the Union of Bank Employees of Costa Rica. He had been dismissed in February , according to the complainants, on the false pretext of unjustified absences from work. The Government stated inter alia that legal proceedings were pending in connection with this matter. In November  the Committee and the Governing Body drew attention to the importance of a rapid procedure for examining alleged cases of dismissal because of trade union activities. The Government was requested to supply the text of the judgement handed down in the case relating to the dismissal of Mr. Sobrado Chaves.
.The documents and observations communicated by the Government on  June and  July  include the texts of the judgements requested. As concerns Mr. Devandas Brenes, it is stated in the judgements pronounced by the labour court and the Higher Labour Court in September and October  that he was discharged on  March  by the institute of Housing and Town Planning together with other workers, as part of a retrenchment of staff rendered necessary by financial difficulties. The judges considered it proven that Mr. Devandas Brenes had been dismissed for this reason and not arbitrarily or as a means of anti-union persecution, and that the employer had obtained authorisation in advance from an advisory board as required by the collective agreement. As regards Mr. Alfaro Ziga, the judgements, likewise of first and second instance, pronounced in March and May  state that he was dismissed in February  by the Costa Rican Electricity Institute. The union had filed a complaint with the Legislative Assembly against the authorities of the Institute, accusing them of corruption and mismanagement. The Assembly set up a commission of inquiry. Later the union executive had a statement published in the press accusing the authorities of the institute of anti-union persecution. The latter enjoined Mr. Alfaro Ziga to substantiate some of the charges made, which he did not do himself, but left it to the union, whereupon he was dismissed. The court considered that the dismissal was justified, observing, inter alia, that while the union was a separate legal entity from its members, this fact did not exonerate Mr. Alfaro Ziga from his responsibilities as an employee in his relations with his employer. According to the court, the statement published by the union was based on charges made personally by this employee, who did not substantiate them as instructed by his employer, and was thus guilty of dishonesty and disloyalty. The court considered that there was just cause for dismissal on the ground of serious non-compliance with the obligations deriving from a contract of employment as specified in the Labour Code.
.The Government also supplies information concerning the criminal proceedings initiated in  against Messrs. Devandas Brenes and Alfaro Ziga on charges of riot",0,1975,Costa Rica
173,"and incitement to a collective stoppage of public services. According to the indictment put before the criminal court, on the occasion of a strike at the Costa Rican Electricity Institute in July of that year, these persons, who had no connection with the Institute (Mr. Alfaro Ziga having been dismissed from it a few months earlier, as stated above), insinuated themselves into the movement and by haranguing them and making subversive speeches incited some  workers to take part in a collective cessation of their public duties; they succeeded in persuading them to stop work, thus paralysing the main electricity supply plant. Also according to the indictment, the strike had been declared unlawful that very same day by the labour court - a ruling not found acceptable by the strikers, who insulted and stoned the Civil Guardsmen who arrived two days later to enforce the court order.
.The Government furnishes a judicial attestation to the effect that in May , when Mr. Devandas Brenes was elected to be a member of the Legislative Assembly, the examining magistrate eliminated him from the proceedings, which he continued with respect to the other accused. The Government considers that it has demonstrated that these persons participated in an unlawful strike staged in an institution for which they did not work and not ""in strikes called by workers belonging to their respective unions"" it further states that neither the dismissals nor the measures taken to preserve law and order constituted breaches of the ILO Conventions on freedom of association.
.With regard to Mr. Sobrado Chaves, who, as stated above, was General Secretary of the Onion of Bank Employees of Costa Rica at the time of his dismissal, the Government also supplies the text of the judgement pronounced by the labour judge and confirmed on appeal, rejecting his claim against the bank. These judgements state that in connection with a collective dispute, Mr. Sobrado Chaves was appointed by the employees of the bank to be one of their representatives at a conciliation tribunal. The bank authorities considered that he was subsequently guilty of unjustified absences and requested authorisation from the courts to dismiss him, which was refused so long as the collective dispute was still pending. The bank dismissed him as soon as the dispute was settled in the judgement it is declared proven that this person absented himself from work  times over a period of two months without having given due notice. The court states that employers may not refuse time off to employees appointed to represent the workers at conciliation proceedings, but that this right of an employee is not unrestricted, but is limited to the time required to attend such proceedings and does not extend to other activities unconnected with the conciliation tribunal. In the case in question, according to the judgement, the repeated absences did not coincide with any of the hearings of the conciliation tribunal.
.The Committee observes that the Government has now supplied detailed information about these events, which occurred some time ago. It considers nevertheless that the texts of the judgements in question have been useful in helping it to reach its conclusions.
.The Committee and the Governing Body have constantly emphasised the importance of the principle that workers should enjoy adequate protection against all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment. In this very case, the Committee has pointed out that such a guarantee is also necessary in the case of trade union officials in order to give effect to the fundamental principle that workers' organisations must have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom. The Committee has nevertheless stated that this principle does not necessarily imply that the fact that a person holds trade union office confers on him immunity against dismissal irrespective of the circumstances. In certain cases the Committee has expressed the view that dismissal for absence from work without the employer's permission does not appear in itself to constitute an infringement of freedom of association.
.As concerns the dismissal of three general secretaries of organisations of workers in the public sector, the Committee observes that they took place in different circumstances and for different reasons, two of the persons concerned being accused of failing in their duty as employees to an extent considered by the country's courts to be sufficiently serious to justify their dis-missal in the other case, the official concerned was one of a group of workers who lost their jobs as a result of a forced reduction in staff.
.In these circumstances, the Committee notes that in the cases to which the complaints refer it has not been proved that there was any infringement of freedom of association. Nevertheless, whatever the grounds for these dismissals may have been, it appears desirable to draw attention to the inevitably prejudicial effects upon trade union organisations and their members, and upon industrial relations, deriving from situations of this kind. The Committee wishes to point out that in the public sector an effective means of helping to prevent such situations may be to put into practice measures inspired by the principles of the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ), not only as concerns the protection of public employees against anti-union discrimination (Article  of the Convention) but also as regards the determination, through negotiation or other methods as provided for in the Convention, of the nature and scope of the facilities to be afforded, without prejudice to the efficient operation of the service concerned, to the representatives of recognised public employees' organisations (Articles  and ).
.In these circumstances, with regard to these cases as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as concerns the question of the protection of workers' organisations against possible acts of interference by employers, to draw the Government's attention once again, for the reasons indicated in paragraph  above, to the desirability of adopting special legislative measures in order to give full effect to this principle;(b) with regard to the dismissal of trade union officials in the public sector:(i) to take note of the fact that the Government has supplied the texts of the judgements pronounced in these cases, from which it appears that in the cases in question there has been no infringement of freedom of association;(ii) nevertheless, with a view to preventing possible acts of anti-union discrimination and the harmful consequences deriving from the dismissal of trade union officials, to draw attention to the importance of putting into practice the measures indicated in paragraph  above;(c) to bring this report to the notice of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.
.The Committee already examined these cases in November  and in May ; on each occasion it submitted interim conclusions, in paragraphs  to  of its nd Report and in paragraphs  to  of its st Report, respectively. The Governing Body approved the first of these reports at its th Session (November ) and the second at its th Session (June ). The Government sent further information in a letter dated  September .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.When it last examined these cases, the Committee's conclusions related to the dismissal and arrest of trade union leaders and to interference by the Social Security Fund in a trade union assembly.
.With regard to the latter point, the complainants had alleged that the Costa Rican Social Security Fund had interfered with the holding of the union's general assemblies; in particular, it had engaged in manoeuvres to impose certain persons on the trade union leadership and to remove the new executive Committee which had been legally elected. The Government had made no observations on this point and the Committee had expressed its regret that the Government had not done so.
.Referring to the conclusions it had reached in an earlier case relating to Costa Rica, the Committee pointed out that in ratifying Convention No.  the Government had undertaken to secure the implementation of the guarantees contained in Article  of the said Convention and was accordingly under the obligation to take steps to ensure that workers' organisations, in particular, were provided by the national legislation with the means to protect themselves against interference by employers or their associations. Although Costa Rican legislation contained no specific provisions to this effect, a draft law concerning collective labour relations did contain them; the draft law had been submitted to the legislative assembly but had not yet been adopted.
.On the recommendation of the Committee, the Governing Body, in June , urged the Government to adopt without delay the draft provisions regarding the protection of workers' organisations against acts of interference by employers or their organisations. In its letter of  September , the Government states that it has taken note of these observations.
.The allegations outstanding also refer to the arrest of Luis Fernando Alfaro Ziga, General Secretary of the Trade Union Association of",-1,1975,Costa Rica
174,"Employees of the Costa Rican Electricity Institute, and of Mario Devanda Brenes, General Secretary of the National Federation of Public Service Workers (FENATRAP) and of the National Institute of Housing and Town Planning. According to the complainants, both had first been dismissed from their jobs; subsequently, because of the strike called by the workers of the establishments in which they had been employed, they were charged by the public prosecutor's office with incitement to strike and other offences. Both were being held at the public prison of Heredia, along with common criminals.
.The Government had replied that Luis Fernando Alfaro Ziga had made subversive speeches during the strike called on  July  at the Costa Rican Electricity Institute. The Public Prosecutor had brought charges against him of riot, incitement to a collective stoppage of services and conduct prejudicial to public order. Mario Devanda Brenes had been charged with the same offences. The Government stated that these two persons were to be brought to trial before the Higher Court of San Jose, which had ordered them to be released on bail of , colons each.
.Proceedings had therefore been instituted against the two trade unionists for strikes in public services. The Committee recalled, in this connection, that recognition of the right of public employees to organise did not imply the right to strike. Nevertheless, since the right to strike is an essential means available to the workers and their organisations for defending and promoting their occupational interests, where strikes are prohibited or severely restricted in essential services or in the civil service, adequate guarantees should be ensured to safeguard the interests of the workers to the full. Among such guarantees the Committee has made special mention of adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures in which the parties can take part at every stage and in which the awards are binding in all cases on both parties; these awards, once they have been made, should be fully and promptly implemented.
.In the present case, section  of the Labour Code prohibits strikes in the public services, and any disputes which may arise between employers and workers in these sectors must be referred to the labour courts for compulsory settlement. Nevertheless, in an earlier case relating to Costa Rica, the complainants alleged that, under the special law setting up the Costa Rican Electricity institute, this body was not obliged to submit to compulsory arbitration. The Government had supplied no information on this point. The Committee considered that, if the allegation was correct, the workers of the Institute would be deprived not only of the right to strike but also of the other safeguards mentioned to protect their occupational interests. In June , the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, had requested the Government to state whether the procedure for the peaceful settlement of disputes provided for under section  of the Labour Code was applicable to disputes in the Costa Rican Electricity Institute and the National Institute of Housing and Town Planning. The Governing Body had also requested the Government to transmit the texts of the judgements pronounced in the cases of Alfaro Ziga and Devandas Brenes.
.In its letter of  September , the Government states that it has taken note of the principles and considerations outlined above and specifies that section  of the Labour code is fully applicable to the National Institute of Housing and Town Planning and the Costa Rican Electricity Institute, pursuant to section , paragraphs (a) and (d), of the Code:For the purposes of the last preceding section () the following shall be deemed to be public services:(a) all work performed by persons in the employment of the State or a state institution, if the work in question is not of the same nature as work performed also by private undertakings carried on for profit;(d) work performed by employees who are strictly indispensable for the maintenance in operation of private undertakings which cannot suspend their services without causing serious and immediate prejudice to public health or public economy in general, such as clinics and hospitals, and municipal hygiene, cleaning and lighting services;The Government adds that the trial of Alfaro Ziga and Devanda Brenes is still before the Higher Penal Court, following an appeal by the defence.
.The Committee takes note of this information.
.Finally, the Committee had received allegations relating to the dismissal of trade union officials. According to the Complainants, Carlos Manuel Acua Castro, Deputy General Secretary of the National Union of Social Security Employees (UNDECA), had been dismissed on  June  from his post as legal inspector at the Social Security Fund on the grounds that he had been attending courses at the law faculty, whereas in reality, according to the complainants, he had merely sat for the examinations with the authorisation of his employer. The complainants considered that this situation was the consequence of the complaint presented to the Council of State on the subject of the interference of the Social Security Fund in the general assembly of the union and the participation of Acua Castro in the elections. It was further alleged that Cristin Sobrado Chaves, General Secretary of the Union of Bank Employees of Costa Rica (UNEBANCO), had been dismissed without due cause on  February , after the Higher Labour Court had pronounced the dismissal unjustified. Furthermore, according to the complainants, this measure was a violation of the arbitration award in force at the Bank. Sobrado Chaves had been reproached with unjustified absence from work although, according to the complainants, he had absented himself with the authorisation of his immediate supervisors to carry out activities related to a collective dispute which the bank workers had brought before the labour judge.
.The Government affirmed that, according to the Social Security Fund, Acua Castro's dismissal constituted a sanction for a misdemeanour committed by a worker and should not be artificially connected with other events which had nothing to do with the case. Nevertheless, the Labour Court and, subsequently, the Higher Labour Court of San Jos had judged that the suit filed by Acua Castro against the Social Security Fund was receivable. On  August , the Division of Cassation of the Supreme Court had confirmed this decision. It stated that the judges considered that the reasons given by the employer for the dismissal of Acua Castro were unjustified and ordered the Fund to pay him nine months' wages as compensation, taking account of his seniority in employment. The judges nevertheless considered that Acua Castro had not proved that he had been dismissed on account of his trade union activities and was accordingly not entitled to compensation on this account.
.The Government further stated that, on  August , the Bank of Costa Rica had applied to the labour courts which were examining the collective labour dispute raised by the bank workers for authorisation to dismiss Cristin Sobrado Chaves. The Bank had alleged that the accused had committed unpardonable breaches of discipline. On  February , Sobrado Chaves was dismissed on the grounds of unjustified absences from work. The Bank informed him that, since the arbitration of the collective labour dispute was completed, it was at full liberty to apply the disciplinary sanctions corresponding to the misdemeanour concerned. The Government indicated that the case in question was now under examination by the labour judge of San Jos but that the proceedings, which began on  April , were not yet completed.
.The Committee noted the decision of the Supreme Court concerning Acua Castro. In this connection, it pointed out on a number of occasions that a worker may frequently find it difficult or even impossible to furnish proof that he has been the victim of anti-union discrimination. In the present case, the competent courts had judged that the trade union official had been dismissed without just cause. In these circumstances, the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, had requested the Government to envisage the possibility of reinstating Acua Castro in his employment. The Committee further noted that Sobrado Chaves had been dismissed a long time ago and that the legal proceedings were not yet completed. It recalled the importance which it attaches to the application of a rapid procedure for the examination of alleged cases of dismissal because of trade union activities, and the Governing Body had requested the Government to transmit, as soon as it was pronounced, the text of the judgement handed down in the case of Sobrado Chaves, with the reasons adduced therefor.
.In its letter of  September , the Government states that Acua Castro held for several months the post of chief of the technical co-operation and international affairs unit of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, which he had left of his own free will to take up a post in the private sector. As regards Sobrado Chaves, adds the Government, this case is still before the Labour Court but the judgement is expected to be handed down very soon and will be communicated to the ILO as soon",-1,1975,Costa Rica
175,"as it is pronounced.
.The Committee takes note of this information. However, it feels bound to draw attention once again to the considerable time that elapsed between the dismissal of Sobrado Chaves on  February  and the institution of legal proceedings. It wishes to repeat that a particularly rapid procedure should be applied for the examination of alleged cases of dismissal because of trade union activities. Any worker who is dependent on his employment will inevitably have difficulty in waiting for a long time once he has been deprived of his job because of what appears to him to be antiunion discrimination. Some countries have tackled this problem by means of emergency summary procedures; in the view of the Committee, adoption of such procedures on a temporary or permanent basis would undoubtedly help to improve the system of protection against forms of anti-union discrimination, especially dismissals.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to urge the Government once again to secure the adoption without delay of the draft provisions regarding the protection of workers' organisations against acts of interference by employers;(b) to take note of the information communicated by the Government concerning the existence of a compulsory arbitration procedure where strikes are prohibited, as in the case of the Costa Rican Electricity Institute and the National Institute of Housing and Town Planning and to request it to transmit the texts of the judgements pronounced in the cases of Alfaro Ziga and Devandas Brenes, with the reasons adduced therefor;(c) to draw the Government's attention, for the reasons set forth in paragraph , to the importance of a rapid procedure for examining alleged cases of dismissal because of trade union activities, to request it to communicate, as soon as it is pronounced, the text of the judgement handed down in respect of Sobrado Chaves, with the reasons adduced therefor, and to note further the information provided by the Government on Acua Castro;(d) to take note of the present interim report.
.The Committee already examined these cases in November , when it submitted the interim conclusions contained in paragraphs  to  of its nd Report. The Governing Body approved this report at its th Session (November ).
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations outstanding refer to the dismissal or arrest of trade union officials and to interference by the Social Security Fund in a trade union assembly. The Government sent further information by a letter of  April .
.According to the National Union of Social Security Employees (UNDECA), Mr. Carlos Manuel Acua Castro, Deputy General Secretary UNDECA, had been dismissed on  June  from his post as legal inspector at the Social Security Fund on the grounds that he had been attending courses at the law faculty, whereas in reality, according to the complainants, he had merely sat for the examinations with the authorisation of his employer. The complainants considered that this situation was the consequence of the complaint presented to the Council of State (Contralora general de la Repblica) on the subject of the interference of the Social Security Fund in the general assembly of the union and the participation of Mr. Acua Castro in the elections.
.The General Confederation of Workers (CGT) and the Union of Bank Employees of Costa Rica (UNEBANCO) referred to the situation of Mr. Christin Sobrado Chaves, General Secretary of UNEBANCO. It was alleged that Mr. Sobrado Chaves had been dismissed without due cause on  February , after the Higher Labour Court had pronounced the dismissal unjustified. Furthermore, according to the complainants, this measure was a violation of the arbitration award in force at the bank. Mr. Sobrado Chaves had been reproached with unjustified absence from work although, according to the complainants, he had absented himself with the authorisation of his immediate supervisors to carry out activities related to a collective dispute which the bank workers had brought before the labour judge.
.As regards the dismissal of Mr. Carl Os Manuel Acua Castro, the Government referred to a circular issued by the office of the Chairman of the Social Security Fund. It affirmed that the versions given of the case were untrue and that the measure in question constituted a sanction for a misdemeanour committed by a worker and should not be artificially connected with other events which had nothing to do with the case. The Government stated that on  January  the court of first instance, the San Jos labour court, judged that the suit filed by Mr. Acua Castro against the Social Security Fund was receivable. On  April  the court of second instance, the Higher Labour Court of San Jos, upheld this judgement. Finally, the Social Security Fund had filed an appeal before the Supreme Court for the quashing of the sentence. The Supreme Court had not yet given judgement.
.The Government further indicated that on  August  the Bank of Costa Rica had applied to the labour courts which were examining the collective labour dispute raised by the bank workers for, authorisation to dismiss Mr. Christin Sobrado Chaves. The bank had alleged that the accused had committed unpardonable breaches of discipline. The courts considered that the dismissal was unjustified. On  February , Mr. Sobrado Chaves was dismissed on the grounds of unjustified absences from work. The bank informed him that, since the arbitration of the collective labour dispute was completed, it was at full liberty to apply the disciplinary sanctions corresponding to the misdemeanour concerned. The Government indicated that the case in question was now under examination by the judicial authorities as the judges had expressed the view that the grounds for dismissal were controversial and might be diversely construed.
.In November , the Committee noted that these two cases had been brought before the competent courts, where they were still pending. On its recommendations, the Governing Body had requested the Government to supply the text of any judgements rendered.
.The Government attaches to its communication of  April  the judgement rendered by the Division of Cassation of the Supreme Court concerning the dismissal of Mr. Acua Castro by the Costa Rican Social Security Fund. This decision, dated  August , confirms those of the lower jurisdictions. It states that the judges consider that the reasons given by the employer for the dismissal of Mr. Acua Castro were unjustified and orders the Fund to pay him nine months' wages as compensation, taking account of his seniority in employment. The judges nevertheless consider that Mr. Acua Castro did not prove that he had been dismissed on account of his trade union activities and was accordingly not entitled to compensation on this account.
.In addition, states the Government, proceedings have been instituted before the San Jos labour court against the Bank of Costa Rica in the case of Mr. Sobrado Chaves. The proceedings, which began on  April , are not yet completed.
.The Committee notes the decision of the Supreme Court concerning the first of the persons cited by the complainants. In this connection, the Committee has pointed out on a number of occasions that a worker may frequently find it difficult or even impossible to furnish proof that he has been the victim of an act of anti-union discrimination. In the present case, the competent courts judged that Mr. Acua Castro, Deputy General Secretary of the National Union of Social Security Employees, had been dismissed without just cause. In these circumstances, the Committee considers it desirable that the Government should re-examine this case and envisage the possibility of reinstating Mr. Acua Castro.
.In addition, the Committee feels obliged to point out that, although the aforementioned order of the Supreme Court is dated  August , the Government made no mention of it in its earlier communications (dated  May ). The Committee can only regret that this was not done, and trusts that the Government will communicate a copy of the judgement given in the case of Mr. Sobrado Chaves as soon as this has been rendered. In the latter connection, the Committee notes that Mr. Sobrado Chaves was dismissed over a year ago and that the legal proceedings are not yet completed. It wishes to recall the importance which it attaches to the application of a rapid procedure for the examination of alleged cases of dismissal because of trade union activities
.The CGT also alleged that Mr. Luis Fernando Alfaro Ziga, General Secretary of the Trade Union Association of Employees of the Costa Rican Electricity Institute, had first been removed from his job and subsequently, owing to a strike which had been called by the general assembly of the union for  to  July , had been charged by the public prosecutor's office with incitement to strike and other offences. He was imprisoned and was refused bail.
.In addition, stated the complainants, Mr. Mario Devandas Brenes, General Secretary of the National Federation of Public Service Workers (FENATRAP), had",1,1975,Costa Rica
176,"been dismissed from his job at the National Institute of Housing and Town Planning (where he was also general secretary of the union) and subsequently, on the grounds of a strike called by the workers of the institute, had been charged with the same offences as Mr. Alfaro Ziga and detained under the same conditions. These two persons were being held at the public prison of Heredia, along with common law offenders.
.The Government replied that Mr. Luis Fernando Alfaro Ziga had made subversive speeches during the strike called on  July  at the Costa Rican Electricity Institute. For this reason, the Public Prosecutor of the Republic had charged him before the municipal court of Tibs with riot, incitement to a collective stoppage of services and conduct prejudicial to public order. The trial had not yet been completed.
.As regards the case of Mr. Mario Devandas Brenes, continued the Government, he had been charged with the same offences as Mr. Alfaro Ziga, for which he was also being prosecuted before the municipal court of Tibs.
.The Committee took note of this information. It nevertheless noted that the facts impugned go back to July  and that the trade unionists concerned have not yet been brought to trial. Moreover, it was not possible to determine with any certainty whether the persons concerned were still detained. The Committee recalled the importance it attached to the principle that in all cases, including those in which trade unionists are charged with offences of a political nature or under common law, which the Government considers to have no bearing on their trade union activities, the persons concerned should be tried rapidly by an impartial and independent judicial authority. On its recommendations, the Governing Body had drawn the Government's attention to this principle and requested it to supply the texts of the judgements rendered in the two cases.
.In its letter of  April  the Government states that proceedings have been instituted against the two abovementioned trade unionists before the Higher Court of San Jos, which has ordered them to be released on , colons bail each
.It would appear from available information that proceedings have been instituted against two trade union officials for strikes in public services. They have nevertheless been released on bail. The Committee has stressed on a number of occasions that recognition of the right of public employees to organise does not imply the right to strike.
.Nevertheless, since the right to strike is an essential means available to the workers and their organisations for defending and promoting their occupational interests, the Committee has pointed out in a number of cases concerning Costa Rica that, where strikes are prohibited or severely restricted in essential services or in the civil service, adequate guarantees should be ensured to safeguard the interests of the workers to the full. Among such guarantees the Committee has made special mention of adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures in which the parties can take part at every stage and in which the awards are binding in all cases on both parties; these awards, once they have been made, should be fully and promptly implemented. In the present case, section  of the Labour code prohibits strikes in the public services, and any disputes which may arise between employers and workers in these sectors must be referred to the labour courts for settlement.
.Nevertheless, in one of the above-mentioned cases relating to Costa Rica, the complainants alleged that, under the special act setting up the Costa Rican Electricity Institute, this body was not obliged to submit to compulsory arbitration. The Government had supplied no information on this point. The Committee considered that, if the allegation was correct, the workers of the institute would be deprived not only of the right to strike but also of the other safeguards mentioned to protect their occupational interests. The Committee therefore feels it to be necessary, in the present case, for the Government to specify whether section  was applicable to the collective labour disputes at the Costa Rican Electricity Institute and the National Institute of Housing and Town Planning.
.The National Union of Social Security Employees alleged that the Costa Rican Social Security Fund had interfered with the holding of the union's general assemblies; in particular, it had engaged in manoeuvres to impose certain persons on the trade union leadership and to remove the new executive Committee which had been legally elected.
.The Government had supplied no comments in this connection. In November  the Committee recalled that freedom of assembly and election by trade union organisations, without interference by employers and the public authorities, constitutes an essential guarantee of the free exercise of trade union rights. Furthermore, Article  of Convention no.  stipulates that workers' organisations shall enjoy adequate protection against any acts of interference by employers (either directly, or by their agents or members) in their establishment, functioning or administration. In particular, acts which are designed to support workers' organisations by financial or other means, with the object of placing such organisations under the control of employers or employers' organisations, are deemed to constitute acts of interference. The Governing Body had requested the Government to communicate its observations on this aspect of the case.
.The Government has still not supplied comments in this connection.
.The Committee regrets that the Government has not yet seen fit to reply to these allegations, which refer to incidents that took place three years ago. In an earlier case relating to Costa Rica, the Committee pointed out that in ratifying Convention No.  the Government had undertaken to secure the implementation of the guarantees contained in Article  of the said Convention, and was accordingly under the obligation to take steps to ensure that the occupational organisations were provided by the national legislation with the means to enforce the rights guaranteed to them under the said provisions.) The Committee subsequently noted that Costa Rican legislation contained no specific provisions to protect workers' organisations from acts of interference by employers and their organisations. According to section  of the Labour Code ""any case not provided for by this Code, the regulations hereunder or acts supplementary or related thereto shall be decided in accordance with the general principles of labour law, equity and local custom and usage; in default thereof the provisions laid down in the Conventions and Recommendations adopted by the International Labour Organisation shall be applied in the first place, in so far as they are not contrary to the laws of the country, and thereafter the principles and enactments of ordinary law"". The Committee had also pointed out that Convention No. , by virtue of its ratification by Costa Rica, had been incorporated in the national legislation, and accordingly considered that it would be most appropriate for the Government to examine the possibility of adopting clear and precise provisions ensuring the adequate protection of workers' organisations against any acts of interference by employers and their organisations.
.The Committee considers that these conclusions are also applicable in the present case. It would appear from an observation made by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations in  that a draft law concerning collective labour relations containing provisions giving protection to workers' organisations against acts of interference has been submitted to the legislative assembly but has not yet been adopted.
.In these circumstances, and as regards the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the dismissal of two trade union officials, to request the Government, for the reasons set forth in paragraph , to envisage the possibility of reinstating Mr. Acua Castro in his employment, and also to request it to transmit the text of the judgement given in the case of Mr. Sobrado Chaves, with the reasons adduced therefor;(b) as regards the arrest of two other trade union officials:(i) to recall the considerations and principles set forth in paragraphs  and  regarding strikes in public services;(ii) to request the Government, for the reasons set forth in paragraphs  and , to state whether the procedure for the peaceful settlement of disputes provided for under section  of the Labour Code is applicable to disputes in the Costa Rican Electricity Institute and the National Institute of Town Planning;(iii) to note that Messrs. Alfaro Ziga and Devandas Brenes have been released on bail, and to request the Government to transmit the texts of the judgements pronounced in their cases, with the reasons adduced therefor;(c) as regards the interference by the Social Security Fund in a trade union assembly, to urge the Government, for the reasons set forth in paragraphs  and , to adopt without delay the draft provisions regarding the protection of workers' organisations against acts of interference by employers or their organisations;(d) to take note of the present interim report.
.The complaints of the National Union of Social Security Employees, the General Confederation of workers and the Union of Bank Employees of Costa Rica are contained in communications dated  June ,  August ",-1,1975,Costa Rica
177,"and  March  respectively. The texts of these communications were transmitted to the Government, which furnished its observations in letters of  May .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to request the Government to communicate its observations on the allegations relating to interference by the Social Security Fund in the general assembly of the Union of Social Security Employees in June ;(b) to draw the attention of the Government to the terms of the Workers' Representatives Recommendation,  (No. ), quoted in paragraph  above;(c) to request the Government to transmit the texts of the judgements rendered in the cases concerning the dismissal of Mr. Acua Castro and Mr. Sobrado Chaves;(d) to draw attention to the principle set forth in paragraph  above concerning guarantees of rapid judicial procedure, and to request the Government to supply the texts of the judgements rendered in the proceedings against Mr. Alfaro Ziga and Mr. Devandas Brenes. Mr. Devandas Brenes;(e) to take note of the present interim report.",0,1975,Costa Rica
178,".The complaint from the Confederation of Democratic Workers (CCTD) was submitted by a communication dated  August ; that of the Trade Union of Workers in the Electrical and Telecommunications Industries (SITET) by a letter dated  March . SITET presented additional information on  April . The Government submitted its comments by letters dated  November and  December .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The CCTD states that during the th Session of the International Labour Conference () the Workers' delegate of Costa Rica had accused his Government of trade union persecution and that the Government delegate had undertaken that his Government (including autonomous institutions) would not carry out any reprisals or persecution of any kind against trade union leaders. The complainants add that, disregarding this promise, the Costa Rican Electricity Institute (IOE), an autonomous body whose directors are appointed on government advice and in which there is a Minister appointed by the Central Government, had dismissed members of SITET and brought charges against Mr. Guido Nez Romn, Secretary-General of that union, accusing him of having used the right to strike, negotiated the signing of a collective agreement and exerted trade union pressure to that end.
.SITET states in its letter of  March  that since its registration with the competent administration it has been subjected to considerable pressure from the IOE. Investigations carried out by a special Committee of the Legislative Assembly had revealed that the accusation was justified. A Member of Parliament had then tabled a motion to the effect that the terms of a loan from the Inter-American Development Bank should include trade union immunity (fuero) and the obligation to negotiate a collective agreement. The IOE administrators had then undertaken to change their policy towards the union.
.In view of this commitment, the complainants continue, SITET had submitted a draft collective agreement in April , but one month later the Institute had transformed one of its own credit associations into a trade union called the ASDEICE and granted it all necessary privileges (furnished office, employee, car and driver, funds for the publication of a monthly bulletin, etc.). This ""home made"" union, continues the complainants, had also presented a draft collective agreement. Having received two drafts, IOE stated that the two organisations should first of all reach agreement, knowing very well that the puppet union would not agree to do so. The draft agreement had not, in fact, produced any results. Renewed pressure was exerted to make workers leave the SITET, and although the other union fell into Communist hands, according to the complainants, that did not change the IOE's attitude to ASDEICE, some of whose members were even promoted.
.SITET then submitted a complaint to the Minister. As the manager of IOE stated that the dispute should be submitted to the labour courts, SITET had followed the procedure for the settlement of disputes of an economic and social nature. The parties had been summoned to appear for conciliation, but the IOE had refused to negotiate. SITET had then sought compulsory arbitration, but that had been refused since, under a special Constitutional provision, the Institute was not obliged to go to arbitration. At that point, the workers had decided to strike, although such action was illegal because IOE is a public service. The employer had then dismissed eight workers, all of whom had seventeen years' service, not for participation in the strike but for unlawful acts harmful to the Institute. The complainant had asked the Ministry of Labour to investigate the unfair accusation and the charges had been proved to be unfounded, but the workers had not been reinstated. Also as a result of the strike, the Secretary-General of SITET, Guido Nez Romn, and other members of the executive, together with the dismissed workers, had been accused of incitement to the collective stoppage, which was an offence under Article  of the Labour Code; their case was under investigation.
.Since then, SITET stated, the situation had become worse and pressure on the union had increased; workers had been dismissed on any pretext, without any of the benefits to which they were legally entitled. The management had organised what was known as the ""Group for the Preservation of the IOE"", composed of all the heads of department, who visited all the work centres to persuade workers to leave the union. According to SITET, it even writes letters of resignation for them. The campaign had enabled management to induce , members to leave the union. Whereas, according to the union rules, workers wishing to resign from the union must apply to the executive which then gives instructions for deductions in respect of union dues to cease, the IOE, according to the complainant, applies other methods. SITET is sometimes informed by the accounts department that a worker has decided to resign from the union and that his contributions would no longer be deducted from his pay; in such cases the union receives no other information than that given by IOE. In other cases, the worker sends his letter of resignation to the chief of personnel, who gives instructions for the deduction of union dues to cease and sends the union a copy of the worker's letter together with a copy of his own letter to the accounts department. Sometimes the worker communicates directly with the accounts department, which crosses the worker off its list. According to SITET, normal procedures are applied in the case of the other union; workers are not crossed off the list but are forced to remain in that organisation. It adds that it has lodged a complaint with the Ministry of Labour but so far has not heard of any action being taken.
.The second communication from SITET concerns another practice of the same type: it claims that the chief of the personnel office ceased deducting the trade union dues of some workers, whereas the union had merely asked him to suspend the loan repayments to one of the union's bodies.
.The Government replied by two communications of  November and  December . Concerning the dismissal of eight strikers, it pointed out that the action taken by IOE was illegal and referred in this connection to Section  of the Constitution and Sections , ,  and  of the Labour Code. Section  specifically bans strikes in public services and stipulates that any conflicts arising in such services shall be referred to the labour courts. Section  defines as public services all activities performed by employees of the State or of its institutions where the activities of the State or its institutions are not the same as those of private firms or agencies working for reward.
.The Government submitted a copy of the ruling of the labour court (and that of the Supreme Labour Court confirming it), to the effect that negotiations had been broken off following a threat of strike which it declared to be illegal. Consequently, it is the Government's opinion that there were sufficient grounds for dismissal under Article  of the Labour Code. From later talks held with a view to restoring peace between the employer and workers, the IOE had appeared to be prepared not to dismiss workers merely for having gone on strike and to dismiss only those strikers who had acted in a manner prejudicial to the undertaking by deeds punishable under the Penal Code. In the light of that implicit undertaking and at the request of the trade union, the Ministry of Labour had carried out an investigation into the criminal liability of the dismissed workers. Seven of the eight had not participated in any punishable act, but the Institute nevertheless dismissed them, which it was legally entitled to do.
.Regarding the criminal proceedings brought against the Secretary-General of SITET, the Government states that the IOE had brought legal proceedings pursuant to Sections ,  and  of the Penal Code. The articles in question read:
.""The sanctions specified in section , increased by one-third for any person responsible for jeopardising the common weal, shall be imposed for:
.""The penalty shall be imprisonment for six months to two years for any person guilty of creating a public danger or of impeding or hampering the normal operation of transport by land, sea, air or water, or of impeding or hampering public communication services or public power services in any form.
.""The penalty shall be imprisonment for six months to two years and a fine consisting of a percentage of the income earned over a period of from  to  days for any person guilty of having urged officials or employees of public services collectively to abandon their work.""
.The Government points out that Mr. Nez Roman has never been committed to gaol. The investigating magistrate had ordered ""imprisonment and trial"", but the accused had been left free pending trial and the case had not closed. During the proceedings, the counsel for the",0,1973,Costa Rica
179,"defence had lodged an appeal with the Supreme Court on the grounds that Article  of the Penal Code was unconstitutional, but the appeal had been rejected. In addition, a bill had been submitted to the Legislative Assembly for the abrogation of Section  of the Penal Code, for which the Social Affairs Committee of the Assembly had, by a majority vote, expressed its support.
.The Government confirms the existence of a ""Group for the Preservation of the IOE"", but denies that the group puts pressure on workers to resign from the union. The Government included a large mass of documentation with its comments, including in particular a copy of the report on the investigations carried out by the labour inspectorate on the allegations of trade union persecution. According to this document, the ""Group for the Preservation of the IOE"" was endeavouring to restore peace amongst the personnel of the Institute at a time when the other union, the ASDEICE, was preparing a strike in sympathy with the SITET strikers who had been dismissed. Twenty-five of the workers questioned had stated to the investigator that they had left the SITET without any pressure from the group. The investigators stated that they had found no proof that members of the group had drafted some of the resignation letters referred to; most of them had been written by the heads of the offices at the various workplaces, in all cases at the request of the workers concerned. The Government attaches to its letter the text of statements obtained from the workers questioned. The reasons given for the resignations included in particular disagreement with the decision to strike and the need to use the union contribution money for other purposes.
.The document indicates that  workers left the union between  June  and  May . In some cases the worker informed the union of his decision in writing; the worker sometimes asked the employer to cease deducting union dues from his pay because he was leaving the union; there were also cases in which workers sent a collective notice of resignation to the employer in the same way; in the majority of cases, the personnel department had received from the workers concerned a copy of the letter of resignation sent to the union and in such cases the employer had not checked whether the union had in fact received the original. The report in question concludes that the procedure followed by IOE to strike the names of resigning workers from the list it had prepared for check-off purposes is an internal matter, since, when notified of the resignations by one of the means mentioned, the personnel department instructs the accounts department to cease the deduction of union dues from the pay of the former union member.
.The case thus relates mainly to the strike declared by SITET in the Costa Rican Electricity Institute and to certain forms of trade union persecution which are supposed to have taken place within that institute.
.The Committee notes that relations between the IOE and SITET had been very strained since the creation of that union and that the latter complained of pressures exerted on its members to persuade them to leave the union and of the support which the Institute had given to the creation and activities of another union. The Committee also notes that the strike was started after the failure of negotiations and that, according to the complainants, the IOE refused to submit the dispute to compulsory arbitration as permitted under the law establishing that body. The strike was illegal since IOE is classified as a public service in which all strikes are forbidden (sections  and  of the Labour Code). According to the employer, the dismissal of eight strikers was due not to their participation in the strike action, but to committed actions harmful to the undertaking and punishable under law. The Committee nevertheless notes that an investigation carried out by the Ministry of Labour disclosed that seven of the eight dismissed workers had not committed any punishable offence. The decision to dismiss them was nevertheless maintained.
.On the basis of the principle whereby allegations relating to the right to strike are not outside its competence in so far as they affect the exercise of trade union rights, the Committee has, in similar cases and particularly in cases relating to Costa Rica, held that, while restrictions on the right to strike in the public service or in essential services could be accepted, there should, in such cases, be adequate guarantees to safeguard the interests of the workers who are thereby deprived of an essential means of defending their occupational interests, which implies that such restrictions should be accompanied by adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures in which the parties concerned can participate at all stages. In the case under discussion the strike had been started after the breakdown of negotiations. However, if, as claimed by SITET, arbitration could be refused by the IOE in application of a special provision, the workers of that Institute would be deprived not only of the right to strike but also of the other safeguards mentioned to protect their occupational interests, which is contrary to the principle mentioned above.
.Regarding the allegations concerning trade union persecution, the investigation carried out by the labour inspectorate showed that twenty-five workers questioned had stated that they had left SITET without undergoing pressure from the group known as the ""Group for the Preservation of the IOE"", because they did not support the strike, because they needed the money which would have been used for union dues, or for other reasons. However, the Committee considers it somewhat strange that in many cases union members wishing to leave the union communicated firstly and sometimes only with the employer, that union members submitted collective resignations and that resignation letters were often written by the chiefs of offices at the request of the workers concerned. It considers that if the ""Group for the Preservation of the IOE"" was encouraged by the management to induce workers to leave the union, that would constitute an infringement of freedom of association.
.In these circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to call attention, with regard to the allegations concerning trade union persecution, to the considerations set out in paragraph ;(b) to emphasise, concerning the allegations relating to the strike, the importance which it attaches to the principle that, where restrictions are placed on the right to strike in essential services, there should, in such cases, be adequate guarantees to safeguard the interests of the workers who are thereby deprived of an essential means of defending their occupational interests, and that such restrictions should be accompanied in all cases by adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures in which the parties concerned can participate at all stages.",-1,1973,Costa Rica
180,".The complaint from the Confederation of Democratic Workers (CCTD) was submitted by a communication dated  August ; that of the Trade Union of Workers in the Electrical and Telecommunications Industries (SITET) by a letter dated  March . SITET presented additional information on  April . The Government submitted its comments by letters dated  November and  December .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The CCTD states that during the th Session of the International Labour Conference () the Workers' delegate of Costa Rica had accused his Government of trade union persecution and that the Government delegate had undertaken that his Government (including autonomous institutions) would not carry out any reprisals or persecution of any kind against trade union leaders. The complainants add that, disregarding this promise, the Costa Rican Electricity Institute (IOE), an autonomous body whose directors are appointed on government advice and in which there is a Minister appointed by the Central Government, had dismissed members of SITET and brought charges against Mr. Guido Nez Romn, Secretary-General of that union, accusing him of having used the right to strike, negotiated the signing of a collective agreement and exerted trade union pressure to that end.
.SITET states in its letter of  March  that since its registration with the competent administration it has been subjected to considerable pressure from the IOE. Investigations carried out by a special Committee of the Legislative Assembly had revealed that the accusation was justified. A Member of Parliament had then tabled a motion to the effect that the terms of a loan from the Inter-American Development Bank should include trade union immunity (fuero) and the obligation to negotiate a collective agreement. The IOE administrators had then undertaken to change their policy towards the union.
.In view of this commitment, the complainants continue, SITET had submitted a draft collective agreement in April , but one month later the Institute had transformed one of its own credit associations into a trade union called the ASDEICE and granted it all necessary privileges (furnished office, employee, car and driver, funds for the publication of a monthly bulletin, etc.). This ""home made"" union, continues the complainants, had also presented a draft collective agreement. Having received two drafts, IOE stated that the two organisations should first of all reach agreement, knowing very well that the puppet union would not agree to do so. The draft agreement had not, in fact, produced any results. Renewed pressure was exerted to make workers leave the SITET, and although the other union fell into Communist hands, according to the complainants, that did not change the IOE's attitude to ASDEICE, some of whose members were even promoted.
.SITET then submitted a complaint to the Minister. As the manager of IOE stated that the dispute should be submitted to the labour courts, SITET had followed the procedure for the settlement of disputes of an economic and social nature. The parties had been summoned to appear for conciliation, but the IOE had refused to negotiate. SITET had then sought compulsory arbitration, but that had been refused since, under a special Constitutional provision, the Institute was not obliged to go to arbitration. At that point, the workers had decided to strike, although such action was illegal because IOE is a public service. The employer had then dismissed eight workers, all of whom had seventeen years' service, not for participation in the strike but for unlawful acts harmful to the Institute. The complainant had asked the Ministry of Labour to investigate the unfair accusation and the charges had been proved to be unfounded, but the workers had not been reinstated. Also as a result of the strike, the Secretary-General of SITET, Guido Nez Romn, and other members of the executive, together with the dismissed workers, had been accused of incitement to the collective stoppage, which was an offence under Article  of the Labour Code; their case was under investigation.
.Since then, SITET stated, the situation had become worse and pressure on the union had increased; workers had been dismissed on any pretext, without any of the benefits to which they were legally entitled. The management had organised what was known as the ""Group for the Preservation of the IOE"", composed of all the heads of department, who visited all the work centres to persuade workers to leave the union. According to SITET, it even writes letters of resignation for them. The campaign had enabled management to induce , members to leave the union. Whereas, according to the union rules, workers wishing to resign from the union must apply to the executive which then gives instructions for deductions in respect of union dues to cease, the IOE, according to the complainant, applies other methods. SITET is sometimes informed by the accounts department that a worker has decided to resign from the union and that his contributions would no longer be deducted from his pay; in such cases the union receives no other information than that given by IOE. In other cases, the worker sends his letter of resignation to the chief of personnel, who gives instructions for the deduction of union dues to cease and sends the union a copy of the worker's letter together with a copy of his own letter to the accounts department. Sometimes the worker communicates directly with the accounts department, which crosses the worker off its list. According to SITET, normal procedures are applied in the case of the other union; workers are not crossed off the list but are forced to remain in that organisation. It adds that it has lodged a complaint with the Ministry of Labour but so far has not heard of any action being taken.
.The second communication from SITET concerns another practice of the same type: it claims that the chief of the personnel office ceased deducting the trade union dues of some workers, whereas the union had merely asked him to suspend the loan repayments to one of the union's bodies.
.The Government replied by two communications of  November and  December . Concerning the dismissal of eight strikers, it pointed out that the action taken by IOE was illegal and referred in this connection to Section  of the Constitution and Sections , ,  and  of the Labour Code. Section  specifically bans strikes in public services and stipulates that any conflicts arising in such services shall be referred to the labour courts. Section  defines as public services all activities performed by employees of the State or of its institutions where the activities of the State or its institutions are not the same as those of private firms or agencies working for reward.
.The Government submitted a copy of the ruling of the labour court (and that of the Supreme Labour Court confirming it), to the effect that negotiations had been broken off following a threat of strike which it declared to be illegal. Consequently, it is the Government's opinion that there were sufficient grounds for dismissal under Article  of the Labour Code. From later talks held with a view to restoring peace between the employer and workers, the IOE had appeared to be prepared not to dismiss workers merely for having gone on strike and to dismiss only those strikers who had acted in a manner prejudicial to the undertaking by deeds punishable under the Penal Code. In the light of that implicit undertaking and at the request of the trade union, the Ministry of Labour had carried out an investigation into the criminal liability of the dismissed workers. Seven of the eight had not participated in any punishable act, but the Institute nevertheless dismissed them, which it was legally entitled to do.
.Regarding the criminal proceedings brought against the Secretary-General of SITET, the Government states that the IOE had brought legal proceedings pursuant to Sections ,  and  of the Penal Code. The articles in question read:
.""The sanctions specified in section , increased by one-third for any person responsible for jeopardising the common weal, shall be imposed for:
.""The penalty shall be imprisonment for six months to two years for any person guilty of creating a public danger or of impeding or hampering the normal operation of transport by land, sea, air or water, or of impeding or hampering public communication services or public power services in any form.
.""The penalty shall be imprisonment for six months to two years and a fine consisting of a percentage of the income earned over a period of from  to  days for any person guilty of having urged officials or employees of public services collectively to abandon their work.""
.The Government points out that Mr. Nez Roman has never been committed to gaol. The investigating magistrate had ordered ""imprisonment and trial"", but the accused had been left free pending trial and the case had not closed. During the proceedings, the counsel for the",0,1973,Costa Rica

182,".The Committee examined this case in November  and presented to the Governing Body at that session an interim report which is reproduced in paragraphs  to  of its th Report. This report was approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ).
.Costa Rica has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its complaint, dated  July , the Costa Rican Christian Workers' and Peasants' Confederation alleged that the Government was carrying out a systematic persecution of trade union leaders in Costa Rica in spite of the provisions in the Labour Code. It cited the example of Gilberto Rodriguez Arias, President of the Union of Civil Service Employees (UNESECI). Mr. Rodriguez began trade union activities in  when he was a Class  Public Administration Officer in the Personnel Selection Branch of the Public Service Commission and he was responsible in large part for the founding in  of the UNESECI. The complainants went on to state that Mr. Rodriguez had been transferred on several occasions after February  and had been informed in June  that his job had ceased to exist and that he was consequently dismissed. These actions had been taken as a result of Mr. Rodriguez's trade union activities.
.In its communication dated  May  the Government pointed out that an inquiry had been initiated in connection with this matter, but this inquiry had subsequently been suspended since the person concerned, having stated that any action would be pointless, declined to produce any documentary evidence. This being the case, continued the Government, it had not been possible to establish whether, in reality, any trade union persecution had taken place as alleged.
.In its th Report the Committee had deplored the fact that despite the lapse of time since the complaint was submitted and the urgency of the requests made by the Committee, the reply which was submitted by the Government did not contain sufficient information to enable the Committee to reach its conclusions on the matter in the full knowledge of the facts. It had drawn the attention of the Government to the provisions of Article  of Convention No.  according to which the countries (of which Costa Rica is one) having ratified this Convention undertake to take all necessary and appropriate measures to ensure that workers - including public servants - may exercise freely the right to organise. The Committee had also stressed that one of the fundamental principles of freedom of association is that workers should enjoy adequate protection against all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment such as dismissal, demotion, transfer or other prejudicial measures, and that this protection is particularly desirable in the case of union officials because, in order to be able to perform their trade union duties in full independence, they must have the guarantee that they will not be prejudiced on account of the mandate which they hold from their trade unions. The Committee has considered that the guarantee of such protection in the case of trade union officials is also necessary in order to ensure that effect is given to the fundamental principle that workers' organisations should have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom.
.In view of the circumstances of the case and the nature of the information supplied by the Government, the Committee had recommended the Governing Body, inter alia, to draw the attention of the Government to the principles and considerations expressed in the preceding paragraph and to transmit to the complainants the substance of the Government's communication for any further comments they might wish to make thereon.
.Despite several requests addressed to the complainants, no comments have been received from them on the Government's reply. The Committee notes that the complaint dates from  July  and it considers that, since no comments have been received from the complainants, it is not in possession of sufficient information to enable it to reach its conclusions in full knowledge of the facts. In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that the case does not call for further examination on its part.
.The complaint of the Costa Rican Christian Workers' and Peasants' Confederation (COCC) is contained in a communication dated  July  addressed to the Director-General of the ILO.
.The Committee recalls that, at its meeting in November , it addressed an urgent appeal to the Government to supply its observations on the allegations contained in the complaint, the Government having failed to reply to the repeated requests of the Committee to supply such observations (th Report, paragraph ). The Committee also recalls that at its meeting in February , since no reply had been received to its appeal, and in accordance with the rule of procedure contained in paragraph  of its th Report, it informed the Government that it might submit a report on the substance of the matter at its next session even if the observations requested had not been received. By a communication dated  May  the Government transmitted its observations on the allegations made in the complaint.
.Costa Rica has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its complaint the Costa Rican Christian Workers' and Peasants' Confederation alleges that there is a systematic persecution of trade union leaders in Costa Rica in spite of the provisions in the Labour Code directed against such discrimination. It cites the example of Gilberth Rodriguez Arias, President of the Union of Civil Service Employees (UNESECI). Mr. Rodriguez began trade union activities in  when he was a Class  Public Administration Officer in the Personnel Selection Branch of the Public Service Commission and he was responsible in large part for the founding in March  of the UNESECI, of which he was elected President.
.Just before this, in February , he was transferred to the Recruitment Section and this transfer is alleged to have been both a demotion in real terms and in violation of the Civil Service Statute which provides that no civil servant can be transferred to another position or be given an increased workload for a period of more than two months. It is alleged also that this transfer was motivated by a desire to discourage Mr. Rodriguez from pursuing his trade union activities.
.During March and April of  there is alleged to have been some friction between Mr. Rodriguez and the management of the Civil Service in relation to hours of work and similar issues. On  May of that year the Director of the Civil Service, Mr. Sidney Brautigam Jimnez, sent a note to Mr. Rodriguez in which the latter is accused of prejudicing the Civil Service and those employed in it. Mr. Rodriguez replied to the Director expressing his surprise and explaining that there must have been a serious misunderstanding.
.The complainants annex to their letter copies of notes sent to the Transport Minister and to the National Association of Public Employees, in which Mr. Brautigam attests to the professional competence of Mr. Rodriguez; they point out that these communications directly contradict the reasons given to Mr. Rodriguez by Mr. Brautigam for the former's transfer to the Recruitment Section several months earlier. In July , Mr. Brautigam proposed transferring Mr. Rodriguez to the Transport Ministry and in spite of petitions by the UNESECI and certain members of the Legislative Assembly explaining that such a transfer would leave the union leaderless, Mr. Rodriguez was sent to the Transport Ministry on  October , to a job involving personnel classification which was not his special field.
.On  December , Mr. Rodriguez was once again transferred, this time to the Planning Office where his duties did not correspond at all with his professional qualifications. Finally, on  June , he was informed by Mr. Brautigam that as a result of the approval of a Special Budget by the Legislative Assembly, his job had ceased to exist and that he was consequently dismissed.
.The complainants claim that Mr. Rodriguez has been victimised because of his trade union activities and that the provisions of the Special Budget, reducing the number of positions for persons of Mr. Rodriguez's qualifications from five to four with the consequent dismissal, merely constituted a pretext for getting rid of him so that he could no longer lead the trade union of which he was President.
.In its communication dated  May  the Government points out that an inquiry was initiated in connection with this matter, but that this inquiry was subsequently suspended since the person concerned, having stated that any action would not be productive, declined to produce any documentary evidence. This being the case, continues the Government, it is not possible to establish whether, in reality, any trade union persecution took place as alleged.
.The Committee considers it appropriate to",0,1972,Costa Rica
183,"recall the observations which it made in paragraph  of its First Report, namely, ""the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and the Committee is confident that if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side will recognise the importance for the protection of their own good name of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to such detailed factual charges as may be put forward"".
.The Committee deplores the fact that despite the lapse of time since the complaint was submitted and the urgency of the requests made by the Committee to the Government to supply its observations on the allegations contained in the complaint, the Government has now submitted a reply which, in the opinion of the Committee, does not contain sufficient information to enable the Committee to reach its conclusions on the matter in full knowledge of the facts.
.The Committee would draw the attention of the Government to the provisions of Article  of Convention No.  according to which countries having ratified this Convention (of which Costa Rica is one) undertake to take all necessary and appropriate measures to ensure that workers, including public servants, may exercise freely the right to organise.
.The Committee would also stress that one of the fundamental principles of freedom of association is that workers should enjoy adequate protection against all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment such as dismissal, demotion, transfer or other prejudicial measures - and that this protection is particularly desirable in the case of trade union officials because in order to be able to perform their trade union duties in full independence they must have the guarantee that they will not be prejudiced on account of the mandate which they hold from their trade unions. The Committee has considered that the guarantee of such protection in the case of trade union officials is also necessary in order to ensure that effect is given to the fundamental principle that workers' organisations should have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom.,
.The Committee considers that, in view of the circumstances of the case and the nature of the information now supplied by the Government, before reaching any conclusions on the matter, it would prefer to have any further comments which the complainants might wish to make on the information supplied by the Government. It accordingly recommends that the substance of the Government's reply be transmitted to the complainants for this purpose.
.In these circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to recall the observations made by the Committee in its First Report, quoted in paragraph  above;(b) to deplore the fact that, despite the lapse of time since the complaint was submitted and the urgency of the repeated requests made by the Committee to the Government to supply its observations, the Government has now submitted a reply which does not contain sufficient information to enable the Committee to reach its conclusions on the matter in full knowledge of the facts;(c) to draw the attention of the Government to the principles and considerations expressed in paragraphs  and  above; and(d) to decide, for the reasons expressed in paragraph  above, to transmit to the complainants the substance of the communication of the Government, dated  May , for any further comments they might wish to make thereon.",0,1972,Costa Rica
184,".The complaint of the Costa Rican Confederation of Democratic Workers is contained in a communication dated  June . It was transmitted to the Government, which replied by a communication dated  July , to which was appended a considerable quantity of documentation relating to the case.
.Costa Rica has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their complaint the complainants merely allege that leaders of the National Union of Employees of the Costa Rican Social Insurance Fund (UNDECA) have been arrested and dismissed because of their refusal to accept the intransigent attitude of the Minister of Labour and of the Executive Board and Management of the Social Insurance Fund. The complainants request urgent ILO intervention to examine the case.
.In its reply the Government states that in February  a direct agreement was signed between the Costa Rican Social Insurance Fund and the UNDECA in which the UNDECA undertook, in exchange for benefits obtained, not to promote until February  ""any collective dispute of an economic and social nature"". Nevertheless, in April  the UNDECA filed a series of claims in which it demanded various financial improvements. Notwithstanding the undertaking that had been given, the Executive Board of the Fund agreed to examine this list of claims, although it requested a longer time limit for the negotiations than the twenty-two days demanded by the union. At the beginning of May, while the negotiations were in progress, the union threatened to launch a series of strikes, which it in fact did on  May .
.The Government goes on to state that the management of the fund referred the matter to the labour tribunal, which declared this strike action to be illegal on the ground that the union had not exhausted the conciliation procedure prescribed by law (section  of the Labour Code) as well as on the ground that the employees of the Fund, like other persons employed by a public service, do not enjoy the right to strike (article  of the Constitution and section  of the Labour Code). Section  of the Labour Code classifies as being public services all services performed by employees of the State or its institutions, where the activities in question are not also carried on by private profit-making undertakings.
.The Government states that following on this judgement the strike was terminated and negotiations were reopened. Nevertheless, in June the union launched a further strike, which was likewise ruled to be illegal by the labour tribunal. On this second occasion the union went so far as to besiege the head office of the Fund and some of its hospital centres, endangering the health and even the lives of the patients. In consequence, the Fund was compelled to dismiss some of the workers and union leaders, since they had defaulted in their duties as employees in the hospital centres. It was this situation which prompted the request for the intervention of the police in order to safeguard order and the interests of the patients. The strike was ended and talks were resumed, but the union has already announced yet another stoppage.
.The Government concludes by stating that, since at no time was the life or freedom of any person involved in the dispute endangered, there is no cause to consider this case an urgent case in accordance with the classification established by the Committee on Freedom of Association.
.The Committee has established the principle that allegations relating to the right to strike are not outside its competence in so far as they concern the exercise of trade union rights. As concerns the right to strike in essential services or in the civil service, the Committee has pointed out that, where strikes are forbidden or subject to restriction in such sectors, adequate guarantees should be ensured to safeguard to the full the interests of the workers thus deprived of an essential means of defending their occupational interests. The Committee has also pointed out that the restriction or prohibition in question should be accompanied by adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures, in which the parties can take part at every stage and in which the awards are binding in all cases on both parties; these awards, once they have been made, should be fully and promptly implemented. The Committee has also expressed the view that legislation which provides for compulsory conciliation and arbitration in industrial disputes before a strike may be called cannot be regarded as an infringement of freedom of association.
.The Committee observes that the employees of the Costa Rican Social Insurance Fund, in their capacity as employees of a public service, do not enjoy the right to strike and that, on the contrary, any disputes in which they may be involved must compulsorily be dealt with by the labour tribunals (section  of the Labour Code). The Committee also observes that, according to the Government, at no time was the freedom of the persons participating in the strike movements launched by the UNDECA endangered.
.In these circumstances, the Committee considers that, in the light of the principles set forth in paragraph  above with respect to strikes in public services, it cannot be considered that there has been any infringement of trade union rights in the present case. The Committee accordingly recommends the Governing Body to decide that the allegations, and consequently the case as a whole, do not call for further examination.",0,1972,Costa Rica
185,".The complaint is contained in a communication dated  September  addressed direct to the ILO by the Costa Rican Christian Workers' and Peasants' Confederation.
.The complaint was duly transmitted to the Government, which forwarded its observations thereon in a communication dated  January  addressed direct to the Director-General.
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communication dated  September  the complainants state that in accordance with Act No.  of  July , which set up the Popular and Community Development Bank of Costa Rica, their Confederation (viz. the Costa Rican Christian Workers' and Peasants' Confederation) was entitled to have two representatives on the Executive Board of the said Bank. The complainants add that, in spite of the fact that the Minister of Labour had promised to support their nominations, the Council of the Government, under pressure from the Inter-American Regional Organisation of Workers (GRIT) and the American Institute for the Development of Free Trade Unionism (IADSL) and after an investigation into the private lives of the proposed candidates, decided to appoint only one representative.
.In its communication dated  January  the Government points out that Act No.  of  July  (published in the official gazette "" La Gaceta "", No.  of  July ) provides in its interim provision IX that within  days of the coming into force of the Act a provisional national Board of Directors shall be appointed and, inter alia, that the duly registered democratic workers' Confederations shall each appoint two representatives. In accordance with this provision, two members of the Costa Rican Christian Workers' and Peasants' Confederation and two members of the Costa Rican Democratic Workers' Confederation were appointed to the provisional Board of Directors of the Bank.
.Subsequently, the Government adds, the provisional Board of Directors submitted a draft bill to the Legislative Assembly with a view to extending to four years the original two-year term of office of the provisional board. The Legislative Assembly, however, did not agree to this proposal and instead promulgated Act No.  of  August  (published in the official gazette "" La Gaceta "" on  August ), which modified the provisions of Act No.  of  July .
.The Government explains that the new Act No.  provides that the Council of the Government shall appoint four representatives of the duly registered workers' Confederations from lists of three names which each Confederation shall submit within not more than five days of the date of entry into force of the Act and that these appointments shall be made not more than ten days from the date of entry into force of the Act. The Act further provides that the provisional national Board of Directors shall cease to function two years and six months from the date of its appointment with the exception of those members appointed in accordance with the new Act.
.The Government states that the Council of the Government (i.e. the President and the Government Ministers) were empowered to appoint members from the workers' con federations but that the Act did not indicate the number of representatives which must be appointed from each of the Confederations. The Council made its selection of representatives from the lists of three names submitted to it. The purpose of the law is that the appointments should be made on the basis of the degree of representativity of the Confederations concerned. The Costa Rican Christian Workers' and Peasants' Confederation, states the Government, was not the organisation which had the greatest number of members. The Government, accordingly, rejects any allegation that it committed any infringement of trade union rights.
.In some previous cases, the Committee has taken the view that it was not called upon to express an opinion as to the right of a particular organisation to be invited to take part in certain bodies unless its exclusion constituted a clear case of discrimination affecting the principle of freedom of association, and that this was a matter to be determined by the Committee in the light of the facts in each given case.
.Moreover, the Committee has previously observed z that on several occasions, and especially when the draft text of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention was being discussed, the International Labour Conference has referred to the question of the representative character of workers' and employers' organisations and has admitted to some extent the distinction sometimes made between various organisations according to the extent to which they are representative.
.In the present case, the Committee notes that provision of Act No.  of  July  whereby the complainant organisation was entitled to have two representatives on the provisional executive board of the Popular and Community Development Bank of Costa Rica has been amended by Act No.  of  August  to the effect that the Council of the Government shall nominate four representatives from the registered workers' Confederations out of a list of three names submitted by each of these organisations. By such a procedure it would appear that the Council is under no obligation to nominate an equal number of members from each of the Confederations, and, according to the complainants, only one member proposed by them was nominated by the Council. The Committee further notes the Government's explanation that the purpose of the Act is that the members of the executive body of the Bank should be selected by the Council on the basis of the degree of representativity of each of the Confederations concerned, and that the complainant organisation was not the one having the largest membership.
.In the circumstances, the Committee considers that the complainants have failed to furnish proof of any discrimination affecting the principle of freedom of association in the present instance and, accordingly, recommends the Governing Body to decide that the case does not call for further examination.",0,1971,Costa Rica
186,".This case has already been examined by the Committee, at its session in February , at which time it submitted to the Governing Body an interim report contained in paragraphs  to  of its th Report. The Committee's th Report was adopted by the Governing Body at its th Session (February-March ).
.The facts of the case may be summarised as follows. The Homoeopathy Workers' Union, founded in , was duly registered by the Trade Unions Office of the Ministry of Labour after the provisions of its statutes relating to the organisation's funds had been amended in compliance with a request made by the office in question. The Union appears to have functioned normally until April , when it was informed by the Ministry that, on the basis of information furnished by the College of Physicians and Surgeons, the Ministry had made application to the courts for the Union's judicial dissolution. The information supplied by the College of Physicians and Surgeons was to the effect that up to  only three persons had been authorised by the College to practise homoeopathy in Costa Rica. Under the law of that country the practice of homoeopathy and certain other special branches of medicine is subject to such authorisation being granted.
.Furthermore, under the terms of sections  and  of the Labour Code (as amended), firstly, a workers' organisation or an organisation of persons exercising a profession independently may not be formed with fewer than  members, and, secondly, the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare is empowered to apply to the labour courts for the winding up of any occupational organisation which fails to comply with this provision. Since, according to the Government, only three medical practitioners had been authorised to practise homoeopathy, it appeared that the minimum membership requirement for the establishment of an organisation of persons practising homoeopathy independently as a profession had not been fulfilled.
.At its February  session the Committee pointed out that in many countries laws and regulations have been enacted, in the public interest, for the control of the exercise of various professional activities. Such rules, noted the Committee, are of necessity stringent in order to ensure that the general public may have adequate protection against persons who may seek to exercise professional activities without the qualifications, or authorisation by the supervisory professional body, which may be necessary before doing so. The Committee observed that in Costa Rica the medical profession is governed by laws and regulations of this kind, and that it was these provisions and the law governing the establishment of trade unions which the Government had invoked as justification for its application to the courts for the dissolution of a union consisting, apparently, of three properly qualified and duly authorised homoeopaths and a number of other persons who had not received proper authorisation to practise this branch of medicine.
.The court action brought by the Ministry being still sub judice at the time when the Committee last examined the case, the Committee, considering that the information furnished therein might be useful to it in assessing the merits of the case, recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to supply a copy of the judgement when it was pronounced, together with the grounds adduced therefor.
.In response to this request, which was conveyed to it on  March , the Government, by a communication dated  July , has supplied the text of the judgement pronounced by the court of first instance as well as that of the judgement pronounced on appeal.
.The judgement of the First Labour Court of San Jos orders the dissolution of the complaining organisation. The grounds adduced from this ruling are stated to be the following facts, considered to be proved: (a) that the occupational organisation known as the "" Homoeopathy Workers' Union of Costa Rica "" was registered with the Trade Unions Office of the Ministry of Labour; (b) that the College of Physicians and Surgeons objected to registration of the organisation concerned on the ground that none of the members of its executive committee was authorised to practise homoeopathy in Costa Rica under the terms of the law whereby the College was established; (c) that the statutes of the organisation in question mention, as one of its aims, "" to strive to obtain official recognition for its members in their special field, namely that of homoeopathic medicine ""; (d) that among the aims of the organisation is also to be found the fundamental intention "" to enrol all the homoeopaths in the country as members of the Union "", their admission being subject to the requirement that they "" practise within the field of activity covered by this Union "" and to the condition that "" the applicant shall be examined by a board made up of members of the Union, practising homoeopathy, in homoeopathy and such other subjects as the Executive Committee may direct, with a view to satisfying the board not only as to his knowledge of homoeopathy, but also as to his general culture ""; (e) that there exists no national or foreign instructional establishment, recognised by the Ministry of Education, which awards diplomas, decrees or certificates in homoeopathy.
.The judgement also declares that, considering that "" the situation which prevailed during the preliminary inquiries into the case has remained unchanged, as is shown by the fact that the organisation involved has not attempted to challenge the findings which were reached following the inquiries, under sections ,  and  (c) of the Labour Code, it behoves this court to dissolve the body known as the Homoeopathy Workers' Union of Costa Rica, without condemning it to pay the costs of the action "".
.On appeal, the Supreme Labour Tribunal confirmed the judgement of the court of first instance for the same reasons as those invoked by that court.
.It is clear both from the text of the judgements supplied by the Government and from the explanations given by the Government that the persons whom the complaining union claims to represent are not-with the apparent exception of three of them-entitled, under the statutory provisions in force in this respect, to practise the ancillary branch of medical science with which the present case is concerned. Moreover, since only three persons are authorised to practise homoeopathy in Costa Rica, and the law of the country requires that there be at least  in order to found a union of workers exercising a profession independently, it seems that the complaining union has not fulfilled the requirements which it must fulfil under the various national laws and regulations, taken together, in order to be eligible for recognition.
.In these circumstances, since the order for the dissolution of the union given by the competent courts does not appear to be a measure which could be considered an infringement of freedom of association, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that the case does not call for further examination.
.The complaint was contained in a communication, dated  April , addressed direct to the ILO by the Homoeopathy Workers' Union of Costa Rica. By a communication dated  June , the complainants presented further information in substantiation of their complaint. The complaint and further information having been transmitted to it, the Government communicated its observations in a letter dated  December .
.Costa Rica has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communication dated  April , the complainants state that their union was founded on  October , when a request for registration was submitted to the Trade Unions Office of the Ministry of Labour. By a note dated  December  that office made an observation concerning the statutes submitted by the union and proposed that a general assembly be convened so that the statutes might be amended as regards the part relating to funds. A note dated  December  was also received from the chief of the Trade Unions Office of the Ministry, requesting the union to comply with the observations made by the Ministry concerning the amendment of the statutes.
.In a communication addressed to the Ministry, continue the complainants, the Trade Unions Office was informed of the decision of the extraordinary general assembly of the union which took place on  January . In this communication it was stressed that the recommendations of the Ministry had been observed, and that the union had proceeded to amend the statutes as required.
.On  March , state the complainants, the chief of the Trade Unions Office sent the union a note informing it of the registration of its Constitution and statutes and at the same time indicating the entry at which the union was registered (vii volume , folio , entry , dated  March , of the register of trade unions and other social organisations). In accordance with section  of the Labour Code, an extract of the registration was published in",0,1971,Costa Rica
187,"La Gaceta and the Diario Oficial three times in succession.
.In a letter dated  January , a copy of the minutes of the ordinary general meeting of the union, as well as reports concerning finance and other matters and the most recent list of members, was sent to the Trade Unions Office. A reply to this communication dated  January  was received from the chief of the Trade Unions Office of the Ministry.
.On  January , continue the complainants, the Trade Unions Office informed the union that the document relating to the assembly of the union in January  had been received, that its presentation had been approved and that it had been recorded in the registers kept for this purpose by the Trade Unions Office of the Ministry.
.The complainants add that in a note dated  April  the chief of the Trade Unions Office of the Ministry communicated to the union a copy of a letter dated  February , addressed by the Ministry to the Secretary of the College of Physicians and Surgeons, in which it was stated that the Legal Department of the Ministry, having examined the circumstances of the matter, had concluded that the Homoeopathy Workers' Union was not legally in existence and that the Trade Unions Office of the Ministry had accordingly deleted it from the register and made application to the court for its judicial dissolution.
.In a communication dated  June , the complainants state that a request was made by the union for a meeting with the Ministry of Labour so that a solution to the problem raised by the College of Physicians and Surgeons might be found. The Minister refused such a meeting on the grounds that the matter was sub judice. A further communication was sent by the union to the Minister on  April  but no reply was received.
.The complainants further allege that the union wrote to the Legal Department of the Ministry on  April , requesting information on the legal grounds upon which action for the dissolution of the union had been taken. The Ministry replied in a letter dated  May  that the union had been informed of the legal decision given on the matter by the Department in a letter dated  May .
.In support of these allegations the complainants supply copies of all the correspondence and documents referred to in the preceding paragraphs.
.The Government, in its reply dated  December , points out that the First Labour Court is at present considering the application for dissolution of the Homoeopathy Workers' Union. The Government explains that the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare is empowered by sections ,  and  of the Labour Code (as amended by Act No.  of  May  and Act No.  of  August ) to apply to the courts for the winding-up of trade unions having a membership of fewer than  if they are associations of workers carrying on a trade or profession on their own account.
.The Government also refers to the Act for the foundation of the College of Physicians and Surgeons (Act No.  of  August ) and the Regulations for its administration (Act No.  of  January ). Section  of the Act of  provides that no person who has not previously registered with the College may practise medicine or surgery or any special branch thereof, and that authorisation is required from the College for the practice of other ancillary branches of medical science, including homoeopathy, except in the case of persons registered in such branches with other professional colleges. The Government adds that section  of the same Act provides that only persons registered with the College or authorised thereby may hold public office in connection with the professional practice of medicine, or branches thereof, except in the case of persons registered with other professional colleges in those branches.
.The Government states that in  the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare was notified by the College of Physicians and Surgeons that none of the members of the executive of the union in question was authorised to practise homoeopathy in conformity with the Act, and that up to  only three medical practitioners had been authorised to practise homoeopathy in Costa Rica. As far as the other branches of medicine were concerned, only the optometrists had formed their own professional college.
.Under the Regulations for the administration of the Act, continues the Government, the College of Physicians and Surgeons was the only body competent to authorise the practice of homoeopathy, and since only three persons had so far been thus authorised, no union could be formed in accordance with the provisions of the Labour Code. In addition, the Government draws attention to the legal provisions of the Health Code of , which makes it illegal for unauthorised persons to practise certain paramedical occupations (including homoeopathy). Under the Penal Code, the unlawful practice of medicine and related occupations is a criminal offence.
.In the light of these considerations, concludes the Government, the Ministry, exercising the powers vested in it, applied to the First Labour Court of San Jos for the winding up of the union in question. The Government adds that the union's legal advisers have lodged an objection to this application and the Court will accordingly reach such decision as it thinks appropriate. The Government concludes by stating that, in its opinion, there is not the slightest evidence of anti-union persecution.
.The Committee observes that the Homoeopathy Workers' Union, founded in , was duly registered by the Trade Unions Office of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare after compliance with the request of that office to amend the statutes concerning the matter of the funds of the union. The union appears to have functioned normally as such until April , when it was informed by the Ministry that, information having been received from the College of Physicians and Surgeons, an application had been made to the Court for its dissolution. The information supplied by the College was that up to  only three persons in Costa Rica had been authorised by the College to practise homoeopathy. Such authorisation, the Committee notes, is a requirement laid down by law for the practice of homoeopathy and certain other special branches of medicine.
.The Committee has also taken account of the provisions of sections  and  of the Labour Code (as amended) which provide that a workers' organisation, or an organisation of persons independently exercising their profession, may not be formed with fewer than  members, and also, inter alia, that in the event of non-compliance with this provision the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare shall apply to the labour courts for the winding up of such an occupational organisation. Since, the Government maintains, only three medical practitioners had been authorised to practise homoeopathy in the country, it follows that the minimum membership requirement had not been fulfilled for the establishment of an organisation of persons independently practising homoeopathy.
.In many countries there exist laws and regulations which are enacted, in the public interest, for the control of the exercise of various professional activities. Such rules are, of necessity, stringent in order to ensure that the general public may have adequate protection against persons who may seek to exercise professional activities without the qualifications or authorisation by the supervisory professional body which may be necessary before doing so. The Committee has observed that, in Costa Rica, the medical profession is governed by laws and regulations of this kind, and it is these regulations and the law governing the establishment of trade unions which the Government invokes as justification for the application to the courts for the dissolution of a union consisting, apparently, of three properly qualified and duly authorised homoeopaths and a number of other persons who have not received proper authorisation to practise this branch of medicine. The Government argues that the union is not a union constituted by at least  persons exercising their profession independently, as required under section  of the Labour Code.
.The Committee has no information before it, nor has the Government contended, that the work actually performed by those members of the union in question who, according to the Government, are not authorised to practise homoeopathy is performed in contravention of the law governing the practice of this branch of medicine. It would therefore seem that these persons are engaged in work connected with, or ancillary to, the practice of homoeopathy and that it is not considered that special authorisation is essential for this type of work. The Committee considers that such persons, provided they are legally performing activities in connection with the profession of homoeopathy, should be entitled to the protection afforded by the freedom of association Conventions.
.Furthermore, the membership requirement contained in section  of the Labour Code is applicable not only to organisations of persons independently exercising a profession, but also to organisations of workers in general. According to the information supplied",1,1971,Costa Rica
188,"by the Government, this provision would appear to be interpreted in such a manner as to place a restriction on the forming of an occupational organisation consisting both of independent professionals and of employees (trabajadores) as defined in section  of the Labour Code, despite the fact that they all exercise functions in the same occupational sphere. Such a restriction would, in the opinion of the Committee, constitute an infringement of Article  of Convention No. , which guarantees to workers, without distinction whatsoever, the right to establish and to join organisations of their own choosing.
.In view of the lack of information as to the membership of the union in question and the actual work performed by the persons involved in the union, the Committee is at present unable to arrive at any definitive conclusions concerning the complaint.
.The Committee therefore recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the attention of the Government to the considerations set forth in paragraphs  and  above;(b) to request the Government to supply detailed information, at an early date, as to the membership of the Homoeopathy Workers' Union and the actual work performed by the persons involved in that union;(c) to request the Government to supply copies of the judgement of the First Labour Court of San Jos concerning the application for dissolution of the Homoeopathy Workers' Union, together with the grounds adduced therefor; and(d) to take note of this interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report when the information requested in subparagraphs (b) and (c) of the: present paragraph has been received.",1,1971,Costa Rica
189,".The complaint of the Costa Rican Christian Workers' and Peasants' Confederation was contained in a communication dated  November , which was forwarded to the Government on  December  for observations.
.Despite the repeated requests made by the Committee, the Government has not furnished its observations. Consequently the Committee, at its May  Session, sent an urgent appeal to the Government to supply the observations requested (nd Report, paragraph ). No response having been made to this appeal, the Committee, at its November  Session, in accordance with the rules of procedure established in paragraph  of its th Report, stated that it intended to submit at its present session a report on the substance of the matter even if the information awaited from the Government had not been received by that date (th Report, paragraph ). The observations in question have not been received to this day.
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its complaint, the Costa Rican Christian Workers' and Peasants' Confederation denounces as ""trade union persecution"" the dismissal of Isaac Amador Prez, General Secretary of the union of the firm Ensambladora Centroamericana S.A. (ECASA), and of Manuel Chaves Sojo and Juan Luis Cordero Fernndez, other trade union leaders. These persons are alleged to have been dismissed by the undertaking for having collected signatures in order to raise the question of a collective agreement.
.Since the Government has not submitted its observations on these allegations, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to recall the observation made by the Committee in paragraph  of its First Report, according to which the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and the Committee is confident that, if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments for their part will recognise the importance for the protection of their own good name of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to such detailed factual charges as may be put forward;(b) to note that the allegations made refer to measures of antiunion discrimination against three trade union leaders, namely Mr. Isaac Amador Prez, Mr. Manuel Chaves Sojo and Mr. Juan Luis Cordero Fernndez;(c) to note that in the present case the Government has furnished no information to prove that the allegations are groundless;(d) to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that one of the fundamental principles of freedom of association is that workers should enjoy adequate protection against all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment and that this protection is particularly desirable in the case of trade union officials because, in order to be able to perform their trade union duties in full independence, they must have the guarantee that they will suffer no prejudice on account of the mandate which they hold from their trade unions; and that this guarantee is also necessary in order to ensure that effect is given to the principle that workers' organisations should have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom;(e) in particular, to draw the attention of the Government to the Convention and Recommendation concerning workers' representatives, adopted by the International Labour Conference in , in which it is expressly established that workers' representatives in the undertaking should enjoy effective protection against any act prejudicial to them, including dismissal, based on their status or activities as workers' representatives or on union membership or participation in union activities, in so far as they act in conformity with existing laws or collective agreements or other jointly agreed arrangements;(f) to deplore the fact that despite the repeated requests made to it, the Government has not supplied the information requested by the Committee in respect of the allegations that have been made, thus making it impossible for the Committee to submit its conclusions on the case in full knowledge of the facts.",0,1970,Costa Rica
190,".The Committee previously examined this case at its th Session (November ), when it submitted an interim report thereon to the Governing Body (st Report, paragraphs  to ).
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee recalls that the complainants alleged that  workers of the Municipal Council of Goicoechea had been dismissed as an act of reprisal because they had submitted a claim aimed at the conclusion of a collective agreement. The Government had denied that the dismissals were acts of reprisal, stating that they had taken place either because of a reorganisation of the administration or because of misdemeanours committed by several of the workers involved. The Government had also stated that, as regards the submission of a claim, a municipality was not, under national legislation and case law, required to conclude a collective agreement.
.In this connection the Committee recalled that the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), which sets standards designed to protect workers against any acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment and provides for measures to encourage and promote collective bargaining, allows an exception in the case of public servants engaged in the administration of the State. On the other hand, the Committee also recalled that the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations had stated that while the concept of public servant may vary to some degree under the various national legal systems, the exclusion from the scope of the Convention of public servants who do not act as agents of the public authority is contrary to the meaning of the Convention.
.The Committee had observed that there was nothing in the evidence before it to show which categories of municipal employees were involved so that it could decide whether or not they were covered by the guarantees contained in the Convention. Nor was it clear from the available information what actions some of the workers were alleged to have committed which led to their dismissal. The Committee had accordingly requested the Government to define the nature of the duties of the workers covered by the claim submitted to the Municipal Council by the National Union of Municipal Workers, and the misdemeanours, considered to be serious, which led to the dismissal of certain of these workers.
.The Government responded to this request by submitting additional information on the matters in a communication dated  November  addressed direct to the ILO.
.In this communication the Government provides a list of the names and occupations of the dismissed workers, all of whom, states the Government, were municipal workers performing a public service for a municipal corporation, as a department of public administration to which section  of the Labour Code was applicable. This section provides that any "" private "" employer with a given proportion of unionised workers is compelled to conclude a collective agreement with the appropriate trade union at the latter's request. It appears therefore that if the employer is a public body, this obligation does not apply.
.The Government further states that the misdemeanours committed by the workers which caused them to be dismissed were indiscipline, refusal to obey orders of superiors and utter disregard for the tools and equipment issued to them for the performance of their duties, all of which was proved when the matters were thoroughly investigated.
.The Government adds that it is relevant to mention that the matters were not established before the courts, not because of lack of evidence but because of the intervention of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare, through which payment of the statutory benefits was secured for the dismissed workers. As a result of this, legal proceedings were terminated.
.The Government adheres to its view that the dismissals in question in no way amounted to trade union persecution, as alleged by the complainants, since at the time of submission of the claims for better financial conditions, the Municipal Corporation had already decided upon a reorganisation of its staff.
.From the information supplied by the Government in its communication, it appears to the Committee that the nature of the duties of the majority of the workers covered by the claim submitted by the National Union of Municipal Workers is not such as to justify the exclusion of these workers from the scope of the Convention. In the list of persons dismissed by the Council, the Committee observes that out of the  persons named,  are manual workers or labourers (mainly roadsweepers and refuse collectors), four are inspectors of buildings or public entertainment, one is a tax inspector and another a musician in the Municipal Philharmonic Orchestra. Clearly, the majority of the workers involved did not act as agents of the public authority and accordingly are entitled to the protection afforded by Convention No. .
.With regard to the dismissal of the workers employed by the Municipal Council of Goicoechea, the Committee notes the complainants' allegation that the dismissals were acts of reprisal and anti-trade-union victimisation which were the result of the submission of a claim by the National Union of Municipal Workers for improved conditions. The Committee also notes that the misdemeanours which caused the dismissal of certain of the workers were fully investigated by the authorities, and that acts of indiscipline, failure to obey orders, and disregard for tools and equipment, were found to be proved. The Committee is of the opinion that while the commission of misdemeanours of this nature may have been provoked by the refusal on the part of the Council to negotiate, it nevertheless considers that no information has been supplied by the complainants to support the allegation that these dismissals were acts of reprisal or anti-trade-union victimisation. The Committee accordingly recommends the Governing Body to decide that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.
.With regard to section  of the Labour Code and the refusal of the Municipal Council of Goicoechea to discuss or negotiate with the National Union of Municipal Workers in connection with its claim for improved conditions, the Committee wishes to draw the attention of the Government to Article  of Convention No. , which lays down that "" Measures appropriate to national conditions shall be taken, where necessary, to encourage and promote the full development and utilisation of machinery for voluntary negotiation between employers or employers' organisations and workers' organisations, with a view to the regulation of terms and conditions of employment by means of collective agreements "". In this connection the Committee has, on several occasions, emphasised the importance which it attaches to the principle that employers, including public authorities in their capacity as employers, should recognise for collective bargaining purposes the organisations representative of the workers employed by them.
.The Committee accordingly recommends the Governing Body to request the Government to consider, in the light of the considerations and principles set forth in paragraphs ,  and  above, what measures should be taken to ensure the promotion of the full development of voluntary negotiation between workers' organisations and, in appropriate circumstances, public authorities in their capacity as employers, with a view to the regulation of terms and conditions of employment by means of collective agreements. The Committee also recommends the Governing Body to draw the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to this aspect of the case in connection with its examination of reports supplied by the Government under article  of the Constitution of the ILO.
.In these circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to decide that the majority of the workers covered by the claim submitted by the National Union of Municipal Workers were entitled to the protection of Convention No. ;(b) to decide, for the reasons given in paragraph  above, that the allegations concerning the dismissal of  workers by the Municipal Council of Goicoechea do not call for further examination;(c) to request the Government to consider, in the light of the considerations and principles set out in paragraphs ,  and  above, what measures should be taken to ensure the promotion of the full development of voluntary negotiation between workers' organisations and, in appropriate circumstances, public authorities in their capacity as employers, with a view to the regulation of terms and conditions of employment by means of collective agreements; and(d) to draw the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to this aspect of the case in connection with its examination of reports supplied by the Government under article  of the Constitution of the ILO.
.The complaints by the Confederation of Workers and Peasants of Costa Rica (COCC) and the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions (CLASC) were submitted in two communications dated  July and  August . These were forwarded to the Government of Costa Rica, which submitted its observations",0,1970,Costa Rica

.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants allege that the Municipal Council of Goicoechea has dismissed thirty-two workers as an act of reprisal and anti-trade-union victimisation. According to the complainants, the dismissals took place because the National Union of Municipal Workers had submitted a list of claims for better economic and social conditions which the Municipal Council refused to discuss.
.The Government confirms that the Goicoechea Municipal Council did indeed dismiss some of its workers, but adds that this was due to the need to reorganise its administration in the interests of greater efficiency. Dismissals had taken place in other local authorities for similar reasons. The Government adds that some of the dismissals in Goicoechea were due to serious misdemeanours by several of the workers. As regards the submission of a claim, the Government states that under national legislation and case law, a municipality is not required to conclude a collective agreement.
.In its communication the Government declares that the labour authorities investigated the case and found no evidence of any victimisation. The conclusions of these authorities were, in turn, referred to the Tripartite Fact-Finding Committee on Freedom of Association. While the investigation was being held, the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare issued a circular to all local authorities urging them to lose no time in paying any compensation to which redundant workers might be entitled. The Goicoechea Municipal Council reported that it had paid compensation to thirteen of the workers it had dismissed.
.The Committee considers that the complaints fall, in fact, into two parts-first, the dismissal of the municipal employees and, second, the refusal of the Municipal Council to discuss a claim aimed at the conclusion of a collective agreement.
.As regards the former, the Government denies that the dismissals involved any victimisation but acknowledges that some of them were due to serious misdemeanours by the workers concerned; it gives no details of the nature of these misdemeanours. As regards the latter, it refers to section  of the Labour Code, whereby any "" private "" employer with a given proportion of unionised workers is compelled to conclude a collective agreement with the appropriate trade union at the latter's request. However, if the employer is a public body, this obligation does not apply.
.The Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), which sets standards designed to protect workers against any acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment and provides for measures to encourage and promote collective bargaining, allows an exception in the case of public servants engaged in the administration of the State. On the other hand, the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has stated that while the concept of public servant may vary to some degree under the various national legal systems, the exclusion from the scope of the Convention of public servants who do not act as agents of the public authority is contrary to the meaning of the Convention.
.In the present case, there is nothing in the evidence before the Committee to show which categories of municipal employees are involved so that it can decide whether or not they are covered by the guarantees contained in the Convention. Nor is it clear from the available information what actions some of the workers are alleged to have committed which led to their dismissal.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to request the Government to be good enough to define the nature of the duties of the workers covered by the claim submitted by the National Union of Municipal Workers and the misdemeanours considered to be serious which led to the dismissal of certain of these workers;(b) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report once it has received the additional information requested from the Government.Geneva,  November .

192,".The Committee examined this case at its session in May , when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body, which appeared in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (May-June ).
.The case comprised the following allegations: allegations relating to a clash between the police and workers at Puerto Limn; allegations relating to the dismissal of workers at the Luxform underwear factory; allegations regarding the threat of action against the workers' and peasants' movement; allegations regarding action against Mr. Juan Rafael Solis Barboza, press secretary of the complainant organisation, at the instigation of the Costa Rican authorities; allegations relating to the expulsion of union leaders from the banana-growing area owned by the Ticaban Company; allegations relating to the dismissal of trade unionists by plantation employers; allegations respecting an attack by government forces on trade union members in the Estrella valley.
.Among these allegations, only the last three remain pending, the Committee having submitted its final recommendations on all the others to the Governing Body, which approved them.
.With regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to decide, for the reasons stated in paragraph  above, that the allegation respecting the attack by government forces on trade union members during the course of an illegal strike in the Estrella valley calls for no further examination;(b) as regards the allegations relating to the expulsion of union leaders from the banana growing area owned by the Ticaban Company, to insist that the Government should take all legislative and other measures to establish and make effective the right of trade union leaders to enter plantations to exercise lawful trade union activities, as provided for by Legal Opinion No.  of ;(c) as regards the allegations relating to the dismissal of trade unionists by plantation employers, to take note of the information supplied by the Government concerning a Bill guaranteeing trade union rights and to request the Government to keep it informed on any developments in the situation;(d) to take note of the general information supplied by the Government and to request the latter to keep it informed of the results of the action it is taking, particularly concerning the redrafting of the Labour Code on matters of freedom of association.
.The complaint by the General Confederation of Costa Rican Workers was made in a communication dated  October  addressed directly to the ILO, supplemented by a further communication dated  November of the same year. The complaint, together with the supplementary information, was forwarded to the Government, which sent in its observations in a communication dated  April .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complaint comprises a series of allegations which are dealt with separately below.
.As regards the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to decide, for the reasons given respectively in paragraphs  and ,  and ,  and  to  above, that the allegations relating to clashes between the police and strikers at Puerto Limn, the dismissal of workers from the Luxform underwear factory, the threat of action against the workers' and peasants' movement and measures taken against Mr. Juan Rafael Solis Barboza, the press secretary of the complaining organisation at the instigation of the Costa Rican authorities, do not call for further examination on its part;(b) as regards the allegations concerning the expulsion of union officials from the banana-growing district of the Ticaban company, and for the reasons given in paragraphs  and  above:(i) to remind the Government of the importance it attaches to giving trade union representatives the right of entry to plantations for the purpose of trade union activities and to the right of plantation workers to hold trade union meetings on the spot;(ii) to express its concern about the fact that its previous recommendations to the Government relating to the right of entry and assembly do not appear to have led to the taking of action to implement this right;(iii) to request the Government to keep it informed of any measures it has adopted or is planning to adopt to this end;(c) as regards the allegations concerning the dismissal of trade unionists from plantations, and for the reasons given in paragraphs  to  above:(i) to note that in certain cases, by virtue of sections ,  and  of the Labour Code, the national legislation does not appear to afford sufficient protection against acts of anti-trade union discrimination as provided for by Article  of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), which has been ratified by Costa Rica;(ii) to request the Government to envisage appropriate action to give adequate protection to all workers against acts of anti-trade union discrimination, as provided for by Convention No. ;(iii) to request the Government to keep the Governing Body informed of any steps it has taken or is planning to take to this end;(iv) to call the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to the foregoing;(d) as regards the allegations concerning the attack by Government forces on trade unionists in the Estrella Valley, and for the reasons given in paragraphs  and  above:(i) to note that under section  of the Labour Code disputes between employers and employees in public services must be submitted to the labour courts for settlement;(ii) to request the Government to be good enough to state whether the procedures, provided for by law were followed before the outbreak of the strike in question and, if not, the reasons why the said procedures were not set in motion;(iii) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will make a further report when it is in possession of the additional information requested from the Government in this paragraph.Geneva,  May .

193,".The complaint is contained in a communication dated  October , sent directly to the ILO by the Permanent Congress for Trade Union Unity of the Workers of Latin America, the headquarters of which are in Santiago de Chile.
.The Government furnished its observations in a communication dated  November .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee considers that, in any case, governments have the right to take the necessary measures to guarantee public order and national security, which includes ascertaining the purpose of visits to the country by persons against whom there are grounds for suspicion from this point of view. The present case concerns an official of an international trade union Organisation who apparently wished to exercise the right of contacting a national affiliated Organisation and taking part in its work, who had obtained a visa from the Costa Rican authorities and concerning whom certain rumours had arisen. The Committee considers that in order to avoid the danger of the above-mentioned right being restricted, the authorities should check up on each specific case as quickly as possible and should aim-on the basis of objective criteria-at ascertaining whether or not there exist facts which might have real repercussions on public order and security.
.Accordingly, the Committee recommends the Governing Body, as it did in another case, to point out to the Government that it would be desirable, in situations of this kind, to seek an agreement through appropriate discussions in which the authorities as well as the leaders and organisations concerned may clarify their positions.",0,1968,Costa Rica
194,".The Committee examined this case at its meeting held in February , when it submitted to the Governing Body, in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, its conclusions concerning some of the allegations made in the complaint. The only point that remained to be dealt with was an allegation to the effect that the undertaking had coerced a leader of the complainant trade union to resign from office.
.Since the Government had not sent its observations on this particular aspect of the matter, the Committee had recommended the Governing Body, in paragraph  (d) of its th Report, to request the Government to be so good as to send those observations. After the Governing Body had approved the th Report, this request was conveyed to the Government, which answered by a communication dated  January .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants allege in their communication of  July  that Mr. Belforth Quesada Rojas had been subjected to pressure by the Compaia Bananera de Costa Rica to resign from his post as records and correspondence secretary of the trade union.
.In its additional observations dated  January  the Government stated that it appeared from the report and documents it had obtained from the undertaking in question that Mr. Quesada Rojas's resignation was in no way the result of coercion. The Government attached a photocopy of the statement signed by the persons concerned to the effect that he had resigned of his own free will from membership and office in the trade union and that at no time had he been threatened or coerced by the company.
.In the circumstances, taking into account the detailed information supplied by the Government, from which it would appear that the trade union leader named in the complaint had resigned of his own free will, and in view of the fact that the complainants have not supplied further elements of information in support of their allegation that such resignation was a result of coercion by the undertaking, in violation of freedom of association, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that this remaining aspect of the case does not call for further examination.
.The complaint is contained in a communication dated  May  from the General Secretary of the Costa Rica Banana Company Workers' Union (SITRACOBA). The complaining organisation supplied additional information by a second communication dated  July . Both these communications were transmitted to the Government, which replied by two communications dated  September and  October .
.Costa Rica has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.With respect to the case as a whole the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the allegations relating to intervention by the authorities and by representatives of the employers in union meetings, to draw the attention of the Government, as it has already done in a number of earlier cases relating to Costa Rica, to the importance which it attaches to the right of plantation workers to hold trade union meetings on the estates; to express its concern that the recommendations previously made do not appear to have led to the adoption of specific measures to ensure that all plantation workers can exercise the right in question, and to request the Government to be good enough to keep it informed as to the provisions it adopts or plans to adopt to this effect;(b) with regard to the allegation relating to the dismissal of Messrs. Luis Prez Madrigal, Victor Barrantes Gamboa and Juan Rafael Montes Crdenas, to decide, for the reasons indicated in paragraph  above, that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination;(c) with regard to the allegations relating to the dismissal of trade union leaders and members, to draw the Government's attention to the importance which should be attached to the provisions of Article l of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), which has been ratified by Costa Rica; to take note of the Government's statement to the effect that a Bill concerning this matter is now under study, and to express the hope that appropriate measures will be brought into force as soon as possible to protect workers against any act of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment; and to bring these conclusions to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations;(d) with regard to the allegation that pressure was brought to bear on Mr. Belforth Quesada Rojas to make him give up his post with the union, to request the Government to be good enough to furnish its observations on this particular point as soon as possible;(e) to take note of the present interim report, on the understanding that the Committee will report further to the Governing Body when it has received the observations to be requested from the Government under subparagraph (d) above.",0,1965,Costa Rica
195,".The Committee has already examined this case, in November , when it submitted an interim report which forms paragraphs  to  of the th Report of the Committee. This was approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ).
.With respect to the case as a whole the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the allegations that a meeting of farmers was broken up and books belonging to the Quepos Farmers' Union seized, and as regards the detention of the workers Enrique Leal, Santiago Mendoza, Enrique Duarte, Salvador Varela and Rafael Ziga, to decide that these aspects of the case do not call for further examination;(b) as regards the allegations relating to the search of the residence of Mr. Juan Arias and the seizure of the membership list of the Limn Agricultural Workers' Union, to draw the attention of the Government, on taking note of the information supplied by it, to the principle it has emphasised on earlier occasions that while trade unions, like other organisations or persons, cannot claim immunity from search of their premises, such a search should only be made following the issue of a warrant by the ordinary judicial authority after it has been satisfied that evidence exists on the said premises material to a prosecution for an offence under the ordinary law and that such search is restricted to the purposes for which it was issued.
.The complaints of the General Confederation of Workers of Costa Rica are contained in four communications dated  March,  May,  May and  June  respectively. These complaints were transmitted to the Government, which forwarded its observations in communications dated  June and  July .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No.  ).
.With regard to the case as a whole the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to decide that the allegations relating to the detention of Mr. Hernndez Gutirrez, the registration of the Federation of Agricultural, Forestry, and Plantation Workers and the violation of the Labour Inspection Convention,  (No. ), do not call for further examination;(b) to note that the meetings organised by the trade unions in the banana-growing area on the Pacific coast to celebrate May Day were prohibited, according to the Government, in view of special circumstances in which they might have caused disturbances and endangered public order;(c) to suggest to the Government the desirability of issuing the necessary instructions to the local authorities to avoid the legal provisions in force relating to subversive propaganda being interpreted abusively so as to entail a danger of interference that might restrict or impede the right of trade unions to organise their activities freely within the law;(d) to request the Government to furnish its observations as soon as possible on the allegations relating to the raiding of the home of Mr. Juan Arias, the seizure of the membership list of the Limn Agricultural Workers' Union, the seizure of books belonging to the Quepos Farmers' Union and the detention of the workers Enrique Leal, Santiago Mendoza, Enrique Duarte, Salvador Varela and Rafael Ziga;(e) to take note of the present interim report, on the understanding that the Committee will submit a further report when it has received the observations requested from the Government.",1,1964,Costa Rica
196,".The Committee last examined this case when it met in February , at which time it submitted an interim report which appears in paragraphs  to  of its st Report, approved by the Governing Body at its st Session (March ). That report left outstanding certain allegations relating to the detention of trade unionists and the confiscation of trade union literature.
.The Golfito Workers' Union and the Workers' Union of Puerto Gonzlez Vquez claimed in a communication dated  June  that the authorities, after breaking up a union meeting, took into custody the workers Salomon Bustos Morales, Saturnino Alvarez Moreno, Efrain Quesada Chaverri and Esteban Fonseca Moraga, as well as the trade union officers Sabino Jurez and Guillermo Fuentes Ortega. At the same time the authorities in question confiscated a memorandum with nine signatures on the back of a list of claims, stub books of union subscription receipts and other trade union documents.
.In its reply of  December  the Government made no comment on these allegations, and the Committee therefore recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to furnish its observations on the matter, postponing in the meantime its examination of this aspect of the case.
.On  April  the Government replied to the request that had been made concerning these outstanding points. In order to comply with the request the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare had sought information from the General Inspectorate of Finance, which in its turn contacted the authorities for the area in which the events referred to by the complainants had occurred. The Deputy Inspector of Finance at Puerto Gonzlez Viquez stated that there was no record in the guard-room book of such events having taken place on the date mentioned by the complainants. Since the official who was Deputy Inspector at Puerto Gonzlez Viquez at that time is now exercising the same functions at Golfito, the authorities asked him for information on the matters raised in the complaint. Once again, however, the Deputy Inspector's reply was that on the date in question no official action was taken of the kind alleged. Finally, the Commander of the Customs Police for the southern part of the country was consulted, and his reply in no way differed from that of any of the other authorities cited.
.The Committee observes that, on the one hand, the allegation made by the complainants appears to be rather specific, since it gives the names of the persons detained and the date on which they were arrested and the trade union documents confiscated while, on the other hand, the governmental authorities for the area disclaim all knowledge of the events in question. In view of the contradictory opinions expressed by the complainants and by the Government the Committee does not consider itself sufficiently well informed to be able to reach a final decision concerning this aspect of the complaint.
.The Committee recalls, however, that the representative of the Director-General who not long ago went to the same banana-growing area on the Pacific coast of Costa Rica to investigate a series of complaints of alleged infringements of freedom of association reported that "" On several occasions the unions have complained that their leaders were arrested by the local police or by the Customs Police. It was often very difficult to find the records of such proceedings but, on the whole, the grounds for such detentions appear to be: the holding of public meetings without permission, engaging in political discussions during a trade union meeting and carrying allegedly subversive propaganda material.... These detentions are usually for a period of less than  hours and are of a preventive character. No further proceedings are generally instituted, either by the authorities or by the detainees, and so no authoritative interpretation of the law by judicial decision emerges.""
.In these circumstances, and since no further information has been forthcoming from the complainants in respect of the alleged events, and in particular in regard to the persons said to have been arrested, the Committee recommends the Governing Body, while drawing the Government's attention to the fact that the right of trade unionists to meet freely on their own premises, without prior authorisation and without supervision by the public authorities, forms a fundamental part of freedom of association, to decide that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.
.The Committee already examined this case at its session in June  and made an interim report, which appears in paragraphs  to  of its th Report adopted by the Governing Body at its th Session (June-July ) and at its session in November , when it presented another interim report, which appears in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, adopted by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ).
.When examining this case in its th Report the Committee already observed that, by reason of the many complaints received of infringement of trade union rights in the Pacific banana zone, the Government had decided to appoint a committee to investigate these events. At the time the Committee recommended the Governing Body to note that the Government had promised to furnish the results of the investigations being conducted, together with its own observations on the allegations made by the Costa Rican Workers' Confederation "" Rerum Novarum "", and to decide to postpone further examination of the case.
.In a note of  December  the Government communicated its observations together with the results of the investigations carried out by the above-mentioned committee. The Committee has studied the conclusions of this investigating committee with the greatest interest; in addition to dealing with the complaints presented to the Committee, they also treat of other complaints made directly to the investigating committee itself.
.With regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with reference to the allegations concerning the detention and dismissal of trade unionists presented by the Costa Rican Confederation of Workers "" Return Novarum "", to take note that it was not possible to furnish the investigating committee appointed by the Government with proof of the events alleged in the complaint, and that in view of the lack of more precise elements contained in the said complaint to decide that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination;(b) as regards the allegations presented by the Golfito Workers' Union and the Workers' Union of Puerto Gonzlez Viquez concerning the detention of trade unionists and the confiscation of trade union literature, to request the Government to be good enough to furnish its observations on the matter and in the meantime to postpone its examination of this aspect of the case;(c) with reference to the allegations concerning interference by the authorities and by representatives of the employers with trade union meetings, in view of the special situation that has arisen and taking into account the factors emerging from the present proceedings, to reiterate to the Government the principles set forth in paragraph  relating to the facilities that should be granted to plantation workers, particularly with regard to the right to hold trade union meetings, and to point out the need to take such steps as may be necessary to ensure the effective application of these principles;(d) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will report further when it has received the additional information requested from the Government.
.The Committee examined this case at its previous session in June  and made an interim report which appears in paragraphs - of its th Report adopted by the Governing Body at its th Session (June-July ).
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to note that the Government has promised to furnish the results of the investigation now being conducted and its own specific observations on the various points in the complaint by the Costa Rican Confederation of Workers "" Return Novarum "", and, for the time being, to postpone further examination of the case.
.By a communication dated  February  the Golfito Workers' Union presented a complaint against the Government of Costa Rica alleging violation of trade union rights in that country. Following communication of the complaint to the Government, a reply was received by note dated  April .

.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the allegations relating to the arrest of a trade union leader, house searches and confiscation of trade union literature and acts of discrimination against trade unionists, to note that Mr. Guillermo Fuentes was immediately released and to decide that these allegations do not call for further examination;(b) with regard to the allegations concerning intervention in trade union meetings, to request the Government to be good enough to furnish its observations and to decide in the meantime to postpone examination of this aspect of the case.Geneva,",1,1964,Costa Rica

198,".The complaints of the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unionists are contained in a communication dated  December  and enlarged upon in a further communication dated  February . The Government has forwarded its observations in two letters dated  February and  May .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their first communication the complainants announced that the headquarters of the Christian Farm Workers' Front in the city of San Jos had been broken into by the police. In their second communication the complainants confirmed this statement, adding that the public authorities had subsequently given the necessary assurances and guarantees that freedom of association would be respected, following the protests received from other trade union organisations abroad. In the same letter the complainants stated that on  January  Mr. Claudio Gamboa, a senior official of the Christian Farm Workers' Front of Costa Rica, had been arrested while on a visit to the Puntarenas district. He was released after being interrogated several times, and later the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare explained to him how it had happened.
.The Federation stated categorically in the final paragraph of its second communication that it wished its complaint to be held in suspense until the situation in Costa Rica became clearer.
.In its communication of  February  the Government announced that, in view of the various protests that had been received, an investigation had been made into the alleged forcible entry by the police into the union premises. During the investigation contact was made with Mr. Claudio Gamboa, who stated that while a Christmas party was in progress at the headquarters of the Christian Farm Workers' Front in San Jos two members of the armed police came in and after staying a short time left without any further developments. Mr. Gamboa spoke to them, but did not ask them why they were there. At a later meeting at which the Minister of Public Security, the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare, Mr. Gamboa and the two policemen concerned were present, the latter declared that while on their beat during the Christmas festivities they passed in front of the union offices in question and were invited by a man who came out to join the party. They stayed for a few minutes and had a short conversation with Mr. Gamboa, and then left without in any way - disturbing the guests at the party. According to the Government Mr. Gamboa did not deny this account, but argued that he had lodged his complaint with a number of international trade union organisations because of the potential threat to trade union freedoms involved in actions such as these, which might create a precedent.
.The Government added that it was made quite clear at the meeting that the two policemen were acting on their own account and at no time had any intention of breaking in. The Minister of Labour fully explained the position to Mr. Gamboa on behalf of the Government. Mr. Gamboa later told the Minister that he was getting in touch with the trade union organisations to which he had sent his complaint to tell them of the satisfactory explanation given by the Government and ask them for permission to withdraw his complaint. The Government enclosed copies of the cables sent by Mr. Gamboa to the organisations in question.
.In its communication of  May  the Government referred to the complaint concerning the arrest of Mr. Claudio Gamboa on  January  in the Puntarenas district. According to the Government, Mr. Gamboa had gone to Puntarenas to deal with a social problem involving itinerant salesmen. The meeting he attended was alleged to be communist-inspired, and the commandant requested Mr. Gamboa to accompany him to his office. There his identity was established and he was asked a number of questions, after which he was allowed to leave. The Government made inquiries and gave Mr. Gamboa a full explanation of what had happened. Furthermore, the Government gave specific instructions to the competent authorities to take steps to ensure that the Constitutional principle of freedom of association continued to be respected.
.Without going into the substance of the allegations made, the Committee notes that Mr. Gamboa, a Christian trade union official in Costa Rica, has asked a number of trade union organisations, including the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unionists, for permission to withdraw the complaint he made of forcible entry into the premises of the Christian Farm Workers' Front, and that the Federation itself, in its communication of  February , requests that its complaint be left in suspense until the position of that organisation in Costa Rica becomes clearer.
.A question of procedure arises here of a kind which the Committee has already had to consider in similar cases in the past. In Case No. , concerning Greece, the Committee expressed the view that the desire shown by a complaining organisation to withdraw its complaint, while constituting a factor to which the greatest attention must be paid, is not in itself sufficient reason for the Committee to cease automatically to proceed with the examination of the complaint. On that occasion the Committee considered that in this respect it should be guided by the conclusions approved by the Governing Body in  and  with regard to two representations submitted by the Madras Labour Union for Textile Workers and by the Socit de Bienfaisance des Travailleurs de l'Ile Maurice, in accordance with article  of the Constitution of the Organisation (now article ). The Governing Body at that time established the principle that, from the moment that a representation was submitted to it, it alone was competent to decide what effect should be given to it, and that "" the withdrawal by the organisation making the representation is not always proof that the representation is not receivable or is not well founded"". The Committee considers that, in implementing this principle, it is free to evaluate the reasons given to explain the withdrawal of a complaint and to investigate whether these appear sufficiently plausible to lead one to believe that the withdrawal was made in complete independence. It has been pointed out by the Committee that cases might exist in which the withdrawal of a complaint by the organisation presenting it would be a result not of the fact that the complaint had become without purpose but of pressure exercised by the government against the complainants, the latter being threatened with an aggravation of the situation if they did not consent to this withdrawal.
.In the present case it would appear from the information supplied by the Government, taken in conjunction with that contained in the complainants' communication of  February , that the problems raised have been adequately taken care of the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare having given an explanation of what had occurred and issued instructions to local authorities to ensure respect for the principle of freedom of association.
.Consequently the Committee considers that, in the light of the above and of the fact that the complainants themselves have asked that their complaint should be merely adjourned, and not withdrawn completely, there appears no room for doubt that they have acted freely and of their own volition without being subjected to pressure of any kind. The Committee therefore recommends the Governing Body to decide that no useful purpose will be served by its proceeding further with the examination of the case.",0,1963,Costa Rica
199,".This case was examined by the Committee as early as the th Session (November ) when the Committee submitted to the Governing Body an interim report contained in paragraphs  to  of the th Report of the Committee, which was approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ), again at its th Session (February ) when the Committee submitted another interim report contained in paragraphs  to  of its nd Report, which was approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (March ), and yet again at its nd Session (October ), when it submitted another report contained in paragraphs  to  of its th Report which was approved by the Governing Body at its rd Session (November ) and which contains the final recommendations on this case.
.The said recommendations, which were forwarded to the Government of Costa Rica by a communication dated  November , read as follows:
.In all the circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to suggest to the Government the possibility of adopting clear and precise provisions to ensure the adequate protection of workers' organisations against any acts of interference by employers or their organisations, in conformity with Article  of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), which has been ratified by Costa Rica;(b) to draw the attention of the Government to the importance which it attaches to the right of plantation workers to hold trade union meetings and to suggest that it might be appropriate to adopt clear provisions as to the meaning to be attached to the terms "" public meeting "" and "" private meeting "";(c) to draw the attention of the Government, having regard to the particular situation of plantation workers, to the importance which it attaches to the principle enunciated by the Plantations Committee of the I.L.O at its First Session (Bandung, December ) that employers of plantation workers should provide their unions with facilities for the conduct of their normal activities, including free office accommodation and freedom of entry;(d) as regards the allegations relating to the detention of trade union leaders:(i) to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that the right of trade unions to meet freely in their own premises, without need for prior authorisation and without control by the public authorities, constitutes a fundamental element of freedom of association;(ii) to note that the various workers detained were released some hours later;(iii) to decide that this aspect of the case does not require further examination;(e) to draw the attention of the Government to the obligation which it undertook, in ratifying the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), to apply all its provisions including, in this particular case, the provisions of Article  which specifies that "" workers and employers, without distinction whatsoever, shall have the right to establish and, subject only to the rules of the organisation concerned, to join organisations of their own choosing without previous authorisation "";(f) to express its satisfaction to the Government for the statement by the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare, according to which, if the question of the revival of the draft decree referred to in paragraph  above should arise in future, the Government would consult the I.L.O prior to taking any decision on the matter;(g) to express its satisfaction to the Government for the assurances given by the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare, according to which it will no longer send inspectors to private trade union meetings, unless so requested by the trade unions concerned.
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.By a communication dated  January  the Government of Costa Rica acknowledged receipt of the letter forwarding the Committee's recommendations and asked for an interpretation of the recommendation contained in the th Report, paragraph  (e), in order to ascertain whether it means that the public authorities must refrain from any intervention which would tend to restrict or prevent the formation or registration, and consequently the acquisition of legal personality, of unions which, though having statutes in conformity with the law, show themselves, from the evidence collected about their underlying purposes or means of action, to be bodies intended to promote subversion or to conspire against the established government or against the Constitutional democratic rgime; or whether, on the other hand, whenever the possibility of recourse to the competent courts is guaranteed, the administrative authority may, for serious reasons of public or social interest, refuse these spurious trade union organisations the registration conferring legal personality-which would constitute a special procedure of dissolution, successful in achieving its end only when approved by the judicial authorities on an action taken by the organisation's representatives or when, through patent lack of interest, the organisation concerned does not appear before the competent court within a legal time limit.
.In this connection the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, considering a similar observation formulated by the Government representative of another country which had also ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), was of the opinion that a group which adopted the rules and the form of a trade union only in order to engage in activities foreign to trade union activities could naturally not enjoy the guarantees laid down in the Convention. However, the Committee considered that it would be difficult to determine in advance whether an organisation applying for registration would or would not engage in activities foreign to trade union activities. As the Committee emphasised in its general conclusions in , normal control of the activities of trade unions should be effected a posteriori and by the judicial authorities; and the fact that an organisation which seeks to enjoy the status of an occupational organisation might in certain cases engage in activities foreign to trade union activities does not appear to constitute sufficient reason for subjecting trade union organisations a priori to control with respect to their composition and with respect to the composition of their management committees.""
.In all the circumstances the Committee, while maintaining its earlier conclusions, recommends the Governing Body to draw the attention of the Government of Costa Rica to the fact that refusal to register a union because the authorities, in advance and of their own independent judgment, consider that it might be politically undesirable, would seem tantamount to submitting registration, which is compulsory and without which a union cannot lawfully exist, to previous authorisation on the part of the authorities, which is not compatible with the provisions of Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), ratified by the Government of Costa Rica.
.This case was examined by the Committee at its th Session (November ), when the Committee submitted to the Governing Body an interim report contained in paragraphs  to  of the th Report of the Committee which was approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ); and, more recently, at its th Session (February ), when the Committee submitted another interim report contained in paragraphs  to  of its nd Report, which was approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (March ).
.Paragraph  of the nd Report of the Committee reads as follows:
.As regards the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the allegations relating to interference with trade union meetings:(i) to draw the attention of the Government to the importance of having regard, when it is taking the necessary measures to fulfil its responsibility for the maintenance of public order, to the possibility of the exercise of trade union rights being endangered, and to the desirability of taking adequate steps to ensure that its police officers observe the provisions of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Costa Rica;(ii) to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that when the authorities send their representatives to assemblies or general meetings of trade unions, held on union premises, or other private union meetings, the presence of such representatives may be considered as an interference, from which the public authorities should refrain in virtue of Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. );(b) to take note of the present interim report as concerns the allegations relating to anti-union acts by employers, eviction from trade union offices, the banning of certain trade union meetings, the detention of trade union leaders and the application for registration made by the Sole Federation of Workers of the Southern Pacific, it being understood that the Committee will report further thereon as soon as it is in possession of the supplementary observations and information which it has requested",0,1960,Costa Rica

.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.Having been invited by the Government of Costa Rica to send a mission to investigate the accusations made by the complaining organisations, the Director-General of the I.L.O appointed as his representative Mr. H. S. Kirkaldy, Professor of Industrial Relations at the University of Cambridge, and Reporter of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations of the I.L.O, "" to investigate the facts which are the subject of the various complaints of alleged infringements of trade union rights in Costa Rica submitted to the I.L.O by different trade union organisations in that country and to make a report thereon to the Director-General "". Mr. Kirkaldy, accompanied by an official of the International Labour Office, carried out this mission from  to  August  and submitted a report thereon to the Director-General. The Committee has examined the report of the Director-General's representative and has found most useful the factual information collected on the spot when examining the allegations.
.The case covers eight series of allegations concerning respectively anti-union acts by employers, the banning of certain trade union meetings, eviction from trade union offices, the detention of trade union leaders, the application for registration by the Sole Federation of Workers of the Southern Pacific (FUTRA), the right of way, a draft decree and intervention in trade union meetings. As regards the last two allegations, the Committee submitted its final conclusions to the Governing Body in paragraph  (b) of its th Report and in paragraph  (a) of its nd Report, respectively.
.In all the circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to suggest to the Government the possibility of adopting clear and precise provisions to ensure the adequate protection of workers' organisations against any acts of interference by employers or their organisations, in conformity with Article  of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), which has been ratified by Costa Rica;(b) to draw the attention of the Government to the importance which it attaches to the right of plantation workers to hold trade union meetings and to suggest that it might be appropriate to adopt clear provisions as to the meaning to be attached to the terms "" public meeting "" and "" private meeting "";(c) to draw the attention of the Government, having regard to the particular situation of plantation workers, to the importance which it attaches to the principle enunciated by the Plantations Committee of the I.L.O at its First Session (Bandung, December ) that employers of plantation workers should provide their unions with facilities for the conduct of their normal activities, including free office accommodation and freedom of entry;(d) as regards the allegations relating to the detention of trade union leaders:(i) to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that the right of trade unions to meet freely in their own premises, without need for prior authorisation and without control by the public authorities, constitutes a fundamental element of freedom of association;(ii) to note that the various workers detained were released some hours later;(iii) to decide that this aspect of the case does not require further examination;(e) to draw the attention of the Government to the obligation which it undertook, in ratifying the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), to apply all its provisions including, in this particular case, the provisions of Article  which specifies that "" workers and employers, without distinction whatsoever, shall have the right to establish and, subject only to the rules of the organisation concerned, to join organisations of their own choosing without previous authorisation "";(f) to express its satisfaction to the Government for the statement by the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare, according to which if the question of the revival of the draft decree referred to in paragraph  above should arise in future, the Government would consult the I.L.O prior to taking any decision on the matter;(g) to express its satisfaction to the Government for the assurances given by the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare, according to which it will no longer send inspectors to private trade union meetings, unless so requested by the trade unions concerned.
.Having taken cognizance of the case at its th Session (November ), the Committee submitted to the Governing Body the interim report contained in paragraphs  to  of the th Report of the Committee, which was approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ).
.The case comprised five sets of allegations, concerning, in order, anti-union acts by employers, the banning of union meetings on premises provided for the workers, interference with union meetings, the detention of trade union leaders and a draft decree. In respect of the last of these the Committee submitted to the Governing Body its final recommendations, which are set out in paragraph  of its th Report. The remaining allegations, together with others subsequently made by the Chiriqui Land Company Workers' Union in letters dated  October  (to which the Government replied by a letter dated  February ) and  February  with respect to its eviction from the union offices and by the FUTRA in a letter dated  February  with respect to its application for registration, are examined below.

201,".In its communication dated  September  the complaining organisation alleges that the Government of Costa Rica has violated the International Labour Conventions relating to the trade union rights of the workers. The complainant states that two workers' federations-the Banana and Associated Workers' Federation (F.O.B.A) and the Banana Workers' Federation (FETRABA) -decided to join forces in order to take collective economic and occupational action against the Chiriqui Land Company. In accordance with the Labour Code of Costa Rica the Superior Labour Court recognised the lawfulness of their action.
.It is alleged that the Government, in order to favour the Company, offered its mediation to seek a settlement of the dispute, but that it refused from the outset to recognise the F.O.B.A as the most representative organisation, although its representative character was simply a question of fact. The Minister of Labour stated, it is alleged, that the Government would negotiate only with the leaders of FETRABA, ignoring the leaders of F.O.B.A in the action undertaken by these two organisations. Thus, states the complainant, the Government has shown itself to be the worst enemy of the unity of the working class and nothing more than a servile instrument of the Company.
.In a communication dated  September  the complaining organisation presented further information in substantiation of its complaint. It states that a pact of unity between F.O.B.A and FETRABA was the only means available to the worker of starting a collective dispute in the banana industry in accordance with the requirements of the laws. The dispute followed the procedure prescribed by law ; recourse was had to conciliation proceedings and then the workers' representatives secured from the labour courts a ruling that their strike was legal. It was then that the Government decided to intervene on its own initiative circumventing the statutory procedure-to prevent the strike from spreading. The complaining organisation was not averse to government intervention because it desired to reach a settlement by negotiation. But, the complainant declares, the intervention was not limited to an attempt to mediate, being intended to break the united front of the workers by a move against the agreement which was needed to make the strike legal. In this connection the complainant states that, while it is true under Costa Rican law that trade union organisations as such have no place in a dispute, it is also true that the Minister did not address himself directly either to the workers or to their legal representatives, but to one only of the federations concerned-FETRABA-to the exclusion of the other. While intervention by the administrative authorities is not provided for under the law, the complainant admits the right of the Minister to approach one of the organisations concerned for the purpose of negotiating ; in the present case, however, it is alleged that the choice made was discriminatory because it did not take account of the fact that F.O.B.A is the majority and, therefore, the more representative organisation. The pact of unity between the two organisations concerned was attacked and it was stated publicly-without, it is alleged, the Minister of Labour denying it-that the Minister refused to deal with the F.O.B.A on the ground that it was Communist. In fact, the Minister dealt only with FETRABA. It is contended that the Minister of Labour, in statements to the press, attacked F.O.B.A and its leaders and spoke only against the inter-union pact. On  August , declares the complainant, the Minister stated that he had decided "" to prevent persons to whom the workers' fate is of no consequence -and by that I mean the Communists-from trying to add grist to their mill simply to promote the class struggle and to maintain a state of constant unrest in the banana plantations "". It is alleged that the President of the Republic directly attacked the pact in an interview, stating : "" The recent amalgamation of the F.O.B.A unions (directed by the Communists) and the FETRABA unions (non-Communist) was not exactly a happy manoeuvre for the democratic workers, because I feel convinced that they can greatly improve their working conditions without having to resort to communism. We always foster the growth of strong and democratic workers' movements when they are not tainted with communism.""
.All these statements and measures against the pact of unity were intended, according to the complainant, to divide the working class. The Government pressure caused the President of FETRABA to denounce the pact without notice. This denunciation, however, had no effect on the solidarity of the banana plantation workers themselves, who, states the complainant, thus gave the lie to the Government's assertions.ANALYSIS OF THE REPLIES
.In its communication dated  September  the Government states that, while administrative reasons have made it impossible for it to ratify the Conventions concerned with freedom of association, both national law and practice afford all the guarantees laid down in these Conventions. In support of this the Government refers to article  of the Labour Code, which provides that "" the lawful Constitution of social organisations, whether industrial associations or co-operative societies, is hereby declared to be in the public interest as one of the most efficacious means of contributing to the maintenance and development of popular culture and democracy in Costa Rica "", adding that the present Government has faithfully respected this principle by recognising without restriction the right of the workers to form trade unions. The Government states that all trade unions have the right to take action in matters relating to the study, improvement and protection of the economic and social interests of their members, and that no person or trade union organisation has been discriminated against with respect to the recognition of these rights. The Government claims that it has shown tolerance in this respect even at times when the safety of the nation has been in danger. Although the Constitution of Costa Rica prohibits the formation of political parties-such as the Communist Party which seek to undermine the foundations of the country's democratic rgime, the Government has allowed former adherents of the Communist Party to work in the trade unions. Despite the links between the Communist Party and such persons, the Government has refrained from interfering in the affairs of the trade unions to which they belong. According to the Government, the person behind the present complaint is one of these persons.
.With respect to the specific complaint the Government states that, legally speaking, the occupational organisations had no place in the dispute between the banana plantation workers and the Chiriqui Land Company. The law states that for a collective dispute to arise the workers concerned have to form an ad hoc association representing at least  per cent of all the persons employed in the undertaking. The dispute must be submitted to the employer with a view to an amicable settlement ; if such settlement proves impossible it is submitted to a tripartite conciliation board, whose recommendations are not binding on the parties. If no agreement can be reached the workers may apply to a court of law to authorise them to call a strike. If this authorisation is given the strike is legal.
.The law does not provide for intervention by the administrative authorities in relations between employers and workers. However, in the present case, in order to avoid the harm resulting from a strike, the Government saw fit to intervene on its own initiative with the workers and with the company without considering-contrary to the complainant's statement-their membership or non-membership of one organisation or another. The intervention of the Ministry of Labour was made in all good faith without preference being given to any particular trade union. The Ministry consulted different persons, regardless of their trade union affiliations.
.In conclusion to its first reply, the Government declares that its policy of protecting the workers is well known and that it does not see the use to refer to the other aspects of the complaint, which it considers to be unfounded, dishonest and the product of anti-democratic ideologies.
.In its second communication, dated  February , the Government refers again to the observations contained in its first reply. It also points out that in Costa Rica the right to declare a strike is not a trade union right but a right of workers in general. When the Government proposes to mediate a dispute it does not have to choose between trade union leaders ; it is sufficient to deal with workers inspired by sound democratic doctrine who enjoy the confidence of their comrades. The statements by the President of the Republic and the Minister of Labour mentioned by the complainant are substantially correct and were justified because the intervention in the dispute of Communist leaders and agitators was a secret to nobody. The Government did not discriminate between trade unions but with respect to ideological groups tainted with communism. When the Government takes measures against the members of such groups it cares little for their trade union affiliation. The Government, however, cannot support any form of trade unionism other",0,1955,Costa Rica
202,"than democratic trade unionism free from any separatist influence.
.With respect to the breaking of the pact of unity between the trade union federations, the Government states that this pact had no connection with its mediation in the banana industry dispute. That is a gratuitous statement by the complainant which rests on no foundation.
.The essence of the allegations is that, when the two federations of banana workers' unions united to call a strike, declared by the competent court to be lawful, the Government intervened, in a manner circumventing the provisions of the Labour Code, to mediate the dispute, and addressed itself for this purpose to the leaders of the minority organisation (FETRABA), refusing to have any dealings with the leaders of the more representative organisation (F.O.B.A). The complainant does not object to the Government intervening to mediate, even though it exercised its initiative in a manner not exactly corresponding to law, but objects to the alleged discrimination by the Government between the two organisations and to the making of public statements by leading members of the Government which, it is alleged, caused FETRABA to denounce its pact of unity with F.O.B.A. The Government declares that, while it encourages only the democratic trade unions, it has respected the right of workers of all tendencies to organise. Under the Labour Code of Costa Rica, however, no trade union organisation as such is a participant in disputes-a fact admitted by the complainant-because the dispute procedure laid down requires the formation of an ad hoc organisation representing at least  per cent of the workers in the undertaking, and a strike can be lawful only when this procedure has been followed. The Government admits that it intervened to mediate, although no provision for mediation by the administrative authorities is made in the law, and states that it hoped in this way to avoid the effects of a strike which would have been disastrous. In its first reply the Government states that it approached the leaders of the workers irrespective of their trade union affiliation. In its second reply, while adhering to the statement that it did not discriminate between trade union organisations but between leaders of the workers of different ideologies, the Government admits that, among other things, the President did state that the inter-union agreement was not a happy manoeuvre, as it linked F.O.B.A, which he called Communist, with FETRABA, which he called non-Communist. The Government denies that the measures it took had anything to do with the breaking of the pact of unity between the two federations.
.It would appear to be clear that the discrimination made by the Government in its mediation in the dispute-whether it was a discrimination between organisations, as the complainant alleges, or between individual persons on an ideological basis irrespective of their union affiliation, as the Government contends-raises an issue which was directly political in origin. In several earlier cases the Committee has been called upon to give a decision with regard to the application of measures which, although of a political nature and not intended to restrict trade union rights as such, might nevertheless affect the exercise of such rights. In the present case, while the Government contends that the action which it took involved no discrimination between trade unions, the Committee considers that it has before it precise allegations to the effect that, directly or indirectly, the action of the Government resulted in the leaders of a smaller organisation being consulted to the exclusion of the leaders of a larger one in a matter which was clearly of an occupational nature, and that it should, therefore, examine the substance of the allegations made.
.It would appear that the two federations, in order to secure the adherence to their strike movement within the law, made a pact which resulted in a united front representing more than  per cent of the workers concerned, and that this united front seems to have been regarded legally as an "" ad hoc association "" for the purposes of the disputes provisions of the Labour Code, because the Government has not refuted the claim that the strike which it proposed to call was authorised by the competent court.
.The Government contends that, when it mediated, it consulted leaders of the workers concerned irrespective of their trade union affiliation. Because of this, and because under the law trade unions are not parties to disputes, the Government argues that any discrimination between the persons with whom it chose to deal made on ideological grounds did not constitute a discrimination between trade unions. As it admits that its ideological considerations led it to regard it as sufficient to deal only with those leaders of the workers whom it considered to be "" inspired by sound democratic doctrine "" and stands by a public statement of the President that F.O.B.A is Communist and FETRABA non-Communist and that their fusion was an unhappy manoeuvre, it appears to the Committee that the natural consequence of this was that the leaders of the workers consulted by the Government in the mediation proceedings must of necessity have been leaders of FETRABA rather than of F.O.B.A.
.In these circumstances, the Committee draws attention to the fact that it is a generally accepted principle that workers should have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom and that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof and, also, that the law of the land should not be such as to impair, nor should it be so applied as to impair, these rights. Where a body representing the workers in a dispute is elected by those workers, the Committee considers that the right to elect their representatives in full freedom is restricted if some only of those representatives, on the basis of their political opinions, are chosen by a government as persons with whom it will deal in an effort to mediate in the dispute. Where the law of the land provides that the Government may address itself to those who appear to be the representatives of the workers of an undertaking and, in effect, to choose those with whom it will deal, any selection on such a political basis as to eliminate from those dealings, even indirectly, the leaders of the organisation most representative of the class of workers concerned would appear to result in the law of the land being so applied as to impair the right of the workers to choose their own representatives.
.In the present case, while it is contended by the complainant but denied by the Government that the Government's actions and public statements made by its members caused the pact of unity between the two federations to be denounced by one of them, it appears to be common ground that the solidarity of the workers in the dispute was not affected.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to draw the attention of the Government to the importance which it attaches to the principles expressed in paragraph  above, but to decide that, subject to this reservation, having regard to the fact that the complainants themselves do not appear to object to the law of the land as such with respect to trade union rights but only to the manner of its application by the Government for political reasons on a particular occasion, it would appear purposeless to examine the question further, and the case does not call for further examination.",-1,1955,Costa Rica
203,".The complaint presented directly to the I.L.O on  July  by the General Confederation of Costa Rican Workers alleges that the President of the Legislative Assembly of Costa Rica, an influential personality in the present Government, has laid before the Assembly a Bill which would prohibit an entire sector of the working class from performing official functions in trade union organisations.
.It is alleged that the Bill is contrary not only to the provisions of the Costa Rican Constitution but also to the principles enunciated in the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ). In particular, it brings into question the right to establish and join occupational organisations without previous authorisation, the right of workers' and employers' organisations to elect their representatives in full freedom without interference on the part of the public authorities, the guarantee provided against the dissolution or suspension of workers' or employers' organisations by administrative authority, the right to establish federations and Confederations and the right to affiliate with international organisations of workers and employers, etc.
.The complainant requests the I.L.O to intervene to persuade the executive authority to ensure that the Bill will not be submitted to the Legislative Assembly in the course of its extraordinary session, or, in the event of the Bill being adopted, to make use of its right of veto. The complaint is accompanied by a declaration presented to Parliament by the complaining organisation, in which it is alleged that the real purpose of the proposed enactment is to suppress those trade unions which are not affiliated to the Confederation of Labour Rerum Novarum, and by an issue of La Gaceta containing the text of the Bill.
.In accordance with paragraph  of the Ninth Report of the Committee on Freedom of Association, the Director-General informed the complaining organisation that any further information which it might care to present in substantiation of its complaint should be communicated to him within one month, but no further information has been received from the complaining organisation.ANALYSIS OF THE REPLY
.In its letter dated  September  the Government of Costa Rica states that the Bill criticised by the complainant was submitted to the Legislative Assembly by its President exercising the right to introduce Bills which is enjoyed by all Members of Parliament. Until such time as the Bill may be adopted by the Assembly the executive authority cannot pronounce upon it. At the present time the Bill is only in course of being examined by the Assembly.
.The essential allegation by the complainant relates to the submission to the Legislative Assembly, by one of its members, of a Bill which, if it should be adopted, would, according to the complainant, place several restrictions on freedom of association. The proposed enactment, the text of which is attached to the complaint, would in particular amend the Labour Code by forbidding persons who have been members of or sympathisers with any of the political parties prohibited by the Constitution or by Parliament to act as trade union officers. In addition, the Minister of Labour would have power to dissolve trade unions which did not comply with this provision. Persons who had been members of or sympathisers with the Communist Party could not join or represent a trade union. The fact that it had more than two members who were Communist sympathisers would justify the dissolution of a union, and the fact that it had not complied with a provision in the proposed enactment would render it liable to fairly serious penalties.
.The complainant maintains that the provisions in the Bill would constitute infringements of the right to organise guaranteed by the Constitution of Costa Rica at the national level and by the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) at the international level.
.The Government, without commenting on the substance of the provisions of the Bill, points out that, as it is simply a question of a Bill having been submitted to Parliament by one of its members in the exercise of his ordinary parliamentary functions (article  of the Constitution : "" the initiative in presenting Bills is a right of any member of the Legislative Assembly and, through the ministers, of the Executive ""), responsibility cannot be imputed to the Government. It is only after a Bill has been approved by Parliament that the Government can express its attitude towards it.
.In two previous cases (Case No.  : Belgium, and Case No.  : Federal Republic of Germany), in which allegations with respect to pending legislation came before it, the Committee took the view that it should take no action on the ground that the vagueness of the allegations concerning legislative intentions made in those cases, and the considerable uncertainty whether any action would in fact be taken at all, made it unprofitable to attempt to examine the allegations on their merits. At first sight, the position would appear to be different in the present case, because the complaining organisation has annexed to its complaint the text of the proposed enactment against which complaint is made.
.In the present case, as the Government observes, it is not a question of a proposed enactment introduced by the Government, as in Case No.  relating to Greece, but simply of a Bill presented by a Member of Parliament exercising his normal functions, which has not, for the moment, been adopted by Parliament. In these circumstances, while emphasising again the importance which it attaches to the principles that workers should have the right to join organisations of their own choosing and that their organisations should not be liable to be dissolved by administrative authority, but noting the assurance given by the Government that the Bill in question in the present case is not a Government proposal, the Committee, without prejudging any examination as to the merits which it might be called upon to make as the result of a further complaint being presented in the event of the Bill being adopted, considers that it would be premature for it to take any action on the present complaint.",0,1954,Costa Rica
