Any clause in an accord, collective agreement or standard which provides for the payment to a trade union by non-unionized workers of a confederation tax, assistance contribution, promotional contribution or suchlike shall be deemed to be in contravention of such freedom or right. Any provision that does not conform to this restriction is hereby declared null and void, and any sums irregularly withheld shall be returned to the workers concerned.' The complainants state that regional courts have issued rulings to the same effect. (They cite a number of regional court rulings declaring null and void the clauses of collective agreements that provide for the payment of assistance contributions by non-unionized workers, in which the MPT is cited as plaintiff.)\n.The complainants state that the evidence put forward shows that the rulings completely ignore the decisions adopted at general assemblies, which are the supreme, sovereign trade union bodies. The method adopted by the MPT is to convene the presidents of the trade unions for a hearing at the MPT, at which they are presented with a procedural adjustment agreement. Then, somewhere between blackmail and bullying, the union officials are pressured into signing the agreement, often without even a lawyer present to explain the situation or to defend them against the threat that they will be charged with all kinds of misdemeanours if they do not sign, and fined accordingly. These procedural adjustment agreements impose a number of commitments, such as not claiming contributions from members and non-members of the  trusteeship' of union activities. The complainants emphasize that the general meeting that authorizes the workers' representatives to engage in negotiations with the employers' organizations was attended by the workers in the industry and not only the union members, since all the workers benefit from the concessions obtained. For a union leader to go to the MPT and renounce these concessions without the consent of the rank and file is therefore absurd.\n.The complainants feel that this way of proceeding shows how weak the case is for arguing that the payment of a contribution violates freedom of association, since general meetings are open to all workers of the category concerned and every vote has the same weight as that of union members. Besides, all the concessions obtained over the years thanks to the efforts of the union benefit all the workers in the category, whether or not they attend the meetings and whether or not they are union members, which proves that the payment of an assistance contribution by all the workers, irrespective of union affiliation, is necessary for the smooth conduct of the discussions that unions engage in and in their efforts to defend the interests of a professional category.\n.The complainants add that the assistance contributions referred to are scheduled under article (e) of the Consolidated Labour Laws Act and are governed by collective agreements and union by-laws. Article  stipulates that it is a prerogative of the trade unions to require contributions from all workers of the economic or professional categories and of the liberal professions that they represent. For the complainants, the assistance contributions are clearly legitimate and are recognized in the Consolidated Labour Laws Act as well as in article  of the Constitution concerning collective labour agreements.\n.Moreover, they consider that the MPT is violating the sovereign right of the general meeting of workers' organizations to take such a decision, as they are legally protected under article .IV of the Constitution. The MPT s interference is a violation of freedom of association, in that it directly inhibits the ability of trade unions to adopt their own financial regulations and assure their financial viability. The judiciary and the MPT refuse to recognize that each union defends a whole category of workers, whether or not they are union members.\n.The complainants emphasize that unions in Brazil represent categories of workers, as laid down in article  of the Consolidated Labour Laws Act and article  of the Constitution. Representation by category presupposes that all the concessions and benefits obtained ' whether higher salaries or better working conditions ' are extended to all the workers concerned irrespective of union membership. This is a significant achievement, as it means that workers who cannot join trade unions because of their employers' opposition enjoy the same advantages as union members, thanks to the erga omnes effect of collective bargaining. The same, therefore, should apply to the unions' financial support, though the State authorities that the present complaint is directed at contend that the unions' costs should be borne only by their members. This is a source of anti-union discrimination which encourages affiliated workers to cancel their membership.\n.The anti-union practices engaged in by the MPT and by the judiciary are intended to undermine the decision of the workers' general meeting, whereas employers' organizations are at liberty to set whatever contributions they wish without any state interference. The complainants conclude by requesting the Committee to contemplate sending a direct contacts mission to collect information, engage a dialogue and help resolve the issues raised in the allegations.\n.With its communication dated  December , the Government attaches the observations of the MPT. Through its representative, the MPT states that under the Labour Laws Consolidation Act of  the main features of Brazil s labour legislation were: excessive state intervention in both legislative and administrative affairs, trade union monopoly with a mandatory  union tax'  severe restrictions on the right to strike, and the standard-setting power of the labour courts. The emphasis on the individual protection of workers' interests through the labour legislation meant that the collective protection of their interests by trade unions was given less importance. The political opening up that began in the years prior to the adoption of the  Constitution has to be seen from the standpoint of the country s external debt, the succession of economic crises and the pressure of the global market. The Government s response was to introduce measures to make labour law more flexible, and trade unions were expected to adapt to the new rules and regulations while at the same time avoiding the kind of abuses that could lead to a decline in working conditions at a time when the State was focusing on its economic woes. To be able to assume these new responsibilities, trade unions needed to be free and strong and their leaders had to adopt a fresh approach.\n.Brazil s  Constitution, based as it is on the dignity of the human person and on democratic principles, modified significantly the union structure that had existed for decades past. The MPT assumed a leading role in defending the workers' inalienable social and individual interests, especially their fundamental rights. So it is completely untrue, and contrary to the MPT s very mandate, to accuse it of violating a basic right such as freedom of association. According to the MPT, the complainant organizations are trying to do away with any kind of check that might be imposed on them in order to prevent some of their leaders from going off the rails.\n.The MPT asserts that article  of the Constitution guaranteed union autonomy vis--vis the State and protection from  negative' freedom of association, while maintaining the ban on the establishment of more than one union for each economic activity (i.e. the principle of trade union monopoly) as the basis of the union movement, the existence of federations and confederations as the higher level organizations and the levy of union membership dues in addition to the mandatory contribution required from all workers, irrespective of union membership. The maintenance of a trade union monopoly for each category and the introduction of a mandatory contribution were designed to prevent the break up and weakening of the Brazilian unions. However, this cannot continue indefinitely to be the juridical framework for trade unionism in Brazil, since it is not in conformity with the fundamental principles of freedom of association as laid down by the ILO. So long as the Constitution maintains the principle of trade union monopoly and of a mandatory contribution, there is always the possibility that unions will negotiate unfavourable conditions for the workers in exchange for special benefits for the union leaders and that membership dues will be used for the latter s personal benefit or to finance partisan political objectives.\n.The MPT explains that, in addition to state financing of the trade union movement by means of the mandatory contribution payable by all workers, unions continue to levy the union dues provided for in article .IV of the Constitution, as well as an assistance contribution. This was originally meant to function like the solidarity contribution that is found in some European countries, the idea being that non-unionized workers contribute to a union that negotiates better working conditions for them, i.e. an expression of their solidarity with union members and with the union itself in recognition of the services it renders. According to the Federal Supreme Court, which is the highest"", 'restrictions on collective bargaining\n.As regards this aspect of the case the Committee remarks that these restrictions were introduced into the legislation in  and . In this connection the Committee refers to the comments which the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has made for a number of years regarding the application of Convention No.  by Brazil. The comments refer in particular to sections  (as amended by Legislative Decree No.  of  February ) and  of the Consolidation of Labour Laws and section  of Act No.  of  June . These provisions, as mentioned by the complainants, establish the nullity of any clause of a collective agreement which is in direct or indirect contradiction with the Government\'s wages policy, and authorise the Government to appeal against judgements of the labour courts, with suspensory effect, in the event that the percentage of wage increase agreed upon exceeds that laid down by the executive. The Committee of Experts considered that these provisions might seriously affect the ""full development and utilisation of machinery for voluntary negotiation"" mentioned in Article  of Convention No. , ratified by Brazil. Furthermore, the Committee wishes to stress, in connection with Act No.  of  October  respecting the automatic adjustment of wages, as it has already done on many occasions with respect to Brazil and other countries, that if, as part of its stabilisation policy, a government considers that wage rates cannot be settled freely through collective bargaining, such a restriction should be imposed as an exceptional measure and only to the extent that it is necessary, without exceeding a reasonable period, and it should be accompanied by adequate safeguards to protect workers\' living standards.\n.More specifically, as regards section  of the Consolidation of Labour Laws, the Committee notes that a Government representative stated at the June  Session of the International Labour Conference that this provision had been removed from the draft Bill mentioned above.\n.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the dismissals which followed the strike in the metallurgy sector of Sao Paulo in March :(i) to draw the attention of the Government to the principles set forth in paragraph  above;(ii) to suggest that the Government might intervene with the managements of the undertakings concerned to obtain the reinstatement of workers dismissed only for having taken part in a strike which would conform with the principle that the right to strike is one of the essential means available to workers and their organisations to promote and defend their occupational interests;(b) as regards the death of Mr. Santos Dias da Silva:(i) to draw the attention of the Government to the principles set forth in paragraph  above and to note that an inquiry was made into the circumstances of his death and that the case is now before the courts;(ii) to deplore the climate of unrest which led to the violent death of a striking worker and to express the hope that the proceedings instituted before the courts will enable responsibilities to be determined;(iii) to request the Government to keep the Committee informed of the outcome of the judicial proceedings underway;(c) as regards the national trade union legislation and collective bargaining.(i) to draw the attention of the Government to the principles set forth in paragraphs  and  as regards the provisions in the legislation imposing state control over the operation of trade unions and collective bargaining which are incompatible with the principles of freedom of association;(ii) to express the hope that it will be possible to take measures for the final adoption of the draft Bill for the revision of the Consolidation of Labour Laws in order to bring the legislation into conformity with the principles of freedom of association;(d) more generally, to note that new complaints have been received regarding events which took place in the metallurgy sector of Sao Paulo in April and May  which will be examined by the Committee at its next session.\n.In communications dated respectively ,  and  March and  April , the National Labour Front (FNT), the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) and the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), presented complaints of violation of trade union rights in Brazil. WCL sent additional information in support of its complaint on  May . In the same communication it transmitted documentation sent to it by the National Labour Front and stated that it supported the complaint of that Organisation. The Government, for its part, sent its observations in a letter of  May .\n.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.The complaints of FNT, WFTU and CLAT, which were sent to the ILO by telegram, refer to the government decision to place under control the trade unions of the metallurgical and engineering industries of the State of Sao Paulo following a strike to obtain higher wages. CLAT also refers to dismissals affecting  workers.\n.In its letter of  March  WCL states that during collective bargaining in the metallurgical sector in Sao Bernardo do Campo, Santo Andr and Sao Caetano (all in the Sao Paulo industrial area), the employers\' representatives refused to grant a  per cent wage increase which, according to WCL, was merely an adjustment to make good the loss of purchasing power.\n.Following this refusal votes were taken in workers\' assemblies - certain of which were attended by over , persons - and it was decided to call a strike of unlimited duration beginning  March . The Government declared this move to be unlawful under legislation which, according to WCL, virtually denies the right to strike. Furthermore, continues the complainant organisation, although the strike spread to other major industrial centres of the State of Sao Paulo, such as Jundiai and Sao Jos dos Campos, the Government decided to place all the metalworkers\' unions of Sao Bernardo do Campo, Santo Andr and Sao Caetano under control.\n.WCL attaches to its letter of  May  a communication dated  April  addressed to the ILO by the National Labour Front and supported by the dismissed officials of the metalworkers unions of Sao Bernardo do Campo, Diadema and Santo Andr, the Metalworkers\' Union of Sao Paulo, the Union of Workers in the Metallurgical Industries of Osasco and  other Brazilian workers\' organisations in various sectors of activity.\n.The documents annexed to the communication of ENT indicate that there are certain weaknesses in the Brazilian legislation. Firstly, it does not provide for effective sanctions against undertakings which do not respect the law. Secondly, it establishes strict supervision of unions by the Ministry of Labour by allowing the Minister or his regional delegates to intervene in any organisation on any pretext whatsoever. Thirdly, the right to strike of workers is non-existent. Finally, as from , severance pay for older workers and stability of employment have been seriously affected by the creation of the ""length of service guarantee fund"", in that the guarantee of employment for trade union leaders is only temporary and that severance pay has been reduced without just cause.\n.The ENT documentation also points out that, despite the provisions of section  of the consolidation of Labour Laws, under which employers do not have the right to refuse to bargain, they systematically attempt to evade their obligations when serious matters are to be discussed. Moreover, when problems arising out of collective agreements are brought before the labour courts, these do not examine the questions raised or confine themselves to applying the wage increases decided by the executive.\n.As regards the labour dispute to which the complaints refer, it is stated that the trade unions in which the Ministry of Labour has intervened are geographically based in the seven centres of Greater Sao Paulo, where the automobile industry is concentrated.\n.The document also states that a survey had been carried out by the Inter-Union Department of Socio-economic Studies and Statistics, a body set up by the unions. This survey had established that, in order to ensure the maintenance of the workers\' purchasing powers, wages should be increased by . per cent. In order to obtain this compensation certain trade unions made unsuccessful appeals to the courts and others, including those mentioned in the complaints, exerted pressure from the rank and file, with or without strikes, and thus obtained partial payment of the . per cent increase by direct agreement with the employers or their organisations. Thus, in May and July , the Union of Workers in the Metallurgical, Engineering and Electrical Equipment Industries of Sao Bernardo do Campo and Diadema and the Union of Machinery Industries of the State of Sao Paulo concluded agreements for an  per cent increase which was to be permanently incorporated into the wage and which might not be deducted from future adjustments.\n.In February  further negotiations took place.', ""authority for interpreting the Constitution, union dues are not strictly speaking a tax and can therefore be levied only on a union s members. The assistance contribution was examined by the Higher Labour Court, the country s highest labour court, which decided that it should be paid by union members (standard No.  mentioned above and case law guideline No.  relating to collective labour disputes). The case law cited was not intended to restrict the ability of trade unions to defend the workers but, on the contrary, sprang from the need to prevent the practice frequently indulged in by certain  shadow' trade unions which have no members, serve merely as a screen for obtaining financial resources, have no commitment to the rank and file and can easily be manipulated by enterprises to make the provisions of labour law more flexible.\n.The MPT states that, there are of course a significant number of militant representative trade unions that call strikes and obtain concessions for the workers. When the MPT comes across practices or clauses that contravene the laws and regulations in force, some of its attorneys feel duty bound to enforce compliance in line with the interpretation handed down by the courts. Often it is the workers themselves (who pay their assistance or compulsory contribution through the MPT where the collective labour agreements are registered) who request the MPT s intervention. In these cases the MPT is simply following the court s guidelines. Currently, the MPT s officials are trying to introduce a process of formal dialogue with the trade unions to resolve the various issues surrounding the proper exercise of freedom of association.\n.The MPT states that on  May , a National Coordinating Body for the Promotion of Freedom of Association (CONALIS) was set up with the participation of representatives of the MPT s units throughout the country. One of the CONALIS' strategic objectives is to guarantee freedom of association and to resolve collective labour disputes. For the MPT, a genuinely democratic society is possible only if all sectors comply with the principles embodied in the Constitution, and especially with one as important as the matter of labour relations. Hence, the need for the MPT to contribute to the democratization of the trade union movement and for its strategy of strengthening both the organizations themselves and the collective bargaining process and of striving to eliminate anti-union discrimination. On  August , CONALIS held its first nationwide meeting, which the presidents of all the trade union confederations were invited to attend. Participants were thus able to express their views on what the movement, as a whole, expected from the new body and on the MPT s handling of the whole issue since its creation. Through this process of dialogue a large number of contacts and meetings were organized with the leaders of the union confederations to discuss a broad range of issues, including the assistance contribution, the banning of strikes and the threats on the lives of union officials.\n.The MPT emphasizes that it has been discussing a range of issues of concern to the workers and to society by promoting ongoing social dialogue and holding bipartite or tripartite meetings before it reaches its decisions. It considers that the complaint under examination is extremely important, as it provides the ILO with an overall picture of the problem of trade unionism in Brazil. The State must, at all times, consider the consequences of its actions and make sure that it is achieving its goals, even if this means reviewing its approach in the matter. Unless there is a change of culture in the trade union movement and a change of perspective by its leaders, it is the workers themselves who will suffer most. The complaint under examination could serve as a means of convincing union leaders to agree to Brazil s ratification of Convention No. , which the unions' opposition has so far unfortunately prevented from taking place.\n.In its communication dated  October , the Government states that great progress has been achieved for the working class and that employment and growth are at record highs every month. It indicates that these achievements are the fruit of the struggle of workers, represented by their unions, who sought to avoid lay-offs in times of crisis and to obtain better working conditions.\n.The Government adds that the single paragraph of article  of the Federal Constitution of Brazil states that the power emanates from the people and will be exercised on its behalf. For this reason, the constituents who drafted the Federal Constitution in  were supported by the popular vote and were required to draft a democratic constitution that takes into account the immediate and medium-term needs of the Brazilian people. Thus, the provisions on freedom of association and unity, which restrict the territorial base to at least a municipality, aim to prevent the formation of trade unions against the interests of workers and weaken the combative entities. In the same vein, article  of the Constitution provides several progressive measures, such as the prohibition of intervention and state interference in trade union affairs, freedom of association ' maintaining trade union unity at the territorial level corresponding to at least one municipality, compulsory trade union dues to continue to ensure the independence of unions and the recognition of the right to strike and the trade right to officials.\n.Regarding the assistance contributions, the Government indicates that it is not a tax, since, if that had been the case, workers would not have been able to oppose it. The Government acknowledges the existence of conflicts in relation to such contributions and reaffirms its willingness to improve the dialogue with the unions and organizations representing employers in order to find a legal mechanism to effectively regulate this matter. The Government states that, in the framework of the National Labour Forum (FNT), the creation of a negotiated contribution has been proposed, pursuant to which all workers in the same category should pay in case of concluding a collective agreement, thereby eliminating the compulsory contribution in the Constitution. The Government states that, due to lack of consensus and the fact that this issue is a source of conflict in itself, this proposal was not acted upon. The Government adds that, in order to refine and strengthen democracy in industrial relations, it proposed the creation of a Council of Industrial Relations of tripartite composition where these types of issues could be examined.\n.The Committee observes that the complainant organizations raise objections to the measures adopted by the MPT and to the decisions handed down by the judiciary revoking clauses in collective agreements with respect to the payment of assistance contributions by all workers covered by an agreement, including non-unionized workers, because of the erga omnes effect of collective bargaining. They also allege that the Office of the Public Prosecutor of So Paulo has initiated legal proceedings to prevent trade unions from engaging in protest action.\n.The Committee notes that the Government has sent the observations of the MPT, whose representative states that: () under the Labour Laws Consolidation Act of , the main features of Brazil s labour regulations were: excessive state intervention in both legislative and administrative affairs, trade union monopoly with a mandatory  union tax'  severe restrictions on the right to strike, and the standard-setting power of the labour courts; () the political opening-up that began in the years prior to the adoption of the  Constitution have to be seen from the standpoint of the country s external debt, successive economic crises and the pressure of the global market and, consequently, measures have been introduced to make labour law more flexible and trade unions are expected to adapt to the new rules and regulations while at the same time avoiding the kind of abuses that could lead to a decline in working conditions at a time when the State was focusing on its economic woes; () if they are to assume their new responsibilities, trade unions need to be free and strong and their leaders have to adopt a fresh approach; () Brazil s  Constitution, based as it is on the dignity of the human person and on democratic principles, modified significantly the union structure that had existed for decades past; () the MPT has assumed a leading role in defending the workers' inalienable social and individual interests, especially their fundamental rights, and so it is completely untrue, and contrary to the MPT s very mandate, to accuse it of violating a right as fundamental as freedom of association; () the maintenance of a trade union monopoly for each category and the introduction of a mandatory contribution were designed to prevent the break up and weakening of the Brazilian unions, but this cannot continue indefinitely to be the juridical framework for trade unionism in Brazil, since it is not in conformity with the fundamental principles of freedom of association as laid down by the ILO; () with the maintenance of trade union monopoly and of a""]"
