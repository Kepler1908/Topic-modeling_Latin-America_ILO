0,".The complaint is contained in a communication dated  January  from Education International (EI) and the Teachers' Union of the Autonomous National University of Honduras (SIDUNAH).
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  July .
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communication dated  January , EI and SIDUNAH allege that: (i) the Autonomous National University of Honduras (UNAH), an autonomous state institution, refuses to recognize the legal existence of SIDUNAH for the purposes of representing all the teaching staff who work at UNAH; and (ii) refuses to transfer to it the sums of money corresponding to the union dues deducted from all teaching staff. The complainants report that: (i) SIDUNAH was established in  and its recognition by the Secretary of State in the Department of Labour and Social Security was published on  January ; and (ii) on  April  a request was submitted to UNAH for it to transfer the union dues to SIDUNAH from that point on, a request that was allegedly denied by UNAH.
.The complainants note that, in light of the refusal of the university authorities to recognize SIDUNAH as a trade union and to transfer to it the funds corresponding to the union dues deducted from the university teachers, SIDUNAH lodged an appeal for amparo (remedy for the protection of constitutional rights) with the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice and that, by means of a ruling dated  July , the Court ordered UNAH to recognize SIDUNAH and to transfer to it the union dues deducted from the teachers since April .
.The complainants allege that the university authorities did not comply with this sentence and they therefore requested that an executing officer be appointed, in accordance with articles  and  of the Constitutional Justice Act, a request that was granted and the Supreme Court appointed an executing officer and a court order was obtained for the seizure of the funds relating to the period from April  to  October  from the Central Bank of Honduras. The complainants note that they are requesting the same procedure for the seizure of the funds corresponding to the union dues from  November  to  December , although that request is allegedly being stalled by the Central Bank, which appears to be conspiring with the university authorities and the other trade union involved.
.In a communication dated  July , the Government noted that on  April , SIDUNAH submitted a document to UNAH stating that it had legal recognition and requested that the deductions of union dues, from the teachers who work at that institution, be transferred to it (request logged as administrative file No. SG-UEA---). The Government notes that by means of documents dated  and  April , the rector s office of UNAH requested SIDUNAH to correct a number of deficiencies and, in accordance with the provisions of article  of the Labour Code, to, among other things, provide accreditation for the teachers by means of their respective original signed membership applications, along with a copy that can be duly checked, as well as a certified extract of the records of the meeting held by the members of SIDUNAH, in which, by majority vote, they request UNAH to take a deduction from the wages of the affiliated workers and to make available to the union the ordinary and extraordinary dues that they are required to contribute.
.The Government notes that, even though on  July , SIDUNAH partially corrected the things that had been requested of it, it did not comply with the aforementioned, therefore, on  October , UNAH decided to shelve the proceedings. The Government also notes that: (i) on  October , SIDUNAH appealed that ruling and requested that it be declared partially void; (ii) on  November , SIDUNAH requested the rector's office of UNAH to send certification that it had given implied consent (article  of the Administrative Proceedings Act, which provides that: ""The silence of the Administration shall have the effect of a declaration of presumed intent, only in such cases in which the Act gives it a positive or negative effect""); (iii) on  November , the rector's office decided that it should refer back to what had been decided on  October (that is, to shelve the proceedings); (iv) on  November , SIDUNAH submitted a document entitled ""Document certifying that implied consent has been given in its favour"" (which was received by the secretariat of the University Council on  December ); and (v) on  July , the Legal Department issued a report on the matter.
.The Government notes that on  March , SIDUNAH lodged an appeal for amparo (remedy for the protection of constitutional rights) before the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice and that on  July , the Court issued its ruling granting amparo having considered that implied consent had been given and ""that, having detected an infringement of the right to petition, of the right to defence and, as a result, to due process, the teachers belonging to SIDUNAH were granted amparo, in order that their right to due administrative process be restored to them, providing them with the certification of implied consent, because it had been proven that there had been no response for more than two years, which gave rise to the legal effect of a positive reply to the request"". The Government notes that the Court ordered UNAH to recognize SIDUNAH and its board of directors and to proceed with the transfer of the sums of money corresponding to the deductions for ordinary and extraordinary union dues from April  until the date of the ruling.
.According to the Government, in compliance with this ruling, on  January , the rector s office of UNAH ordered the recognition of SIDUNAH and ordered the general secretariat to request SIDUNAH to submit union membership rolls, which should be accompanied by a signed authorization and the fingerprint, employee number and identity number of each member, for the purposes of the salary deductions. The executive secretariat for staff development was also ordered to implement the deductions for SIDUNAH members, in accordance with the lists submitted.
.The Government indicates that: (i) SIDUNAH believed that the sentence had not been wholly complied with and requested the Constitutional Chamber to appoint an executing officer to ensure that the sentence was carried out; and (ii) the Court appointed an executing officer, without overseeing their work or defining the procedures to follow for accomplishing their mandate (article  of the Constitutional Justice Act) and that, in view of such an omission by the Court, UNAH was subjected to serious and irreparable damages as a result of the arbitrary and discretionary actions taken liberally by the executing officer who, going beyond the scope of the ruling, illegally requested that the executive board of SIDUNAH join the governing body of UNAH, that the executive board of SIDUNAH be relieved of their academic duties, that physical spaces be assigned to the union, that the total number of teaching staff at UNAH be determined, and required payment and seized UNAH property in the amount of  million lempiras, which corresponds to the period from April  to December  (and not to July , as per the ruling), making arbitrary use of the list of all teachers at UNAH, ignoring the fact that not all of them are members of SIDUNAH, and as a result the ruling that they were instructed to carry out did not cover all of them. The Government notes that the funds were seized from the UNAH budget intended for the execution of its constitutional mandate to further higher education in the country, and not that corresponding to the union dues deducted from the salaries of teachers who are members of SIDUNAH.
.The Government notes that on  June , UNAH requested that the Court completely void the proceedings since the ruling appointing the executing officer and all of their actions, for having violated due process and having omitted to define the proceedings as laid down in article  of the Constitutional Justice Act, and due to the excesses of the executing officer in carrying out their mandate. The Government notes that UNAH has proposed that the declaration that implied consent had been given does not in itself give automatic authorization to what SIDUNAH had requested, since it is still necessary to comply with the requirements of the relevant norms, in this case, those contained in article  of the Labour Code. The Government notes that UNAH had not taken deductions from members of SIDUNAH, since they had not been accredited and had not submitted union membership rolls or the duly signed authorizations, accompanied by the fingerprints, employee number and identity number of every member of SIDUNAH for the purpose of the deduction from",1,2021,Honduras
1,"their salary of ordinary and extraordinary dues.
.The Government highlights that SIDUNAH s request and aim has always been to have transferred to it the amount corresponding to the deductions for union dues and contributions already credited to UNAH s other union, the Union of Workers of the Autonomous National University of Honduras (SITRAUNAH), which was founded in  and is comprised of workers from different sections of the university, from various professions, offices and specialities. The Government notes that, according to the meeting records,  members of SIDUNAH had resigned their membership of SITRAUNAH. The Government highlights that such resignations, in accordance with the provisions of articles  and  of the Labour Code, are very personal acts that should be carried out with the union that the person is a member of, or with their employer, and not at a meeting of another union, since they are required to notify their employer in writing. The Government notes that SIDUNAH claims to represent all university teachers and not only its members, which is an abuse of its right and violates the freedom of association of the teachers who are not members of SIDUNAH, that is to say, their freedom to freely and voluntarily decide whether or not to join that trade union. The Government notes that both the Secretary of State in the Department of Labour and Social Security and UNAH agree that SIDUNAH only represents those members who have joined the trade union, and not all teachers, as has been claimed.
.The Committee observes that in this case the complainants allege that UNAH refuses to recognize SIDUNAH and to transfer to it the sums of money corresponding to the union dues deducted from university teachers. They allege that, although in  the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice granted SIDUNAH its appeal for amparo (remedy for the protection of constitutional rights) and ordered UNAH to recognize it and transfer to it sums corresponding to the union dues deducted from the teachers since April , UNAH did not comply, and therefore they requested the appointment of an executing officer, who seized the amount corresponding to the period from April  to  October  and is currently in the process of requesting the seizure for the period from November  to December , which is being stalled by the Central Bank.
.The Committee notes that in this regard the Government indicates that: (i) the request that SIDUNAH made on  April  for UNAH to recognize it and transfer to it the union dues had deficiencies and although it partially corrected the things that had been requested, it did not comply with several requests and therefore UNAH shelved the proceedings; (ii) on  October , SIDUNAH appealed that ruling and submitted a document stating that implied consent had been given in its favour; (iii) in its ruling on  July , the Court considered that implied consent had been given and ordered UNAH to recognize SIDUNAH and transfer to it the amount corresponding to the dues deducted from April  until the date of the ruling; (iv) in compliance with that, on  January , the rector s office of UNAH ordered the recognition of SIDUNAH and the implementation of deductions for members of SIDUNAH, in accordance with the membership rolls that the union would have to submit; (v) the Court did not oversee the work of the executing officer, who acted in an arbitrary and discretionary manner, going beyond the scope of the ruling and, among other things, seized UNAH property in the amount of  million lempiras, corresponding to the period from  to  (not what the ruling ordered) and using the list of all university teachers, many of whom belong to a different union, SITRAUNAH, causing UNAH serious and irreparable damages; and (vi) on  June , UNAH requested that all the proceedings since the appointment of the executing officer be declared void.
.The Committee notes that in its  ruling the Constitutional Chamber focused on the question of whether implied consent had been given and concluded that, since more than two years had passed and the State had not provided a response, that entailed approval of what SIDUNAH had requested in .
.The Committee notes that, according to the documentation provided, on the one hand is SITRAUNAH, the company or primary union, comprised of workers from different sections of the university, from various professions, offices and specialities, and on the other hand is SIDUNAH, which is an occupation-based trade union, which is to say that it is comprised of individuals who share the same profession, trade or speciality. The Committee notes that in the document that SIDUNAH presented to UNAH on  April , it is stated that because it is an occupation-based organization, it brings together and represents all the teaching staff who work at UNAH. It also states that SIDUNAH does not include UNAH s administrative and service staff  who have always been represented by the other union organization in which no teacher has had any participation due to the hegemony established by a group of administrative workers'  The Committee notes that in a report written by the Secretary of State in the Department of Labour and Social Security, dated  March , annexed to the Government s reply, they note that SIDUNAH represents its members and not all the teachers, as it had claimed. In that regard, the Committee recalls that workers in public or private universities shall have the right to establish organizations and to join them, [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , para. ] and in this case the teachers can choose to join whichever organization that they deem suitable.
.On the other hand, the Committee notes that article  of the Labour Code provides that, in order for there to be deductions of ordinary dues, the union must provide the company with, among other documents, the membership roll for those from whom deductions are to be made, which, according to the Government, have not been submitted to UNAH. In that regard, recalling that both legislation which imposes accreditation or proof of affiliation of members of the trade union for their union dues to be deducted from their wages, and legislation which stipulates that it suffices for a union to submit a list of members for the union dues to be deducted, are compatible with Convention No , the Committee trusts that, once the requirements established in the legislation have been complied with, UNAH will transfer to SIDUNAH the sums of money corresponding to the union dues that have been deducted from those of its members that have requested it. Noting that an appeal lodged by UNAH is pending resolution, and regretting that a request made by SIDUNAH almost a decade ago has not materialized, the Committee trusts that the Constitutional Chamber will soon rule and expects the Government to promote constructive dialogue between UNAH and SIDUNAH in the interests of contributing to the establishment of harmonious labour relations.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee trusts that, once the requirements established in the legislation have been complied with, the Autonomous National University of Honduras (UNAH) will transfer to the Teachers' Union of the Autonomous National University of Honduras (SIDUNAH) the sums of money corresponding to the union dues that have been deducted from those of its members that have requested it.(b)	The Committee trusts that the Constitutional Chamber will soon rule on the Appeal that has been lodged by UNAH and expects the Government to promote constructive dialogue between UNAH and SIDUNAH in the interests of contributing to the establishment of harmonious labour relations.(c)	The Committee considers that this case does not call for further examination and is closed.",1,2021,Honduras
2,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the Union of Workers of the sugar, honey, alcohol and similar industries in Honduras (SITIAMASH) dated  January  and communications from the Single Confederation of Workers of Honduras (CUTH) dated  May and  November .
.The Government of Honduras sent its observations regarding the allegations in communications dated  August  and  January .
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In a communication dated  January , SITIAMASH states that, following a decision made by both organizations, the Union of Workers of the northern sugar refineries and allied workers in the Guanchias sector (SITRAZUNOSASG) and SITIAMASH agreed to merge, with the first trade union, established in an enterprise and its subsidiaries (hereafter the group trade union), becoming a branch of SITIAMASH, an industry-level union. In this respect, the organization adds that: (i) SITIAMASH, established in , is the main trade union for sugar workers in the country and is an affiliate of the Single Federation of Workers of Honduras, the Single Confederation of Workers of Honduras (CUTH) and the International Union of Food, Agricultural, Hotel, Restaurant, Catering, Tobacco and Allied Workers' Associations; (ii) the merger respected all the internal processes of both organizations, as well as the respective administrative processes, as noted in Resolution No. / of  March  issued by the State Secretariat of the Labour and Social Security Departments (STSS); (iii) under the merger, SITIAMASH and the group trade union agreed on the goal of  concluding collective agreements to ensure a decent and dignified life for sugar workers and fighting for the existence of only one collective agreement between workers and employers in the Honduran sugar industry'  and (iv) with the backing of the labour inspector and the legal representative responsible for the merger, the enterprise Azunosa (hereafter  the enterprise'  was informed of the merger in question, so that it could take the necessary steps, especially with regard to collective bargaining and the deduction of union dues in the enterprise.
.The complainant organization goes on to indicate that, on  December , the group trade union notified the STSS of its unilateral separation from SITIAMASH. In this respect, the complainant organization states that: (i) at no time was SITIAMASH informed of this separation process, which is not provided for in the labour legislation; (ii) in violation of the labour legislation, the labour administration, through Resolution No. / of  December , immediately registered the separation without any administrative processes having been undertaken and without demanding the fulfilment of all the requirements and processes that had been put in place during the merger; and (iii) the labour administration proceeded to immediately recognize a new executive committee of the group trade union.
.The complainant organization also alleges that: (i) the workers who opposed the separation were dismissed; (ii) the enterprise did not agree to receive a visit from the labour inspector following the complaint filed by SITIAMASH alleging the illegality of the separation and the dismissals; (iii) the enterprise never fulfilled its obligation to send SITIAMASH the union dues of unionized workers following the merger concluded on  March ; (iv) in this context, the President of SITIAMASH has been followed and his place of residence has been under surveillance; and (v) the lawyer appointed by SITIAMASH to undertake the administrative and legal action related to the trade union merger process and the aforementioned dismissals was the victim of an attack on  January  during which her car and place of residence were shot at several times, luckily she avoided physical injury.
.In a communication dated  May , the CUTH provided additional information on the allegations presented by SITIAMASH. The CUTH stated specifically that: (i) the merger of the group trade union and SITIAMASH, officially registered by the labour administration on  March , resulted from a decision by the group trade union s general assembly on  August , which did not face any opposition from the enterprise or the labour administration at that time; (ii) as a result of the merger, the group trade union had become the Guanchias branch of SITIAMASH; (iii) on  May , the Guanchias branch of SITIAMASH presented the enterprise with a list of demands concerning all workers who performed their work on the enterprise s premises, including workers directly employed by the enterprise and those employed though third-party companies; (iv) as noted in several inspection reports, the enterprise refused to engage in the dialogue that was repeatedly requested by SITIAMASH; (v) in violation of the legislation, the labour administration refused to appoint a mediator, as had been requested by SITIAMASH; (vi) on  November , the enterprise, with the collusion of some workers occupying positions of trust and without seeking avenues for negotiation with SITIAMASH, established a parallel executive committee of the defunct group trade union, claiming that it had been appointed by the union s general assembly, although the union had already merged with SITIAMASH, in accordance with the wishes of that general assembly; (vii) subsequently, the new parallel executive committee, without the permission of the general assembly, initiated a separation process, without duly notifying SITIAMASH and unbeknownst to the members of its Guanchias branch; (viii) the enterprise negotiated five collective agreements with the aforementioned executive committee within three months, which were registered by the STSS as agreements with companies subcontracted by the enterprise; (ix) on  July , the enterprise dismissed Gustavo Alberto Quiroz Baquedano, Francisco Enrique Mendoza Canales, Rubn Daro Umanzor, Maynor Jos Ponce, Rony Alexis Cruz and Jos Magdaleno Bentez, all workers who were members of the executive committee of the Guanchias branch of SITIAMASH; (x) almost two years after the filing of a complaint regarding the violation of the trade union rights of the aforementioned trade union leaders, they are still waiting for the penalties provided for in the Labour Inspection Act to be imposed; (xi) the members of the Guanchias branch of SITIAMASH have been subject to coercion, threats of dismissal and offers of employment and economic benefits to leave their union and join the union orchestrated by the enterprise, and a permanent campaign of intimidation has been maintained with armed security guards stationed in the work areas in order to monitor and harass members of the Guanchias branch; and (xii) on  August , a request was filed with the STSS to oppose the registration of the aforementioned collective agreements on the grounds that the group trade union lacked legal representativeness and was a union sponsored by the employer.
.In view of the above, the complainant alleges that: (i) since the group trade union was legally and duly merged with SITIAMASH, the election of a new executive committee of the defunct group trade union constitutes a mechanism for the creation of a parallel union, running counter to the interests of the workers as expressed in the assembly that authorized the merger of the unions; and (ii) the election of the executive committee of the trade union sponsored by the enterprise and parallel to the Guanchias branch of SITIAMASH and the registration of collective agreements were illegal administrative acts because SITIAMASH was never summoned by either the group trade union or the STSS and the negotiation of the collective agreements was carried out in absence of the Guanchias branch of SITIAMASH.
.In a communication dated  November , the CUTH alleges an escalation of the harassment, intimidation, threats and persecution against the senior members of the SITIAMASH branch present in the enterprise. The CUTH alleges in particular: (i) the unjustified dismissal on  October  of Carlos Rivera, Secretary-General of the branch of SITIAMASH in the enterprise; and (ii) threats of dismissal against the other workers of the enterprise who maintained their membership of SITIAMASH.
.In a communication dated  November , the Government indicates that the State of Honduras respects Conventions Nos  and  and refrains from acts of interference of any kind into trade unions' activities. The Government specifically indicates that: (i) the STSS registered the merger of the group trade union and SITIAMASH through Resolution No. / of  March  and that the relevant information can be found in the archives of the General Labour Directorate in the Department of Civil Organizations; (ii) however, the archives of this office do not contain a record of the locations in which SITIAMASH has branches; (iii) there is no evidence in the General Labour Directorate of the withdrawal of the legal personality of the group trade union, and this legal personality therefore remains valid; (iv) on  November , Mr Montenegro Orellana appeared before the General Labour Directorate to notify it of the new executive committee of the group trade union; (v) as the public authorities must refrain from any interference which would restrict the right of the organizations to organize their administration, the General Labour Directorate took note of the",1,2020,Honduras
3,"new executive committee of the group trade union through Resolution No. / of  December ; (v) the executive committee of the group trade union notified the General Labour Directorate through a notarized communication of  December  of the union s decision to separate from SITIAMASH; and (vi) in an order dated  January  the General Labour Directorate acknowledged the decision of the union and, owing to the nature of the request and in strict respect for trade union independence, did not initiate any administrative procedures.
.The Government states that the group trade union registered and concluded six collective agreements with different enterprises (Servicios Agrcolas de Soldaduras y Derivados de Montajes Estructuras Metlicas; Empresa Agrcola EMMODEI; Servicios Mltiples Tilos; Empresa de Operaciones de Industrias Metlicas; Servicios Mltiples Martnez; and Empresa Agrcola (ESAO)). The Government indicates that three of these collective agreements prompted SITIAMASH to file an appeal, and these appeals are currently being processed under the applicable administrative procedures. Insofar as the collective bargaining was undertaken through direct arrangements, the STSS never intervened in the bargaining process between the group trade union and the enterprises. Lastly, the Government adds that the alleged dismissals of senior members of SITIAMASH and the alleged persecution of that organization s President are currently being investigated and that it is not aware of the aspects of the allegations related to trade union dues.
.In a communication dated  January , the Government confirms that the merger between the group trade union and SITIAMASH was the result of a decision of the general assembly of the group trade union of  August , which was registered by the labour administration on  March . The Government stresses that this merger represents an exclusive action of the trade union. Regarding the allegations that the STSS denied SITIAMASH s request to appoint a mediator to begin negotiations with the enterprise on the list of demands presented by SITIAMASH, the Government states that the applicants did not fulfil the legal requirements to initiate a mediation process, as it is necessary to demonstrate that the direct settlement stage has expired.
.With respect to the registration of the new executive committee of the group trade union, the Government reiterates that, although the STSS was notified of the merger of the aforementioned union with SITIAMASH, the withdrawal of the legal personality of the group trade union did not appear in the archives of the General Labour Directorate, for this reason it could not deny the request to register the new executive committee. The Government adds that, with regard to the collective agreements concluded by the group trade union, the STSS did not participate in any way and, in accordance with the principle of good faith and collective autonomy, limited itself to registering the collective agreements concluded, as they complied with the law.
.The Government reiterates that it also limited itself to taking note of the group trade union s decision to separate from SITIAMASH, proving that the STSS did not interfere in any trade union. The Government states that, in this case, the separation is indicative of a conflict within the trade union, and the resolution of this type of conflict is the responsibility of the conciliation and arbitration boards.
.With regard to the dismissals of the members of the executive committee of the Guanchias branch of SITIAMASH, the Government states that, under section  of the Labour Code, the violation of trade union immunity must be proven before the competent labour court. The Government adds that the complainant organization contradicts itself as, on the one hand, it indicates that the labour inspectorate verified the above-mentioned dismissals and, on the other hand, it alleges delays in the action of the STSS. In relation to the allegations of coercion and threats against the members of the Guanchias branch of SITIAMASH, the Government states that the complainants have not indicated precisely who has perpetrated coercion and in what way.
.The Committee notes that this case refers to allegations of the violation of freedom of association and collective bargaining in an enterprise in the sugar sector in connection with the merger between a trade union present in an enterprise in the sector and its subsidiaries (hereafter the group trade union) with an industry-level trade union, SITIAMASH. The Committee notes the complainant organizations' allegations of: (i) the establishment of a parallel trade union with close ties to enterprise through the irregular registration of the executive committee of the group trade union, even though the union had already merged with SITIAMASH, and subsequently through the irregular separation of the group trade union from SITIAMASH; (ii) the obstruction of the collective bargaining undertaken by the branch of SITIAMASH and the irregular registration of collective agreements concluded by the new executive committee of the group trade union; (iii) the dismissal of the leaders of the branch of SITIAMASH and its Secretary-General; and (iv) threats and acts of anti-union violence against the President of SITIAMASH and the lawyer advising the organization. The Committee also notes that the Government states that it fully respects trade union independence, the labour administration has not carried out any act of interference in favour of any of the unions involved in this case and the labour inspectorate has fulfilled its obligations with respect to the allegations.
.With respect to the relationship between the group trade union and SITIAMASH, the Committee notes that, on the basis of the information provided by the parties, the following chronology of events can be inferred: (i) on  August , the general assembly of the group trade union decided to merge with SITIAMASH; (ii) this merger was registered by the labour administration in a resolution of  March ; (iii) on  May , the branch of SITIAMASH presented a list of demands to the enterprise related to the terms and conditions of employment of all workers who performed work on the enterprise s premises; (iv) in November , the STSS was notified of an executive committee of the group trade union that had merged with SITIAMASH and registered it through Resolution No. / of  December ; (v) on  December , the group trade union notified the STSS of its separation from SITIAMASH, the labour administration took note of this decision through an order of  January ; and (vi) over the following months, the group trade union concluded a series of collective agreements with various companies contracted by the enterprise.
.The Committee notes the complainant organizations' allegations that: (i) the reactivation of the group trade union with workers occupying positions of trust in the enterprise had the effect of establishing, with the support of the labour administration, a trade union controlled by the enterprise, parallel to the branch of SITIAMASH; (ii) the labour administration should not have registered the new executive committee of the group trade union because that organization had not existed since its merger with SITIAMASH; and (iii) the separation process of the group trade union, of which SITIAMASH was not informed and which was immediately registered by the labour administration, had not been subjected to the requirements that had accompanied the merger process between the two trade unions.
.The Committee notes the Government s indications that: (i) although the labour administration had a record of the merger between the group trade union and SITIAMASH, it did not have a record of the withdrawal of the legal personality of the group trade union or the locations in which SITIAMASH had branches; (ii) in accordance with the principle of non-interference, the Government had limited itself to registering the different decisions that had been sent by the trade unions; (iii) the labour administration was informed of the decision of the general assembly of the group trade union to separate from SITIAMASH; and (iv) owing to the nature of the request it had received and with strict respect for trade union independence, the labour administration took note of this decision and did not initiate any type of administrative procedure in that respect.
.The Committee observes that, in view of the foregoing, there is a controversy regarding the legitimacy and the validity of the appointment of the executive committee of the group trade union following its merger with SITIAMASH and the separation of the group trade union from the industry-level union. The Committee observes the Government s consideration that the situation in question reflects the existence of a conflict within a trade union, while the complainant organizations allege that it demonstrates the existence of interference aimed at facilitating the establishment of a union controlled by the enterprise, in a context of anti-union acts against senior members of SITIAMASH. The Committee recalls on the one hand, that it has emphasized the fundamental principle of workers being able to join organizations of their own choosing and of the enterprise not interfering in favour of a trade union and that respect for the principles of freedom of association requires that the public authorities exercise great restraint in relation to intervention in the internal affairs of trade unions. It is even",0,2020,Honduras
4,"more important that employers exercise restraint in this regard. They should not, for example, do anything which might seem to favour one group within a union at the expense of another [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , paras  and ]. The Committee recalls on the other hand, that it has considered that the Committee is not competent to make recommendations on internal dissentions within a trade union organization, so long as the government does not intervene in a manner which might affect the exercise of trade union rights and the normal functioning of an organization and that when internal disputes arise in a trade union organization they should be resolved by the persons concerned (for example, by a vote), by appointing an independent mediator with the agreement of the parties concerned, or by intervention of the judicial authorities [see Compilation, paras  and ]. While noting that it has not been informed of initiatives aimed at finding an internal solution for the organizations in question, the Committee observes that the annexes provided by the complainant organizations show that SITIAMASH took court action to have the group trade union dissolved. The Committee therefore requests the Government and the complainant organizations to provide information on the results of that action, and on other potential court action that SITIAMASH might have initiated in connection to the allegations of irregularities made by the complainant organizations in relation to the separation of the group trade union from SITIAMASH.
.With respect to the allegations regarding the collective bargaining with the enterprise and its subsidiaries, the Committee notes the complainant organization s assertions that: (i) the enterprise has refused to discuss the list of demands presented by SITIAMASH in May  with a view to regulating the terms and conditions of employment of all workers performing work on the enterprise s premises, whether employed directly by the enterprise or by its subsidiaries; (ii) the labour administration refused to appoint the mediator requested by SITIAMASH; (iii) instead, at the beginning of , the labour administration registered a series of collective agreements concluded by the group trade union with various subsidiary companies without involving SITIAMASH and its branch in the collective bargaining process; and (iv) SITIAMASH opposed the registration of the collective agreements in question before the labour administration because the group trade union lacked legal representativeness and was an organization sponsored by the employer. The Committee notes the Government s indications that: (i) SITIAMASH did not fulfil the legal requirements for the appointment of a mediator as it had not demonstrated the expiry of the direct settlement period with the enterprise; (ii) SITIAMASH made administrative appeals against three of the six collective agreements negotiated and concluded by the group trade union; and (iii) in accordance with the principle of collective autonomy and after having verified the legality of the collective agreements concluded by the group trade union, the labour administration registered those agreements.
.The Committee duly notes the information provided by the complainant organization and the Government. In particular, the Committee notes that: (i) the complainant organizations allege that SITIAMASH was not involved in the collective bargaining processes initiated at the beginning of  by the group trade union, an organization that they claim lacked legal representativeness and proper independence; and (ii) the complainant organizations state that, in August , SITIAMASH presented a list of demands covering all workers of the enterprise and its subsidiaries, a point that has not been refuted by the Government. In this respect, the Committee recalls its consideration that in order to determine whether an organization has the capacity to be the sole signatory to collective agreements, two criteria should be applied: representativeness and independence. In the Committee s view, the determination of which organizations meet these criteria should be carried out by a body offering every guarantee of independence and objectivity [see Compilation, para. ]. The Committee also observes that, under section  of the Honduran Labour Code, if there are several unions within the same company, the collective agreement must be concluded with the one with the largest number of workers in the negotiation. Noting the Government s indications that SITIAMASH had submitted an administrative appeal against the registration of collective agreements that the STSS had determined to be legal, the Committee requests the Government to specify the criteria the STSS used to confirm that the group trade union was independent and more representative. The Committee also requests the complainant organizations to indicate whether the labour administration decisions in question had been contested before the courts.
.With respect to the allegations of the anti-union dismissal of the senior members of the Guanchias branch of SITIAMASH, the Committee notes the trade union s allegations that: (i) six senior members of the Guanchias branch were dismissed on  July ; (ii) two years after filing a complaint for the violation of trade union rights, the penalties provided for in the legislation still have not been imposed; and (iii) the Secretary-General of the above-mentioned branch, Mr Carlos Rivera, was dismissed without cause on  October . The Committee also notes that the Government: (i) indicates in its first communication that the dismissals of July  were being investigated; (ii) stated in its second communication that the labour inspectorate had confirmed the dismissals and, given that an allegation of the violation of trade union immunity had been made, the matter fell under the jurisdiction of the labour courts; and (iii) has not referred to the alleged dismissal without cause of the Secretary-General of SITIAMASH. The Committee also observes that it emerges from the documents and annexes provided by the complainant organizations that: (i) in an official communication dated  August  and addressed to the labour inspectorate, the lawyer of the dismissed senior members of the trade union concluded the administrative procedures related to the dismissals in order to begin court proceedings and requested the inspectorate to undertake investigations into a potential violation of section  of the Labour Code, which provides for the imposition of a fine in the case of a violation of the right to freedom of association; and (ii) a court action for the reinstatement of the six dismissed workers was lodged on  October . The Committee recalls that no one should be subjected to anti-union discrimination because of legitimate trade union activities and the remedy of reinstatement should be available to those who are victims of anti-union discrimination and where cases of alleged anti-union discrimination are involved, the competent authorities dealing with labour issues should begin an inquiry immediately and take suitable measures to remedy any effects of anti-union discrimination brought to their attention [see Compilation, paras  and ]. In addition, observing that the court action initiated against the dismissals that took place in  has reportedly still not received a ruling, the Committee recalls that cases concerning anti-union discrimination should be examined rapidly, so that the necessary remedies can be really effective; an excessive delay in processing such cases constitutes a serious attack on the trade union rights of those concerned [see Compilation, para. ]. In view of the foregoing, the Committee requests the Government to: (i) provide information on the execution and the outcomes of the investigations requested by SITIAMASH for the violation of the right to freedom of association resulting from the dismissal of several of its senior members in July ; and (ii) provide its observations regarding the alleged dismissal of the Secretary-General of the SITIAMASH branch in October . The Committee also requests that the necessary measures be taken to ensure that the court action initiated in relation to the above-mentioned dismissals is concluded in the near future in accordance with freedom of association and requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.In relation to the allegations of threats, coercion and acts of anti-union violence in the context of the merger and separation of the two unions in question, the Committee notes the complainant organizations' specific allegations of: (i) threats of dismissal and offers of employment and economic benefits for the members of the Guanchias branch of SITIAMASH to leave that union and join the union orchestrated by the enterprise; (ii) the presence of armed security guards in the workplace to monitor and harass SITIAMASH members; (iii) the persecution of the President of SITIAMASH and the surveillance of his house; and (iv) the attack on  January  with several gunshots aimed at the vehicle and house of the lawyer appointed by SITIAMASH to monitor the files related to the present case. The Committee notes the Government s indication that the allegations of threats and coercion against SITIAMASH members lack specific information regarding the form of the acts and their perpetrators. The Committee also notes that the Government: (i) indicated in its first communication that the alleged persecution of the SITIAMASH President was being investigated, an element about which it did not provide further information in its second communication; and (ii) has not provided its",0,2020,Honduras
5,"observations regarding the alleged attack on the organization s lawyer. Recalling that the rights of workers' and employers' organizations can only be exercised in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind against the leaders and members of these organizations, and it is for governments to ensure that this principle is respected [see Compilation, para. ], the Committee urges the Government to take without delay the necessary measures to guarantee the safety of the persons who have reportedly been victims of acts of anti-union violence and to investigate the allegations of the complainant organizations. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government and the complainant organizations to provide information on the outcomes of the court action to dissolve the group trade union initiated by SITIAMASH, as well as the other court action SITIAMASH might have taken in relation to the allegations of irregularities reported by the complainant organizations related to the separation of the group trade union from SITIAMASH.(b) With regard to the registration of collective agreements concluded by the group trade union, the Committee requests the Government to specify the criteria used by the STSS to confirm the independence and greater representativeness of the aforementioned organization. The Committee also requests the complainant organizations to indicate whether the above-mentioned decisions of the labour administration were contested before the courts.(c) The Committee requests the Government to:provide information on the execution and the outcomes of the investigations requested by SITIAMASH into the violation of the right to freedom of association resulting from the dismissal of several of its senior members in July ; andprovide its observations regarding the alleged dismissal of the Secretary-General of the branch of SITIAMASH in October .(d) The Committee requests that the necessary measures be taken to conclude without delay the court action initiated in relation to the above-mentioned dismissals in accordance with freedom of association and requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.(e) The Committee urges the Government to take without delay the necessary measures to guarantee the safety of the persons who have reportedly been subjected to acts of anti-union violence and to investigate the above-mentioned allegations of the complainant organizations. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.",0,2020,Honduras
6,".The complaint is contained in communications dated  May  submitted by the Authentic Trade Union Federation of Honduras (FASH).
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  October  and  September .
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communications dated  May , FASH questions the slowness and ineffectiveness of the Labour Inspectorate in putting an end to the violations of freedom of association, alleging the following:
.The complainant alleges that, in August , its affiliate, the Union of Hospital, Clinic and Health Centre Workers (SITRAHCYCS), contacted the Labour Inspectorate about violation of the rights of an employee of the enterprise Polyclinic Hospital SA (hereinafter  the enterprise'  who had been suspended without pay for five days. In February , the SITRAHCYCS also requested that the Inspectorate sanction the violation of the enterprise s unionized workers' rights concerning the applicable collective agreement on working conditions. On  October , the Inspectorate ruled in favour of the worker and on  January , the enterprise was notified that the Labour Inspectorate had found violations (in relation to wage increase) by the enterprise of the application of the collective agreement in question. The complainant indicates that the enterprise appealed the decision before the Ministry of Labour, but that the latter had yet to take any action as of the filing of the complaint. After being sought on various occasions in  regarding individual situations relating to the violation of the applicable legislation on rest in the radiology department, the Labour Inspectorate finally issued a decision in  that was appealed without further outcome. The complainant condemns this delay, which makes it impossible for the enterprise to correct the violations in question.
.The complainant alleges that on  February , Mr Presentacin Vsquez and Mr Carlos Mondragn, respectively the President and General Secretary of the Union of Workers and Employees of the municipality of Choluteca, were unfairly dismissed by the mayor of the municipality because of their union responsibilities (having submitted a list of demands). As the head of the human resources of the mayor  s office did not appear, the complainant alleges that on  March , the labour inspector verified the reported violations, but that the municipality refused to correct them. It indicates that on  April , the regional headquarters of the Labour Inspectorate of Choluteca maintained that workers who are members of the executive committee of a trade union organization, from the time they are elected until six months after the termination of their duties, cannot be dismissed from their jobs without first proving before the labour court judge that there is just cause to terminate the contract. However, according to the complainant, the union leaders were not reinstated in their posts. On the contrary, they were threatened by the mayor, who declared that he did not want any union members on his council and that he wanted to dismiss the other union members.
.The complainant alleges the unfair dismissal of some  unionized municipal employees by the mayor of the municipality of Tela Atlntida since , which was verified by the Labour Inspectorate in May . The complainant alleges that although the Labour Inspectorate ordered the reinstatement of the unionized municipal employees who had been dismissed, that decision was not respected.
.It also alleges that the municipality has not complied with the collective agreement concluded between the Union of Public Employees of the Municipality of Tela (SIDEPMUT), notably by failing to remit union dues to the union. The municipality was also fined for this infraction by the administrative secretariat of the General Directorate of the Labour Inspectorate.
.Lastly, the complainant alleges that the municipality was unwilling to negotiate a collective agreement for  and , for which the services of a labour inspector were also requested. The complainant condemns the lack of progress in these matters.
.In its communication dated  October , the Government indicates that: (i) in all the cases presented in the complaint, the General Directorate of the Labour Inspectorate has issued a ruling and always complied with the corresponding administrative procedures and guaranteed the parties' right to defence and due process; (ii) the Ministry of Labour, through the General Directorate of the Labour Inspectorate, has guaranteed the exercise of freedom of association by imposing the relevant sanctions in each specific case and in accordance with the labour legislation in force, specifically the Labour Inspection Act; (iii) the General Directorate of the Labour Inspectorate, in exercising its powers and without prejudice to the sanctions imposed for violations of freedom of association, has formally required the immediate correction of the violations found, including the payment of dues to unions and the reinstatement of dismissed workers; (iv) the certifications of the decisions concluding administrative proceedings have been issued in a timely manner (for example, in the case of the mayor s office of Tela) so that the union can claim its legal rights through the courts; and (v) the Ministry of Labour and Social Security has ensured protection of the right to freedom of association for workers and employers, respect for the working conditions agreed collectively, and continuous monitoring to ensure appropriate relations between employers and unions, intervening when necessary and issuing appropriate decisions, always in compliance with the national and international labour legislation in force and tailored to each specific case.
.In its communication dated  September , the Government declares that:As to the enterprise, administrative file IL---, whose parties include Ms Katia Mirandes as complainant, is on file without further processing, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act; and that administrative file IL--- concerning the violation of the applicable legislation on rest in the radiology department is with the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act and the Labour Inspection Act;As to the municipality of Choluteca, administrative file ILN---, to which Mr Presentacin Vsquez is a party, is with the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act and the Labour Inspection Act; andAs to the municipality of Tela Atlntida, administrative file ILN--- is to be sent to the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic so that it may be duly processed under the relevant provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act and the Labour Inspection Act.
.The Government indicates that the information provided is the result of interinstitutional consultations held with the bodies tasked with hearing and following up on the allegations made by the parties. It states that information was also requested from the General Confederation of Workers (CGT) and FASH, but that no additional information or observations were received regarding the allegations.
.The Committee notes that the present case mainly concerns allegations of non-compliance with a collective agreement in an enterprise in the health sector, anti-union dismissals in two municipalities in the country, as well as the slowness and ineffectiveness of the Labour Inspectorate in putting an end to the reported violations of freedom of association.
.The Committee observes that the complainant, in the allegations on specific cases (relating to the suspension without pay of a worker of the enterprise or to failure to respect rest periods in the radiology service), has not established any link to a possible violation of union rights. The Committee wishes to recall in this regard that its mandate consists in determining whether any given legislation or practice complies with the principles of freedom of association and collective bargaining laid down in the relevant Conventions [see Compilation of Decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , para. ]. Recalling the importance of the complainants' communication of relevant information and specific facts in order to enable it to reach a determination in full knowledge of the facts, the Committee observes that the complainant has not indicated how the union rights of the workers concerned have been violated and will therefore not pursue its examination of these allegations.
.Moreover, the Committee notes that the complainant alleges failure to comply with certain clauses of the applicable collective agreement on working conditions, which was confirmed by the Labour Inspectorate in a decision dated  January  (in particular in relation to wage increase), but which has not yet been corrected in practice. The Committee notes that, according to the complainant, the enterprise appealed the decision before the Ministry of Labour, but that the latter had yet to take any action as of the filing of the complaint. The Committee also observes that, contrary to the other issues raised by the complainant concerning the enterprise, the Government has not provided any information on the processing of the file by the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic.
.The Committee wishes to recall that mutual respect for the commitment undertaken in collective agreements is an important element of the right to bargain collectively and should",1,2019,Honduras
7,"be upheld in order to establish labour relations on stable and firm ground, and that failure to implement a collective agreement, even on a temporary basis, violates the right to bargain collectively, as well as the principle of bargaining in good faith [see Compilation, paras  and ]. In the light of the above, the Committee requests the Government to provide information on the measures taken to ensure that the members of the SITRAHCYCS are able to fully exercise their right to bargain collectively and that the collective bargaining agreement signed by the union and the enterprise is effectively applied, and to provide information on the action taken by the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic and the outcome of the applicable sanctions.
.The Committee observes that cases of anti-union dismissals have been brought to its attention in the case of the two above-mentioned municipalities and will therefore be examined together.
.The Committee notes that the complainant alleges that: (i) on  February , Mr Presentacin Vsquez and Mr Carlos Mondragn, respectively the President and General Secretary of the Union of Workers and Employees of the municipality of Choluteca, were unfairly dismissed by the mayor because of their union responsibilities (having submitted a list of demands); (ii) the labour inspector verified the reported violations on  March , but the municipality refused to correct them; and (iii) although the regional headquarters of the Labour Inspectorate of Choluteca maintained on  April  that workers who are members of the executive committee of a trade union organization, from the time they are elected until six months after the termination of their duties, cannot be dismissed from their jobs without first proving before the labour court judge that there is just cause to terminate the contract, the union leaders were not reinstated in their posts.
.The Committee also notes that the complainant alleges that: (i) some  unionized municipal employees have been unfairly dismissed by the mayor of the municipality of Tela Atlntida since  in an attempt to destabilize SIDEPMUT, which was verified by the Labour Inspectorate in May ; and (ii) the Labour Inspectorate s decision ordering the reinstatement of the dismissed unionized municipal employees was not respected.
.The Committee notes that the Government indicates in both cases that the Labour Inspectorate did indeed find the violations reported, that the mayors refused to comply with the corresponding decisions and that the respective files are (as of September ) with the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic, in accordance with the relevant legal provisions. The Committee notes in this respect the Government s indication that the certifications of the decisions concluding administrative proceedings have been issued in a timely manner so that the union can take legal action.
.The Committee notes, on the one hand, that the national legislation provides for measures to protect trade unionists and trade union leaders against discrimination and, on the other hand, that the competent authorities have carried out the appropriate investigations to remedy the consequences of the acts of anti-union discrimination, but that there are still significant difficulties surrounding implementation in practice, insofar as, according to the information available, the decisions of the Labour Inspectorate have allegedly not been enforced.
.The Committee recalls in this respect that no one should be subjected to anti-union discrimination because of legitimate trade union activities and that the remedy of reinstatement should be available to those who are victims of anti-union discrimination [see Compilation, para. ]. In addition, observing that there are reportedly still no rulings in the enforcement actions initiated against the dismissals that took place in February , the Committee recalls that cases concerning anti-union discrimination should be examined rapidly, so that the necessary remedies can be really effective; an excessive delay in processing such cases constitutes a serious attack on the trade union rights of those concerned [see Compilation, para. ]. In the light of the foregoing, the Committee requests the Government to provide information on the action taken by the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic in this respect. In addition, the Committee requests the Government, as well as the complainant, to provide information on any legal proceedings initiated in relation to the dismissals mentioned above and trusts that any such proceedings will be resolved without delay in accordance with freedom of association.
.Regarding the alleged threats against union leaders Mr Presentacin Vsquez and Mr Carlos Mondragn, the Committee notes that the complainant specifically alleges that, instead of being reinstated in their posts, they were threatened by the mayor, who stated that he did not want any union members on his council and that he wanted to dismiss the other union members. Recalling that the rights of workers' and employers' organizations can only be exercised in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind against the leaders and members of these organizations, and that it is for governments to ensure that this principle is respected [see Compilation, para. ], the Committee urges the Government to take without delay the necessary measures to investigate the complainant s allegations. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.The Committee further notes that, in the case of the municipality of Tela Atlntida, according to the complainant, the municipality failed to give SIDEPMUT the union dues that had been deducted from the salaries of the affiliated employees. The Committee notes that the complainant alleges that the municipality was fined for this infraction by the administrative secretariat of the General Directorate of the Labour Inspectorate, but that this sanction does not appear to have had any effect. Recalling that a considerable delay in the administration of justice with regard to the remittance of trade union dues withheld by an enterprise is tantamount in practice to a denial of justice [see Compilation, para. ], the Committee requests the Government to provide information in this regard, so as to ensure that the amounts withheld have been paid to the union in question.
.Moreover, the Committee notes that the complainant reports the unwillingness of the municipality of Tela Atlntida to negotiate a collective bargaining agreement for  and  with SIDEPMUT, indicating that it requested the services of a labour inspector in this regard and regretting the lack of progress on these issues, without providing further details. Recalling that both employers and trade unions should bargain in good faith and make every effort to come to an agreement, and that satisfactory labour relations depend primarily on the attitudes of the parties towards each other and on their mutual confidence [see Compilation, para. ], the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that the members of SIDEPMUT are able to fully and effectively exercise their right to bargain collectively, and to keep it informed in this respect.
.Finally, as to the allegations concerning the slowness and ineffectiveness of the Labour Inspectorate in putting an end to the violations of freedom of association in the situations mentioned above, the Committee notes that, according to the information available, the Labour Inspectorate has issued decisions requiring the correction of the violations found to remedy violations of freedom of association, as in the case of the unjustified dismissals.
.While duly noting the progress made in the Labour Inspection Act of , observed by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations (CEACR) in supervising the application of Convention No. , the Committee observes the particularly lengthy nature of the administrative procedures described in the present case, which would deprive those concerned of effective protection, taking into account that the unjustified dismissals date back to  in the case of the municipality of Choluteca, and even to  in the case of the municipality of Tela Atlntida. The Committee trusts that the competent authorities will take the necessary measures to ensure the prompt application of sanctions and remedial measures, applicable to the situations presented in this case. The Committee draws the attention of the CEACR to the aspects of this case concerning the application in practice of the Labour Inspection Act, so that it can take them into consideration in supervising the application of Convention No. .
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to provide information on the measures taken to ensure that the members of the Union of Hospital, Clinic and Health Centre Workers (SITRAHCYCS) are able to fully exercise their right to bargain collectively and that the collective agreement signed by the union and the enterprise is effectively applied, and to provide information on the action taken by the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic and the outcome of any applicable sanctions.(b) The Committee requests the Government to provide information on the action taken by the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic and the applicable sanctions concerning the dismissals of the leaders Mr Presentacin Vsquez and Mr Carlos Mondragn. The Committee also requests the Government, as",0,2019,Honduras
8,"well as the complainant, to provide information on any legal proceedings initiated in relation to the dismissals reported in the two municipalities and trusts that any such proceedings will be resolved without delay in accordance with freedom of association.(c) The Committee urges the Government to take without delay the necessary steps to investigate the complainant s allegations regarding the threats against the unionized employees of the municipality of Choluteca. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.(d) The Committee requests the Government to provide information on the issue of union dues, so as to ensure that the amounts withheld have been paid to the union in question.(e) The Committee requests the Government to take measures to ensure that the members of the Union of Public Employees of the Municipality of Tela (SIDEPMUT) are able to fully and effectively exercise their right to bargain collectively, and to keep it informed in this respect.(f) The Committee trusts that the competent authorities will take the necessary measures to ensure the prompt application of the sanctions and remedial measures applicable to the situations presented in this case.(g) The Committee draws the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations (CEACR) to the aspects of this case concerning the application in practice of the Labour Inspection Act, so that it can take them into consideration in supervising the application of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).",0,2019,Honduras
9,".The complaint is contained in communications of  November  and  May  presented by the Single Confederation of Workers of Honduras (CUTH).
.The Government of Honduras sent its observations in communications of  October ,  October  and  February .
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  November , the CUTH alleges the interference by officials of the Secretariat of Internal Affairs, Justice and Decentralization (SGJD) in the internal affairs of its affiliate, the National Association of Public Sector Employees (ANDEPH), based on its rejection of an application for registration of the executive board for the '  period, concealment of notification of this rejection, request to the members of this board to resign from their positions owing to their disagreement with their election and, subsequently, convocation of a congress of ANDEPH members in order to elect a new executive board.
.The complainant indicates that, on  March , ANDEPH held an ordinary national congress of members in which, independently and in accordance with the applicable legislation and its constitutions, the national executive board for the '  period was elected. The complainant indicates that an application was made for the board s registration to the Directorate for the Regulation, Registration and Monitoring of Public Associations of the SGJD in a written communication of  March . A copy of the communication is attached to the complaint, showing that the board was chaired by Rubn Matute Sarmiento, with Fredy Nahm Gmez as General Secretary. In addition, the complainant indicates that the above-mentioned application for registration was ultimately rejected by the SGJD by resolution No. - of  September  and that, as the SGJD concealed notification of that resolution, it only came to light on  November , when the deadline for filing the corresponding appeal against the decision had passed.
.The complainant also indicates that, in private meetings, certain SGJD officials requested the members of the executive board elected on  March , in an illegal, arbitrary, abusive and ill-intentioned manner, to resign from their positions after expressing disagreement with their election. In addition, the complainant indicates that on  November , a congress of ANDEPH members was held in Comayagua, convened by the SGJD in order to appoint a new executive board, the members of which, it indicates, were close to the incumbent SGJD Secretary of State.
.In its communication of  May , the complainant reiterates the above allegations and adds that the challenge it filed against the appointment of the executive board elected on  November  was declared inadmissible, and that it subsequently filed an appeal in that respect.
.In its above-mentioned communications, the complainant states that the situations described above did not allow ANDEPH to develop its operational plans for ten months and that various actions were taken, and several national and international complaints were filed in this regard. These include a note sent on  May  to the Secretary of State of the SGJD by the elected Chairperson of ANDEPH, Mr Matute, and the lodging of a complaint with the Human Rights Commissioner of Honduras dated  July , both of which are attached to the complaint. In the complaint it is stated that Csar Chirinos Andrade, Mario Isaac Zelaya and Joel Villalta Romero had illegitimately requested the SGJD to register another executive board, assuming functions not conferred on them, just as they had done in  with the backing of officials of the SGJD.
.In its communication of  October , the Government provides information on various administrative proceedings that took place in  regarding the applications for registration of the executive board (or board of directors) of ANDEPH, to which the complaint refers.
.The Government reports that in  various requests were submitted to the SGJD concerning the registration of a new ANDEPH executive board. The Government specifies that:
.In this respect, the Government indicates that, by resolution No. - of  September , the SGJD decided to: (i) refrain from considering the various applications for registration of the ANDEPH executive boards and their corresponding objections, leaving the channels open for, where appropriate, the parties to come before the competent courts to discuss the dispute that had arisen between them; and (ii) refrain from issuing any statement until the said dispute has come before the courts. The Government states that the parties concerned were notified of the above-mentioned resolution on  September  by means of a notice posted on the notice board of the relevant office.
.The Government explains that the decision contained in resolution No. - was based on the fact that the SGJD is not sufficiently competent to hear disputes arising from the election of an executive board or from the objection to the registration of the board and that, therefore, it could not ascertain the veracity or legality of the election process of each of the executive boards that the different parties requested to register. Thus, the Government states that its resolution was based on sections  and  of agreement No. -, which approves the procedure for the registration and recording of information concerning the public associations, under which aggrieved parties are entitled to address the court where they object to the election of a board of directors and to its registration.
.Furthermore, the Government provides information on the previous election of an executive board of ANDEPH, and on its effective registration. In this respect it indicates that:
.In its communication of  October , the Government reports that, despite its request for information in , the incumbent Chairperson of ANDEPH, Edvin Canales, did not provide any information on new developments related to the complaint.
.Lastly, in its communication of  February , the Government indicates that the Directorate for the Regulation, Registration and Monitoring of Public Associations of the SGJD registered the new executive board of ANDEPH for the period '  by administrative resolution No. - of  July .
.The Committee notes that the complainant alleges the interference in  by SGJD officials in the internal affairs of its affiliated body, ANDEPH.
.In this regard, the Committee notes that the complainant alleges that: (i) by resolution No.   of  September , the SGJD rejected the application of  March  requesting the registration of the ANDEPH executive board chaired by Rubn Matute Sarmiento with, as General Secretary, Fredy Nahm Gmez, who had been elected for '  at an ordinary national congress of members held on  March ; (ii) the SGJD concealed the notification of the aforementioned resolution, which only came to light on  November , which prevented the corresponding appeal from being filed as the deadline to do so had passed; (iii) in private meetings, certain SGJD officials requested the members of the said executive board to resign from their positions after expressing disagreement with their election; (iv) on  November , at a national congress of members convened by the SGJD, a new ANDEPH executive board composed of persons close to a senior SGJD official was elected for ' ; (v) the challenge filed against the appointment of this board was declared inadmissible, which led to the subsequent filing of an appeal; and (vi) the situations described above prevented ANDEPH from developing its operational plans, and various actions were taken and several national and international complaints were filed in this respect.
.In addition, the Committee notes the Government s observations according to which: (i) in , the SGJD received applications for the registration of more than one ANDEPH executive board, including the application of  March  concerning the registration of the committee chaired by Rubn Matute Sarmiento, to which the complaint refers; additionally, the SGJD also received requests to reject the above applications for registration; (ii) after considering that there was an internal dispute regarding the election and registration of the executive board in question, based on the provisions of agreement No. - approving the procedure for the registration and recording of information concerning public associations, the SGJD issued resolution No. - of  September , by which it decided to refrain from considering the aforementioned registration applications and requests for their refusal, and also from issuing any statement in this respect until the dispute arising between the parties involved was resolved by the courts of justice; (iii) the aforementioned resolution was notified on  September  to the parties concerned by means of a notice posted on the notice board of the relevant office; (iv) subsequently, further to a request submitted on  November , the SGJD convened an ordinary congress of ANDEPH members on  November  at the Comayagua Bar Association to elect new leaders of the national executive board; (v) acting on a request of  November , the SGJD issued, by resolution of  December , the registration for a four-year term of an ANDEPH executive board, chaired by Fredy Nahm Gmez, with Csar Chirinos",1,2018,Honduras
10,"as General Secretary, and the corresponding certificate; and (vi) the Directorate for the Regulation, Registration and Monitoring of Public Associations, the competent department of the SGJD, carried out the registration of the board in question.
.The Committee notes that from the above information it is clear that there was an internal dispute within ANDEPH regarding the election of the national executive board for ' , which led to the SGJD, as the competent department, receiving both applications for the registration of various boards for that period, and requests to reject such applications and that, as a result of the foregoing, it decided to refrain from considering them and from issuing statements in this respect until the dispute in question was resolved by the courts of justice, under resolution No. - of  September .
.In this respect, the Committee recalls that when internal disputes arise in a trade union organization they should be resolved by the persons concerned (for example, by a vote), by appointing an independent mediator with the agreement of the parties concerned, or by intervention of the judicial authorities and that, specifically, when two executive committees each proclaim themselves to be the legitimate one, the dispute should be settled by the judicial authority or an independent arbitrator, and not by the administrative authority [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , paras  and ].
.In the light of the foregoing, the Committee is struck by the Government s indication that, two months after the adoption of resolution No. -, the SGJD decided to process a new application for registration of an ANDEPH executive board and finally issued its registration for a four-year period by resolution of  December . In this respect, the Committee: (i) notes that such registration was, according to information of the complainant, subject to various challenges; and (ii) regrets that it was not informed of these actions, which, it is hoped, have followed their usual course and have been duly resolved. Based on the above, the Committee requests the Government to ensure that, in the absence of a solution identified by the interested parties themselves, the resolution of internal disputes within a trade union organization effectively falls to the judicial authority or an independent mediator agreed by the parties, and not to the administrative authority. Finally, the Committee notes that the mandate of the ANDEPH executive board for ' , to which the complaint refers, has come to an end, and thus the mandate of the corresponding board for the '  term has entered into force, recognized by administrative resolution No. - of  July . In these circumstances, the Committee considers that this case is closed and does not call for further examination.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to ensure that, in the absence of a solution identified by the interested parties themselves, the resolution of internal disputes within a trade union organization effectively falls to the judicial authority or an independent mediator agreed by the parties, and not to the administrative authority.(b) The Committee considers that this case is closed and does not call for further examination.",0,2018,Honduras

.The Government sent its observations in a communication of  November .
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  June , the CUTH alleges that there was a violation in three cases of the right to collective bargaining and freedom of association of the Union of Agroindustrial and Allied Workers (STAS) ' which is part of the Federation of Unions of Agroindustrial Workers (FESTAGRO), which in turn is affiliated to the complainant organization ' by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security (STSS).
.The complainant organization alleges that, in violation of the provisions of Honduran legislation and the ILO Conventions ratified by Honduras, the STSS failed to recognize the right of the STAS branch in the agricultural company Bananera Santa Rita SA (hereinafter the banana company) to bargain collectively and that this right was accorded instead to trade union organizations that undermine the economic, labour and social conditions of the workers through their negotiations. In this regard, the complainant organization states that, on  May , both the banana company and the regional office of the STSS in the municipality of El Progreso were notified of the establishment of a branch of the STAS and of the election of its executive board. The complainant organization adds that, on  June , the STAS formally submitted to both entities a list of demands with a view to concluding a collective agreement on working conditions.
.The complainant organization maintains that, even though the STAS had formally notified both the STSS and the company of its list of demands, three months later, between  September and  October , and at the request of the company, the General Labour Inspector, without first consulting the company s trade union organizations ' the STAS and the Union of Workers of the Agricultural Company Bananera Santa Rita SA (SITRAEBASAR) ' conducted investigations in order to determine which union was the most representative and the one with which the company was expected to negotiate the collective agreement. The complainant organization alleges that the General Labour Inspector did not take into consideration the submission by the STAS of  union membership forms signed by workers of the company ' a company in which  workers were employed on a permanent basis at the time. In addition, it states that the General Labour Inspector s final report of  October  (copy attached) indicates that the STAS has only  members and makes no reference to the submission of documentation by SITRAEBASAR that would prove how many members that union has. The complainant organization alleges that the STSS did not follow due process as established in Honduran labour legislation and that its reports were factually incorrect.
.The complainant organization encloses with its communication a copy of a written statement issued on  November  by the Finance Secretary of FESTAGRO on behalf of the STAS to the General Labour Inspector at the STSS office in El Progreso. In the statement, the Finance Secretary of FESTAGRO indicates that days earlier, on  November, he had been to the STSS offices to confirm that the executive board of SITRAEBASAR had not reported to those offices for interview or to present the record of the executive board election and the record of the submission of its list of demands.
.The complainant organization reports that the STSS is unlawfully favouring the Union of Azucarera del Norte and Agroindustrial Workers (SITRAZUNOSAGS) in subsidiaries of Azucarera del Norte SA (AZUNOSA, hereinafter  the sugar company' , thereby preventing the exercise of collective bargaining by the STAS sub-branch in the welding and metal working company SODEMEM, which is also a subsidiary of the sugar company.
.The complainant organization states that, on  November , SODEMEM and the STSS office in El Progresso were notified of the establishment of an STAS sub-branch. The complainant organization maintains that, on  March , the STAS formally submitted to both entities a list of demands for the negotiation of a collective agreement on working conditions. The complainant organization alleges that although the notification of the SITRAZUNOSAGS branch in the subsidiaries of the sugar company was submitted on  April , the STSS tampered with the dates of the notifications so that the documents issued by the STSS indicate that they were submitted on  October .
.The complainant organization further alleges that the notification of the SITRAZUNOSAGS branch in the sugar company and in its subsidiaries by the STSS office in San Pedro Sula was a violation of the principle of geographical jurisdiction as, according to that principle, the notification should have been issued by the STSS office in El Progreso. The complainant organization further alleges that the STSS did not take into consideration the fact that there was already a union in the subsidiaries to the sugar company, namely the STAS branch, which had a membership of  out of a total of  workers who were employed at that time in those companies.
.The complainant organization points out that, on  February , the company Sur Agrcola de Honduras SA de CV (SURAGROH, hereinafter the agricultural company) and the regional office of the STSS in Choluteca were notified of the establishment of the executive board of the STAS sub-branch in the company. The complainant organization alleges that the aforementioned executive board was detained in the company offices by the company s administrative staff. The complainant organization further alleges that the members of the executive board of the STAS sub-branch were dismissed without justification, contrary to the provisions of section  of the Labour Code, which stipulates that the members of executive boards cannot be dismissed for at least six months after ceasing to perform their union duties without first verifying with the appropriate court that there is just cause to terminate the contract.
.The complainant organization alleges that, in response to a request by the agricultural company to cancel the notification of the establishment of the executive board of the STAS sub-branch, the Directorate of Legal Services and General Labour Inspectorate of the STSS of Tegucigalpa issued a decision dated  September , cancelling the notification without justification. The decision also invalidated the report of intimidation issued by the General Labour Inspectorate of Choluteca on  February , which stated that the agricultural company had violated the right to freedom of association when it had handed the members of the executive board their notice. In this regard, the complainant organization alleges that: (i) by cancelling the notification of the establishment of the executive board of the STAS sub-branch, the STSS violated Conventions Nos  and ; and (ii) by invalidating the aforementioned report of intimidation through an unjustified decision, the STSS acted in violation of the provisions of Honduran law relating to trade union immunity and those establishing that the justification of administrative actions is mandatory.
.The complainant organization indicates that, on  October , the STAS filed an appeal against the STSS decision of  September  with the General Labour Inspector of the STSS of Tegucigalpa. In addition, the complainant organization provides a copy of the complaint of  November  submitted by the STAS President to the Office of the National Commissioner for Human Rights (CONADEH), calling for an investigation into and analysis of the unfair and unlawful action of the STSS in relation to, among other things, the aforementioned decision of the STSS.
.Lastly, the complainant organization reports that, on  April , Mr Moiss Snchez Gmez, General Secretary of the STAS sub-branch in the company MELEXSA (hereinafter the melon company) and Mr Misael Snchez Gmez, a member of that union, were the victims of a criminal attack for their trade union activity in Choluteca, with the latter sustaining serious injuries to his face caused by a machete. According to the complaint filed on  April  by Mr Moiss Snchez Gmez to the Police Investigation Directorate of the Ministry of Security (copy attached), both workers were attacked by a group of people in hoods who threatened them with firearms and machetes and stole the mobile phone of Mr Moiss Snchez Gmez, which contained information on his union activities. The complainant organization recalls that the union s adviser in that area, Mr Nelson Nez, had previously been threatened for his trade union work, but the Public Prosecutor s Office had not taken the acts seriously.
.In its communication of  November , the Government reports that an application was submitted by the international consultant of the trading company Tela Railroad Company (a company belonging to the same parent company as the banana company) requesting the presence of the STSS in the banana company with a view to determining the most representative trade union in that company, as the company had two union organizations and it wanted to negotiate a collective",1,2017,Honduras
12,"agreement with the most representative one. The Government adds that these trade union organizations were the STAS, classified as an industry union, and SITRAEBASAR, classified as an enterprise or first-level union.
.The Government indicates that, in order to determine which union was the most representative, between  September and  October , an official inspection was conducted in the banana company, which included meetings with Mr Miguel Armando Zapata, Labour Relations Manager for Honduras; Mr Germn Edgardo Zepeda, President of FESTAGRO; and Mr Toms Membreo, President of the STAS; as well as with members of the Trade Union Federation of National Workers of Honduras (FESITRANH) on behalf of SITRAEBASAR. The Government informs that, in order to determine the union membership of the workers, individual interviews were carried out during the inspection, not in the presence of the employer, but in the presence of representatives of the STAS and SITRAEBASAR, who ensured that the process was carried out without any form of coercion. The Government states that  workers were interviewed out of a total of  permanent workers in the company at that time. The Government points out that, pursuant to section  of the Labour Code, which provides that  if there are several unions within the same company, the collective agreement must be concluded with the one with the largest number of workers in the negotiation' and pursuant to Article  of Convention No. , and based on the investigations that were conducted, it was concluded that the union with which the company should negotiate the collective agreement was SITRAEBASAR, since of the  workers who were interviewed,  said that they were members of SITRAEBASAR and  said that they were members of the STAS.
.With regard to the allegation that the reports of the General Labour Inspectorate were factually incorrect, the Government indicates that, although during the inspection the STAS presented membership forms signed by the workers, it was found that  of these membership forms did not contain the worker s fingerprint, but only their signature, and that neither did they indicate the date on which the worker had joined the union. Consequently, as inconsistencies had been found in the membership forms submitted by the STAS, the General Labour Inspector issued a report dated  October  concluding that SITRAEBASAR was the most representative trade union and the one with which the company should negotiate the collective agreement.
.Lastly, the Government provides a copy of a statement issued on  August  by the company s legal representative, Mr Fuad Alberto Giacoman Hasbun, to the Regional Coordinator of the General Labour Inspectorate of El Progresso, announcing the conclusion of a collective agreement with SITRAEBASAR.
.In response to the allegations made by the complainant organization regarding the tampering with the dates in the records of the notifications of the SITRAZUNOSAGS branch, the Government indicates that, although formal notification of the establishment of an STAS branch in SODEMEM was given on  November , the fact is, as was placed on record, that SITRAZUNOSAGS had previously notified subsidiaries of the sugar company of the establishment of union branches in that company. Accordingly, the Government informs that the General Labour Inspectorate of El Progreso was established in subsidiaries of the sugar company in compliance with the order of  October , the objective of which was to carry out the request made by Mr Julio Figueroa, Regional Coordinator of the General Confederation of Workers (CGT), the organization to which SITRAZUNOSAGS is affiliated.
.With regard to the allegation concerning the violation of the principle of geographical jurisdiction by the STSS, the Government indicates that it was the STSS of El Progreso, and not the STSS of San Pedro Sula, which issued the notification of the SITRAZUNOSAGS branch, as shown by the signature and stamp on the record (copy attached).
.With regard to the allegations made by the complainant organization concerning the dismissal of members of the executive board of the STAS sub-branch, the Government refers to the decision of  September  by the STSS of Tegucigalpa cancelling the notification of the establishment of the executive board of the STAS sub-branch and invalidating the report of the General Labour Inspectorate of  February  stating that freedom of association had been violated by the agricultural company when it had dismissed the members of the executive board. The invalidated report stated that members of the executive board are afforded special protection by the State and cannot be dismissed without a court order. The Government indicates that the STSS decision of  September  complies with legal requirements, as section  of the Labour Code concerning trade union immunity is applicable only to the members of the central executive board, and therefore the members of executive boards at the branch level do not have trade union immunity.
.In relation to the criminal attacks against the General Secretary of the STAS sub-branch, Mr Moiss Snchez Gmez, and his brother, union member Mr Misael Snchez Gmez, the Government informs that on  April , the General Labour Inspectorate of the STSS of Choluteca responded to the complaint filed by Mr Moiss Snchez Gmez and his legal representative. The Government adds that, as a result, on that same day, the General Labour Inspector visited the premises of the melon company, where he interviewed the human resources manager, who stated that he was unaware of the alleged attacks, that Mr Moiss Snchez Gmez did not work for the company and that Mr Misael Snchez Gmez had worked there only on a temporary basis, between  November  and  March . The Government concludes that the STSS took appropriate action within the scope of its authority in response to the complaint that was filed in connection with the aforementioned attacks.
.The Committee observes that, in the present case, the complainant organization alleges that the STSS fraudulently disregarded the most representative status of the STAS branch in a banana company, thereby preventing the branch in question from bargaining collectively.
.The Committee notes in particular that the complainant organization alleges that, on  June , the STSS and the mentioned company were formally notified of the submission of a list of demands for the negotiation of a collective agreement on working conditions. The Committee observes that the complainant organization alleges that, despite the formal notification of the list of demands by the STAS, more than three months later, between  September and  October , the General Labour Inspectorate of the STSS of El Progreso conducted investigations, at the request of the company and without first consulting the trade union organizations in the company, to determine which trade union was the most representative. The Committee notes that the complainant organization indicates that, after conducting its investigations, the General Labour Inspectorate established that the most representative union with which the company should negotiate a collective agreement was SITRAEBASAR. The complainant organization reports that the General Labour Inspectorate presented information that was factually incorrect in its final report. Specifically, the complainant organization maintains that, although the STAS submitted  union membership forms signed by workers of the company (in which  workers were employed on a permanent basis at the time), in his final report the General Labour Inspector makes reference to only  membership forms. Furthermore, according to the complainant organization, the report makes no reference to the submission of documentation by SITRAEBASAR that would prove how many members that union has. In addition, the Committee observes that, according to the written statement issued by the Finance Secretary of FESTAGRO to the STSS, SITRAEBASAR did not report to the STSS to present the record of the election of its executive board or the record of the submission of its list of demands.
.The Committee notes that the Government, for its part, states that the General Labour Inspector in the aforementioned report determines that  of the membership forms submitted by the STAS did not contain the worker s fingerprint, but only their signature, and neither did they indicate the date on which the worker had joined the union. The Government states that, in view of such inconsistencies, the General Labour Inspectorate decided to hold individual interviews with the workers, in the presence of representatives of the STAS and SITRAEBASAR and not in the presence of the employer, to determine which union they belonged to. The Government concludes that, based on the information obtained during the interviews, the General Labour Inspectorate established that the most representative union with which the company should negotiate the collective agreement was SITRAEBASAR, as of the  workers interviewed,  said that they belonged to that union, while  said that they belonged to the STAS.
.The Committee observes that in this case there are differences of view between the trade union organizations that claim their greater representativeness in the banana company. The complainant organization challenges the decisions of the General Labour Inspectorate in relation to the following points: (i) the number of membership forms submitted by the STAS and the validity of these forms",1,2017,Honduras
13,"under Honduran legislation; (ii) the non-submission of the membership forms by SITRAEBASAR; (iii) the criteria used by the General Labour Inspectorate to determine the validity of the STAS membership forms, in particular because the workers' signatures were considered to be insufficient and their fingerprints were necessary; and (iv) the basis for the methodology used by the General Labour Inspectorate on this occasion to determine which union was the most representative. In this regard, the Committee recalls that  in order to encourage the harmonious development of collective bargaining and to avoid disputes, it should always be the practice to follow, where they exist, the procedures laid down for the designation of the most representative unions for collective bargaining purposes when it is not clear by which unions the workers wish to be represented. In the absence of such procedures, the authorities, where appropriate, should examine the possibility of laying down objective rules in this respect' [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , para. ].
.In the light of the above and in the absence of information on whether or not an appeal has been filed against the General Labour Inspectorate s decision, and in order to be in a position to pursue its examination of this matter, the Committee requests the Government and the complainant to indicate whether an appeal has been filed. If so, it requests the Government to provide information on its outcome.
.The Committee observes that the complainant organization alleges unlawful actions by the STSS involving the tampering with the dates in the records of the General Labour Inspectorate and the violation of the principle of the geographical jurisdiction in order to favour SITRAZUNOSAGS in subsidiaries to the sugar company and thereby prevent the STAS sub branch in SODEMEM, also a subsidiary of the sugar company, from engaging in collective bargaining. The Committee notes that the Government for its part maintains that the notification of the SITRAZUNOSAGS branch in subsidiaries to the sugar company was made prior to the notification of the STAS branch in SODEMEM, as shown by the records of the STSS of El Progreso. While noting the differences between the account of the complainant organization and that of the Government regarding the exact date on which the notification of the SITRAZUNOSAGS branch in subsidiaries to the sugar company was issued, the Committee observes that it does not have the necessary information to be able to ascertain in this case whether or not there was a violation of the principles of freedom of association and collective bargaining. Noting further that the complainant organization does not refer in its allegations to the filing of an appeal in this respect, the Committee will not pursue its examination of this allegation.
.The Committee observes that the present complaint concerns alleged actions taken and omissions made by the STSS between September  and April , consisting of: (i) the cancellation of the notification of the establishment of the executive board of an STAS sub branch; (ii) the invalidation of the report of the General Labour Inspectorate of Choluteca which stated that there had been a violation of freedom of association by an agricultural company when it had dismissed the members of that executive board; and (iii) the absence of an investigation into the criminal attack against Mr Moiss Snchez Gmez, General Secretary of the STAS sub-branch in the melon company, and Mr Misael Snchez Gmez, a member of that union.
.With regard to the allegation concerning the cancellation of the notification of the establishment of the executive board of the STAS sub-branch, the Committee notes that neither the complainant organization, which claims simply that there was a violation of Conventions Nos  and , nor the Government provide any information on the circumstances and reasons for the aforementioned cancellation. The Committee notes that, according to the information provided by the complainant organization, the STAS filed an appeal against the STSS decision of  September  and a complaint with CONADEH, in which it alleged that the action of the STSS in this regard had been unfair and unlawful. Underlining the importance of these appeals being examined as soon as possible, the Committee requests the Government to inform it of the reasons for the cancellation of the notification of the establishment of the executive board of the STAS sub-branch and the outcome of the ongoing procedures.
.With regard to the allegation concerning the dismissal of the members of the executive board of the STAS sub-branch, the Committee observes that the decision of  September  by the STSS of Tegucigalpa, provided by the Government, refers to the dismissal of workers who were members of the executive board of the STAS sub-branch and states that union immunity was not applicable because the dismissals concerned the executive board of a sub branch of a union, and not a central executive board, and that, therefore, the dismissal of several members of the executive board of the sub-branch of a union was, in this respect, in accordance with the law. The Committee notes that an appeal was lodged by the STAS on  October  with the STSS and a complaint dated  November  was filed with CONADEH, calling for an investigation into and analysis of the unfair and illegal action of the STSS in this regard. Recalling that,  where cases of alleged anti-union discrimination are involved, the competent authorities dealing with labour issues should begin an inquiry immediately and take suitable measures to remedy any effects of anti-union discrimination brought to their attention' [see Compilation, op. cit., para. ], the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that, in the context of the aforementioned proceedings, the possibility that the dismissals of the executive board members were of an anti-union nature will be examined. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.In relation to the allegation concerning the criminal attacks against the General Secretary of the STAS sub-branch, Mr Moiss Snchez Gmez, and his brother, union member Mr Misael Snchez Gmez, the Committee notes that, according to the information provided by the complainant organization, both workers were attacked by a group of people in hoods who threatened them with firearms and machetes and stole the mobile phone of Mr Moiss Snchez Gmez, which contained information about his union activities. Furthermore, as a result of this attack, Mr Misael Snchez sustained serious injuries to his face caused by a machete. The Committee notes that Mr Moiss Snchez Gmez filed a complaint in relation to these acts with the Police Investigation Directorate of the Ministry of Security.
.The Committee notes that the Government, for its part, states that the STSS, within the framework of its competences, took appropriate action within the scope of its authority in response to the complaint filed by Mr Moiss Snchez Gmez and his legal representative. In particular, the Government indicates that, on  April , the General Labour Inspectorate of Choluteca visited the premises of the melon company and interviewed the human resources manager in order to shed light on the facts. In its reply, the Government simply sends the information provided by the Human Resources Manager, who stated that only Mr Misael Snchez Gmez had worked for the company and only on a temporary basis prior to the incident. The Committee expresses its deep concern at these serious acts of violence and at the limited reply by the Government. The Committee observes that on  May  the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) issued a press release condemning these acts and urged the Government to take the necessary measures to guarantee that union leaders can carry out their work of denunciation, monitoring and protection, free from attacks or acts of violence. In this regard, the Committee recalls that the rights of workers' and employers' organizations can only be exercised in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind against the leaders and members of these organizations, and it is for governments to ensure that this principle is respected. The Committee also wishes to stress that the killing, disappearance or serious injury of trade union leaders and trade unionists requires the institution of independent judicial inquiries in order to shed full light, at the earliest date, on the facts and the circumstances in which such actions occurred and in this way, to the extent possible, determine where responsibilities lie, punish the guilty parties and prevent the repetition of similar events [see Compilation, op. cit., paras  and ]. In this regard, while noting the inspections conducted by the STSS, the Committee observes with concern that the Government has not provided any information on the complaint filed with the Police Investigation Directorate or on any other criminal investigation. The Committee therefore urges the Government to ensure that criminal investigations are conducted as soon as possible into the attacks against Mr Moiss Snchez Gmez and Mr Misael Snchez Gmez to determine where the responsibilities lie for",0,2017,Honduras
14,"these attacks and punish the guilty parties. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect. The Committee also urges the Government to ensure that Mr Moiss Snchez Gmez and Mr Misael Snchez Gmez are receiving adequate protection to fully guarantee their safety. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	In the light of the elements in this case, the Committee requests the Government and the complainant to indicate whether an appeal has been filed against the decision of the General Labour Inspectorate in relation to the determination of the most representative trade union organization, and if so, to provide information on its outcome.(b)	The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the reasons for the cancellation of the notification of the establishment of the executive board of the STAS sub-branch in the agricultural company and of the outcome of the appeal filed with the STSS and the complaint submitted to CONADEH by the STAS in this respect.(c)	With regard to the allegations concerning the dismissal of members of the executive board of the STAS sub-branch in the agricultural company, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that, in the context of the ongoing proceedings, the possibility that the dismissals of the executive board members were of an anti-union nature will be examined. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.(d)	With regard to the allegations of criminal attacks against the General Secretary of the STAS sub-branch in the melon company, Mr Moiss Snchez Gmez, and his brother, union member Mr Misael Snchez Gmez, the Committee urges the Government to ensure that criminal investigations are conducted as soon as possible in this regard to determine where the responsibilities lie for these attacks and punish the guilty parties. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect. The Committee also urges the Government to ensure that Mr Moiss Snchez Gmez and Mr Misael Snchez Gmez are receiving adequate protection to fully guarantee their safety. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.",0,2017,Honduras
15,".The complaint is contained in a communication dated  October  from the Single Confederation of Workers of Honduras (CUTH).
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  May  and  April .
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In a communication dated  October , the complainant organization alleges non compliance by the Honduran Social Security Institute (hereinafter  the Institute'  with various clauses of the th collective labour agreement currently in force, concluded in April  with the Union of Workers of the Honduran Social Security Institute (SITRAIHSS) (which is part of the Unitary Federation of Honduran Workers (FUTH), which is in turn affiliated to the complainant organization).
.The complainant states that the Government decided in  to intervene in the affairs of the Institute in order to safeguard public interests, appointing an oversight committee for this purpose, which has been in charge of the Institute s administration ever since. The complainant alleges that, since , the oversight committee has failed to comply with nine of the clauses of the collective labour agreement and that, despite the fact that the SITRAIHSS wrote on a number of occasions requesting the oversight committee to comply fully with the collective agreement, it had replied that it was unable to accede to such a request. The complainant further states that the SITRAIHSS filed four complaints with the Ministry of Labour and Social Security between  and  regarding non-compliance with the nine clauses of the collective agreement alleged in this complaint.
.On  November , the SITRAIHSS filed a complaint for non-compliance with clause (h) of the collective agreement, which provides that the Institute will grant paid union leave to workers for various purposes, including attending conferences, union-related training courses, congresses, seminars and other similar events to do with union activity, for each activity s duration, provided that the number of absent workers is not such that the normal functioning of the institution is adversely affected. The complainant claims that the Institute has failed to grant paid leave to union leaders or to those carrying out trade union activities and that, in a letter sent in September , the oversight committee stated that, while there was no problem in granting union leave, this should be subject to section () of the Labour Code, which prohibits employers from remunerating union leave. Concerning the complaint filed, the complainant states that, although the Ministry of Labour and Social Security decided in November  to impose a penalty on the Institute for violation of freedom of association, it revoked its decision following counter evidence presented by the oversight committee, thereby rendering null and void the previously imposed penalty.
.On  April , the SITRAIHSS filed a complaint for non-compliance with clause  (regarding meal breaks included in the working day and the right of workers on certain shifts in hospital medical units to be provided with a snack and breakfast) and clause  of the collective agreement (according to which the Institute undertakes to provide water coolers with sufficient supplies of water bottle refills in accessible locations for service units). According to the complainant, there has been a failure to comply with both clauses, since: (i) food is not being provided to workers, meaning that they incur additional costs; and (ii) water coolers are not being provided for staff, which is putting workers' health at risk, given that they have the right to satisfy their thirst in the workplace with the highest quality water (pure water) that poses no risk to health. The complainant states that, in a letter dated  February , the Institute informed it that: (i) due to budget constraints, it was decided that food would be provided on a priority basis to patients and not to staff so long as the difficult financial situation continues; and (ii) the Institute did not have the means to cover the amount required to buy water for employees. The complainant states that, following the submission of a complaint on the matter, on  August  the Ministry of Labour and Social Security decided to impose a financial penalty on the oversight committee. Despite this, the situation has not been resolved.
.On  July , the SITRAIHSS filed a complaint for non-compliance with clause  (monthly meetings to be held between the trade union and the Institute s management, and extraordinary meetings if the parties so agree) and clause  (public holidays when staff required to work will receive triple normal pay) of the collective agreement. According to the complainant, both clauses were allegedly being violated, given that: (i) the current administration is not concerned about labour disputes within the Institute and is simply not interested in meeting with the SITRAIHSS; and (ii) since , the Institute s oversight committee has been instructing the Human Resources Department to advise that, on the sole initiative of the oversight committee, the institution s activities were being reprogrammed, removing the holidays already established in the collective agreement. The complainant states that the processing of the complaint has become protracted in the Ministry of Labour and Social Security and the outcome is still pending.
.On  August , the SITRAIHSS filed a complaint for non-compliance with clause  (Christmas and New Year bonus), clause  (sum donated by the Institute each April for the  May celebrations), clause  (sum of money given each year by the Institute for study scholarships to be granted by the trade union to workers' children) and clause  (the minimum wage for newly recruited workers is fixed by the Institute in line with the amount stipulated by the State, which can automatically be amended by new legislation) of the collective agreement. The complainant alleges that the above clauses have been violated, given that since  the Institute has only partially complied with its obligations by paying some of the agreed amounts. Moreover, although in a letter dated  October  the oversight committee announced that from October  the minimum wage agreed in the collective agreement would be paid, the Institute allegedly failed to comply with its obligation to pay the amount of minimum wage due for the period between January  and September . With regard to the complaint, according to the complainant, the processing of the complaint has become protracted in the Ministry of Labour and Social Security and the outcome is still pending.
.In a communication dated  May , the Government indicates that the Institute is a state budgetary and non-profit institution, responsible for providing social security and health coverage and protection from occupational risks. The Government states that: (i) it had intervened in the affairs of the Institute in  because of failings in the management and administration of the Institute, which had led to a serious crisis situation and to financial collapse; and (ii) the objectives of the oversight committee are to restructure personnel administration and management, enhance service quality and ensure drug supplies. The Government adds that corruption had forced it not only to intervene in the affairs of the Institute, but also to conclude agreements with the Organization of American States in the fight against impunity. As a result, a joint body was established, called the Mission to Support the Fight against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras.
.The Government adds that the institutional crisis resulted in the oversight committee deciding to bail out the Institute, taking actions specifically aimed at mitigating the following risks: (i) the Institute s closure, incurring social damage by preventing the delivery of pension and social security services; (ii) damage through the loss of a source of employment for all employees and officials in the institution due to the financial collapse; (iii) suspension of employment contracts without pay, and other extreme measures such as staff reductions; and (iv) the cessation of activities in connection with contracts concluded by former administrations that commit significant resources of the institution to service planning and delivery.
.The Government states that, given the above circumstances, the oversight committee opted to: (i) reduce current expenditure in order to provide and improve services to members; (ii) restore the image of and confidence in the institution; and (iii) change the system of internal control, with clear processes and mechanisms, thus reforming the institution. The Government emphasizes that the actions taken by the oversight committee were aimed at bailing out the Institute and lifting it out of the serious administrative, technical and financial situation it was in, using as a legal basis the provisions of the General Act on Public Administration, section  of which provides that:The oversight committee has the same powers as those invested in administrators in the exercise of their legal representation. The very act of intervention is just cause for the oversight committee to temporarily suspend staff, terminate employment contracts or revoke agreements concluded with staff considered to be superfluous.
.The Government includes detailed information in its communication on the Institute s financial",1,2017,Honduras
16,"situation before its intervention and describes each of the measures adopted by the oversight committee to fully settle the Institute s main contractual obligations that posed financial and social risks. The Government also underlines that it is not, or has never been, its intention to violate any of the clauses, but rather to fulfil its responsibility of bailing out the Institute in order to consolidate and guarantee not only existing rights and benefits, but also to ensure the capacity to provide social security coverage, and on a sustainable basis.
.The Government states that the oversight committee prioritized compliance with all of the priority obligations of the Labour Code and the collective agreement in  per cent of cases, and emphasizes that there has been no failure to comply with the collective agreement, but rather that circumstances and conditions arose making it impossible to meet some of the non-priority obligations of the collective agreement because of the financial crisis faced by the institution. The Government also emphasizes that it has always complied with the following clauses of the collective agreement to ensure that all workers in the Institute enjoy benefits: clause  (voluntary redundancy bonus), clause  (assistance with the cost of spectacles), clause  (assistance with funeral costs), clause  (holiday pay), clause  (special leave (prophylactic)), clause  (adjustment for seniority (five-year period)), clause  (overtime premium), clause  (group life insurance), clause  (transport for night-shift workers), clause  (paid leave), clause  (study leave), clause  (shift changes), clause  (seniority bonus) and clause  (reimbursement of medical expenses).
.With regard to compliance with clause (h) of the collective agreement (union leave), the Government states that, on  November , the oversight committee presented evidence to counter the General Labour Inspectorate s notification informing the Institute of the imposition of penalties. The Government also emphasizes that, in accordance with the law, the oversight committee authorized unpaid union leave for the persons elected as members of the executive committee and who sought ongoing periods of leave in order to carry out trade union activities. According to the Government, this decision is based on the final subparagraph of section () of the Labour Code, which states that:  ...employers are required to ' grant union leave to the worker ' .Where a worker holds union management positions, the leave shall last for as long as the worker remains in his/her post. The employer is prohibited from paying wages for this purpose. The leave in question shall be requested by the individual trade union organization' 
.As for the alleged non-compliance with clause  of the collective agreement (public holidays), the Government states that the Institute, in order to ensure that union members benefited from prompt care in the health system, decided to allow employees compensatory time off for the days when they are required to undertake activities as part as their duties. It also states that this measure was taken to ensure the well-being of members and that they receive prompt health care. Furthermore, with respect to clause , the Government states that the Institute has been paying the minimum wage agreed in the collective agreement since October  and that the Institute has always ensured that members receive the benefits provided for in the Labour Code such as the th-month and th-month salary bonuses (clauses  and  of the collective agreement).
.Concerning clauses  and  of the collective agreement (food and water coolers for employees), the Government states that the Institute s budgetary capacity is only sufficient to provide food for patients admitted to the country s different hospital units. The Government points out, however, that all priority and substantive obligations, arising both from the Labour Code and the collective agreement, have been paid punctually every month to all employees. The Government emphasizes that the financial crisis faced by the Institute has resulted in it taking measures to control spending, earmarking available financial resources for priority expenditure. The Government also emphasizes that, from the date its intervention began, it has been paying the monthly deductions due from permanent employees, amounting to  per cent, punctually to the trade union organization. With regard to clause  (meetings between the trade union and the Institute authorities), the Government points out that the oversight committee has engaged in communication and ongoing dialogue whenever the trade union organization has requested it to do so and, as proof of this, they attach the attendance lists of the meetings between the oversight committee and the SITRAIHSS.
.In its communication dated  April , the Government reports that, on  December , the oversight committee signed an agreement with the Medical Association of the Honduran Social Security Institute (AMIHSS) and the Honduran Medical School (CMH) (organizations distinct from the complainant organization), which ended a strike called by the Institute s doctors to seek a salary increase. The Government reports that the oversight committee undertook in this agreement to: (i) grant medical staff a salary adjustment equivalent to  per cent, starting in January ; and (ii) grant a one-off sum equivalent to a normal salary earned from December  to those who worked throughout December without a break. The doctors, for their part, promised to return to work immediately. The oversight committee also undertook in this agreement to review two clauses of the collective agreement in the second quarter of  relating to contests for the appointment of doctors and voluntary redundancies (clauses that are not subject to the complainant s allegations of non-compliance in the present complaint).
.The Committee observes that in the present case the complainant alleges non-compliance since  with various clauses of the collective agreement concluded in  between the SITRAIHSS and the Institute (a public body responsible for providing social security and health coverage and protection from occupational risks). The Committee notes that the complainant and the Government state that, in , the Government decided to intervene in the affairs of the Institute in order to safeguard public interests, appointing for that purpose an oversight committee, which has been in charge of the Institute s administration ever since. According to the Government: (i) the intervention in the affairs of the Institute was necessary because of corruption and managerial and administrative failings, which had led to a serious crisis situation within the Institute and to its financial collapse; and (ii) the main objective of the oversight committee is to restructure personnel administration and management, enhance service quality and ensure drug supplies.
.The Committee notes the complainant s specific allegation that, since , the oversight committee has failed to comply with nine clauses out of a total of  in the collective agreement in question. It also notes that, according to the documents attached by the complainant, in  and  the SITRAIHSS sent several letters to the oversight committee requesting it to comply fully with the collective agreement and that, in response, the oversight committee had emphasized that the intention had never been to affect employees but that, given the financial situation faced by the institution and the resultant recovery process, the main objective was to maintain sources of employment and to progressively ensure compliance with all obligations to ensure enjoyment of benefits.
.The Committee further notes that the complainant and the Government indicate that in  and  the SITRAIHSS filed four complaints with the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, alleging non-compliance with the nine clauses that are the subject of this complaint. Regarding the status of these complaints, the information provided by the complainant shows that: (i) although the Ministry of Labour imposed a penalty on the Institute for non-compliance with clause (h) (union leave was reportedly granted but only on an unpaid basis), following counter evidence presented by the oversight committee, the Ministry of Labour revoked its decision (on the basis that section () of the Labour Code prohibits employers from remunerating union leave), thereby rendering null and void the penalty imposed; and (ii) the Ministry of Labour also imposed a penalty on the Institute with respect to non-compliance with clauses  and  (food and water coolers for workers), despite which the situation has not been resolved in practice, according to the complainant. On this point, the Committee notes the Government s statement that: (i) the Institute s financial situation prevents it from covering this type of expense; (ii) budgetary capacity is only sufficient to provide food for patients admitted to the country s different hospital units; and (iii) notwithstanding the foregoing, the oversight committee, despite the current financial crisis situation, is complying with the priority obligations of the Labour Code and over  per cent of those arising from the collective agreement.
.Moreover, the Committee observes that the Ministry of Labour has yet to express its position on the complaints relating to clause  (monthly meetings between the trade union and the Institute), clause  (public holidays), clause  (Christmas and New Year bonus), clause  (sum of money for the  May celebrations) and clause  (study grants). With regard to",0,2017,Honduras
17,"clause  (minimum wage), the Committee notes that, while the complainant acknowledges that from October  the Institute paid the minimum wage agreed in the collective agreement, it is alleged that the oversight committee failed to comply with its obligation to pay the amount of minimum wage due for the period between January  and September .
.In light of the above, the Committee observes that: (i) in , following serious financial difficulties caused by managerial and administrative failings, the Government appointed an oversight committee, which decided that, in the short term, it could not implement a number of clauses of the collective agreement currently in force within the institution (clauses that, according to the oversight committee, were not of a priority nature); (ii) although the Government stresses that the failure to implement certain clauses of the collective agreement is merely temporary, this situation following the financial crisis in the institution dates back to , and the Government gives no indication in its reply as to when the current situation might end and when it will be in a position to comply fully with the collective agreement; (iii) several of the complaints of non-compliance with the collective agreement presented by the SITRAIHSS in  and  are still pending a decision by the Ministry of Labour; (iv) although the Government mentions a series of meetings held between the oversight committee and the SITRAIHSS since , as well as an agreement signed in December  with doctors' organizations in order to end a strike, the Government does not state that it entered into negotiations with the SITRAIHSS regarding the impact of the Institute s financial situation on the implementation of the collective agreement; and (v) under the Labour Code, the validity of the institution s fourteenth collective agreement, signed in  for a period of three years, will automatically be extended for periods of one year at a time, unless the parties, or one of the parties, expresses in writing their explicit wish to end the agreement.
.Underlining that agreements should be binding on the parties, the Committee recalls that it has highlighted the importance, in the context of an economic crisis, of maintaining permanent and intensive dialogue with the most representative workers' and employers' organizations, and that adequate mechanisms for dealing with exceptional economic situations can be developed within the framework of the public sector collective bargaining system [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , paras  and ]. [See also th Report, Case No.  (Canada), para. ]. In the light of the foregoing considerations, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps to promote dialogue between the Institute and the SITRAIHSS so that the parties can consider appropriate ways to once again fully implement the collective agreement currently in force and address all other issues that they deem appropriate in accordance with the principle of voluntary collective bargaining. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.With regard to non-compliance with clause (h) of the collective agreement on paid union leave, the Committee notes that, according to the documents attached by the complainant and the Government, the Ministry of Labour based its decision to revoke the penalty previously imposed on section () of the Labour Code, in so far as it prohibits employers from granting paid union leave. In this connection, the Committee recalls that the issue of the payment of wages by the employer to full-time union officials should be up to the parties to determine and the Government should authorize negotiation on the issue of whether trade union activity by full-time union officials should be treated as unpaid leave [see Compilation, op. cit., para. ]. The Committee therefore requests the Government, in consultation with the representative workers' and employers' organizations, to take the necessary steps to review legislation so that the social partners may negotiate the possible remuneration of union leave. The Committee refers the legislative aspects of this case to the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations (CEACR).
.In light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps to promote dialogue between the Institute and the SITRAIHSS so that the parties can consider appropriate ways to once again fully implement the collective agreement currently in force and address all other issues that they deem appropriate in accordance with the principle of voluntary collective bargaining. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.(b)	The Committee requests the Government, in consultation with the representative workers' and employers' organizations, to take the necessary steps to review legislation so that the social partners may negotiate the possible remuneration of union leave. The Committee refers the legislative aspects of this case to the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations (CEACR).",0,2017,Honduras
18,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the Trade Union of Postal Workers of Honduras (SITRAHONDUCOR) dated  May .
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  March and  August .
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. )
.In its communication dated  May , the complainant organization indicates its decision to withdraw the allegations contained in two previous communications. It also states that, on  November , representatives of the Directorate of Legal Services of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security (STSS), of the Post Office of Honduras (HONDUCOR, hereinafter the Enterprise), of SITRAHONDUCOR and of the Workers' Confederation of Honduras (CTH) signed a special accord in which they agreed, among other things, that the director of the Enterprise would request the STSS to issue an opinion on the dues to be deducted from the workers of the Enterprise, on the basis of Decree-Law No.  of  March  and clause  of the prevailing collective agreement, and would make those deductions for all employees, with the exception of employees in a position of trust. The opinion in question concerns the deductions payable by non-unionized workers benefiting directly from a collective agreement on working conditions in force, for a sum equal to the ordinary union dues. The documents provided by the complainant organization include legal opinion No. /DSL/ of  November  from the Directorate of Legal Services of the STSS, which concluded that  if an employee wishes to voluntarily leave the trade union association to which he or she belongs and if the individual directly enjoys the labour gains achieved by the trade union, he or she should also pay the percentage equivalent to the ordinary dues already established by the trade union, as per article -A of the Labour Code in force, as the enjoyment of those labour gains or rights brings with it obligations for the individual with the trade union association' 
.The complainant organization alleges that, in , the salary deductions that should have been made of an amount equivalent to  per cent of the monthly salary did not cover all the workers benefiting from the prevailing collective agreement on working conditions and that, consequently, they should contribute an amount equal to the ordinary dues paid by the workers affiliated to the organization. It adds that the amounts that were deducted from the workers' salaries by the Enterprise management as union dues were not transmitted to SITRAHONDUCOR and that, in February , the sums in question were reimbursed to the employees.
.The Government sent its observations in response to the complainant organization s allegations in communications dated  March  and  August .
.In its communication dated  March , the Government confirms that the Enterprise requested the STSS to issue an opinion on deducting  per cent from the salary of all employees. The Directorate of Legal Services of the STSS stated that trade unions are associations that individuals are free to join and to leave and that, if workers benefit from the collective agreement, they should pay the  per cent but there should be an option of not having the amount deducted if the individual does not benefit from the labour gains.
.The Government explains, secondly, that the SITRAHONDUCOR has ignored all requests to provide the necessary documentation for the deduction of union dues, in accordance with article  of the Labour Code. The provision in question states:  In order to proceed with the deduction of union dues, the trade union must submit the following documents to the enterprise: (a) a copy of the relevant excerpt of the union s general assembly minutes in which authorization was given to deduct the dues, by a majority vote of the total number of members; the copy of the document must be provided with a list of all the participants; (b) the payroll, in duplicate, certified by the president, the secretary and the legal adviser, of all the members registered at the time of the authorization, who will have their union dues deducted even if they have voted against the authorization or have expressed their wish to no longer have their dues deducted; and (c) for individuals who join the union at a later date, notifications of new membership, certified as per the previous clause'  It also indicates that over  employees of the Enterprise requested the enterprise s highest authorities not to deduct the  per cent of their monthly salary for union dues. The Government adds that, owing to the problems between employees of the Enterprise and SITRAHONDUCOR members, the Enterprise s legal advisory department, through the General Labour Inspectorate, requested the STSS to appoint a mediator. It states that, in the Enterprise, the rights to freedom of association and to organize have always been respected, there have been no violations of the provisions of a treaty or international Convention, and every attempt has been made to maintain order and a healthy working environment.
.In its communication dated  August , the Government states that the Enterprise, which is attached to the Ministry of Infrastructure and Public Services (INSEP), was instructed to deduct the union dues. The Government sends a copy of a communication dated  August , in which the Director-General of the Enterprise states that SITRAHONDUCOR was requested to provide the information relating to the Integrated Financial Administration System (SIAFI) to be able to proceed with the transfers.
.The Committee observes that the allegations relate to the non-deduction, in , of the amounts equivalent to ordinary trade union dues from all workers benefiting from the prevailing collective agreement on working conditions (with the exception of employees in a position of trust); they also relate to the reimbursement to the employees, in February , of the amounts retained by the Enterprise
.The Committee notes that, according to the Government: (i) a worker can voluntarily leave the trade union association to which he or she belongs and only those non-unionized workers benefiting from the collective agreement on working conditions have an obligation to pay the trade union; (ii) the complainant organization has ignored all the requests for the documentation required by law in order to proceed with the deduction of the union dues; and (iii) the suspension of salary deductions coincided with complaints by employees of the Enterprise.
.The Committee also observes that, in the legal opinion dated  November , in response to a request relating to the contributions to be deducted from workers of the Enterprise, the Directorate of Legal Services of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security (STSS) concluded that there is an obligation to contribute when the employee directly enjoys the labour gains achieved by the trade union, on the basis, among others, of clause  of the prevailing collective agreement between the Enterprise and SITRAHONDUCOR, and the relevant provisions of the Labour Code.
.Finally, the Committee observes that the situation appears to be close to being resolved, as in its most recent communication the Government states that the Enterprise has been ordered to deduct the trade union dues, with the complainant organization having been requested to provide the necessary information to make the bank transfer.
.With regard to the collection of the trade union dues and their management, the Committee recalls that the withdrawal of the check-off facility, which could lead to financial difficulties for trade union organizations, is not conducive to the development of harmonious industrial relations and should therefore be avoided. It should also be recalled that trade union dues do not belong to the authorities, nor are they public funds, but rather they are an amount on deposit that the authorities may not use for any reason other than to remit them to the organization concerned without delay. The Committee also recalls that when legislation admits trade union security clauses, such as the withholding of trade union dues from the wages of non-members benefiting from the conclusion of a collective agreement, those clauses should only take effect through collective agreements [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , paras ,  and ].
.The Committee trusts that, once the necessary information has been obtained to order the bank transfer, the Government will proceed without delay to pay back to the complainant organization the amounts retained, either as trade union dues or as contributions by non affiliated workers benefiting from the prevailing collective agreement on working conditions.
.In light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee trusts that, once the necessary information has been obtained to order the bank transfer, the Government will proceed without delay to pay back to the complainant organization the amounts retained, either as trade union dues or as contributions by non-affiliated workers benefiting from the prevailing collective agreement on working conditions.",1,2015,Honduras
19,".The Committee last examined this case (submitted in August ) at its June  session, when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body [see th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (June ), paras ' ].
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  September  and  February .
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.At its June  session, the Committee made the following recommendations [see th Report, para. ]:(a)	The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the results of: (i) the appeal for the protection of constitutional rights (amparo) lodged with the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court in respect of the dismissal of Mr Jorge Alberto Argueta Romero and Mr Carlos Alberto Rodriguez; and (ii) the action of unconstitutionality lodged by the Workers' Union of the Executive Directorate of Revenues (SITRADEI) against the use of polygraph tests.(b)	The Committee requests the complainant organization to provide more detail about the allegations concerning: (i) the initiation of disciplinary proceedings for the purpose of dismissing trade unionists who do not agree to a polygraph test; and (ii) the detention of trade unionists, as a result of the intervention of police and military officials at the country s customs posts, claiming alleged acts of corruption.
.In its communications dated  September  and  February , the Government states the following:(i)	On  January , the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court ordered the dismissal of the appeal for amparo filed by the representative of Mr Jorge Alberto Argueta Romero in respect of the decision issued by the Labour Court of Appeal, finding that the decision of the competent judicial body was duly justified.(ii)	As to the dismissal of Mr Carlos Alberto Rodrguez Espinal, on  June , the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court denied the appeal for amparo for the union leader, thus confirming the decision of the Labour Court of Appeal.(iii)	With regard to the action of unconstitutionality lodged by SITRADEI against the use of polygraph tests, the Government reports that in its decision dated  March , the Supreme Court ended the stay in proceedings by finding a previous judgment from the same chamber, on the same grounds, in which it had ruled that such tests did not violate constitutional rights and guarantees.
.Lastly, the Government indicates that the Executive Directorate of Revenues (DEI) was closed and liquidated through Executive Decree No. PCM   of  November  and that the Presidential Commissioner for Tax Administration now exercises tax-related powers and functions.
.The Committee recalls that the present case refers to alleged actions or omissions by the DEI, which occurred between August  and January , consisting of: the intention to destroy SITRADEI through anti-union harassment of SITRADEI officials and members; the initiation of disciplinary proceedings, with the aim of dismissing trade unionists who would not agree to a polygraph test; and the arrest of trade union members following the intervention of police and military officials at the country s customs posts, claiming alleged acts of corruption.
.With regard to the allegations concerning the anti-union dismissals of Mr Jorge Alberto Argueta Romero and Mr Carlos Alberto Rodrguez, the Committee duly notes that on  January , the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court ordered the dismissal of the appeal for amparo lodged by Mr Jorge Alberto Argueta Romero and that on  June , it denied the appeal for amparo for Mr Carlos Alberto Rodrguez, thus upholding their dismissals.
.As to the action of unconstitutionality lodged by SITRADEI against the use of polygraph tests, the Committee duly notes that the Supreme Court ended the stay in proceedings by finding a previous judgment from the same chamber, in which it had ruled that such tests did not violate constitutional rights and guarantees. Recalling that in its previous examination of the case, the Committee recognized the workers' fear that polygraph tests could be used for anti-union purposes, the Committee trusts that should the Government receive any complaints relating to the use of polygraph tests for anti-union purposes, it will ensure that the appropriate investigations are conducted as soon as possible.
.With respect to the allegations concerning the initiation of disciplinary proceedings and the arrest of trade union members, the Committee observes that the complainant organization does not provide the requested information. In these circumstances, in the absence of any additional information from the complainant, the Committee will not pursue the examination of these allegations.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.
.The complaint is contained in communications from the Single Confederation of Workers of Honduras (CUTH) dated  August ,  March  and  June . These communications were received on  June .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  September .
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In a communication dated  August , the complainant organization alleges that, on  April , the Workers' Union of the Executive Directorate of Revenues (SITRADEI) presented a list of demands relating to the first collective labour agreement covering working conditions to the State Secretariat of the Labour and Social Security Departments, which was submitted by the General Labour Inspectorate on  April  to the Executive Director of the Executive Directorate of Revenues (DEI). The complainant explains that on repeated occasions it requested the Executive Director of the DEI to negotiate the first collective agreement and that the request was always refused.
.In a communication dated  March , the complainant organization alleges, for the period since : that attempts have been made to destroy the SITRADEI; anti-union harassment of SITRADEI officials and members; the initiation of disciplinary proceedings, with the aim of dismissing trade unionists who would not agree to a polygraph test; the ongoing refusal to begin the negotiations of the first collective agreement; and the arrest of trade union members following the intervention of police and military officials at the country s customs posts, claiming alleged acts of corruption.
.Regarding the allegation of failure to negotiate the list of demands relating to the first collective agreement covering working conditions, the complainant organization documents that: () on some occasions the DEI agreed to negotiate the list of demands, while on others it cited its status as a decentralized institution in order not to comply with them (reports of the General Labour Inspectorate dated  April ,  May ,  June ,  July  and  July ); () on a number of occasions, the State Secretariat of the Labour and Social Security Departments decided that through the General Labour Inspectorate the DEI would be requested to initiate the applicable conciliatory discussions, in accordance with the Labour Code; and () on  July , the representatives of the DEI, the State Secretariat of the Labour and Social Security Departments and the SITRADEI met to address the labour issues encountered and to reach an agreement through conciliation that would satisfy the needs of the workers and of the State. The meeting addressed issues including the negotiation of the collective agreement sought by the SITRADEI and the regulation of leave for officials to perform their trade union activities.
.Concerning the harassment of trade union officials and members, the complainant organization refers to penalties imposed on Ms Ruby Jackeline Soto, Ms Rossana Esther Ventura, Ms Carmen Mara Mondragn, Ms Rosa Vilma Ortiz, Ms Milly Janet Meza, Ms Mercy Nohelia Escoto, Mr Mario Antonio Cruz, Mr Oscar Omar Sanos, Mr Darwin Enrique Barahona and Mr Jorge Alberto Chavarra, executive members of trade union branches and confederations, for participating in union activities.
.The complainant organization also refers to trade union repression against Mr Jorge Alberto Argueta Romero and Mr Carlos Alberto Rodrguez, Treasurer and Disputes Secretary, respectively, of the SITRADEI executive board, for having participated for two hours in a trade union activity on  January . Both officials were notified of their dismissal on October .
.In its communication dated  September , the Government states that the DEI is a responsible institution that respects human and labour rights. It observes that the complaint relates to a period of almost five years; the most recent allegations focus mainly on the alleged intention of the Government to destroy the SITRADEI.
.With respect to the failure to negotiate the list of demands relating to the first collective labour agreement covering working conditions, the Government states that the DEI is a decentralized institution which is attached to the State Secretariat of the Finance Department. It explains that the DEI was established in  and that it is governed by the special regulations for administrative, fiscal and customs careers, which came into force on  March . On  September , the then minister in charge of the DEI",1,2015,Honduras
20,"requested an opinion from the General Directorate of Labour of the State Secretariat of the Labour and Social Security Departments, in order to determine whether the DEI was obliged to negotiate a collective agreement with the SITRADEI. On  September , the General Directorate of Labour issued an opinion indicating that the DEI was not obliged to negotiate a collective agreement with the SITRADEI. The Government recalls, moreover, that under article  of the Labour Code,  trade unions of public employees cannot present lists of demands or conclude collective agreements, but trade unions of other official workers shall have all the powers of other workers' unions and their lists of demands shall be handled on the same basis as all others, even if they are not entitled to call or conduct strikes' 
.With regard to the harassment of trade union officials and members, the Government explains that executive and branch members were summoned in due legal form for abandoning their respective jobs and suspending their work in an untimely manner (on ,  and  January and  April ) and for not complying with and violating a number of internal rules set out in Chapter XXIII (disciplinary regulations) of the special regulations for administrative, fiscal and customs careers. It adds that the objections presented by the employees concerned were rejected and that the penalties imposed were upheld by legal decision.
.The Government also explains that, on  October , Mr Jorge Alberto Argueta Romero and Mr Carlos Alberto Rodrguez were dismissed for having unjustifiably suspended their work. This was done in accordance with due legal process or, put in other terms, after having obtained the respective judicial authorizations to proceed with their dismissal (withdrawal of immunity), once the decision of the Labour Court relating to Mr Jorge Alberto Argueta Romero had been confirmed by the Court of Appeal, and once the appeal for the protection of constitutional rights (amparo) lodged with the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court by both men had been allowed, without suspending the act contested.
.With regard to the polygraph test, the Government states that it is regulated by the General Supervisory Act governing the Application of Tests for the Evaluation of Trust for all public servants. It adds that the SITRADEI lodged an action of unconstitutionality against the test and that the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court allowed the action, but without suspending the act contested.
.The Committee observes that the present case alleges actions or omissions by the DEI, which occurred between August  and January , consisting of: the intention to destroy the SITRADEI through anti-union harassment of SITRADEI officials and members; the initiation of disciplinary proceedings, with the aim of dismissing trade unionists who would not agree to a polygraph test; the arrest of trade union members following the intervention of police and military officials at the country s customs posts, claiming alleged acts of corruption; and the ongoing refusal to begin the negotiations of the first collective agreement.
.With regard to the allegation of harassment of officials and members, the Committee notes the Government s explanations whereby the penalties imposed on the executive and branch members of the trade union were imposed in accordance with the law, and the objections presented by the employees concerned were rejected. Concerning the dismissal of Mr Jorge Alberto Argueta Romero and Mr Carlos Alberto Rodrguez, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, they were dismissed for having unjustifiably suspended their work, in accordance with due legal process, once the appeal for the protection of constitutional rights (amparo) lodged with the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court had been allowed, without suspending the act contested. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the result of the appeal for the protection of constitutional rights (amparo) lodged with the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court.
.Regarding the alleged initiation of disciplinary proceedings, with the aim of dismissing trade unionists who would not agree to a polygraph test, the Committee takes note of the explanations provided by the Government indicating that the polygraph test is regulated by the General Supervisory Act governing the Application of Tests for the Evaluation of Trust for all public servants. Recognizing the workers' fear that the polygraph test could be used for anti-union purposes and the alleged disciplinary proceedings aimed at dismissing trade unionists who would not agree to taking the test, the Committee requests the Government to inform it of the result of the action of unconstitutionality lodged by the SITRADEI against the use of polygraph tests. The Committee also requests the complainant organization to provide more detail about the initiation of disciplinary proceedings for the purpose of dismissing trade unionists who do not agree to a polygraph test.
.The Committee requests the complainant organization to provide more detail about the alleged arrest of trade unionists following the intervention of police and military officials at the country s customs posts, claiming alleged acts of corruption.
.With regard to the alleged refusal to negotiate, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, the DEI is not obliged to negotiate a collective agreement with the SITRADEI and that the Labour Code does not apply to the trade union in respect of the presentation of lists of demands nor the conclusion of collective agreements. In this respect, the Committee recalls that:  all public service workers other than those engaged in the administration of the State should enjoy collective bargaining rights, and priority should be given to collective bargaining as the means to settle disputes arising in connection with the determination of terms and conditions of employment in the public service' [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ].
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the results of: (i) the appeal for the protection of constitutional rights (amparo) lodged with the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court in respect of the dismissal of Mr Jorge Alberto Argueta Romero and Mr Carlos Alberto Rodrguez; and (ii) the action of unconstitutionality lodged by the SITRADEI against the use of polygraph tests.(b) The Committee requests the complainant organization to provide more detail about the allegations concerning: (i) the initiation of disciplinary proceedings for the purpose of dismissing trade unionists who do not agree to a polygraph test; and (ii) the detention of trade unionists, as a result of the intervention of police and military officials at the country s customs posts, claiming alleged acts of corruption.",0,2015,Honduras
21,".The Committee examined this case, concerning allegations of anti-union suspensions at the Ministry of Public Works, Transport and Housing (SOPTRAVI) and the seizure of union documentation, at its meeting in March  [see th Report, paras ' ]. On that occasion, the Committee made the following recommendations:(a)	As regards the allegations concerning the suspension of the employment contracts of some , workers at the Ministry of Infrastructure and Public Services (INSEP), (formerly SOPTRAVI), the Committee requests the Government to respect, in the future, the principle of consultation of trade union organizations on matters that affect the interests of their members and to consult them, in particular with regard to the consequences of programmes for the restructuring of employment or the rationalization of conditions of work of salaried employees.(b)	As regards the allegations of an attempt by police and military personnel to break into the head office of the Independent Workers' Federation of Honduras (FITH), the Committee highlights the vagueness and lack of precision of the allegations and therefore invites the complainant organization to send more detailed information, in particular concerning the attempt by police and military personnel to break into the FITH head office in order to seize all the documentation belonging to the union.
.The Government submitted further information in a communication dated  April . With regard to recommendation (a), the Government: (i) emphasized that the suspension of the workers' contracts was temporary and necessary given that the INSEP had an obligation to ensure the proper distribution and implementation of its expenditures; and (ii) stated that the INSEP maintains ongoing communication with trade union organizations on matters that affect the interests of their members, including with regard to the consequences of restructuring programmes on employment or rationalization programmes on the working conditions of employees.
.With regard to recommendation (b), the Government: (i) stated that anti-union persecution is not a state policy and therefore it does not know about the allegations of an attempt by police and military personnel to break into the complainant organization s head office; and (ii) like the Committee, highlighted the vagueness and lack of precision of the allegations and invited the complainant organization to provide more detailed information in this regard.
.The Committee takes due note of the information provided by the Government. Moreover, it observes that the complainant organization has not provided the more detailed information on the allegations of a break-in at its head office that it had requested. In these circumstances, and given that it has received no information either from the Government or from the complainant organization since , the Committee considers this case closed and will not pursue its examination.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the Independent Workers' Federation of Honduras (FITH) dated  April .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  September .
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In a communication dated  April , FITH alleges that the employment contracts of some , workers at the Ministry of Infrastructure and Public Services (INSEP) (formerly the Ministry of Public Works, Transport and Housing (SOPTRAVI)) were suspended for  days (from  April to  July ). This included the contracts of  officials and delegates of the Union of Public Workers and Employees at the Ministry of Public Works, Transport and Housing (SITRAEPSOPTRAVI). The complainant organization indicates that the Ministry of Labour and Social Security (STSS) was informed of the situation, but at the date of the communication, two months had elapsed without any action being taken by the Ministry.
.Moreover, the complainant organization alleges that, in the context of an audit of the STSS involving the High Court of Auditors, police and military personnel attempted to break into the FITH head office to seize all the documentation belonging to the union.
.In its communication dated  September , the Government explains that by means of Decree No. - of  January  issuing the Act for the optimization of the public administration, improvement of citizen services and strengthening of government transparency, a re-engineering of the state apparatus was launched with a view to tackling the financial crisis. As part of the re-engineering, a number of institutions were abolished, while others were merged or regrouped. The Government indicates that in the ministries where temporary staff were employed, the competent body was requested, further to an individual audit of each worker s situation, to suspend individual employment contracts in accordance with the law and the international treaties in force.
.In the particular case of the INSEP, a consultancy study conducted in early  established that, as at January , the ministry had a total of , employees. Most INSEP employees were hired on daily contracts. Furthermore, in the context of the study to evaluate the potential budgetary impact of certain human resources management measures, it was established that . per cent of INSEP employees were concentrated in three departments: the Directorate-General for Highways (a total of , employees, including , on daily contracts); the Central Activities Unit (a total of , employees, including  on daily contracts); and the Directorate-General for Transport (a total of  employees, including  on daily contracts). Taking account of the recommendations made in the context of the abovementioned study, INSEP submitted a request to the STSS on  April  for the suspension of the individual employment contracts of , workers. The suspension of the individual contracts was made effective from  April to  July . The Government states that, as from  July , most of the workers whose contracts had been suspended resumed their work in full.
.The Committee observes that the present case refers to the following allegations: () the suspension for  days (from  April to  July ) of the employment contracts of some , workers at the INSEP (formerly SOPTRAVI), including the contracts of  officials and delegates of the SITRAEPSOPTRAVI; and () an attempt, in the context of an audit to evaluate the financial situation of the STSS involving the High Court of Auditors, by police and military personnel to break into the head office of FITH in order to seize all the documentation belonging to the union.
.The Committee notes all the Government s statements, in particular those explaining that the financial crisis was the reason for the request to suspend the employment contracts of , workers and that, as from  July , most of the workers whose contracts had been suspended resumed their work in full.
.As regards the allegations concerning the suspension of employment contracts at INSEP (formerly SOPTRAVI), the Committee concludes that these are general measures affecting thousands of workers, whether or not they are union members, and that, in this regard, the situation does not imply anti-union discrimination, even if there have been problems in the employment sphere (which lie outside the competence of the Committee). However, the Committee emphasizes the importance it attaches to the promotion of dialogue and consultations on matters of mutual interest between the public authorities and the most representative occupational organizations of the sector involved [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ]. The Committee also recalls that it can examine allegations concerning economic rationalization programmes and restructuring processes, whether or not they imply redundancies or the transfer of enterprises or services from the public to the private sector, only insofar as they might have given rise to acts of discrimination or interference against trade unions. In any case, the Committee can only regret that in the rationalization and staff reduction process, the Government did not consult or try to reach an agreement with the trade union organizations [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. In view of the fact that there is nothing in the information sent by the Government to suggest that the complainant organization or the trade union was consulted, the Committee requests the Government to respect, in the future, the principle of consultation of trade union organizations on matters that affect the interests of their members and to consult them in particular with regard to the consequences of programmes for the restructuring of employment or the rationalization of conditions of work of salaried employees.
.As regards the allegations concerning an  attempt' by police and military personnel to break into the head office of FITH, the Committee regrets the vagueness and lack of precision in the allegations and therefore invites the complainant organization to send more detailed information, in particular concerning the  attempt' by police and military personnel to break into the FITH head office in order to seize all the documentation belonging to the union, in the context of an audit to evaluate the financial situation of the STSS involving the High Court of Auditors.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) As regards the allegations concerning the suspension of the employment",0,2014,Honduras

23,".The Committee last examined this case at its June  meeting, when it presented an interim report to the Governing Body [see th Report, paras ' ].
.The Single Confederation of Workers of Honduras (CUTH) and the General Confederation of Workers (CGT) submitted additional information in a communication dated  June .
.The Government submitted further observations in communications dated  August ,  May  and  September .
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.At its June  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendations [see th Report, para. ]:(a)	The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the legal proceedings concerning the death of Ms Ilse Ivania Velsquez Rodrguez.(b)	Concerning the legal proceedings instituted against  teachers for the crimes of sedition and unlawful association, and their subsequent arrest while participating in a peaceful demonstration, the Committee expects that all necessary measures are taken so that the ongoing legal proceedings can be concluded without further delay and that measures for conditional release are provided if the judicial decisions are not taken in the near future. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.(c)	As to the suspension of the economic regime set forth in the Honduran Teachers' Statute, pursuant to article  of Decree-Law No. - of  October , the Committee reiterates its request to the Government and complainant organizations to seek a negotiated solution acceptable to all the parties concerned, in accordance with the principles of freedom of association laid down in the ratified Conventions on freedom of association and collective bargaining. It requests the Government to inform it of the outcome of any negotiations entered into on the matter.(d)	Concerning the arbitrary provisions on union dues under Decree-Law No. - of  January , the Committee requests the Government to send its observations without delay, in particular on the scope of article  of the decree in question, to inform the Committee how trade unions' right to organize their administration is safeguarded.(e)	Regarding the sending of an official communication by the National Commission of Banks and Securities in November  mandating the transfer of the union dues accrued by each trade union organization to INPREMA, where teachers had opted for a pension savings account, the Committee requests the complainant organization to provide more detailed information, including a copy of the official communication to which it refers.(f)	With regard to the declaration of illegality by the State Secretariat of the Departments of Labour and Social Security which led to the adoption of Executive Decision No. -SE- of  October , and the subsequent imposition of the sanctions of salary deductions, temporary suspension or dismissal, as the case may be, affecting hundreds of teachers, the Committee once again requests the Government to take measures to amend the legislation such that the legality or illegality of a strike is declared by an independent body.(g)	Concerning the allegations that the State Secretariat of the Department of Education sends inspectors to each lawfully convened assembly, the Committee, recalling that the presence of a representative of the public authorities or of the employer in trade union meetings constitutes an act of interference incompatible with the principle of freedom to hold trade union meetings laid down in ratified Conventions on freedom of association and collective bargaining, once again requests the Government to ensure that such practices do not recur in the future.(h)	As to the suppression of protests against the failure to pay salary increments from  to , the Committee once again urges the Government to submit its observations without delay, in particular providing information on the complaints submitted to the competent authorities by the persons who suffered police repression during the protests.(i)	Moreover, the Committee requests the complainant organization to provide more detailed information on the allegations concerning: () the sending of an official communication by the National Commission of Banks and Securities in November  mandating the transfer of the union dues accrued by each trade union organization to INPREMA, where teachers had opted for a pension savings account; and () the restrictions on the right of assembly of teachers' organizations and the victimization and harassment of teachers' representatives.
.In its communication of  June , two of the complainant organizations, the CUTH and the CGT, provided additional information related to the recommendations made by the Committee in its previous examination of the case.
.With regard to recommendation (a) relating to the death of Ms Ilse Ivania Velsquez Rodrguez on  March  while she was participating in a peaceful demonstration, the complainant organizations attach a report drawn up on  January  by the Committee of the Families of Detained and Disappeared Persons in Honduras (COFADEH) (an organization providing legal representation to Ms Velsquez Rodrguez s relatives), which notes that that no progress has been made in the case pending before the Office of the Special Prosecutor for Human Rights, and that the case continues to be met with impunity.
.Concerning recommendation (b) (with regard to the legal proceedings instituted against  teachers for the crimes of sedition and unlawful association, and their subsequent arrest while participating in a peaceful demonstration), the complainant organizations attach a copy of the Supreme Court of Justice ruling dated  May  ordering the dismissal of the proceedings against, and the unconditional release of, Mr Edgardo Antonio Casaa Meja, Mr Csar Agusto Ramos Cceres, Mr Alfonso Lpez Gillen, Mr Jos Alejandro Ventura and Mr Ren Recarte Barahonda, who had been charged with abuse of authority against the public administration.
.As to recommendation (c) (relating to the suspension of the economic regime set forth in the Honduran Teachers' Statute), the complainant organizations note that teachers have seen the purchasing power of their salaries fall as a consequence of the Government s failure to make the adjustments agreed in the Honduran Teachers' Statute and of the Government s historical debt.
.Concerning recommendation (e) (relating to an official communication sent by the National Commission of Banks and Securities in November ), the complainant organizations attach a copy of Circular No. / of the National Commission of Banks and Securities dated  April , which refers to Decree-Law No. -, which provides that the rights of those teachers who hold insurance policies through teachers' organizations shall be preserved or enhanced through the National Pension Institute for Teachers (INPREMA), provided that said teachers have requested and authorized the deduction of the corresponding premium from the pension savings account.
.Concerning recommendation (f) (declaration of the strikes as illegal by the administrative authority), the complainant organizations attach a copy of the ruling of the Administrative Disputes Court of  December  ordering the reinstatement of, and the payment of compensation and damages to,  teachers who had been temporarily suspended from their jobs in light of the strike being declared illegal by the State Secretariat for Labour and Social Security. The complainant organizations note that said ruling has yet to be applied.
.Concerning recommendation (i) (relating to the restrictions on the right of assembly of teachers' organizations and the victimization and harassment of teachers' representatives), the complainant organizations attached a copy of an official communication sent by the State Secretariat for Education on  March  to the departmental directors of education, in which it is stated that the use of school premises for meetings of political parties or teachers' organizations is prohibited.
.Furthermore, with reference to an allegation examined by the Committee in previous reports (the denial of the requests for renewal of union leave), the complainant organizations note that disciplinary proceedings were instituted against those teachers whose requests for renewal of union leave had been denied, and that some of them had already been dismissed. The complainant organizations attach a number of documents relating to the disciplinary proceedings instituted against the following teachers: Mr Elas Muoz Varela, Mr Jaime Atilio Rodrguez, Mr Edwin Emilio Oliva, Mr Eulogio Chvez Doblado, Mr Orlando Meja Velsquez, Mr Armando Gmez Torres and Mr Jury Heny Hernndez Troches. According to the attached documents: (i) the disciplinary proceedings were instituted because the teachers whose requests for renewal of union leave had been denied refused to return to work, and (ii) some of these proceedings remain pending.
.In its communications of  August ,  May  and  September , the Government conveyed the following information.
.With regard to recommendation (a), the Government reports that on  March , the Office of the Special Prosecutor for Offences Against Life instituted ex officio proceedings against Mr Carlos Eduardo Zelaya Ros on charges of culpable homicide. In these proceedings, it was determined that the death of the teacher, Ms Ilse Ivania Velsquez Rodrguez, while participating in a violent protest on  March  resulted from her being run over by a vehicle, by the accused Mr Ros, who was working for HCH media at the time, and who was convicted of culpable homicide on  August  (the case is currently before the enforcement",1,2013,Honduras
24,"court under case file No. --J).
.As to recommendation (b), the Government reports that information on the judicial proceedings instituted against  teachers remains outstanding, since not all of the accused had their cases dismissed.
.Concerning recommendation (c), the Government recalls that, in accordance with the Act on Fiscal and Financial Emergencies, contained in Decree-Law No.  of  March , the country was declared to be in a state of fiscal emergency, and that the automatic salary increase provided for in the economic regime under the Honduran Teachers' Statute was therefore deemed financially unsustainable. The Government notes that, while it is correct that said Decree-Law was valid for a period of one year, it has been extended. It also notes that it was not only the economic regime of the Honduran Teachers' Statute that was put on hold, but also the economic regimes linked to all the various professional statutes. Nevertheless, the Government reports that in September , the central Government approved a salary increase of  Honduran lempiras (HNL), and of an additional HNL, in September , bringing the total increase to HNL, within one year.
.With regard to recommendation (f) (declaration of the strike as illegal by the administrative authority), the Government indicates that this matter was referred to the State Secretariat for Labour and Social Security because the laws and regulations governing the employment relationship between the State and the national public education system do not include provisions on a procedure for declaring a strike illegal. Nevertheless, the Government notes that currently it has not had to have recourse to such measures.
.Concerning recommendation (h), the Government notes that there was no suppression whatsoever of the protests against the failure to pay salary increments from  to , and that the State Secretariat for Education does not have any record on file of any complaint that would provide evidence of acts of repression against the teachers.
.As regards the disciplinary proceedings against and dismissals of the teachers whose requests for renewal of union leave had been rejected, the Government notes that: (i) the requests for renewal of paid union leave were rejected because they exceeded the time limits provided for in the statute of the relevant teachers' organization; (ii) said union officials were entitled to request leave without pay; and (iii) the other teachers who were members of the executive committees were indeed granted paid union leave. The Government notes that disciplinary proceedings had been instituted against the teachers Mr Edwin Emilio Oliva, Mr Orlando Mejia Velsquez, Mr Armando Gmez Torres, Mr Jaime Atilio Rodrguez, Mr Jury Hernndez Trochez and Mr Eulogio Chvez Doblado because, after having been notified that their requests for renewal of leave had not been approved, they did not report for work, thereby abandoning their posts. The Government also notes that a number of those proceedings remain pending.
.The Committee recalls that the present case is part of a long-running dispute between teachers' organizations and the Government, which gave rise to protests and strikes during the period from  to , caused by the suspension of the economic regime set forth in the Honduran Teachers' Statute and the delays in the payment of salaries in arrears, among other factors. Further, the Committee recalls that the allegations that had remained pending in this case relate to: () the death of a trade unionist on  March , while she was participating in a peaceful demonstration; () the legal proceedings instituted against  teachers for the crimes of sedition and unlawful association, and their arrest while participating in a peaceful demonstration; () the suspension of the economic regime set forth in the Honduran Teachers' Statute, and its de-indexation from the minimum salary (preventing the continuing use of the minimum salary as a reference for the automatic and direct increase of salaries); () the failure to pay salary increments from  to  and the suppression of the protests to which this gave rise; () the declaration of the protests as illegal by the administrative authority and the resulting sanctions imposed on more than  teachers; () the suspension of the deductions of union dues for teachers' organizations; and () restrictions on the right of assembly of teachers' organizations and the victimization and harassment of teachers' representatives.
.As regards recommendation (a), relating to the death of Ms Ilse Ivania Velsquez Rodrguez on  March  while she was participating in a peaceful demonstration, the Committee notes that, although the complainant organizations indicate that no progress has been made on the case, which is pending before the Office of the Special Prosecutor for Human Rights, and that the case continues to be met with impunity, the Government indicates that it was determined in the ex officio judicial proceedings instituted on  March  by the Office of the Prosecutor for Offences Against Life that the death of the teacher, Ms Ilse Ivania Velsquez Rodrguez, resulted from her being run over by Mr Carlos Eduardo Zelaya Ros, who was working for HCH media at the time and who was convicted of culpable homicide on  August , and that his sentence is currently before the enforcement court. The Committee takes note of this information relating to the regrettable event, and, recalling the importance of imposing effective sanctions on those found guilty, it requests the Government to supply a copy of the verdict and to provide updated information on the enforcement of the sentence.
.Concerning recommendation (b), relating to the legal proceedings instituted against  teachers for the crimes of sedition and unlawful association, and their subsequent arrest while participating in a peaceful demonstration, the Committee takes note of the fact that, while the complainant organizations attached a copy of the ruling of the Supreme Court of Justice dated  May  ordering the dismissal of the proceedings against, and the unconditional release of, Mr Edgardo Antonio Casaa Meja, Mr Csar Agusto Ramos Cceres, Mr Alfonso Lpez Gillen, Mr Jos Alejandro Ventura and Mr Ren Recarte Barahonda, who had been charged with abuse of authority against the public administration, the Government indicates that information on the judicial proceedings instituted against  teachers remains pending, since not all of the accused had their cases dismissed. Taking note of the information provided by the complainant organizations, the Committee requests the Government and the complainant organizations to indicate which judicial proceedings remain pending and trusts that, pending final judgement, those persons who were accused have been released. Noting with concern that the imprisonment of the  teachers took place in , the Committee once again urges the Government to take all necessary measures to ensure that the ongoing legal proceedings can be concluded without further delay. The Committee requests the Government to provide information in this regard as soon as possible.
.As to recommendation (c) relating to the suspension of the economic regime set forth in the Honduran Teachers' Statute, the Committee takes note, firstly, that the complainant organizations state that teachers have seen the purchasing power of their salaries fall as a consequence of the non-payment of the salary increments agreed under said Statute. The Committee also notes the fact that the Government reports that: (i) in , in the context of a fiscal and financial crisis, Decree-Law No. - of  October  was issued, which suspended not only the economic regime of the Honduran Teachers' Statute, but also that of the statutes governing all the various professions; (ii) this suspension has been extended over the years (in its previous reports, the Committee took note of the explanations provided by the Government on this matter); and (iii) nevertheless, in September , the central Government approved a salary increment of  Honduran lempiras (HNL), and of an additional HNL, in September , amounting to a total of HNL, (the equivalent of US$) within one year. The Committee notes, however, that the Government does not indicate whether or not said increments resulted from wage negotiations. Recalling that Decree-Law No. - provides that salary adjustments shall be determined through negotiations with union organizations, the Committee reiterates its request to the Government and the complainant organizations that they seek a negotiated solution acceptable to all the parties concerned, in accordance with the principles of freedom of association. It requests the Government to inform it of the outcome of any negotiations entered into on the matter.
.The Committee notes that the Government has not sent its observations in relation to recommendation (d), regarding the scope of article  of Decree-Law No. - of  January , which prohibits the State Secretariat for Education, the State Secretariat for Finance and private schools from making any type of deductions payable to teachers' organizations that deviate from or are in excess of those established in the preceding article (article  of the Decree-Law provides that teachers may contribute a maximum of . per cent of their salary to teachers' organizations). In this regard, the Committee recalls that matters relating to the financing of trade union and employers' organizations, as regards both their own budgets and those of",-1,2013,Honduras
25,"federations and confederations, should be governed by the by-laws of the organizations, federations and confederations themselves, and therefore, constitutional or legal provisions which require contributions are incompatible with the principles of freedom of association [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , para. ]. Accordingly, in order to ensure that trade unions' right to organize their own administration is safeguarded, the Committee requests that the Government take the steps necessary to amend Decree-Law No. - in order to stipulate that the amount of the union dues of teachers' organizations shall be determined in accordance with their own by-laws. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the action taken in this regard.
.Concerning recommendation (e), the Committee had requested that the complainant organizations provide it with more detailed information as well as a copy of the official communication by the National Commission of Banks and Securities of November  which, according to the complainant organizations, mandated the transfer of the union dues accrued by each trade union organization to INPREMA, for those teachers who held a pension savings account. On this matter, the Committee notes that the complainant organizations only sent a copy of a circular of the National Commission of Banks and Securities dated April , but not of the official communication of November . In addition, the Committee notes that the attached circular of April  refers to Decree-Law No. -, which provides that the rights of those teachers who possess insurance policies through the teachers' organizations shall be preserved or enhanced through INPREMA, provided that said teachers have requested and authorized the deduction of the corresponding premium from the pension savings account. In this respect, recalling that in its previous examination of the case, the Committee took note of the Government s indication of the voluntary nature of the pension savings account, the Committee will not proceed with the examination of this allegation.
.With reference to recommendation (f), specifically in relation to the fact that the strike was declared illegal by the State Secretariat for Labour and Social Security, the Committee regrets that the Government merely indicates that this is explained by the fact that the laws and regulations governing the employment relationship between the State and the national public education system do not include provisions on a procedure for declaring a strike illegal. The Committee recalls that responsibility for declaring a strike illegal should not lie with the Government, but with an independent body which has the confidence of the parties involved [see Compilation, op. cit., para. ]. The Committee hence requests that the Government take the steps necessary to ensure that the responsibility for declaring a strike as legal or illegal lies not with the Government, but with an independent and impartial body.
.Moreover, with respect to the suspension of teachers from their duties as a result of the strike being declared illegal by the State Secretariat for Labour and Social Security, the Committee notes with concern that, according to the complainant organizations, the ruling of the Administrative Disputes Court of  December  ordering the reinstatement of, and payment of compensation and damages to, the  teachers who had been temporarily suspended from their jobs has yet to be applied. The Committee requests the Government to send detailed information on all the steps taken to ensure the effective implementation of the court ruling, including the reinstatement of the teachers in question.
.As to recommendation (h), relating to the suppression of protests against the failure to pay salary increments from  to , the Committee notes that, according to the Government, there was no suppression whatsoever of the protests, nor does the State Secretariat for Education have any record of any complaints that would provide evidence of acts of repression against the teachers. Accordingly, and considering that the complainant organizations did not provide specific information in this regard, the Committee will not proceed with the examination of this allegation.
.As regards recommendation (i), specifically in relation to allegations of restrictions on the right of assembly, the Committee notes that the complainant organizations attached a copy of an official communication sent by the State Secretariat for Education on  March  to the departmental directors of education, in which it is stated that the use of school premises for meetings of political parties or teachers' organizations is prohibited. In this regard, the Committee draws the Government s attention to the Workers' Representatives Recommendation,  (No. ), concerning the protection and facilities to be afforded to workers' representatives in the undertaking, which provides that the management should make available to workers' representatives such material facilities and information as may be necessary for the exercise of their functions. The Committee also recalls that the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ) lays down in Article  that such facilities shall be afforded to the representatives of recognized public employees organizations as may be appropriate in order to enable them to carry out their functions promptly and efficiently, both during and outside their hours of work, and that the granting of such facilities shall not impair the efficient operation of the administration or service concerned. [see Compilation, op. cit., paras  and ]. The Committee requests the Government to invite the teachers' organizations concerned and the authorities of the State Secretariat for Education to conduct negotiations with a view to reaching an agreement on arrangements for exercising the right of assembly.
.In addition, the Committee notes that, in their communication, the complainant organizations refer to an allegation that was examined in previous reports, concerning the rejection of the requests for renewal of union leave. Specifically, the complainant organizations indicate that those teachers whose requests for renewal of union leave had been rejected between  and  had had disciplinary proceedings instituted against them and had been dismissed.
.On this matter, firstly, the Committee recalls that in its previous reports, it had taken note of the Government s statements affirming that, between  and , union leave continued to be granted for trade union affairs whenever the applicants were entitled to it. Secondly, the Committee takes note of the fact that, according to information in the documents attached by the complainant organizations, and according to the Government, the disciplinary proceedings had been instituted against the teachers because, after being notified that their requests for renewal of leave had not been approved, the teachers did not report for work, thereby abandoning their posts. That is to say, the disciplinary proceedings resulted from the serious misconduct arising from the abandonment of post. In addition, the Committee notes that, according to the Government: (i) the requests for renewal of paid union leave had been rejected on grounds that the teachers had exceeded the time limits under the statutes of the relevant teachers' organizations (the Government does not indicate, however, what time limits are stipulated in those statues and to what extent they were exceeded); (ii) said union officials were entitled to request leave without pay; and (iii) the other teachers who were members of executive committees were granted paid leave. Taking account of the fact that, according to the documents attached by both the complainant organizations and the Government, some of the disciplinary proceedings remain pending, the Committee requests the Government and the complainants to keep it informed of developments in these proceedings.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee requests the Government to supply a copy of the verdict of  August  relating to the homicide of the teacher Ms Velsquez Rodrguez and to provide updated information on the enforcement of the sentence.(b)	The Committee requests the Government and the complainant organizations to indicate which of the judicial proceedings instituted against the  teachers remain pending and trusts that, pending final judgement, those persons who were accused have been released. The Committee once again urges the Government to take all necessary measures to ensure that any ongoing legal proceedings against teachers can be concluded without further delay. The Committee requests the Government to provide information in this regard as soon as possible.(c)	As to the suspension of the economic regime set forth in the Honduran Teachers' Statute pursuant to article  of Decree-Law No. - of  October , the Committee reiterates its request to the Government and to the complainant organizations to seek a negotiated solution acceptable to all the parties concerned, in accordance with the principles of freedom of association. It requests the Government to inform it of the outcome of any negotiations entered into on the matter.(d)	The Committee requests the Government to take the steps necessary to amend Decree-Law No. - of  January  in order to stipulate that the amount of the union dues of teachers' organizations shall be determined in accordance with their own by-laws. The Committee also requests the Government to keep it informed of the action taken in this regard.(e)	The Committee requests that the Government take the steps necessary to ensure that",0,2013,Honduras
26,"the responsibility for declaring a strike legal or illegal lies not with the Government, but with an independent and impartial body.(f)	The Committee requests the Government to submit detailed information on all the steps taken to ensure the effective implementation of the ruling of the Administrative Disputes Court of  December  ordering the reinstatement of, and payment of compensation and damages to, the  teachers who had been temporarily suspended from their jobs as a result of the strike being declared illegal.(g)	The Committee requests the Government to invite the teachers' organizations concerned and the authorities of the State Secretariat for Education to conduct negotiations with a view to reaching an agreement on the arrangements for exercising the right of assembly, including on the venue for trade union meetings.(h)	The Committee requests the Government and the complainants to keep it informed of the disciplinary proceedings instituted against the teachers whose requests for renewal of union leave were denied.
.The Committee last examined this case at its March  meeting, when it presented an interim report to the Governing Body [see th Report, paras  to ].
.One of the complainant organizations, the Single Confederation of Workers of Honduras (CUTH), submitted additional information in a communication dated  June .
.The Government submitted its observations in communications dated  and  April and  October .
.Honduras has ratified Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its previous examination of the case, the Committee made the following recommendations [see th Report, para. ]:(a) The Committee requests the complainant organizations to provide information in their possession on the death of Ms Ilse Ivania Velsquez Rodrguez and in particular whether it was due, as the Government states, to a car accident and whether anyone has been charged or detained in this regard.(b) As regards the legal proceedings instituted against  teachers for the crimes of sedition and unlawful association, and their subsequent detention, when they were participating in a peaceful demonstration, the Committee urges the Government to inform it without delay on the specific acts for which they are being prosecuted, on the status of the legal proceedings instituted and, where applicable, the outcome.(c) Concerning the dispute which is the subject of this complaint, the Committee notes the allegations relating to the suspension of the economic regime set forth in the Honduran Teachers' Statute, under section  of Decree-Law No. -, of  October , and to the failure to pay salary increases, the Committee requests the Government and the complainant organizations to seek a negotiated solution acceptable to all the parties concerned, in accordance with the principles of freedom of association laid down in the ratified Conventions on freedom of association and collective bargaining. The Committee expects that the parties will take full account of the principles referred to in its conclusions in the future and requests the Government to inform it of the outcome of the salary negotiations provided for in Decree-Law No. -, of  October .(d) As for the allegation regarding the suspension of the deduction of union dues for teachers' organizations, the Committee emphasizes that the suspension of the deduction of union dues infringes union rights; it therefore requests the Government to take the necessary steps, if it has not done so already, to ensure that all teachers' organizations once again benefit from the check-off facility for the union dues of their members.(e) As for the declaration of illegality made by the State Secretariat of the Labour and Social Security Departments, which led to the adoption of Executive Decision No. -SE-, of  October , and the subsequent imposition of sanctions involving salary deductions, temporary suspension or dismissal, as the case may be, affecting hundreds of teachers, the Committee requests the Government and the complainant organizations to seek a negotiated solution acceptable to all the parties concerned, in accordance with the principles of freedom of association laid down in the ratified Conventions on freedom of association and collective bargaining; it also requests the Government to take steps to amend the legislation so that the legality or illegality of the strike is declared by an independent body.(f) Concerning the allegations referring to the sending of inspectors to each lawfully convened assembly, by the State Secretariat of the Education Department, the Committee emphasizes that the presence of representatives of the authorities or the employer at union assemblies constitutes interference in violation of the principles of freedom of association laid down in ratified Conventions on freedom of association and collective bargaining. It requests the Government to ensure that such practices do not recur in the future.(g) As for the refusal of union leave requested by numerous officials, under circular letter No. -SE-, of  February , the Committee requests the Government to resume dialogue with the complainant organizations in order to find a prompt solution to this situation, and to inform it of the outcome of any legal proceedings instituted.(h) The Committee notes with regret that the Government s reply is not sufficiently clear as regards the allegations pertaining to: () the exclusion of teachers' organizations from the higher authority of the administration of INPREMA; and () the suppression of the protests resulting from the failure to pay salary increases from  to . The Committee firmly urges the Government to send its observations in this regard without delay, in particular information concerning the complaints submitted to the competent authorities by the persons who have been victims of police repression during the protests.(i) Moreover, the Committee requests the complainant organizations to provide more detailed information on the allegations concerning: () the unilateral suspension of the teacher selection and competitive recruitment boards; () the request for a report on the amounts, use and handling of the funds obtained as a result of the deductions transferred to teachers' organizations; () the institution of civil liability proceedings against four Trade Union of Honduran Teachers (SINPRODOH) officials, for an amount of HNL,,.; and () the alleged professional persecution with no further details against two members of the Association of Secondary Teachers of Honduras (COPEMH). The Committee requests the complainant organizations to furnish all information available to them in relation to these allegations, so that the Government may provide a precise response.(j) The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the communication dated  January  from the General Confederation of Workers (CGT), the Single Confederation of Workers of Honduras (CUTH) and other national organizations concerning allegations of sanctions against education trade unionists and other restrictions on trade union rights in relation to the dispute at hand.
.In a communication of  June , one of the complainant organizations, the CUTH provided additional information on some of the Committee s recommendations from its previous examination of the case (recommendations (a) to (e), (g) and (i)); it also presented fresh allegations concerning restrictions on the right of assembly, certain amendments to teachers' working conditions, and the criminalization of teachers.
.With respect to the Committee s recommendation (a), the complainant explains that during a teachers' demonstration, Ms Ilse Ivania Velsquez Rodrguez suffered a blow to the head which caused her to lose her balance and fall to the ground prior to the collision [in a context of police repression]; according to the autopsy report, the cause of death was a cerebral oedema, which the complainant organization attributes to the blow she suffered prior to the collision. The complainant adds that the authorities have not yet provided any information about any arrest or prosecution.
.As to recommendation (b), the complainant organization reports that the  accused teachers remain in detention, that the legal proceedings have suffered delays which have postponed the hearings arbitrarily, and that the teachers were anxious at the prospect of being convicted.
.Concerning recommendation (c), the complainant indicates that there has not been any communication from the Government with a view to initiating the salary negotiations provided for in Decree-Law No. - of  October ; there has been no salary increase since .
.Regarding recommendation (d), the complainant organization states that the Government is still not deducting union dues, which has been the case since February ; consequently, no transfers have been made to the teachers' organizations. Furthermore, it notes that the Act on the National Social Welfare Institute for Teachers (INPREMA), as amended by Decree-Law No. - of  January , contains arbitrary provisions on union dues, imposing a limit on the number of members per organization and a contribution rate of . Honduran lempiras (HNL).

.With respect to recommendation (g), the complainant organization alleges that union leave requested by numerous officials is still being denied.
.Regarding recommendation (h)(), the complainant organization reports that the Government administers the INPREMA unilaterally, and alleges that the teachers' organizations participate merely as members of the assembly of participants.
.As to recommendation (i)(), the complainant organization explains",-1,2013,Honduras
27,"that, by communication of  September , the State Secretariat of the Department of Education sought to authorize the members of the teacher selection boards in only five of the country s  departments.
.Furthermore, the complainant organization alleges that the right of assembly of teachers' organizations is being restricted and that teachers' representatives are still being victimized and harassed, as they are prohibited from convening meetings outside of working hours and are being denied leave to attend meetings. The complainant also presents a series of allegations concerning changes to working conditions.
.In communications dated  and  April and  October , the Government conveyed the following information.
.With regard to recommendation (a) from the Committee s previous examination of the case, the Government reiterates that the death of Ms Ilse Ivania Velsquez Rodrguez was caused by a vehicle collision, and appends forensic report No. A-- of the Department of Forensic Medicine. Furthermore, it indicates that a driver, Mr Carlos Eduardo Zelaya Ros, has been charged with culpable homicide and the case is pending a final judgment from the trial court.
.With regard to recommendation (b), the Government indicates that the legal proceedings instituted against  teachers for the crimes of sedition and unlawful association when they participated in a demonstration have not yet concluded.
.As to recommendation (c), the Government informs the Committee that Decree-Law No. - of  March , containing the Act on Fiscal and Financial Emergencies has been extended repeatedly, and consequently the economic regime set forth in the Honduran Teachers' Statute remains suspended. The Government explains that the policy on salary increases has been progressive, subject to the economic circumstances of the State; that being the case, the last salary increment for teachers was approved in July .
.Concerning recommendation (d), the Government indicates that the suspension of the deduction of union dues for teachers' organizations was temporary, owing to the change in the internal payment system in the human resources department of the State Secretariat of the Department of Education. It explains that the purpose of Decree-Law No. - of  January , which contains the reforms to the Act on the National Pension Institute for Teachers (INPREMA), is not to deny the right to membership of a teachers' organization, but to protect the teachers' investments; nor does it prohibit the granting of pension benefits by teachers' organizations. The Government adds that teachers' participation in pension savings accounts is voluntary.
.With reference to recommendation (e), the Government indicates that the legal provisions governing the employment relationship between the State and the national public education system do not include a means of declaring a collective work stoppage illegal, and that that is the responsibility of the State Secretariat of the Departments of Labour and Social Security as the competent authority. The Government refutes the statement of the CUTH and indicates that no teachers have been sanctioned merely for having attended meetings held by teachers' associations. It explains that the sanctions imposed pursuant to the decision in question concern only those teachers who had left schools in .
.Concerning recommendation (f), the Government indicates that the allegations referring to the State Secretariat of the Department of Education sending inspectors to each lawfully convened assembly have not been proven. It adds that the teachers' meetings are held in public places and hence any interested party may attend.
.As to recommendation (g), the Government indicates that during the period of  to , it continued to grant leave for trade union affairs whenever the applicants were entitled to it. It adds that more than  teachers' representatives currently enjoy paid union leave.
.As to recommendation (h)(), the Government explains that the board of specialists is the higher level authority of INPREMA for administration and implementation, which is the executive and participatory body of the assembly of participants and contributing members. It adds that the teachers' organizations are part of the assembly of participants and contributing members, with influence over the institute s strategic policy. The Government indicates that membership of both organs is incompatible with the law.
.Concerning the unilateral suspension of teacher selection boards and competitive recruitment examinations (recommendation (i)()), the Government indicates that the boards have been established and explains that the legislation does not exclude teachers' organizations from participating.
.With regard to recommendation (j) from the previous examination of the case, the Government provides the following information:' Concerning the sanctions placed on the five teaching union officials from the department of Corts ' Ms Reina Isabel Discua, Mr Jos Antonio Carvallo, Mr Jos Antonio Alas, Mr Wilson Meja Fiallos and Mr Reynaldo Inestrosa ' it indicates that the administrative proceedings are ongoing. To date, no sanctions have been placed on the aforementioned teachers, who are not teaching union officials, and there is no evidence that they are entitled to union leave. The disciplinary proceedings were initiated by the Education Directorate of the department of Corts on the grounds of alleged failure to perform their duties (of the directorate and subdirectorate of schools) and of resisting orders issued by the competent authority.' As to the suspension of the deputy director of the Instituto Central Vicente Cceres, Mr Valentn Canales Bustillo, the Government explains that the disciplinary proceedings were initiated because he had not taken over the leadership of the institute as required by law. Mr Canales Bustillo was reinstated after complying with the sanction that had been imposed.' Concerning the publication in the Official Journal of  regulations of the Basic Law on Education, the Government recalls that under that law, the secretariat of the Department of Education shall issue the corresponding regulations. The regulations in question do not diminish or restrict the rights recognized in the Constitution; furthermore, they were adopted after a process of consultation with various sectors of the teaching profession, parents and civil society.' With regard to the official communication sent by the National Commission of Banks and Securities in November  mandating the transfer of the union dues accrued by each trade union organization to INPREMA, where teachers had opted for a pension savings account, the Government informs the Committee that the pension savings account is a personalized account which enhances the financial gains of the participants when they retire, and that teachers' participation is voluntary.
.With reference to the allegations of restrictions on the right of assembly of teachers' organizations, continued victimization and harassment of teachers' representatives, prohibition on holding meetings outside of working hours and refusal of leave to attend meetings, the Government categorically rejects the allegations; it clarifies that the intended use of school facilities is for children, and that no applications for teacher training days had been received.
.As to the allegations of changes to working conditions, the Government explains that there have been no such changes; the legislation in force was merely being applied. As to entry into the teaching profession, it states that the new arrangements are on the basis of a competitive examination.
.The Committee recalls that, in the present case, the complaints form part of a long dispute between teachers' organizations and the Government, which gave rise to protests and strikes during the period from  to , caused by the suspension of the economic regime set forth in the Honduran Teachers' Statute and the delays in the payment of salaries in arrears, among other factors. Further, the Committee recalls that the allegations still pending in this case relate to: () the death of a trade unionist on  March , while she was participating in a peaceful demonstration; () the legal proceedings instituted against  teachers for the crimes of sedition and unlawful association, and their arrest while participating in a peaceful demonstration; () the exclusion of teachers' organizations from the higher level authority of the administration of the INPREMA; () the suspension of the economic regime set forth in the Honduran Teachers' Statute, and its de-indexation from the minimum salary (preventing the continuing use of the minimum salary as a reference for the automatic and direct increase of salaries); () the failure to pay salary increments from  to  and the suppression of the protests to which this gave rise; () the declaration of the protests as illegal by the administrative authority and the resulting sanctions imposed on more than  teachers; () the suspension of the deductions of union fees for teachers' organizations; () the adoption of Decision No. -SE- of  July , which provides for the extension of the school year in the case of stoppages or suspensions of classes; () the refusal of requests for renewal of union leave; () the unilateral suspension of teacher selection boards and competitive examinations; () the request for a report on the amounts, use and handling of the funds obtained as a result of the deductions transferred to teachers' organizations; () the civil liability claims brought against four SINPRODOH officials, for an amount of HNL,,.; () the workplace harassment of two members of the COPEMH; and () the sanctions against trade unionists in the teaching profession and other restrictions on trade union rights.
.With regard",-1,2013,Honduras
28,"to recommendation (a), the Committee observes that both the complainant organization and the Government concur that the death of Ms Ilse Ivania Velsquez Rodrguez was caused by a cerebral oedema. However, the Committee notes a contradiction in the account of the circumstances leading to her death: the complainant organization alleges that prior to the collision, the victim suffered a blow to the head which caused her to lose her balance and fall onto the roadway, in a context of political repression, and attributes the cerebral oedema to the blow to the head; whereas the Government denies that there was any political repression and attributes the cerebral oedema solely to the collision. The Committee notes that according to the information provided by the Government, a driver has been charged with culpable homicide and a final judgment is pending. The Committee recalls that  [t]he killing, disappearance or serious injury of trade union leaders and trade unionists requires the institution of independent judicial inquiries in order to shed full light, at the earliest date, on the facts and the circumstances in which such actions occurred and in this way, to the extent possible, determine where responsibilities lie, punish the guilty parties and prevent the repetition of similar events' [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ]. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the legal proceedings.
.Concerning recommendation (b), the Committee notes that, according to the information provided by the complainant organization, the teachers remain in detention and the legal proceedings have suffered delays; the Government has not denied the situation and only indicates that the proceedings have not concluded. The Committee recalls that  justice delayed is justice denied' [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. Observing with concern that the imprisonment of  teachers took place in  and that the Government still does not provide information on the specific acts imputed to them, the Committee emphasizes that prolonged detention of persons awaiting trial involves a risk of abuse. Thus, the Committee expects that all necessary measures are taken so that the ongoing legal proceedings can be concluded without further delay and that measures for conditional release are provided if the judicial decisions are not taken in the near future. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.As to recommendation (c), the Committee notes the complainant organization s statement that there has not been any communication from the Government, and the Government s explanation of the extension of the suspension of the economic regime set forth in the Honduran Teachers' Statute and the need to adapt to the economic circumstances of the State. The Committee reiterates its request to the Government and the complainant organizations to seek a negotiated solution acceptable to all the parties concerned, in accordance with the principles of freedom of association laid down in the ratified Conventions on freedom of association and collective bargaining. Furthermore, it requests the Government to inform it of the outcome of any relevant negotiations entered into.
.Concerning recommendation (d), the Committee notes the divergence between the allegations of a continued suspension of the deduction of union dues and the Government s response that the suspension was temporary. In this connection, the Committee observes that the Government submits documentary evidence, signed by the deputy director of human resources for teaching of the State Secretariat of the Department of Education, indicating that teachers' payroll deductions corresponding to their union contributions to the respective teachers' organizations were functioning normally. Taking account of this documentary evidence, while expressing regret for any suspension that occurred and trusting that the deductions will be made as normal, the Committee, not having received any additional information from the complainant organizations in this regard, will not pursue its examination of this allegation.
.Furthermore, concerning the allegations that the Act on the National Social Welfare Institute for Teachers (INPREMA), as amended by Decree-Law No. - of  January , contains arbitrary provisions on union dues, the Committee observes that, under article  of that decree,  the State Secretariat of the Department of Education, the State Secretariat of the Department of Finance and private schools shall be prohibited from making any type of deductions payable to teachers' organizations that deviate from or are in excess of those established in the preceding article. The State Secretariat of the Department of Education shall so inform the relevant authorities and the private schools, where applicable, in order that the automatic deductions be cancelled for the duration of any such irregularity for those teachers' organizations not complying with the provisions of the preceding article'  The Committee recalls that  a legal restriction on the amount which a federation may receive from the unions affiliated to it would appear to be contrary to the generally accepted principle that workers' organizations shall have the right to organize their administration and activities and those of the federations which they form' [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. The Committee requests the Government to submit its observations on this matter without delay, in particular as to the scope of article  of Decree-Law No. - of  January , to clarify how trade unions' right to organize their administration is safeguarded.
.Furthermore, regarding the allegations concerning the official communication sent by the National Commission of Banks and Securities in November  mandating the transfer of the union dues accrued by each trade union organization to INPREMA, where teachers had opted for a pension savings account, the Committee notes the Government s indication that the pension savings account is voluntary and requests the complainant organization to provide more detailed information, including a copy of the official communication to which it refers.
.With regard to recommendation (e), the Committee notes the Government s explanations as to the limited scope of sanctions under Executive Decision No. -SE- of  October ; the declaration of illegality of a collective work stoppage; and the jurisdiction of the State Secretariat of the Departments of Labour and Social Security in that regard. The Committee recalls that responsibility for declaring a strike illegal should not lie with the Government, but with an independent and impartial body. The Committee once again requests the Government to take measures to amend the legislation such that the legality or illegality of a strike is declared by an independent body.
.With respect to recommendation (f), the Committee notes that the Government is of the opinion that the allegations have not been proven by the complainant organizations, and that any interested party may attend the meetings in question as they are held in public places. While recalling that where a representative of the public authorities can attend trade union meetings, this may influence the deliberations and the decisions taken (especially if this representative is entitled to participate in the proceedings) and hence may constitute an act of interference incompatible with the principle of freedom to hold trade union meetings [see Digest, op. cit., para. ], the Committee once again requests the Government to ensure that such practices do not recur in the future.
.Concerning recommendation (g), the Committee notes the statement of the Government maintaining that, between  and , union leave continued to be granted for trade union affairs whenever the applicants were entitled to it. Therefore, unless the complainant organizations provide additional information in this regard, the Committee will not pursue its examination of this allegation.
.As to recommendation (h), the Committee notes the Government s explanation concerning the inclusion of teachers' organizations in the assembly of participants and contributing members, one of the management and administrative bodies of INPREMA. Therefore, the Committee will not pursue its examination of this allegation.
.The Committee notes that the Government makes no reference to the complaints made by victims of repression during the protests against the failure to pay salary increments from  to . The Committee once again urges the Government to submit its observations without delay, in particular providing information on the complaints submitted to the competent authorities by the persons who suffered police repression during the protests.
.With reference to recommendation (i), the Committee recalls that it requested the complainant organizations to provide more detailed information on the allegations concerning: () the unilateral suspension of the teacher selection boards and competitive examinations; () the request for a report on the amounts, use and handling of the funds obtained as a result of the deductions transferred to teachers' organizations; () the institution of civil liability proceedings against four officials of the SINPRODOH, for an amount of HNL,,.; and () the allegations, without further details, of workplace harassment of two members of the COPEMH (recommendation (i)) so that the Government may accurately respond to them. In the absence of comprehensive information requested from the complainants, and noting the information from the Government indicating that the boards have been established and explaining that the legislation does not exclude the participation of trade union organizations, the Committee will not pursue its examination of these allegations.
.With regard",-1,2013,Honduras
29,"to recommendation (j), the Committee notes the information provided by the Government concerning: () the five teachers from the department of Corts subject to disciplinary proceedings for alleged failure to perform their duties and resisting orders issued by the competent authority, where the Government clarifies that the persons concerned are not officials of teaching unions, that they do not appear to be entitled to union leave and that no sanctions have been placed on them; () the reinstatement of the deputy director of the Instituto General Vicente Cceres, after he complied with the sanction that had been imposed; () the adoption and publication of  regulations of the Basic Law on Education, in accordance with the relevant law, through a process of consultation with various sectors. In such circumstances, the Committee will not pursue its examination of these allegations.
.As to the fresh allegations of restrictions on the right of assembly of teachers' organizations, continued victimization and harassment of teachers' representatives, prohibition on holding meetings outside of working hours and refusal of leave to attend meetings, the Committee requests the complainant organizations to provide more detailed information.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee again invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the legal proceedings concerning the death of Ms Ilse Ivania Velsquez Rodrguez.(b) Concerning the legal proceedings instituted against  teachers for the crimes of sedition and unlawful association, and their subsequent arrest while participating in a peaceful demonstration, the Committee expects that all necessary measures are taken so that the ongoing legal proceedings can be concluded without further delay and that measures for conditional release are provided if the judicial decisions are not taken in the near future. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.(c) As to the suspension of the economic regime set forth in the Honduran Teachers' Statute, pursuant to article  of Decree-Law No. - of  October , the Committee reiterates its request to the Government and complainant organizations to seek a negotiated solution acceptable to all the parties concerned, in accordance with the principles of freedom of association laid down in the ratified Conventions on freedom of association and collective bargaining. It requests the Government to inform it of the outcome of any negotiations entered into on the matter.(d) Concerning the arbitrary provisions on union dues under Decree-Law No. - of  January , the Committee requests the Government to send its observations without delay, in particular on the scope of article  of the decree in question, to inform the Committee how trade unions' right to organize their administration is safeguarded.(e) Regarding the sending of an official communication by the National Commission of Banks and Securities in November  mandating the transfer of the union dues accrued by each trade union organization to INPREMA, where teachers had opted for a pension savings account, the Committee requests the complainant organization to provide more detailed information, including a copy of the official communication to which it refers.(f) With regard to the declaration of illegality by the State Secretariat of the Departments of Labour and Social Security which led to the adoption of Executive Decision No. -SE- of  October , and the subsequent imposition of the sanctions of salary deductions, temporary suspension or dismissal, as the case may be, affecting hundreds of teachers, the Committee once again requests the Government to take measures to amend the legislation such that the legality or illegality of a strike is declared by an independent body.(g) Concerning the allegations that the State Secretariat of the Department of Education sends inspectors to each lawfully convened assembly, the Committee, recalling that the presence of a representative of the public authorities or of the employer in trade union meetings constitutes an act of interference incompatible with the principle of freedom to hold trade union meetings laid down in ratified Conventions on freedom of association and collective bargaining, once again requests the Government to ensure that such practices do not recur in the future.(h) As to the suppression of protests against the failure to pay salary increments from  to , the Committee once again urges the Government to submit its observations without delay, in particular providing information on the complaints submitted to the competent authorities by the persons who suffered police repression during the protests.(i) Moreover, the Committee requests the complainant organization to provide more detailed information on the allegations concerning: () the sending of an official communication by the National Commission of Banks and Securities in November  mandating the transfer of the union dues accrued by each trade union organization to INPREMA, where teachers had opted for a pension savings account; and () the restrictions on the right of assembly of teachers' organizations and the victimization and harassment of teachers' representatives.

.EI and the FOMH denounce the death of Ms Ilse Ivania Velsquez Rodrguez, a teacher affiliated to the COLPROSUMAH, which occurred on  March , when she was participating in a peaceful demonstration called by teachers' organizations of Honduras against the new INPREMA Act. To date, no one has been convicted as a result of Ms Velsquez Rodrguez s death.
.EI and the FOMH denounce the legal proceedings instituted against  teachers for the crimes of sedition and unlawful association, after the teachers were arrested during a peaceful demonstration called by organizations affiliated to union federations. Various teachers were detained in the COLPROSUMAH vehicle, just as they were planning to move to the Supreme Court of Justice, as part of the demonstration, to submit an action for constitutional protection (amparo) against the INPREMA Act.

EI and the FOMH emphasize that the latter Decree-Law orders the de-indexation of the minimum salary, as a result of which the minimum salary cannot henceforth be used as a reference for an automatic increase in salaries. On  May , the SINPRODOH lodged an administrative appeal with the State Secretariat of the Education Department, representing , teachers, prior to legal action for violation of the Honduran Teachers' Statute, demanding payment of the salary increases for the years in arrears.
.The complainant organizations allege that the State Secretariat of the Labour and Social Security Departments decided to declare the protest movements illegal and threaten to sanction the teachers by means of dismissal. More than  teachers were sanctioned in the form of suspension without pay for a period of six months. Through the State Secretariat of the Education Department, the Government issued Executive Decision No. -SE-, of  October , which sanctioned hundreds of teachers who participated in the protest movement by means of a deduction in their wages and dismissal from their posts. EI and the FOMH allege that the sanction was published before the sanctioned teachers had the opportunity to be heard in court.

.In addition, EI and the FOMH denounce the adoption of Executive Decision No.  SE , of  July , which provides for the extension of the school year in the case of stoppages or class suspensions. The State Secretariat of the Education Department sends inspectors to each assembly lawfully convened by the organizations, so that they may produce a record of proceedings. The records are used to impose salary deductions or to suspend teachers.
.The complainant organizations denounce the refusal of the requests for renewal of paid leave:(a) FLATEC states that the State Secretariat of the Education Department ordered, in circular letter No. -SE-, of  February , that the paid leave of Mr Bertn Alfaro Bonilla, Mr Santos Blas Oviedo Rivas and Mr Gaeri Jonathan Duarte, SINPRODOH officials, not be renewed, following the submission of the request on  January  to the Trujillo district education department and regional education departments of El Paraso and Yoro.

.As regards the death of Ms Ilse Ivania Velsquez Rodrguez, the Government states that her death was caused by a young, reckless driver, who hit her while driving against the flow of traffic. A forensic report of the Public Prosecutor s Office concluded that Ms Velsquez Rodrguez died from a blow caused by the impact of her falling onto the roadway. It excludes the possibility that, prior to Ms Velsquez Rodrguez s fall, she had been hit by an object designed for use by the military or police.
.As for the detention of  teachers for the crimes of sedition and unlawful association, the Government explains that they were arrested for assaulting several police officers with mortar rockets. The",-1,2013,Honduras
31,"teachers attempted to flee, but they were stopped by a police patrol. In the car that the teachers were driving, mortar, gasoline and tyres were found, among other things. The Government adds that according to a legal source the mortars that were found were highly explosive, able to cause blindness, deafness, bodily harm and even death. The Government considers that the teachers were treated in the same way as any citizen who would have committed such crimes would have been treated and that due process was respected at all times. To date, no teacher has been convicted of the aforementioned crimes.
.Regarding the exclusion of teachers' organizations from the INPREMA board of specialists, following the reforms contained in Decree No. - of  December , which contains the INPREMA Act, the Government explains that the reforms were based on actuarial studies carried out by the National Commission of Banks and Securities (CNBS), and that they were disseminated among the teachers' unions in . The Government explains that the measures taken guarantee the effective development of INPREMA as an autonomous entity.
.As for the suspension of the economic regime set forth in the Honduran Teachers' Statute, the Government explains that the Act on Fiscal and Financial Emergencies, contained in Decree-Law No. -, of  March , declared that the country was in a state of fiscal emergency, so as to tackle in a comprehensive and responsible manner the fiscal and financial crisis which the public finances were undergoing, and in order to re establish a balance and reactivate sustainable economic growth, through the adoption of extraordinary fiscal and financial measures. The provisions of the Act on Fiscal and Financial Emergencies are to be strictly applied by the legislative, executive and judicial authorities, with their respective dependent institutions and bodies, at the national level. Furthermore, Decree-Law No. -, of  October , suspends, as long as it is in force, the economic regimes established in the different professional statutes. Those economic regimes are fiscal measures that were taken on the basis of the minimum salary increases agreed between employers and workers, or fixed by the President of the Republic, as appropriate; they have served as a reference for the automatic and direct increase in salaries envisaged for public servants protected by special laws or rules, to the detriment of the budgets of centralized and decentralized state institutions, since the activities undertaken are not based on the spirit and rationale which inspire the meaning and scope of the Act on Minimum Salaries, and because they have a strong impact on the public finances of the State of Honduras, which relies on an annual income and expenditure budget. During the process of setting the minimum wage for , the National Minimum Wage Commission considered that the economic impact of the automatic increase in wages under those economic regimes was financially unsustainable for the State, which was why it suggested adopting measures to separate the economic regimes from agreements related to the setting of the minimum wage.
.As regards the administrative appeal lodged by the SINPRODOH, representing around , teachers, which requested the back payment of salaries with their respective collateral benefits, and a bonus for the commercial interest generated by the sums of money in arrears, the Government states that the administrative appeal in question was declared receivable by the State Secretariat of the Education Department, in a ruling dated  August . The case was transferred thereby to the subdepartment of human resources in charge of the teaching profession and the administrative office of the State Secretariat so that they could report as to whether the teachers in question were owed the payment they demanded, pursuant to article  of the Administrative Procedure Act. In a ruling of  March , the reports of the offices in question were received and, for the sake of clarity, the case was submitted to the State Secretariat of the Finance Department so that it could issue a decision determining whether the payment in the form of salary increases corresponded to the respective collateral, backdated to ' , bearing in mind that salary increases are the prerogative of the executive authority, according to the State s economic capacity. The Under-Secretariat for Finance and Budget reported, in letter No.  DGP AE, dated  June , that the appeal lodged by the SINPRODOH members could not, and should not, be accepted, as the country s financial situation did not allow for further and greater commitments beyond those contained in the National General Income and Expenditure Budget. A decision to that effect was taken on  June , by the Under-Secretariat for Finance and Budget, and the case was passed on to the Legal Services Unit of the State Secretariat of the Education Department for legal advice prior to the final decision. Once the trial period requested on  July  by the legal representative of the SINPRODOH had elapsed, without the period having been used by the party concerned, an order was issued as per the provisions of the ruling of  June  (legal advice and decision).
.Concerning the declaration of the protest movements as illegal and the sanctions imposed under Executive Decision No. -SE-, of  October , the Government explains that the State Secretariat of the Labour and Social Security Departments declared the strikes and protests launched by the teachers' representatives in the past two years to be illegal. The administrative procedure, provided for in national legislation for the application of the corresponding sanctions, was then launched. A state of emergency in the national public education system was declared at all levels, excluding the higher level, by Executive Decree No. PCM--, of  March . On the basis of section  of the Labour Code, paragraph one of which states:  where a work suspension has been declared illegal, the employer shall be free to dismiss on such grounds those persons who have intervened or participated in the suspension  ? the State Secretariat of the Education Department issued Executive Decision No. -SE-, of  October , by which it was agreed to deduct from their monthly salary the days not worked by those teachers if, according to the acts recorded, it is established that they did not report for duty on ,  and  August, and that the number of days of absence does not exceed two. In addition, in those cases where the teacher has failed to report for work, without good cause, for two whole and consecutive days or three working days in a month, that is the dates indicated above, the employment contract with the State Secretariat of the Education Department shall be deemed terminated, with no liability on the part of the above institution, pursuant to all the above sanctions, failures and dismissals.
.As regards the allegations concerning suspension of union dues, the Government explains that, owing to the extra deductions imposed on teaching staff by teachers' unions and other banking and financial deductions, delays in the payment of teaching staff occurred, as a result of the tardiness of these organizations to report. The State Secretariat of the Education Department therefore issued Decision No. -SE-, of  December . A decision was taken to suspend temporarily the voluntary deductions granted to Honduran teachers' unions, excluding the mandatory dues such as those of INPREMA, the Honduran Social Security Institute (IHSS), union contributions, and other legal and judicial fees. The Government clarifies that, having received the reports requested by the State Secretariat of the Education Department for this purpose, voluntary deductions were resumed for the COPRUMH and the Teachers' College of Honduras (COLPEDAGOGOSH).
.Concerning the adoption of Decision No. -SE-, of  June , which provides for the extension of the school year in the case of stoppages or suspensions of classes, the Government states that the actions of the State Secretariat of the Education Department have been motivated by the desire to the right to education. The fact that, in the country, millions of young boys and girls and adults continue to be deprived of education opportunities, in many cases owing to poverty, together with the constant stoppages, strikes and occupation of education centres by teachers' representatives, has generated chaos in the education system in the past three years. The State Secretariat of the Education Department is endeavouring to achieve fulfilment of the right to education and the minimum time in terms of class days, which section  of the Regulations under the Honduran Teachers' Statute establishes as actual working time during the school year (that is ten months, with a minimum of  working days), for which reason it has taken action to guarantee the country s education, as envisaged in the Honduran Teachers' Statute and the Regulations thereunder.
.As for the refusal of the requests for renewal of paid union leave, the Government indicates that department directors, department secretariats and subdepartments of human resources in charge of teachers were informed, by circular letter No. -SE-, of  February , that in order to grant paid",-1,2013,Honduras
32,"union leave to teachers who occupy posts in the national executive boards of union organizations, consideration should be given to section ()(d) of the Honduran Teachers' Statute, which refers to paid leave for those occupying managerial positions for the duration of the post. Consequently, this should be applied within the framework of the basic law of each teaching organization determining post duration. In this regard, section  of the Regulations under the Honduran Teachers' Statute states:  All the legal provisions contained in article  of the Law shall be applied in each case by the immediate higher authority which, in turn, shall inform the corresponding authority accordingly.' The above circular letter was challenged before the State Secretariat of the Education Department and the appeal was declared not to be receivable as it did not meet the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act.
.The Government refutes the allegation that circular letter No. -SE-, of  February , ordered the non-renewal of union leave for certain teachers in particular, such as the SINPRODOH officials, Mr Bertn Alfaro Bonilla, Mr Gaeri Jonathan Duarte and Mr Santos Blas Oviedo Rivas. The Government explains that action was taken to investigate whether the teachers had abandoned their jobs in the education centres, following failures or abandonment on the part of many teachers, and the constant complaints made by children s parents, in observance of the provisions of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. However, the Government clarifies that the leave requested by Mr Grebil Escobar del Cid, Secretary for Finance of PRICPHMA, was granted.
.The Government states that, while Mr Armando Gmez Torres, President of PRICPHMA, Mr Orlando Meja Velsquez, Secretary-General of PRICPHMA, and Mr Cesar Augusto Ramos, Secretary for Legal Affairs of PRICPHMA, held posts as teachers' representatives and were on paid union leave, they illegally obtained new teaching positions in schools where they never reported for work. Furthermore, specific records show that on ,  and  February , none of the three teachers reported for work. Mr Jury Hernndez Troches, Secretary for the Environment of PRICPHMA, committed serious misconduct consisting of dereliction of duty from  February  onwards. Mr Edwin Emilio Oliva, President of COLPROSUMAH, Mr Martin Suazo Sandoval, Secretary for Advertising of COLPROSUMAH, and Mr Gaeri Jonathan Duarte of the SINPRODOH also committed serious misconduct consisting of dereliction of duty, which is why they were dismissed.
.The Government emphasizes that the leave requested by Mr Rufino Murillo, Secretary for Internal Affairs of PRICPHMA, was refused because it was requested in order to take up a position that was not part of the PRICPHMA executive board. In the case of Mr Walter Edgardo Rivera, Secretary for Advertising of PRICPHMA, the Court of Appeal for Administrative Disputes ordered a stay of proceedings prior to the request being resolved. Mr Murillo and Mr Rivera were not sanctioned and still have an employment relationship with the State Secretariat of the Education Department.
.The Government states that some representatives returned to their workplaces when the regional departments decided not to extend their paid leave, including Mr Edgardo Antonio Casaa, President of COPRUMH; Mr Otto Omar Cayetano, Vice-President of COPRUMH; Mr Oscar Geovanny Alemn, Secretary for Finance of COPRUMH, Mr Carlos Hernn Izaguirre, Legal Adviser of COPRUMH, and Ms Denia Esmeralda Galindo, Secretary for Disputes of COPRUMH.
.Concerning the actions for constitutional protection (amparo), filed against the State Secretariat of the Education Department by the teachers' representatives whose union leave was not renewed, in connection with the administrative disciplinary proceedings instituted against various teachers, including those of the SINPRODOH, it has emerged that the Supreme Court of Justice has declared them to be not receivable, since the administrative channels have not been exhausted prior to the judicial remedies. Concerning the request submitted by Mr Bertn Alfaro Bonilla for , the Government states that the Director of the education department of Yoro requested a report from the department secretariat indicating how many years Mr Alfaro Bonilla had obtained leave for. The response was that the period was from  to  (that is eight consecutive years). Nevertheless, section () of the Labour Code states:  Where a worker holds union management positions, the leave shall last for as long as the worker stays in his post. The employer shall be forbidden to pay a salary for this purpose. The leave in question shall be requested by the individual union organization ... .' For that reason, Decision No. -, of  February , declared the request for paid leave to be non-receivable, under section  of the Regulations of the Honduran Teachers' Statute which states:  All the legal provisions contained in article  of the law (the Honduran Teachers' Statute) shall be applied in each case by the immediate higher authority.' Decision No. /DOS/ issued by the State Secretariat of the Labour and Social Security Departments refers to the SINPRODOH statutes, section  of which grants a period of three years, with re-election for a further period to any post, with a total or partial break of three years before applying for a new post on the central executive board. Mr Alfaro Bonilla completed his two periods on  November  and cannot therefore continue to obtain paid union leave. The leave refused is that which corresponds to the post of director of the Jos Trinidad Reyes school, located in the village of Las Delicias, El Negrito municipality, department of Yoro, for which reason he is expected to report to the education centre. The Government is unaware whether Mr Alfaro Bonilla occupies other posts within national or international union organizations. Having finalized the process, the regional department of Yoro issued Decision No. -D.D.E.Y.-, whereby Mr Alfaro Bonilla was dismissed for abandoning his post and an order to issue an annulment agreement was given owing to the dismissal of the director of the Jos Trinidad Reyes education centre. On  May , an appeal was lodged against that decision and the case was submitted to the State Secretariat of the Education Department on  June .
.As regards the money owed by the Government to teachers, the Government recognizes that the delay in teachers' monthly payments has been one of the main problems faced by the State Secretariat of the Education Department. The Government explains that the delay (that is the failure to pay on the th day of each month) affected teachers at the national level and that their unrest was understandable. Faced with this situation, the State Secretariat of the Education Office issued Decision No.  SE , of  December , which temporarily suspended the voluntary deductions for teachers to Honduran teachers' unions, excluding mandatory dues such as those of INPREMA, the IHSS, union contributions and other legal and court fees.
.Regarding the teacher selection boards, the Government clarifies that the State Secretariat of the Education Department began a  teacher reorganization' process, which aimed to return teachers assigned to other education establishments to the schools where they had been originally appointed. As a result of this process, needs and vacancies were identified, which led to the redistribution of posts based on the information gathered. In June , guidelines were issued on how to set up regional selection boards in regions where the reorganization process had been completed and where there were vacancies. The teacher reorganization process was concluded in , the boards were set up and representatives from teachers' unions have now been included. The Government adds that the competitive examinations have regained their public status, with many of their stages being conducted in open interviews.
.As regards the allegations relating to the report requested on the amounts, use and handling of the funds received as a result of the transferred deductions, under circular letter No. -SE-, of  March , the Government states that this was sent to the six presidents of the teachers' unions belonging to the FOMH, requesting them to report on the amounts, use and handling of funds received as a result of the deductions transferred to teachers' organizations. For many years, the Secretariat acted as a management body channelling those deductions, following requests made by teachers. Therefore, as a result of the failure to submit the report in question, the State Secretariat of the Education Department reserves the right to decide whether to continue to authorize the transfer of those deductions. The circular letter referred to was challenged before the State Secretariat of the Education Department. The appeal was declared non-receivable, since circular letter No. -SE- does not constitute an administrative act deriving from an administrative procedure, in accordance with section  of the General Act of Public Administration; it is not a general act which may be challenged, in accordance with the provisions of section  of the Administrative Procedure Act, nor is it an administrative decision issued by the administration hearing cases in the first or second instance, pursuant to section  of the Administrative Procedure Act.
.The Committee notes that in this case, the complaints form part of a long dispute between teachers'",-1,2013,Honduras
33,"organizations and the Government, which gave rise to protest movements and strikes, during the period from  to , caused by the suspension of the economic regime set forth in the Honduran Teachers' Statute and the delays in the payment of salaries in arrears, among other things.
.Similarly, the Committee observes that the allegations refer to: () the death of a trade union activist on  March , while she was participating in a peaceful demonstration; () the legal proceedings instituted against  teachers, for the crimes of sedition and unlawful association, and their arrest while participating in a peaceful demonstration; () the exclusion of teachers' organizations from the higher authority of the administration of INPREMA; () the suspension of the economic regime set forth in the Honduran Teachers' Statute, and its de-indexation from the minimum salary (preventing the continuing use of the minimum salary as a reference for the automatic and direct increase of salaries); () the failure to pay salary increases from  to  and the suppression of the protests to which this gave rise; () the declaration of the protest movements as illegal by the administrative authority and the resulting sanctions imposed on more than  teachers; () the suspension of the deductions in union fees for teachers' organizations; () the adoption of Decision No. -SE-, of  July , which provides for the extension of the school year in the case of stoppages or suspensions of classes; () the refusal of requests for renewal of union leave; () the unilateral suspension of Teacher Selection and Competitive Recruitment Boards; () the request for a report on the amounts, use and handling of the funds obtained as a result of the deductions transferred to teachers' organizations; () the civil liability claims brought against four SINPRODOH officials, for an amount of HNL,,.; and () the professional persecution of two members of the COPEMH.
.The Committee notes that the Government states that its actions are not directed against the SINPRODOH. It also notes the following statements by the Government: () the death of Ms Ilse Ivania Velsquez Rodrguez was caused by a young, reckless driver, who hit her while driving against the flow of traffic. The forensic report of the Public Prosecutor s office excludes the possibility that, prior to her fall, she had been hit by an object designed for use by the military or police; () the teachers were arrested for the crimes of sedition and unlawful association for assaulting several police officers with mortar rockets. Due process was respected at all times and, to date, no teacher has been convicted for the aforementioned facts; () the reforms outlined in Decree No.  , of  December , containing the National Social Welfare Institute for Teachers Act were based on actuarial studies carried out by the CNBS, and were disseminated among the teachers' unions in ; () Decree-Law No. -, of  October , suspended the economic regimes established in the different professional statutes, as they are fiscal measures which served as a reference for the automatic and direct increase of salaries, to the detriment of the budgets of centralized and decentralized state institutions; in this respect, the administrative appeal lodged by the SINPRODOH was not successful, since the country s financial situation did not allow for further and greater commitments beyond those contained in the National General Income and Expenditure Budget; () the delay in teachers' monthly payments has been one of the main problems faced by the State Secretariat of the Education Department, and this delay (that is the failure to pay on the th day of each month) affected teachers at the national level and their unrest was understandable, which was why the Secretariat issued Decision No. -SE-, of  December , temporarily suspending the voluntary deductions for teachers to Honduran teachers' unions, excluding mandatory dues such as union contributions and other legal and court fees. The State Secretariat of the Education Department has acted for many years as a management body to channel the deductions for teachers' unions, in line with requests made by teachers. It sent the circular letter to the six presidents of teachers' organizations belonging to the FOMH, requesting them to report on the amounts, use and handling of funds received. Voluntary deductions were resumed for the teachers' unions that had submitted the reports requested, namely the COPRUMH and the COLPEDAGOGOSH; () the adoption of Decision No. -SE-, of  June , which provides for the extension of the school year in the case of stoppages or suspension of classes, was motivated by the desire to fulfil the right to education and the minimum number of class days; () the State Secretariat of the Labour and Social Security Departments has declared illegal the strikes and protests launched by teachers' representatives in the past two years; consequently, pursuant to national legislation on the disciplinary regime, Executive Decision No. -SE-, of  October , was issued, imposing sanctions involving salary deductions, temporary suspension or dismissal, as the case may be; () the refusal of the requests for renewal of paid union leave made by certain teachers is based on national legislation, which should be applied within the framework of the basic law of each teaching organization determining post duration. In this respect, there was a case in which the request for leave was indeed granted (Mr Grebil Escobar del Cid, Secretary for Finance of PRICPHMA), and another case in which the request for leave was refused because it was requested in order to take up a position that was not part of the executive board (Mr Rufino Murillo, Secretary for Internal Affairs of PRICPHMA). In most cases, the requests for renewal of paid union leave were refused because the time limit set under the regulations of the teacher s organization concerned had been exceeded; () the State Secretariat of the Education Department began a  teacher reorganization' process, which aimed to return teachers assigned to other education establishments to the schools where they had been originally appointed. As a result, needs and vacancies were identified, which led to the redistribution of posts based on the information gathered. The reorganization process was concluded in , the teacher selection boards have now been set up, and representatives from teachers' unions have been included.
.The Committee notes with profound concern the seriousness of the allegations which include the death of a union activist, criminal proceedings and mass sanctions relating to union activities, and also significant restrictions on the union rights of officials.
.Regarding the death of Ms Ilse Ivania Velsquez Rodrguez, the Committee observes that, while this highly regrettable event occurred during a demonstration organized by the teachers' organizations of Honduras, it does not seem, according to government statements, to be the result of a violation of the principles of freedom of association. The Committee requests the complainant organizations to provide information in their possession on this allegation and in particular whether her death was, as the Government states, due to a car accident and to indicate whether anyone has been charged or detained in this regard.
.As regards the legal proceedings instituted against  teachers for the crimes of sedition and unlawful association, and their subsequent arrest, while participating in a peaceful demonstration, the Committee takes note of the statements made by the Government that they assaulted several police officers by throwing mortar rockets at them. The Committee emphasizes that the principles of freedom of association do not protect abuses consisting of criminal acts while exercising the right to strike [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ]. The Committee regrets the acts of violence that occurred during the demonstration and urges the Government to provide information without delay on the specific acts for which they are being prosecuted, on the status of the legal proceedings instituted and, where applicable, the outcome.
.Concerning the dispute which is the subject of this complaint, the Committee notes the allegations relating to the suspension of the economic regime set forth in the Honduran Teachers' Statute, under section  of Decree-Law No. -, of  October , and also notes the economic arguments put forward by the Government. The Committee also notes that section  of the above Decree-Law states that:  within a period of  days and subject to negotiation with union organizations, the executive authority shall fix the adjustment to the base salary of public servants governed by special laws or professional statutes, in accordance with the state salary policy, without this increasing the collateral benefits'  As regards the alleged failure to pay the salary increases, the Committee observes that the Government acknowledges that the delay in teachers' monthly payments has been one of the main problems faced by the State Secretariat of the Education Department and that, in view of the situation, the Secretariat issued Decision No. -SE-, of  December , temporarily suspending the voluntary deductions from teachers for Honduran teachers' unions, excluding mandatory dues such as those",-1,2013,Honduras
34,"of INPREMA, the IHSS, union contributions and other legal and court fees. The Committee recalls that as part of its previous examination of Case No. , in November , the complainant organizations in that case had alleged that the Honduran Teachers' Statute was a legal instrument equivalent to a collective labour agreement and the product of many years of struggle, as reflected in Decree-Law No. -, of  November , and that that argument was not rejected by the Government [see th Report, para. ]. The Committee recalls that a fair and reasonable compromise should be sought between the need to preserve as far as possible the autonomy of the bargaining parties, on the one hand, and measures which must be taken by governments to overcome their budgetary difficulties, on the other [see Digest op cit., para. ]. The Committee requests the Government and the complainant organizations to seek a negotiated solution acceptable to all the parties concerned, in accordance with the principles of freedom of association laid down in the ratified Conventions on freedom of association and collective bargaining. The Committee expects that the parties will take full account of these principles in the future and requests the Government to inform it of the outcome of the salary negotiations provided for in Decree Law No.  , of  October .
.As for the allegation regarding the suspension of the deduction of union dues for teachers' organizations, the Committee notes that paragraph  of Agreement No. -SE-, of  December , excludes union dues. The Committee notes, however, that the Government has not denied the alleged suspension of the deduction of union dues, and has indicated that voluntary deductions had resumed for teachers' organizations that had submitted the reports requested. The Committee recalls that the withdrawal of the check-off facility, which could lead to financial difficulties for trade union organizations, is not conducive to the development of harmonious industrial relations and should therefore be avoided [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. Given that the suspension of the deduction of union dues infringes trade union rights, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps to ensure that the remaining teachers' organizations once again benefit from the check-off facility for the union dues of their members.
.As for the declaration of illegality made by the State Secretariat of the Labour and Social Security Departments, which led to the adoption of Executive Decision No.  SE , of  October , and the subsequent imposition of sanctions involving salary deductions, temporary suspension or dismissal, as the case may be, affecting hundreds of teachers, the Committee recalls that responsibility for declaring the strike as illegal should not lie with the Government, but with an independent body which has the confidence of the parties involved [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. The Committee also recalls that arrests and dismissals of strikers on a large scale involve serious risk of abuse and place freedom of association in grave jeopardy. The competent authorities should be given appropriate instructions so as to obviate the dangers to freedom of association that such arrests and dismissals involve [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. The Committee requests the Government and the complainant organizations to seek a negotiated solution acceptable to all the parties concerned, in accordance with the principles of freedom of association laid down in the ratified Conventions on freedom of association and collective bargaining; it also requests the Government to take steps to amend the legislation so that the legality or illegality of the strike is declared by an independent body.
.As for the allegations relating to the extension of the school year in the case of stoppages or suspension of classes, under Decision No. -SE-, of  July , the Committee takes note of the clarifications provided by the Government indicating that the State Secretariat of the Education Department has been endeavouring to achieve fulfilment of the right to education and the minimum number of class days, which section  of the Regulations under the Honduran Teachers' Statute establishes as actual working time during the school year (that is ten months, with a minimum of  working days). The Committee considers that in these circumstances the extension of the school year is not a cause for objection.
.The Committee notes that the Government has not responded to the allegations referring to the sending of inspectors to each lawfully convened assembly, by the State Secretariat of the Education Department, in order to record the proceedings for sanctions-related purposes. The Committee emphasizes that the presence of representatives of the authorities or the employer at union assemblies constitutes interference in violation of the principles of freedom of association laid down in ratified Conventions on freedom of association and collective bargaining. It requests the Government to ensure that such practices do not recur in the future. The Committee further emphasizes that the right of occupational organizations to hold meetings in their premises to discuss occupational questions, without prior authorization and interference by the authorities, is an essential element of freedom of association and the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede its exercise, unless public order is disturbed thereby or its maintenance seriously and imminently endangered [see Digest, op. cit., para. ].
.As for the allegations concerning refusal of union leave requested by numerous officials, whose names are mentioned in the allegations, under circular letter No.  SE , of  February , which the Government claims limits union leave to the duration of the union positions held, the Committee notes that on  February  the above letter was challenged by the SINPRODOH before the State Secretariat of the Education Department. The Committee takes note of the information provided by the Government, according to which action was taken to investigate whether the teachers had abandoned their duties in the education centres, following the failures or abandonment on the part of various teachers and the constant complaints made by parents, in observance of the provisions of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Furthermore, the Committee notes the information supplied by the Government relating to the actions for constitutional protection (amparo) brought by the teachers' representatives against the State Secretariat of the Education Department, in connection with the administrative disciplinary proceedings instituted against a number of teachers, including those from the SINPRODOH, and which the Supreme Court of Justice has declared not to be receivable, as the administrative channels had not been exhausted prior to the judicial remedies. The Committee also takes note of the information provided on the requests for renewal of trade union leave that were granted, and those that were refused, along with the reasons for their refusal. The Committee requests the Government to resume dialogue with the complainant organizations in order to find a prompt solution to this situation, and to inform it of the outcome of any legal proceedings instituted.
.The Committee notes with regret that the Government s reply is not sufficiently clear as regards the allegations pertaining to: () the exclusion of teachers' organizations from the higher authority of the administration of INPREMA; and () the suppression of the protests resulting from the failure to pay salary increases from  to . The Committee urges the Government to send its observations in this regard without delay, in particular information concerning the complaints submitted to the competent authorities by the people who have been victims of police repression during the protests.
.Moreover, the Committee requests the complainant organizations to provide more detailed information on the allegations concerning: () the unilateral suspension of the teacher selection and competitive recruitment boards; () the request for a report on the amounts, use and handling of the funds obtained as a result of the deductions transferred to teachers' organizations; () the institution of civil liability proceedings against four SINPRODOH officials, for an amount of HNL,,.; and () the alleged professional persecution with no further details against two members of the COPEMH. The Committee requests the complainant organizations to furnish all information available to them in relation to these allegations, so that the Government may provide a precise response.
.The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the communication dated  January  from the General Confederation of Workers (CGT), the Single Confederation of Workers of Honduras (CUTH) and other national organizations concerning allegations of sanctions against education trade unionists and other restrictions on trade union rights in relation to the dispute at hand.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the complainant organizations to provide information in their possession on the death of Ms Ilse Ivania Velsquez Rodrguez and in particular whether it was due, as the Government states, to a car accident and whether anyone has been charged or detained in this regard.(b) As regards the legal proceedings instituted against  teachers for the crimes of sedition and unlawful association, and their subsequent detention, when they were participating in a",-1,2013,Honduras
35,"peaceful demonstration, the Committee urges the Government to inform it without delay on the specific acts for which they are being prosecuted, on the status of the legal proceedings instituted and, where applicable, the outcome.(c) Concerning the dispute which is the subject of this complaint, the Committee notes the allegations relating to the suspension of the economic regime set forth in the Honduran Teachers' Statute, under section  of Decree-Law No. -, of  October , and to the failure to pay salary increases, the Committee requests the Government and the complainant organizations to seek a negotiated solution acceptable to all the parties concerned, in accordance with the principles of freedom of association laid down in the ratified Conventions on freedom of association and collective bargaining. The Committee expects that the parties will take full account of the principles referred to in its conclusions in the future and requests the Government to inform it of the outcome of the salary negotiations provided for in Decree-Law No. -, of  October .(d) As for the allegation regarding the suspension of the deduction of union dues for teachers' organizations, the Committee emphasizes that the suspension of the deduction of union dues infringes union rights; it therefore requests the Government to take the necessary steps, if it has not done so already, to ensure that all teachers' organizations once again benefit from the check-off facility for the union dues of their members.(e) As for the declaration of illegality made by the State Secretariat of the Labour and Social Security Departments, which led to the adoption of Executive Decision No. -SE-, of  October , and the subsequent imposition of sanctions involving salary deductions, temporary suspension or dismissal, as the case may be, affecting hundreds of teachers, the Committee requests the Government and the complainant organizations to seek a negotiated solution acceptable to all the parties concerned, in accordance with the principles of freedom of association laid down in the ratified Conventions on freedom of association and collective bargaining; it also requests the Government to take steps to amend the legislation so that the legality or illegality of the strike is declared by an independent body.(f) Concerning the allegations referring to the sending of inspectors to each lawfully convened assembly, by the State Secretariat of the Education Department, the Committee emphasizes that the presence of representatives of the authorities or the employer at union assemblies constitutes interference in violation of the principles of freedom of association laid down in ratified Conventions on freedom of association and collective bargaining. It requests the Government to ensure that such practices do not recur in the future.(g) As for the refusal of union leave requested by numerous officials, under circular letter No. -SE-, of  February , the Committee requests the Government to resume dialogue with the complainant organizations in order to find a prompt solution to this situation, and to inform it of the outcome of any legal proceedings instituted.(h) The Committee notes with regret that the Government s reply is not sufficiently clear as regards the allegations pertaining to: () the exclusion of teachers' organizations from the higher authority of the administration of INPREMA; and () the suppression of the protests resulting from the failure to pay salary increases from  to . The Committee firmly urges the Government to send its observations in this regard without delay, in particular information concerning the complaints submitted to the competent authorities by the persons who have been victims of police repression during the protests.(i) Moreover, the Committee requests the complainant organizations to provide more detailed information on the allegations concerning: () the unilateral suspension of the teacher selection and competitive recruitment boards; () the request for a report on the amounts, use and handling of the funds obtained as a result of the deductions transferred to teachers' organizations; () the institution of civil liability proceedings against four Trade Union of Honduran Teachers (SINPRODOH) officials, for an amount of HNL,,.; and () the alleged professional persecution with no further details against two members of the Association of Secondary Teachers of Honduras (COPEMH). The Committee requests the complainant organizations to furnish all information available to them in relation to these allegations, so that the Government may provide a precise response.(j) The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the communication dated  January  from the General Confederation of Workers (CGT), the Single Confederation of Workers of Honduras (CUTH) and other national organizations concerning allegations of sanctions against education trade unionists and other restrictions on trade union rights in relation to the dispute at hand.",-1,2013,Honduras
36,".The Committee last examined this case at its June  meeting and submitted an interim report to the Governing Body [see th Report, paras ' , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (June )].
.The Government sent new observations in a communication dated  May .
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its previous examination of the case in June , the Committee made the following recommendation on the matter still pending [see th Report, para. ]:The Committee regrets to observe that the Government has not responded to the allegations concerning the company Casa Comercial Mattews Cemcol Comercial y Similares and requests it to send its observations without delay.
.The Committee reproduces here the allegations of the complainant organization on the matter [see th Report, para. ]:In a communication dated  August , FASH and SITRACCMACCOS allege that in , the company Casa Comercial Mattews Cemcol Comercial y Similares, claiming a full restructuring of the company ' but in reality seeking to dissolve the trade union ' succeeded in getting many of the trade unionists to leave its employ and later dismissed the many other trade union members precisely when the trade union changed its statutes with a view to change from a company union to an industry-level union. The complainant organizations point out that at the date of the complaint the seven board members were the only ones that had not been dismissed; the employment relationship of all the remaining trade unionists had been terminated. The complainants have requested that the collective agreement be honoured, including the terms relating to the payment of wages and to the social benefits of those who were dismissed.
.In its communication dated  May , the Government stated in relation to the allegations of a large number of dismissals and anti-union practices in the company Casa Comercial Mathews Cemcol Comercial y Similares, SA de CV, that, on  July , a general inspection was conducted in the company. On that occasion, the inspectors concluded that there had been a violation of the right to freedom of association. The company was compelling workers to resign, in exchange for full payment of their benefits and the signing of an individual employment contract with another, non-unionized company belonging to the same group, with a view to dissolving the Workers' Union of the Casa Comercial Mathews Cemcol Comercial y Similares (SITRACCMACCOS). The labour inspectors noted that any workers who refused were threatened with dismissal. Over a period of  days, the company s workforce was reduced from  to ten workers. The Government adds that the company was notified on  July  of the violations that had been observed, and that a further inspection was conducted on  November , which concluded that the violations indicated in the notification document had not been remedied. On  April , the General Labour Inspectorate issued the company with a fine of , Honduran Lempiras (HNL) and an official warning that the fine would be increased by  per cent in the event of a repeat offence.
.In relation to the allegations still pending concerning a large number of dismissals and anti-union practices in the company Casa Comercial Mathews Cemcol Comercial y Similares, SA de CV, the Committee takes note of the labour inspections to which the Government refers, which concluded that there had been a violation of the right to freedom of association, and of the General Labour Inspectorate s issuance of a fine. The labour inspectors concluded that there had been a violation of the right to freedom of association, in view of the fact that the company was compelling workers to resign in exchange for full payment of their benefits and the signing of an individual employment contract with another, non-unionized company belonging to the same group, with a view to dissolving the SITRACCMACCOS. The labour inspectors noted that any workers who refused were threatened with dismissal. Over a period of  days, the company s workforce was reduced from  to ten workers. The Committee observes that the fine of HNL, (US$.) which was imposed is the maximum amount provided for under the legislation of Honduras. In the Committee s view, this does not constitute, in the present case, a sufficient remedy against the violation of the right to freedom of association, which was established by the labour inspectors.
.In this respect, the Committee recalls that, for a number of years, the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has been requesting the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that penalties for acts of anti-union discrimination and interference are sufficiently effective and serve as a deterrent. The Committee also notes the conclusions adopted in June  by the Committee on the Application of Standards of the International Labour Conference on legal protection against acts of anti-union discrimination and interference, calling for an effective change to the law and practice with a view to ensuring the full application of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and for the development of tripartite dialogue to resolve the matters concerned.
.The Committee firmly expects that the Government will, in the near future, take all the necessary measures, in consultation with the social partners, to amend its legislation to ensure comprehensive protection against anti-union discrimination, in particular in case of anti-union dismissals by providing for reinstatement in the previous position or for penalties which serve as a sufficient deterrent against such acts. In the event that reinstatement is not possible for objective and compelling reasons, the union members concerned should receive adequate compensation which would represent a sufficiently dissuasive sanction. The Committee refers the legislative aspect of this case to the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, which is already dealing with this matter. Furthermore, the Committee requests the Government to state whether the company has appealed against the fine imposed by the labour inspectorate and whether the union members who were dismissed or compelled to resign have lodged an appeal in this connection. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of any appeals lodged.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee expresses the firm hope that the Government will, in the near future, take all the necessary measures, in consultation with the social partners, to amend its legislation to ensure comprehensive protection against anti-union discrimination in the manner indicated in its conclusions.(b) The Committee requests the Government to state whether the company has appealed against the fine imposed by the labour inspectorate for violating freedom of association and whether the union members who were dismissed or compelled to resign have lodged an appeal in this connection. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of any appeals lodged.(c) The Committee refers the legislative aspect of this case to the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, which is already dealing with the matter.
.The complaint is contained in two communications from the Authentic Trade Union Federation of Honduras (FASH), dated  August . The first communication was also signed by Workers' Union of the Casa Comercial Mattews Cemcol Comercial y Similares (SITRACCMACCOS), the second by the Workers' Union of Honduras Institute of Children and the Family (SITRAIHNFA).
.The Government sent its observations in a communication on  December .
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In a communication dated  August , FASH and SITRACCMACCOS allege that in , the company Casa Comercial Mattews Cemcol Comercial y Similares, claiming a full restructuring of the company ' but in reality seeking to dissolve the trade union ' succeeded in getting many of the trade unionists to leave its employ and later dismissed the many other trade union members precisely when the trade union changed its statutes with a view to change from a company union to an industry-level union. The complainant organizations point out that at the date of the complaint the seven board members were the only ones that had not been dismissed; the employment relationship of all the remaining trade unionists had been terminated. The complainants have requested that the collective agreement be honoured, including the terms relating to the payment of wages and to the social benefits of those who were dismissed.
.In another communication dated  August , FASH and SITRAIHNFA allege that the Honduras Institute of Children and the Family claims that the trade union should be dissolved so that the Institute can do business with non-governmental organizations (NGOs). The authorities are debating whether to dismantle the Institute and establish a Children s Ombudsman Office with new staff.
.Further, the aforementioned organizations allege that the Institute failed to comply",-1,2012,Honduras
37,"with various terms of the  collective agreement (this agreement continues to be in force, since the complainants allege that the Institute s authorities have blocked the negotiation of the new agreement). They also allege that the Institute does not recognize the trade union as the representative of all the workers, whether affiliates or not. Other terms that the Institute has failed to comply with include, for example, those relating to overtime hours of work, staff transportation, provision of equipment, regulatory procedures and job stability. Therefore, according to the complainants, the Institute has dismissed employees orally and in writing. The trade unions have sent many attachments.
.In its communication of  December , the Government states that it respects union rights and that the authorities recognize SITRAIHNFA, as evidenced by the six agreements concluded in the Institute. SITRAIHNFA terminated the last collective agreement and apparently negotiated in a series of meetings with the former executive director the provisions of the collective agreement without accepting those relating to wage increases and others having economic and financial implications. The Government explains that during this time the Institute has been engulfed by a budgetary and financial crisis, to the extent that on  September , under Executive Order No. -, a state of emergency was declared at the Institute, and an intervening commission was set up. The commission was operational until January , when the current executive director was named. Under the general provisions relating to the Council of Ministers contained in Executive Orders Nos PCM-- and PCM--, his powers in dealing with the budget and financial resources have been restricted, owing to the domestic and international financial crisis affecting the State, to the extent that all wage increases are prohibited by law, a point that the complainants seek to overlook. In other words, the Government reiterates that the signing of the seventh collective agreement has not been possible in view of the country s financial situation, in particular the Institute s available budgetary resources, and the legal impediments duly shown by the executive orders that the Government attached to its communication.
.The Government states that the allegation that dismissals at the Institute are made orally and in writing, and that the trade union is not recognized or its existence denied is not true. This allegation can easily be refuted by the many specific records and grievance records that are properly drawn up in the presence of the trade union in the Institute s Department of Human Resources. A union representative is thus present and signs the documents. The representative is granted the right to speak in defence of the workers' interests, in accordance with the rules of procedure and the collective agreement, which alone defeats this allegation.
.The Government adds that when the bill for the establishment of the National Children s Ombudsman Office was brought before the Honduran National Congress, the members of the SITRAIHNFA Central Board of Directors were invited by the State to attend so that they too could present their initiatives and observations. The proposals of both parties are now awaiting debate in the legislative branch. In view of the preceding statement, the wording of the complaint stating that  the Government s intention is to do business with NGOs' not only lacks respect, but is totally inappropriate and does not merit any consideration whatsoever because such defamatory accusations should not be made capriciously and without substantiation to international bodies.
.In addition, the Government considers inappropriate and capricious the statement that the executive branch intends to dissolve the Institute, and thus the trade union. The plan to set up the National Children s Ombudsman Office to replace the Institute is not the decision of the executive branch alone, since the relevant bill was drafted by a team composed of representatives of bodies engaged in international cooperation dealing with youth programmes, such as: the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the United Nations Children s Fund (UNICEF); civil society, representatives of the Inter-institutional Coordination of Private Organizations for Children and Children s Rights (COIPRODEN), an organization representing more than  organizations devoted to youth programmes; the Office of the Public Prosecutor for Victimized Children, an integral part of the Office of the Public Prosecutor of the State; and the executive branch, represented by the Justice and Human Rights Secretariat and the senior management of the Institute, based on the competencies granted by the Constitution and the legal provisions governing its institutional life. By creating a new institution, this bill aims to extend the scope of the Institute, which is oriented solely towards children at social risk or criminal law offenders. It also will also cover the human rights of the . million children of Honduras. Further, this bill falls within the frame of the Law on the Country Vision and National Plan, which in the case of the Institute, requires it to decentralize its functions through the municipalities, with the compulsory expansion of the present  municipalities in which it operates, to the  municipalities throughout the country.
.With regard to the trade union s recognition, the Government states that apparently the complainants do not recall the contents of clause  of the collective agreement in force that states as follows:  If for whatever reason the Honduras Institute of Children and the Family should change its name or its representatives, the new authority shall continue being the  employer' in matters of employment. The relation will be governed by the rules of procedure in force, in addition to the provisions of the present collective agreement, and by the Labour Code, as a legal framework. In all cases the trade union will be recognized automatically as the legitimate representative of the professional and general interests of its respective members with whatever name is adopted by the new institution.' ,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:
.Concerning the alleged impediments to collective bargaining, the Government denies impediments by the Institute and refers to the records of grievance hearings granted on behalf of the workers and to specific records referring to the conciliation produced by the mediation of the Secretariat of Labour aimed at bringing a halt to the countless illegal walkouts by the trade union that cause prejudice to the children and the Institute. In all these documents the union appears precisely as the workers' representative.
.With respect to the alleged violation by the Institute s authorities of the employment agreement, the Government states that according to the trade union, the terms range from those relating to payment of overtime hours of work to the alleged violation of constitutional guarantees, the obligation to provide staff transportation under certain conditions, the provision of furniture and equipment, the application of regulatory procedures to staff, job stability and so forth. The Government points out that there is little substance in these allegations and if they were true, this would require intervention or the permanent closing of the Institute.
.The Government also states that the complainant has not exhausted all administrative remedies concerning the allegations. Concerning the application of clause  of the collective agreement that was challenged by a series of temporary workers claiming such clause as the basis for recognition of their status as fixed-term workers, the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice ruled in favour of the Institute, dismissing the case against the Institute.
.With regard to the alleged non-compliance with the clause of the sixth collective agreement guaranteeing the administrative and managerial freedom of the Institute with respect to the necessary resources for achieving its ends, without further obligations or constraints than those set out in the Constitution of Honduras, in the laws, in the regulations and in the present collective agreement, the Government states that despite giving timely notification to some temporary workers of the termination of their contracts, the administration of the Institute lawfully and repeatedly advised the former workers to claim amounts to which they could be found legally entitled in terms of acquired rights. As ordered and instructed by the union leaders, the workers refused to do so, causing significant prejudice to their own interests, since articles  and  of the Labour Code exclude the possibility of making any legal claims to employment rights two months after their agreements have been terminated.
.The Government states that the trade union eventually acknowledged that the Institute s senior management had on the one hand dismissed staff and, on the other hand, recruited others. However, what the signatories of the agreement do not indicate is that many people lacking the proper qualifications for their posts were under contract at the Institute. As a result, it was necessary to replace part of them with qualified staff, social workers, psychologists and physicians to carry out the difficult work of the Institute, that is to say, to provide care for children at social risk or for juvenile offenders of criminal law.
.The Government stresses that SITRAIHNFA has been responsible for constant abuse, causing prejudice not only to the Institute and the children. The union carried out  illegal work stoppages (amounting to ",0,2012,Honduras
38,"working days), which in some cases lasted  or  days, bring the Institute s work to a halt.
.The Committee takes note of the allegations relating to the Institute and observes that they refer to the dissolution of the Institute and its replacement by a Children s Ombudsman Office with new staff. It also takes note of the allegation of the Institute s failure to comply with various clauses of the  collective agreement, impediments by the authorities to the negotiation of a new collective agreement, oral and written dismissals and the failure to recognize the union as the representative of all the workers.
.The Committee notes that the Government states the following: () the negotiation of the new agreement was faced with the impossibility of offering any wage increases in virtue of the executive orders issued by the Council of Ministers in view of the domestic and international financial crisis limiting budgetary resources; () a bill has been introduced to establish the National Children s Ombudsman Office, and SITRAIHNFA s Central Board of Directors has been given the opportunity to present its initiatives, observations and proposals, which are pending discussion in the legislative branch; therefore, the complainants' accusation of  doing business with NGOs' is defamatory. The replacement of the Institute by the National Children s Ombudsman Office is not a decision of the executive branch alone, since the bill was drafted by a group of representatives of organizations engaged in international cooperation, such as UNICEF, and numerous organizations dealing with children s issues, such as the Juvenile Prosecutor; () the purpose of replacing the Institute with the National Children s Ombudsman Office is to extend human rights coverage to . million children and to decentralize functions through the municipalities (currently the Institute is oriented solely towards children at social risk or criminal law offenders and only covers  of the  municipalities in Honduras); () the collective agreement expressly guarantees that the future employer will recognize the trade union as a legitimate representative of its members in the new institution; () the employment issues covered in the complaint have resulted in mediation between the parties by the Secretariat of Labour, and the trade union has made  work stoppages that have paralysed the work of the Institute for  working days; () in the issues contained in the complaint, the complainant has failed to exhaust all administrative remedies; () as regards the alleged violation of the collective agreement by staff dismissals, the judicial authority has in a certain number of cases ruled against the trade union; the trade union also claimed that temporary workers, who have received timely notification of the termination of their contracts, should be recognized as fixed-term staff; lastly, the Institute had to replace a certain number of people lacking the necessary qualifications for the posts concerned to fill them with skilled personnel (social workers, physicians, psychologists and so forth) in order to meet the aims of the Institute (provision of services for children at social risk and juvenile criminal law offenders); and () in the administrative procedures for dismissal, the trade union was granted a hearing by the Institute s Human Resources Department.
.The Committee observes that the present case between the trade union and the Institute is related mainly to the likely replacement of the Institute by another institution (according to the complainants, with new staff) on the one hand, and to collective bargaining issues on the other (impossibility of pay raises because of the financial crisis, according to the Government, and failure to observe certain clauses of the collective agreement in force, according to the complainants; and dismissals of short- or fixed-term workers).
.In view of the contradictory versions of the parties, the Committee considers that it is not in a position to determine whether or not the terms of the agreement in force have been breached. Taking into account the number of strikes carried out, the Committee requests the Government to take measures so that the Institute, in agreement with the complainant, set up an independent mechanism for the settlement of disputes on the application of the terms of the collective agreement. The Committee expresses the hope that this mechanism can be included in the next collective agreement. The Committee considers that this mechanism should be able to deal with issues of interpretation of the collective agreement, including in relation to the provisions on dismissal. Concerning the impossibility of negotiating wage increases because of the domestic and international financial crisis, as argued by the Government, the Committee wishes to highlight the principle whereby if, as part of its stabilization policy, a government considers that wage rates cannot be settled freely through collective bargaining, such a restriction should be imposed as an exceptional measure and only to the extent that is necessary, without exceeding a reasonable period, and it should be accompanied by adequate safeguards to protect workers' living standards [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ]. The Committee requests the Government to ensure respect for this principle and expresses the hope that collective bargaining on wage issues can be taken up again in the very near future.
.With regard to the likely replacement of the Institute by the National Children s Ombudsman Office for the reasons and aims mentioned by the Government, the Committee observes that, according to the Government, the relevant bill was submitted for consultation with the trade unions concerned once it had been introduced to the legislature and that in this context, the trade unions have presented their observations and proposals. The Committee regrets nonetheless that in drafting the bill such trade unions were not consulted, despite the fact that the bill deals with an issue that has a direct impact on their members. The Committee expresses the hope that, as announced by the Government, the legislative branch will duly consider the trade unions' viewpoint and proposals and will give them a voice in the legislative process.
.Lastly, the Committee regrets to observe that the Government has not responded to the allegations concerning the company Casa Comercial Mattews Cemcol Comercial y Similares and requests it to send its observations without delay.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	With regard to the allegations concerning the Institute, the Committee requests the Government to take measures so that the Institute, in agreement with the complainant, set up an independent mechanism for the settlement of disputes on the application of the terms of the collective agreement and expresses the hope that this mechanism can be included in the next collective agreement. The Committee considers that this mechanism should also be able to deal with the interpretation of the collective agreement, including in relation to the provisions on dismissal.(b)	Concerning the impossibility of negotiating wage increases due to the financial crisis, the Committee draws the Government s attention to the principle contained in the conclusions on the economic stabilization measures in times of financial crisis and requests it to ensure respect for such principle; at the same time the Committee expresses the hope that collective bargaining on wage issues can be taken up in the very near future.(c)	The Committee expresses the hope that, as announced by the Government, the legislative branch will duly consider the point of view and proposals of the trade unions and will give them a voice in the process of drafting the bill on the National Children s Ombudsman Office.(d)	Lastly, the Committee regrets to observe that the Government has not responded to the allegations concerning the company Casa Comercial Mattews Cemcol Comercial y Similares and requests it to send its observations without delay.",-1,2012,Honduras
39,".The complaint is contained in a communication dated  August  from the Unitary Confederation of Workers of Honduras (CUTH), the Workers' Confederation of Honduras (CTH) and the General Confederation of Workers (CGT).
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  November .
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communication dated  August , the CUTH, the CTH and the CGT raise objections to Decree No. - of  November, which contains the National Hourly Employment Programme (PRONEH), which they consider to be in violation of ILO Conventions Nos , , , ,  and  (the Committee will limit itself to examining the alleged violations of Conventions Nos  and ). The complainants add that agreement No. STSS-- was published on  January , and that it contains the regulations of PRONEH, issued by the Ministry, pursuant to the provisions of article  of Decree No.  , which requires the Ministry to work together with a member of the workers' organizations and a member of the employers' organizations, designated by the Economic and Social Council, to regulate the application of the abovementioned Decree within  days of its publication. The complainants state that no invitation was sent to the workers' organizations and allege that the Decree, which directly affects workers, was adopted without consultation by the Government with trade unions, and is intended not to promote employment but to further deregulate the labour market, increase job insecurity and violate international labour Conventions, the Constitution and the Labour Code. According to the complainants, the Temporary Hourly Employment Act was adopted in order to legalize temporary work and outsourcing. The complainants point out that the labour market is saturated with temporary workers and those doing outsourced work, and the Act is not needed to hire workers on a temporary basis (the complainants provided the figures for temporary workers in the private and public sectors).
.The complainants state that, as Decree No. - and the corresponding regulations have been adopted without consultation, the workers' confederations are preparing an appeal against both documents on the grounds that they are unconstitutional and impossible to implement. The appeal is to be submitted to the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice. The complainants allege that workers' organizations were not consulted with regard to the adoption of the Decree and regulations, and only the employers' interests were taken into consideration. They add that the second paragraph of article  of the Decree, which states that  it is understood that workers hired under the terms of the Programme are entitled to the fundamental rights set forth in the Labour Code and the eight fundamental ILO Conventions signed and ratified by the State of Honduras, including Conventions Nos  and , which guarantee the right to organize and collective bargaining, in compliance with the provisions of domestic labour law'  is merely declaratory and perverse since the Decree turns professional activities of the permanent nature exercised by many workers into a temporary activity and, worse still, into hourly employment. They also consider that this paragraph is contradictory since it states that rights and guarantees must be compatible with domestic labour law yet domestic law denies temporary workers the right to organize.
.The complainants consider that the principal violation lies in the attempt to use a decree to convert labour activities that are permanent per se into temporary hourly work, thereby increasing the number of workers who are denied the right to freedom of association and collective bargaining. According to the complainants, the Decree contains no genuine and effective provisions on the exercise of the right to freedom of association and collective bargaining, and it makes trade union organization and collective bargaining impossible, in practice, for temporary workers, let alone workers hired by the hour or on a non-permanent basis. The complainants state that the option of hiring workers by the hour, and the concomitant job insecurity, can only have adverse effects on freedom of association and make it easier to commit acts of anti-union discrimination. In practice, most enterprises resort to temporary labour with no regulation and no guarantees of fundamental rights.
.In its communication of  November , the Government states that, in their explanation of the violations, the trade union confederations state that they are preparing an appeal on grounds of unconstitutionality because they consider that the Constitution and Conventions Nos , , ,  and  are being violated. According to the allegations, Honduran workers would allegedly be left without protection as a result of the violation of their right to job security, greater job insecurity, and the loss of collective bargaining and trade union rights. However, to date, nobody has lodged an appeal against the National Hourly Employment Programme Act (Decree No. -), nor is there any record, in the Inspectorate, of any complaint relating to the violation of the labour rights of workers under the Programme.
.As regards the alleged violation of job security, PRONEH rules out any possibility of violating this right, firstly because it prohibits the dismissal of permanent workers for the purpose of replacing them with workers hired under and covered by the Hourly Employment Programme, and secondly because employers will be allowed to hire temporary workers in numbers equal to  per cent of the workforce, but this percentage is calculated on the basis of the overall workforce of permanent staff, meaning that if a permanent staff member is dismissed, the number of permitted temporary employees will be reduced accordingly. With regard to the alleged violations of trade union and collective bargaining rights, it should be noted that article , paragraph , of Decree No. - stipulates that  it is understood that workers hired under the terms of the Programme are entitled to the fundamental rights set forth in the Labour Code and the eight fundamental ILO Conventions, including Conventions Nos  and , which guarantee the right to organize and collective bargaining, in compliance with the provisions of domestic law' 
.With regard to the allegation that workers' organizations were not consulted before PRONEH was adopted, the Government states that, before adopting the Act, the Honduran Congress held public information meetings for the sectors concerned, and the Ministry of Labour and Social Security (STSS), acting through the Economic and Social Council, subsequently invited workers' and employers' representatives to draw up the Act s regulations, but only the employers' representatives attended. The Honduran Congress organized a series of meetings and awareness-raising events with the various sectors before adopting the Act (these facts have been checked against graphical records). During monitoring of the implementation of the Programme, concerned sectors have also been invited but the only persons who participated as observers on behalf of workers were Mr Alfredo Ponce and Mr Roberto Sevilla from the CTH. The aim was to monitor and check the Programme and determine whether or not it was necessary for the Programme s legal technical unit to propose changes to enhance the implementation of Decree No.  .
.With regard to the allegation that PRONEH has failed to promote employment and that one of its purposes is to legalize temporary work, the Government states that PRONEH was devised within the framework of the Government s plan for '  as a temporary strategic programme for reducing and eradicating poverty. Its main objectives include increasing work opportunities and thereby enable the people to live with dignity, preserve existing jobs and avert an increase in the rates of unemployment and underemployment. It is not the purpose of the Programme to legalize temporary work. Indeed, article , points  and , read as follows : ' ) production or service units shall not hire workers under the terms of the Programme to perform duties considered, in accordance with the Labour Code, to be temporary or seasonal'  for the simple reason that those workers are regulated and protected by the Labour Code (article  of the Labour Code); ' ) production or service units performing duties that may be specific to their trade but are not ongoing because they are dependent on production contracts involving predetermined volumes with specific due dates for occasional customers, meaning that when the delivery is made or the due date is reached the work to be done comes to an end, as well as those tasks that increase seasonally or during certain periods of the year or at certain dates and thus require a temporary increase in the workforce, may avail themselves of the Programme and hire employees under the terms thereof'  this provision makes it possible for employers to create jobs by hiring staff to meet seasonal demand. Staff hired under the hourly employment regime have the advantage of benefiting from all labour benefits, such as the guaranteed payment of thirteenth and fourteenth months' wages and leave for each hour worked, paid for in the form of non-routine compensation,",1,2011,Honduras
40,"which is the equivalent of adding an extra  per cent onto the agreed base salary, which shall not be lower than the minimum wage (see the paragraph on non-routine compensation in article ).
.Any enterprise wishing to hire staff under the terms of PRONEH must register with the Directorate-General for Employment of the STSS, draw up an individual written contract along the lines of the model developed by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security (in order to ensure that the labour rights of workers are protected), register the signed contracts with the Directorate-General for Employment (article , paragraphs  and  of the Act), comply with domestic and international labour legislation in the areas of child labour and the worst forms thereof (article () of the Act), hire workers from vulnerable groups in compliance with the legally established percentages (article , paragraphs  and  of the Act), register the workers on the monitoring or registration list with the Honduran Social Security Institute (article , paragraph , of the Act), give preference to persons covered by the Programme when filling vacant permanent staff posts (article ()), sign agreements with the Honduran Social Security Institute to provide workers covered by the Programme with social security services or, where appropriate, sign agreements with private clinics, company medical systems and insurance companies (article  of the Act), extend to workers covered by the Programme the same benefits as those of permanent staff in terms of health plans, insurance policies and other social security benefits, in areas where the Honduran Social Security Institute does not have a presence (article , paragraph , of the Act), and provide the Directorate-General for Employment and the General Labour Inspectorate with the information they need to assess the Programme (article  of the Act and article  of the Regulations).
.The Government reports that, nationwide,  enterprises using the Programme are currently registered with the STSS. The number of PRONEH contract registration transactions has increased, leading to better control and monitoring of the rights of workers hired under the Programme; the results are such that no complaints have yet been lodged with the STSS via the Inspectorate. This demonstrates that no exploitation is taking place.
.The vast majority of the PRONEH contracts are for half days (four or five hours) or full days (six, seven or eight hours), depending on the tasks performed by the employee in the workplace. Hiring an employee for a full day s work ensures that he or she will earn more than the  minimum wage and increases his or her chances of becoming a permanent employee. Finally, the Government states that it should be noted that, nearly one year after PRONEH was adopted, it has generated ,,. lempiras (HNL) in earned wages, and the control, registration and monitoring work done by the STSS has generated real data on the economic impact of the Programme and its contribution to the gradual decrease in the unemployment and poverty rates in Honduras. If current trends continue, Decree No. - will have generated around HNL million or more by the end of .
.The Committee observes that in this case the complainant organizations raise objections to Decree No. - of  November, which contains PRONEH, which the complainants consider to be in violation of ILO Conventions Nos  and , and state that the workers' confederations are planning to appeal against both documents on the grounds that they are unconstitutional and impossible to implement. The appeal is to be submitted to the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice. The complainants allege that workers' organizations were not consulted with regard to the Decree and regulations, the Decree converts permanent labour activities into temporary hourly ones, thereby increasing the number of workers excluded from the exercise of freedom of association and collective bargaining, and article , paragraph , of the Decree stipulates that  it is understood that workers hired under the terms of the Programme are entitled to the fundamental rights set forth in the Labour Code and the eight fundamental ILO Conventions signed and ratified by the State of Honduras, including Conventions Nos  and , which guarantee the right to organize and collective bargaining, in compliance with the provisions of domestic labour law'  is merely a declaratory paragraph and is contradictory since the Labour Code (domestic labour law) denies temporary workers the right to organize.
.The Committee takes note that the Government states that: () to date, nobody has lodged an appeal against the National Hourly Employment Programme Decree, nor is there any record, in the Inspectorate, of any complaint relating to the violation of the labour rights of workers under the Programme; () regarding job security, the Act prohibits the dismissal of permanent workers for the purpose of replacing them with workers covered by the Programme; () regarding violations of collective bargaining and trade union rights, article  of the Decree has been quoted (see the previous paragraph); () regarding the failure to consult workers' organizations before adopting the Act, and contrary to the allegations, the Honduran Congress held public information meetings for the sectors concerned before the Act was adopted, the STSS, acting through the Economic and Social Council, subsequently invited workers' and employers' representatives to draw up the regulations, but only the employers' representatives attended, and during the monitoring of the implementation of the Programme, concerned sectors were invited but representatives of the CTH were the only ones who participated; () any enterprise wishing to hire staff under the terms of the Programme must register with the Directorate-General for Employment of the STSS and further register the contracts it signs; ()  enterprises using the Programme are registered and the number of contract registration transactions has increased, leading to better control and monitoring of the rights of workers; and () to date, nobody has lodged an appeal with the Inspectorate, proving that there have not been mass dismissals.
.The Committee observes firstly that Decree No. - of  November, which contains PRONEH, does not regulate trade union affairs and therefore does not contain provisions that are incompatible per se with the principles of freedom of association (far from it, article  states that it is understood that workers hired under the terms of the Decree are entitled to the fundamental rights enshrined in ILO Conventions, with particular reference to Conventions Nos  and ).
.With regard to the alleged lack of consultation in the process of adopting the abovementioned Decree and regulations, the Committee takes note of the contradictory arguments advanced by the complainants and the Government regarding the prior consultation that took place and the participation of the worker party therein (the complainants state that they were not consulted and the Government states that the sectors concerned were consulted but the worker party, with few exceptions, failed to attend the meeting organized through the Economic and Social Council for the purpose of drafting the regulations).
.With regard to the concern expressed by the complainants about the impact of the Decree on the trade union rights of workers, the Committee wishes to refer to the findings of the General Survey of the Committee of Experts on the fundamental Conventions on labour rights in the light of the ILO Declaration on Social Justice for a Fair Globalization, paragraph , in which it is indicated that:  the Committee observes that one of the main concerns expressed by trade union organizations is the adverse impact of insecure forms of employment on trade union rights and the protection of workers' rights, especially in the case of repeatedly renewed short-term temporary contracts; outsourcing, which is used even by some governments in their own public services to perform legally mandated ongoing tasks; and the non-renewal of contracts for anti-union reasons. Some of these modalities often deprive workers of access to freedom of association and collective bargaining, especially when they conceal a genuine and ongoing labour relationship. Some forms of job insecurity can also deter workers from joining trade unions. The Committee wishes to emphasize the importance of examining, within a tripartite framework, the impact of these forms of employment on the exercise of trade union rights in all member States.' The Committee underlines that such dialogue could take place if necessary.
.Finally, with regard to the allegation that domestic legislation excludes temporary workers from trade union organizations (the complainants cite the Labour Code in so far as it refers to the requirement that a person must be regularly employed before being able to join a trade union s executive board, and the definition of a trade union as a permanent organization of workers), the Committee observes, firstly, that the Government refers to article  of the Decree, which mentions the need to comply with fundamental Conventions (with particular reference to Conventions Nos  and ), and states that no complaints have been lodged with the Inspectorate, and secondly, that the complainants have failed to supply examples of specific cases in which the implementation of the Decree has led to violations of",-1,2011,Honduras
41,"the collective bargaining and trade union rights of temporary workers. That being so, the Committee, welcoming the reference in Decree No. - to the protection of the fundamental trade union rights of temporary workers, and noting that no judicial appeal has been lodged against the Decree, the Committee will not pursue the examination of this case.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.",0,2011,Honduras
42,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the Unitary Federation of Honduran Workers (FUTH), dated  June  and supported by eight Honduran trade unions.
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  October  and  March .
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  June , FUTH states that its complaint was also being presented by eight affiliated trade unions, namely, the Trade Union of Workers of the National Autonomous University of Honduras, with a legal address in the city of Tegucigalpa, Honduras; the Trade Union of Workers of the National Child Welfare Agency (SITRAPANI); the Trade Union of Workers of the National Registry Office (SITRARENAPE); the Trade Union of Workers of the National Agrarian Institute, Branch No. , Aguan (SITRAINA); the Trade Union of Workers of Industria Cementera Hondurea SA, known as Lafarge INCEHSA; the Trade Union of Workers of the Retirement and Pensions Institute for Public Employees and Civil Servants in the executive branch (STRAINJUPEMP), the Trade Union of Workers of the Municipality of Danl, El Paraso; and the Trade Union of Workers of the Venus Confectionery Factory.
.FUTH alleges that, on  January , the Chancellor of the National Autonomous University of Honduras arbitrarily dismissed the worker Marco Antonio Moreno, the President of Branch No.  of the Trade Union of Workers of the National Autonomous University of Honduras, and in doing so violated the procedure stipulated in the Labour Code. It also alleges that the university authorities consistently refused to negotiate the th collective agreement.
.Furthermore, FUTH alleges that, on  November , the President of SITRAPANI, Mr Pedro Elvir, was attacked and followed all the way to his home by unknown persons riding a motorcycle. The persons responsible for planning and perpetrating the attack are unknown. FUTH considers that the reason for the attack was the trade union s persistent complaints about attempts to privatize the institution.
.FUTH adds that, on  May , the State granted legal personality to SITRARENAPE. However, although it granted legal personality to a trade union of public employees, it also curtailed and restricted its right to collective bargaining by issuing Decree No. , which changed the legal personality of the National Registry Office by curtailing its autonomy and maliciously restricting the right of workers to conclude a collective agreement.
.Furthermore, FUTH alleges that, on  April ,  workers of the Venus confectionery factory, including the central executive board covered by the legal protection of trade union immunity, were dismissed.
.On  September , one worker, Mr Gerson Daniel Mendoza Martnez, a permanent official of SITRAINA, was dismissed without regard for the procedure stipulated in the collective agreement. This was a violation of due process and the special legal protection afforded by the State to trade union activities.
.FUTH also states that the Trade Union of Workers of the Retirement and Pensions Institute of Honduras reports repeated violations of the collective agreement and particularly section  thereof, in connection with the granting of contracts of indeterminate duration to  temporary workers who should, under this section, have acceded to permanent status. As a result, the trade union was forced to initiate administrative and legal proceedings when the contracts of the workers in question were not renewed. One of the workers was even covered by trade union immunity since he was a member of the bargaining committee, in accordance with section  of the collective agreement.
.Lastly, on  January ,  workers of the Municipality of the city of Danl, El Paraso, were dismissed without just cause, in violation of the constitutional guarantee of the right to work, the right to trade union immunity and the special legal protection of the State, given that the dismissed workers include members of the full central executive board, members of the honour and discipline committee and trade union officials. Section  of the collective agreement was thus also violated.
.In its communications dated  October  and  March , the Government refers to the case of the National Autonomous University of Honduras, in which the institution s trade union reported the dismissal of Mr Marco Antonio Moreno, the President of Branch No. , alleging violations of Conventions Nos  and  because of a lack of due process and a failure to follow the procedure set forth in the Labour Code, as well as the refusal by the employer party to negotiate the th collective agreement.
.In this regard, the Government states that: (a) the National Autonomous University of Honduras turned to the labour courts in Francisco Morazn to seek the lifting of the trade union immunity of Mr Marco Antonio Moreno, and the case is now awaiting a ruling following an extraordinary appeal for amparo lodged by the abovementioned trade union leader with the Supreme Court of Justice; and (b) bargaining began on  February  between the National Autonomous University of Honduras and the trade union of workers of that institution over a collective agreement on working conditions; at present, after two rounds of negotiations, it was agreed to enter the conciliation stage.
.As regards the case of SITRAPANI, it is stated in the complaint that on  November , Mr Pedro Elvir, the President of the trade union was attacked and followed all the way to his home by unknown persons riding a motorcycle. The location of the persons responsible for planning and perpetrating the attack is unknown. It is alleged that the reason for the attack was the trade union s persistent complaints about attempts to privatize the institution.
.In this regard, the Government states that there is no record of any complaint about the alleged attack on Mr Pedro Elvir being lodged with the institutions responsible, in Honduras, for investigating citizens' reports of offences committed (the Directorate of criminal investigation (DGIC) and the Public Prosecutor s Office). Routine enquiries have uncovered no complaint involving the abovementioned attack on Mr Pedro Elvir.
.As regards the allegation concerning SITRARENAPE and the restriction on the right to collective bargaining resulting from changes to the legal personality of the National Registry Office, the Government states that: (a) the State of Honduras, acting through the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, recognized the abovementioned legal personality and approved the statutes of the trade union, as a trade union of public employees, in a decision dated  April ; (b) subsequently, the abovementioned Ministry responded to a written application by Ms Ana Julia Arana Canales, the President of the trade union, by adopting, pursuant to a decision dated  November , a comprehensive reform of the statutes of the trade union as a trade organization; (c) on  April , following another application by the President of the trade union, a further reform of the statutes was adopted but the trade union s status as a trade organization remained unchanged; and (d) the National Registry Office is now an autonomous institution with its own legal personality, and the status of that institution s trade union as a trade organization remains unchanged. The Government adds that, in light of the above, the State of Honduras has not acted to curtail or restrict the right to collective bargaining of SITRARENAPE, and that any amendment that was approved was made at that trade union s request.
.As regards the case of the Venus confectionery and chewing gum factory, it is claimed that  workers, including the central executive board of the trade union, were dismissed on  April , and that the right to job security and the right to freedom of association were correspondingly violated. The Government states that: (a) on  March , an application for the recognition and registration of legal personality was filed with the Ministry of Labour by the Trade Union of Workers of the Venus Confectionery and Chewing Gum Factory; (b) the Ministry issued a decision on  April  in which it recognized and granted the requested legal personality, which was made public on  April  and is recorded in the register of trade union organizations; (c) the full executive board continues to be made up of six trade union officers; and (d) the General Labour Inspectorate in the Ministry of Labour carried out an inspection in the factory on  July  and placed on record its observations on instances of intimidation and violations of the legislation, specifically: the dismissal of a number of workers for having stated their intention to establish a trade union under the protection of the State, the failure to allow a number of workers to go on leave, the failure to pay a th month s wages as a bonus to a number of workers, and the withholding of a fourteenth month s wages as social compensation for ; to date, the Department of Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration has processed  applications for conciliation from workers of the factory who have fully utilized this body",1,2011,Honduras
43,"and instead referred their case to the judicial authorities. According to the Government, its actions have been consistent with its duty to protect trade union immunity, the right to job security and the right to freedom of association.
.Regarding the allegation that, on  September , one worker, Mr Gerson Mendoza Martnez, a permanent official of Branch No.  of the Trade Union of Workers of the National Agrarian Institute, was dismissed without regard for the procedure set forth in the collective agreement, thereby violating due process and trade union immunity, the Government states that the worker in question referred his case to the Labour Court on the grounds that he had been illegally dismissed because he was entitled to trade union immunity; he was reinstated in compliance with a judicial order and is currently working at the Institute. The employer lodged an appeal against the reinstatement order, but the appeal was dismissed.
.Regarding the complaint by the STRAINJUPEMP concerning the violation of section  of the collective agreement that entered into force on  January , as a result of the indefinite extension of the temporary contracts of  workers, including the dismissal of one worker who was entitled to trade union immunity because he was a member of the bargaining committee under section  of the collective agreement, the Government states, with regard to the complaint about the violation of section  of the collective agreement currently in force, that the section in question stipulates the following:  Temporary contracts. The Institute shall conduct an analysis to determine the need for posts and approach the relevant bodies with a view to granting permanent status to all non-permanent employees (,).' It is clear from the wording of the section that, after having conducted the analysis, the Institute will decide whether or not posts need to be created in order to absorb staff on temporary contracts and grant them permanent status, while taking into consideration the institution s needs and financial resources; furthermore, the STRAINJUPEMP has taken legal action through the Labour Court in Francisco Morazn to secure compliance with section , and the Retirement and Pensions Institute for Public Employees and Civil Servants in the executive branch (INJUPEMP) will respect, in other words comply with, the ruling of that judicial body in a spirit of respect for the principle of legality and the rule of law.
.Regarding the dismissal of a member of the bargaining committee negotiating the new collective agreement, the Government states that the dismissal of Mr Nerli Gonzales Baquedano did have a just cause and did not take place until negotiations in the direct settlement stage had been exhausted. Notwithstanding the above, the worker used the legal mechanisms provided by the State and referred his case to the Labour Court on  March , applying for reinstatement. For this reason, the ordinary courts of the Republic of Honduras will determine the correct outcome in accordance with the law, and the INJUPEMP, as a State institution, will fully comply with the court order.
.Regarding the alleged dismissal without explanation of  workers of the Municipality of the city of Danl, El Paraso, on  January , in violation of the right to trade union immunity, because the dismissal of the members of the central executive board, members of the honour committee and trade union officials violated section  of the collective agreement, the Government states that as a result of the dismissals denounced by the workers, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, acting through the Directorate-General for Labour, intervened with the intention of securing a conciliatory settlement that protected the workers' rights, but no such conciliatory settlement was achieved and as a result the workers referred their case to the Labour Court in Francisco Morazn. The proceedings are now at the evidentiary stage and if the court rules in favour of the workers, the Municipality of Danl, El Paraso, will be obliged to comply.
.Regarding the allegations relating to the National Autonomous University of Honduras (refusal by the university authorities to negotiate the th collective agreement, and the dismissal of trade union officer Marco Antonio Moreno), the Committee notes the Government s statements to the effect that: () negotiation of the collective agreement has started and has entered the conciliation stage, and () the University authorities have initiated legal proceedings to seek the lifting of the trade union immunity of Mr Marco Antonio Moreno, and the case is now awaiting a ruling from the Supreme Court of Justice following an extraordinary appeal for amparo. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the amparo ruling and of the outcome of the legal proceedings initiated by the National Autonomous University to seek the lifting of the trade union immunity of Mr Marco Antonio Moreno, and to send it information on the progress of collective bargaining ' currently in the stage of conciliation ' between the University and the trade union.
.Regarding the alleged restriction of collective bargaining at the National Registry Office arising from Decree No. , which allegedly curtailed the freedom of that institution to bargain collectively, the Committee notes the Government s statements according to which: () the National Registry Office is an autonomous institution with a legal personality; () no action has been taken to curtail the right to collective bargaining; and () the trade union continues to have the status of a trade organization, and the amendments to the trade union s statutes were adopted at the trade union s request. The Committee considers that FUTH has failed to explain how Decree No.  restricts the right to collective bargaining at the National Registry Office, and will not pursue its examination of this allegation unless FUTH provides new evidence.
.Regarding the alleged attack on Mr Pedro Elvir, the President of SITRAPANI, who was followed by unknown persons, allegedly because of the trade union s complaints about attempts to privatize the institution, the Committee takes note of the Government s statements, from which it is clear that trade union officer Mr Pedro Elvir has not lodged a complaint with the authorities concerning this incident. The Committee invites the complainants to report the incident to the national authorities responsible for criminal prosecutions, and requests to be kept informed in this regard.
.Regarding the dismissal, on  April , of  workers of the Venus confectionery and chewing gum factory, including the members of the central executive board of the trade union, the Committee takes note of the Government s statements, according to which: () the General Labour Inspectorate has placed on record, among other violations of the legislation, the dismissal of a number of workers for having stated their intention to establish a trade union; and () the administrative authorities have processed  conciliation applications submitted by workers who then referred their case to the judicial authorities once they had exhausted their options with that body. The Committee observes that the Government does not recognize that  workers have been dismissed but indicates that the inspection revealed dismissals of many workers and that only  conciliation applications have been submitted. The Committee expresses its concern over the alleged dismissal of all the members of the central executive board of the trade union, and over the fact that there has been no judicial ruling since the dismissals occurred (in April ). The Committee firmly expects that the judicial authorities will hand down their decision without delay and requests the Government to keep it informed of the eventual ruling. The Committee requests the Government and the complainant to indicate whether there have been other dismissals which have not yet been addressed and to provide information in this regard.
.Regarding the dismissal on  September  of Mr Gerson Mendoza Martnez, a trade unionist in the Trade Union of Workers of the National Agrarian Institute, without regard for the procedure stipulated in the collective agreement, the Committee notes the Government s statement according to which the abovementioned trade unionist was reinstated in compliance with a judicial order within the framework of the legal proceedings he had initiated.
.Regarding the alleged violations by the INJUPEMP of the collective agreement in force and particularly section  thereof, which jeopardized  workers with temporary contracts who should have been granted contracts of indeterminate duration and currently have no contracts (including a trade union representative who, as a member of bargaining committee, is also protected by section  of the collective agreement), the Committee observes that the Government indicates that the granting of permanent status to temporary workers under section  of the collective agreement is subject to an analysis of the institution s needs and financial resources. The Committee also notes that the Government confirms that the trade union initiated legal proceedings and that the trade union representative in question, Mr Nerli Gonzales Baquedano, has also filed a legal application for reinstatement, even though the Government states that the dismissal did have a just cause and did not take place until negotiations in the direct settlement stage had been exhausted.",-1,2011,Honduras
44,"The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the rulings made by the judicial authorities.
.The Committee observes that in this case, allegations have been made on the basis of problems with the interpretation of certain sections of collective agreements. The Committee suggests that the Government should take the necessary steps to ensure that the examination of these problems is entrusted to an independent commission trusted by both parties, or take measures to encourage parties to collective bargaining to include voluntary mechanisms for resolving conflicts over the interpretation of collective agreements.
.Regarding the allegation that, on  January ,  workers of the Municipality of the city of Danl, El Paraso, were dismissed without just cause, in violation of the collective agreement, and that the dismissed workers included members of the central executive board, members of the honour and discipline committee and trade union representatives, the Committee notes that the Government indicates that the administrative authorities did intervene, albeit unsuccessfully, in an attempt to arrive at a conciliatory settlement, and that as a result, the workers concerned took legal action. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the eventual rulings.
.In general, the Committee observes that in two of the cases in this complaint, entire trade union councils have been dismissed. The Committee wishes to express its concern with regard to this situation and recall the principle that no person should be dismissed or prejudiced in employment by reason of trade union membership or legitimate trade union activities, and it is important to forbid and penalize in practice all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of employment [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ], as well as the fact that rapid and effective protection against anti-union discrimination is particularly necessary in the case of trade union officials.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the rulings handed down in the legal proceedings initiated by the National Autonomous University to seek the lifting of the trade union immunity of trade union official Mr Marco Antonio Moreno and in the appeal proceedings for amparo recently initiated by the trade union leader before the Supreme Court of Justice, as well as to provide information on the progress of collective bargaining between the University and the trade union.(b)	Regarding the alleged attack on Mr Pedro Elvir, the President of the Trade Union of Workers of the National Child Welfare Agency, who was followed by unknown persons, allegedly because of the trade union s complaints about attempts to privatize the abovementioned institution, the Committee invites the complainant organizations to report the incident to the authorities responsible for criminal prosecutions, and requests to be kept informed in this regard.(c)	Regarding the allegations of anti-union dismissals, on  April , at the Venus confectionery and chewing gum factory, the Committee expresses its concern at the dismissal of  workers, including, according to the allegations, all of the members of the central executive board of the trade union, and that there has been no judicial ruling since the dismissals occurred (in April ).

45,".The complaint is contained in communications of  and  March  of the Union of Workers of the Drink and Allied Industries (STIBYS). The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  February .
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communications of  and  March , the Union of Workers of the Drink and Allied Industries (STIBYS) alleges that the enterprise Cervecera Hondurea SA de CV in the cities of La Ceiba and Tegucigalpa was ordered in final rulings to reinstate various workers in their posts, pay the wages that they had not received between the date of termination of their contract of employment and their reinstatement and to pay their other entitlements in accordance with the collective labour agreement. The persons concerned in the city of La Ceiba are Fredy Dueas and Leonel Afgueta Moreno, dismissed despite their right to trade union immunity as members of the central executive board of the STIBYS and, in Tegucigalpa, in accordance with the ruling of the Second Labour Court, Oscar Ramn Vallejo Montoya, Luis Alonso Valladares, Jos Javier Nez Duarte, Julio Csar Garca Ayala, Hugo Francisco Varela Valladares, Olman Antonio Sierra Ortez and Jorge Adolfo Carranza. The enterprise is not complying with these orders.
.The complainant organization indicates that, despite the fact that these workers were reinstated in their posts by court order at the premises of the enterprise in Tegucigalpa on  February  and in La Ceiba on  February  following legal proceedings for the enforcement of the ruling, in practice the enterprise is not allowing these workers to enter the workplace, nor has it issued them with their workbooks or assigned them to jobs, which constitutes the offence of disobedience as set out in section  of the Penal Code.
.Despite this ill-treatment, the reinstated workers have complied with their hours of work since their reinstatement ( and  February ). The complainant attaches the rulings of the two labour courts of La Ceiba and Tegucigalpa and of the Supreme Court of Justice, and the report by the labour judge who was prevented from entering the premises of the Cervecera Hondurea SA de CV.
.Under the terms of the collective agreement applicable to the enterprise Cervecera Hondurea SA,  The enterprise hereby affirms that if it were to be decided to separate or divide its current operations while the present collective labour agreement remains in force, compliance with the corresponding obligations contained in the collective agreement that is in force shall be guaranteed in this enterprise and in the new enterprise.' In view of the above, the STIBYS considers it appropriate to denounce the State of Honduras so that it can be reprimanded for not compelling the enterprise Cervecera Hondurea SA de CV to comply with the Constitution, section  of the Labour Code and ILO Conventions Nos  and  in so far as they relate to employment stability, and accordingly to comply with the final rulings handed down by the courts in these cases. According to the rulings, the dismissals occurred after the enterprise invoked the need for an adjustment of its staff, but without complying with the termination procedure envisaged in the collective agreement.
.In its communication dated  February , the Government states that at no time did the enterprise Cervecera Hondurea SA de CV fail to give effect to a final ruling or order handed down by the judicial authorities of the Republic of Honduras, as recorded in the proceedings of the courts of the Republic.
.The Government observes in relation to Oscar Ramn Vallejo Montoya, Luis Alonso Valladares, Jos Javier Nez Duarte, Julio Csar Garca Ayala, Hugo Francisco Varela Valladares, Olman Antonio Sierra Ortez and Jorge Adolfo Carranza that, based on the ordinary application to demonstrate justified reason for termination of employment, the Second Labour Court in its final judgement of  November  found in favour of the plaintiff and convicted the enterprise to: (a) the payment in damages of the unpaid wages until reinstatement is effective, as well as the payment of acquired entitlements; and (b) enforcement of the ruling in the event that the employer is unwilling to carry out reinstatement.
.The Government indicates that the ruling was appealed to the Labour Appeal Court of the Department of Francisco Morazn, which set aside the appeal in a final judgement of  January  and confirmed the ruling of the court of first instance. The legal representative of the employer then lodged an extraordinary appeal in cassation with the Administrative Labour Disputes Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice which, in a decision of  March , set aside the appeal and sent the case back to the Labour Appeal Court in May . The Government attaches a copy of the ruling of the Court of Cassation.
.The Government adds that after the order referred to above requiring the reinstatement of the workers was handed down by the Second Labour Court of the Department of Francisco Morazn, the Cervecera Hondurea SA de CV in good faith and, in compliance with the proposed ruling ' b) enforcement of the ruling in the event that the employer is unwilling to carry out reinstatement'  accepted and reinstated the workers concerned in accordance with the reinstatement order (attached by the Government), which was signed by the legal representative of the STIBYS, as certified on the copy of the order dated  March , which was authorized by the judge and clerk of the Second Labour Court.
.In relation to the allegations that the unpaid wages have not been received, the Government attaches the internal document and a copy of the communication sent to the Prosecutor Tito Vsquez detailing the cheques corresponding to the unpaid wages, dated  March , which were received by each of the workers.
.The Government indicates that Leonel Argueta Moreno, the only member of the union s executive board who was dismissed and who accordingly benefited from trade union immunity, was reinstated in his post on  April . Argueta Moreno continues to work in the enterprise, as agreed between the STIBYS and the enterprise Cervecera Hondurea SA de CV. The Government attaches documentation demonstrating compliance with the reinstatement order and the ruling.
.In view of the above, in relation to the information requested, and as the enterprise Cervecera Hondurea SA de CV has given effect to the rulings, the Government calls for the case to be closed. The Government attaches the following: () certification of the ruling in cassation handed down by the Labour Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice dated  March ; () the record of the proceedings before the Second Labour Court of the Department of Francisco Morazn dated  March ; () the communication sent to Prosecutor Tito Vsquez containing the details of the cheques for the unpaid wages issued to Jos Javier Nez Duarte, Luis Alonso Valladares, Olman Antonio Sierra, Oscar Ramn Vallejo, Jorge Adolfo Carranza, Julio Csar Garca Ayala and Hugo Francisco Varela; () the internal electronic mail detailing the cheques for the entitlements of the dismissed workers; and () a copy of the contract of employment of Leonel Argueta Moreno.
.The Committee notes that in the present case the complainant organization alleges that, following the dismissal of Fredy Dueas and Leonel Argueta Moreno, both members of the central executive board of the STIBYS, and seven other workers, all of whom obtained final reinstatement orders, the enterprise Cervecera Hondurea SA de CV is preventing the return of these workers to their workplaces and refuses to assign them to jobs. The judgements found that these dismissals, for which the enterprise cited the need for staff adjustment, were decided upon without complying with the procedure envisaged in the collective agreement.
.The Committee notes the Government s reply denying that the workers in the enterprise have been victims of any violation of their rights and the attached documents: () the certification of the ruling in cassation handed down by the Labour Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice dated  March ; () the record of the proceedings before the Second Labour Court of the Department of Francisco Morazn dated  March ; () the communication sent to Prosecutor Tito Vsquez containing the details of the cheques for unpaid wages issued to Jos Javier Nez Duarte, Luis Alonso Valladares, Olman Antonio Sierra, Oscar Ramn Vallejo, Jorge Adolfo Carranza, Julio Csar Garca Ayala and Hugo Francisco Varela; () the internal electronic mail detailing the cheques for the entitlements of the dismissed workers; and () a copy of the contract of employment of Leonel Argueta Moreno (reinstated on  April , that is a few days after the complaint was presented to the Committee).

47,".The Committee examined this case at its meeting in November  [see th Report, paras ' ]. On that occasion, noting that the complainant emphasized the fact that bringing a case before the courts would be too lengthy a process, the Committee requested the Government to send copies of the labour inspection reports relating to this dispute without delay, to continue taking measures, subject to substantive evidence and/or information warranting the contrary, for the reinstatement of the many dismissed union officials and members of the Trade Union of Workers at Industrias Tiara SA de CV (SITRATIARA), and to ensure that the company does not adopt any anti-union measures, in particular that it does not promote a  workers' committee' as an alternative to the trade union. The Committee also emphasized the need to impose speedy and dissuasive sanctions for anti-union acts and requested the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.In a communication dated  February , the Government states, with regard to the measures for the reinstatement of the dismissed union officials, that two complaints have been filed with the First Divisional Labour Court of San Pedro Sula by the dismissed workers. On  August , Ms Laura Pea Bonilla, Ms Mara Zenia Gmez, Ms Mayra Suyapa Carrasco and Mr Eusebio Martnez Alvarado filed an ordinary complaint relating to their dismissal with the First Sectional Labour Court of San Pedro Sula in the department of Corts. The Government adds that, on  March , the first instance ruling was issued by the First Divisional Labour Court of San Pedro Sula in favour of the complainant workers. Subsequently, on  May , the Labour Appeals Court of the department of Corts upheld the aforementioned ruling. Consequently, the lawyer for Industrias Tiara SA de CV submitted an appeal for legal irregularities to the Supreme Court of Justice, contained in Case No. S.L. -. The Government sees fit to mention that the company against which the complaint was brought has expressed its intention, via the Private Enterprise Board of Honduras, to comply with the ruling of the competent national court. The Committee takes note of this information and requests the Government to keep it informed with regard to compliance with the ruling.
.The Government adds that, on  July , the legal representative of the SITRATIARA filed an ordinary complaint with the First Divisional Labour Court of San Pedro Sula in the department of Corts for the dismissal of the members of the executive committee. On  November , Industrias Tiara SA de CV challenged the aforementioned initial complaint. The second complaint is still before the first instance body on account of lack of action by the complainant lawyer (the legal representative of SITRATIARA). The Committee takes note of this information and requests the Government to inform it of the outcome of the judicial proceedings in question.
.With regard to the prevention of anti-union measures, the Government states that the State Secretariat for Labour and Social Security Matters and the Private Enterprise Board of Honduras have exchanged correspondence and held talks with their representatives with regard to the complaint submitted by the International Textile, Garment and Leather Workers' Federation (ITGLWF) in order to prevent the implementation of anti-union measures. The Committee takes note of this information.
.In view of the Government s failure to reply, the Committee has been obliged on three occasions to postpone its examination of this case. At its meeting in June , the Committee made an urgent appeal to the Government, drawing its attention to the fact that, in accordance with the procedural rules set out in paragraph  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body, it might present a report on the substance of these cases if the observations or information requested had not been received in due time [see th Report, para. ]. To date, the Government has not sent its observations.
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:Noting that the complainant emphasizes the fact that bringing a case before the courts would be too lengthy a process, the Committee requests the Government to send copies of the labour inspection reports relating to this dispute, to continue without delay to take measures, subject to substantive evidence and/or information warranting the contrary, to bring about the reinstatement of the many dismissed union officials and members of SITRATIARA, and to ensure that the company does not adopt any anti-union measures, in particular, that it does not promote a workers' committee as an alternative to the trade union. The Committee also emphasizes the need to impose speedy and dissuasive sanctions for anti-union acts. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.",0,2006,Honduras
48,".At its meeting in March , the Committee requested the Government to inform it of the outcome of the action relating to the fine of  lempiras imposed on the teachers' organizations COPEMH and COPRUMH [see th Report, paras ' ].
.In its communication of  February , the Government states, with regard to the proceedings relating to the imposition of fines on COPEMH and COPRUMH, that an appeal has been lodged against the decision reached by the Administrative Disputes Court, which declared inadmissible the action brought by the representative of the trade unions. The Government adds that the appeal is pending in the Supreme Court of Justice, which expects to issue its ruling at the end of May .
.The Committee takes note of this information and requests the Government to inform it of the ruling issued by the Supreme Court of Justice.
.At its meeting in June , the Committee: (i) noted with interest that the authorities had abandoned the lawsuit intended to suspend the legal personality of the complainant organizations and requested the Government to keep it informed of any new decision in relation to this case; and (ii) invited the Government and the trade union organizations to find a negotiated solution to the unresolved issues before the judicial authority and to keep it informed in this respect [see nd Report, para. ].
.In its communication of  November , the Government states that, following the acquittal of Nelson Edgardo Clix, former president of the Association of Secondary Teachers of Honduras (COPEMH), Mr Avila lodged an appeal in cassation with the Supreme Court of Justice, which in its ruling of  May  on the appeal annulled the judgement and hearing and ordered the case to be retried with different judges. In view of this ruling, Mr Carlos Avila Molina, not wishing to maintain the action, dropped the case. With regard to the action brought by the teachers' organizations, COPEMH and the Professional Association of School Teachers of Honduras (COPRUMH), before the Administrative Disputes Court relating to the imposition of fines ( lempiras), the procedure is following its course and the ruling is awaited. It should be recalled, with regard to the latter case, that the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic made an offer to the teachers' organizations to suspend the fines, but the organizations did not accept the offer and decided to proceed with the case.
.The Committee notes the Government s statement that the case against trade union official Mr Nelson Edgardo Clix has been dropped. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the outcome of the action relating to the fine of  lempiras imposed on the teachers' organizations COPEMH and COPRUMH.
.With respect to this case, the Committee had requested the Government to: () keep it informed of the outcome of the lawsuit by the Minister of Education against the official, Nelson Edgardo Clix for slander, libel and defamation; () indicate whether, by virtue of the non-reprisal clause established in the  July  agreement between the Government and the complainant organizations, and specifically the clauses relating to wages and the deduction of trade union dues, the sanctions (fines) against the president of COPEMH and against COPEMH and COPRUMH, and the application to have these organizations' legal personality suspended, had been abandoned or set aside. At its meeting in November , the Committee: (i) noted with interest that the authorities had abandoned the lawsuit intended to suspend the legal personality of the complainant organizations and requested the Government to keep it informed of any new decision in relation to this case; and (ii) invited the Government and the trade union organizations to find a negotiated solution to the unresolved issues before the judicial authority, based on the non-reprisal clause arising out of the conciliation settlement of  July  and on Conventions Nos.  and  which have been ratified by Honduras and apply fully to teaching staff so that the complainant organizations should be able to represent their members without any problem whatsoever; the Committee requested the Government to keep it informed in this respect [see th Report, para. ].
.In a communication dated  January , the Government reiterated the information it had sent on  August  of which due note was taken when the case was examined in November .
.In these circumstances, the Committee calls on the Government to send the information that has been requested.
.At its June  meeting, the Committee requested the Government to communicate the result of the lawsuit filed by the Minister of Education against the official, Nelson Edgardo Clix, for slander, libel and defamation, and the result of the application for the protection of constitutional rights entered by the complainant organizations against the judgments, which, it is alleged, deny the right of these organizations to represent their members. Also, while the Committee noted with interest the settlement reached on  July  between the Government and the complainant organizations, and in particular the clauses on salaries and the deduction of trade union dues, the Committee requested the Government to indicate whether by virtue of that non-reprisal clause the sanctions (fines) on the president of COPEMH and against COPEMH and COPRUMH and the application for suspension of these organizations' legal personality have been abandoned or set aside [see th Report, paras. -].
.In its communication of  July , the Government states that the Office of the Attorney-General of the Republic has abandoned the lawsuit begun to suspend the legal personality of COPEMH and COPRUMH. With regard to the fines of  lempira imposed on these organizations by the administrative authority, the judicial authority has still not handed down a decision, the trade union officials having ignored the invitation of the Attorney-General s Office to come to an amicable arrangement and thereby to be able to eliminate the fine; according to the Government, these fines are to do with social anarchy and disorder by the education trade union officials. Moreover, the Supreme Court of Justice has not handed down a decision on the appeal for cassation filed by the Ministry of Education personally against the decision that would acquit trade union official Nelson Edgardo Clix of slander, libel and defamation. Also, the Supreme Court confirmed the other decisions appealed by the complainant organizations through application for protection of constitutional rights and has confirmed the legal decisions that found lack of legitimacy of the organizations to represent the personal rights of their members.
.The Committee notes this information and notes with interest that the authorities have abandoned a lawsuit intended to suspend the legal personality of the complainant organizations. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any new decisions in relation to this case. The Committee invites the Government and the trade union organizations to find a negotiated solution to the unresolved issues before the judicial authority based on the non-reprisal clause arising out of the conciliation settlement of  July  [see th Report, para. ] and on Conventions Nos.  and , ratified by Honduras and applied fully to teaching staff, according to which the complainant organizations should be able to represent their members without any problem whatsoever. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.In its November  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendations regarding the questions that remained pending [see th Report, para. ]:(a) While noting with interest the settlement reached on  July  between the Government and the complainant organizations and in particular its clauses on salaries and deduction of trade union dues, the Committee requests the Government to indicate whether by virtue of that non-reprisal clause the sanctions (fines) on the president of COPEMH and against COPEMH and COPRUMH and the application for suspension of these organizations' legal personality have been abandoned or set aside.(b) The Committee also requests the Government to keep it informed of the result of the lawsuit by the Minister of Education against the official Nelson Edgardo Clix for slander, libel and defamation.(c) Finally, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the result of the application for protection of constitutional rights entered by the complainant organizations against the judgements, which, it is alleged, deny the right of these organizations to represent their members.
.In its communication dated  March , the Government states that the Court of Tegucigalpa acquitted Mr. Nelson Clix of the offences of slander and libel and that this ruling was subject to an appeal for review for a procedural flaw and violation of the law before the Criminal Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice which has still not issued a decision on the matter. With regard to the right of the teachers' associations to represent their members, the Government states that a ruling is pending on an amparo (enforcement of constitution rights) appeal lodged with the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court by representatives of the Association of Secondary Teachers of Honduras (COPEMH) and the Professional Association of School Teachers of Honduras (COPRUMH) against",-1,2004,Honduras
49,"the ruling issued by the Administrative Disputes Appeal Court on  September  which upheld the decision handed down by the Administrative Disputes Court concerning the setting aside of an administrative act applied for by the abovementioned teachers' associations.
.The Committee takes note of this information and requests the Government to communicate the result of the abovementioned ongoing proceedings before the Criminal Chamber and the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice. The Committee also reminds the Government of its previous recommendation requesting it to indicate whether, by virtue of the non-reprisal clause contained in the settlement reached between the Government and the complainant organizations on  July , the sanctions (fines) on the president of COPEMH and against COPRUMH and the application for suspension of these organizations' legal personality have been abandoned or set aside.
.The complaint is set out in a joint letter from the Association of Secondary Teachers of Honduras (COPEMH) and the Professional Association of School Teachers of Honduras (COPRUMH) of  March . In a letter of  March , Education International (EI) supported the complaint. The Government sent its observations in a letter of  August .
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their letter of  March , the Association of Secondary Teachers of Honduras (COPEMH) (affiliated to the United Confederation of Workers of Honduras, which is in turn a member of the Inter-American Regional Organization of Workers, to the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions and Education International) and the Professional Association of School Teachers of Honduras (COPRUMH) (a member of Education International) allege that the Secretariat of State in the Ministry of Education and other state institutions initiated a series of acts of repression, discrimination and interference in trade union affairs in order to circumvent and eliminate the Honduran Teachers' Statute which is the legal instrument equivalent to a collective agreement, and the product of many years of struggle, contained in Decree-Law No. - of  November  and approved by the Honduran National Congress.
.These acts of repression, discrimination and interference in trade union affairs consist of:(a) Prohibition of COPEMN and COPRUMH and their president from organizing trade union activities and events, such as meetings and demonstrations, classifying such activities as a criminal offence. This prohibition was ordered by the Secretary of State for Education in a resolution of  August .(b) Imposition of economic sanctions (fines) on the said organizations by the Secretariat of State in the Ministry of Education without any legal authority. This was done by summons dated  October , requiring the president of COPEMH to pay to the General Treasury of the Republic within  hours a fine of  lempiras in respect of alleged illegal acts committed by the organization. Likewise, by summons dated  August  COPEMH and COPRUMH were required through their presidents to pay to the General Treasury of the Republic within  hours a fine of , lempiras, which fine was imposed according to the Secretariat for renewed acts in contravention of the resolution of  August . All of this is a manoeuvre to force the organization and its members to conform to government guidelines and policies, in contempt and in violation of the right freely to organize activities and formulate a programme of action set out in ILO Convention No. , and also contained and developed in the Honduran Teachers' Statute and the constitutions of the teachers' associations.(c) An application to suspend the legal personality submitted by the Public Prosecutor s Office to the labour court of first instance, announced on  May  in the national newspapers.(d) Suspension of the deduction of trade union dues of members of COPEMH and COPRUMH. Having failed to achieve the subjection of the teachers' organizations to its policies, the Secretary of State for Education informed them in a letter, ref:  SE- of  January , that with effect from December , the Secretariat of State for Education would not make deductions from teachers' salaries for their contributions or dues to their organization (trade union dues). This is in breach of article , paragraph , of the Honduran Teachers' Statute and article , paragraph , of the General Teachers' Regulations. The deductions had been made from the inception of both organizations up to the date when the Minister notified that he would no longer do so. Thus, the life insurance policy was suspended, as a result of which the teachers were left without protection. The hospital health insurance policy was suspended, as a result of which teachers and their dependents are not entitled to the medical care provided by that insurance. The medical and funeral expenses insurance was suspended. The survivors insurance for survivors of pensioners was suspended. Personal loans to members were suspended, forcing them to resort to moneylenders to the detriment of the family budget.(e) Prosecution of officials and members of the organization. In October  several of the organization s officials were prosecuted: Professor Eulogio Chvez Doblado (president at that time), Carlos Alberto Murillo, Andrs Martnez, Ricardo Pastrana, Joel Nez Medina, Nelson Edgardo Clix (president of the organization for the period -), Carlos Alberto Lanza and Luis Alonzo Sosa, of COPEMH and Professors Jorge Alberto Franco (president of the organization at that time), German Yobany Hernndez, Ftima Mercedes Andino, Carlos Roberto Leal and Angel Octavio Martnez (president of the organization for the period -). They were indicted by the Public Prosecutor s Office in the Tegucigalpa Lower Criminal Court, charged with arson and damage to property belonging to the State of Honduras and offences committed by individuals who exceeded their duties in the exercise of the rights guaranteed them under the Constitution. However, as they were innocent, they were acquitted by the Court.
.Subsequently, the Minister of Education, Mr. Carlos Avila Molina, instituted proceedings against the current president of the organization, Professor Nelson Edgardo Clix, accusing him of slander, libel and defamation for denouncing acts of interference by the Secretariat of State for Education to control the teachers' organization and seeking to install candidates supportive of the Government. The Court acquitted Professor Nelson Edgardo Clix of the offences in its judgement of  October , but the Minister of Education lodged an appeal which is to be heard by the Supreme Court of Justice, with the risk that he may be imprisoned and thus prevented from carrying out his duties as president of the organization.
.The complainant organizations add that their right to represent their members and provide them with legal defence is being impeded and denied. On  December , these organizations applied for an injunction against the State of Honduras seeking its compliance with the economic arrangements set out in articles - of the Honduran Teachers' Statute and articles  and  of the General Regulations of the Statute and against the substitution of those arrangements by an act concluded between the State and some of the teachers' organizations on  July . In this case, the Administrative Disputes Court and the Administrative Disputes Appeal Court in that city, on application by the Public Prosecutor s Office, in January , denied the right of members under the Constitution to be represented by the organization. At the present time an appeal for protection of constitutional rights is pending before the Supreme Court of Justice against the decisions that deny the organization s right to represent its members.
.In addition, the complainants continue, the right of collective bargaining has been denied. From  January , the salaries of members of the complainant organizations were paid in accordance with the act (contract) signed by the government authorities and other teachers' organizations on  July , totally ignoring the economic arrangements established in the Honduran Teachers' Statute. In January , Decree No. - of  December , published in the official journal of  January  came into force. It contains the law on the restructuring of the central government salary system which abolishes the Honduran Teachers' Statute, at the same time violating and diminishing the agreement of  July  between the State and the other trade unions. These actions are in violation of Article  of Convention No. .
.In its communication of  August , the Government states with respect to an alleged prohibition by the Secretariat for Education of the teachers' associations (COPEMH and COPRUMH) from organizing trade union activities and events (meetings, demonstrations) that on  August  the Secretariat for Education issued a resolution requiring the teachers' organizations to  cease their acts of disobedience and calls to secondary education teachers to disobedience, ill-timed suspension of work and walkouts, participation in acts of contempt and breach of public order and actions which affect the free movement of persons, goods and services, either by inciting or participating in them, and also to cease making public pronouncements and statements which offend and demean the image of the institution and",-1,2004,Honduras
50,"its representatives'  This resolution was based specifically on Article , paragraph , of Convention No.  which states:  In exercising the rights provided for in this Convention workers and employers and their respective organizations, like other persons or organized collectivities, shall respect the law of the land.' The latter is precisely the purpose of the resolution, i.e. that the exercise of the principle of trade union independence is circumscribed by the legal framework ruling in the country. What happened overstepped the bounds of the country s legal framework when members of the teachers' associations engaged in violent demonstrations using clubs, homemade bombs (molotov cocktails), stones, burning tyres, setting fire to a vehicle, causing damage to state property (destruction of the railings surrounding the National Congress Building), blocking roads, preventing the free movement established in the Constitution of the Republic. In no way and at no point was there a ban on exercising the principle of trade union independence nor did the State engage in  acts of interference' as stated in the complaint. In this respect, it should be clearly understood that the concept of act of interference contemplated in paragraph , of Article , of Convention No.  in no way covers the matters to which the complaint refers. The decision in question led to the teachers' association seeking to have it nullified, which was declared inadmissible.
.As to the alleged imposition of economic sanctions (fines) on the teachers' organizations by the Secretariat of Education without allegedly any legal provision to allow that, the Government states that the fines mentioned by the complainants were ordered by virtue of the illegal acts committed by the trade union organizations mentioned above. The legal basis was article , paragraph (a), of the Labour Code which states that  Any violation of the provisions of this Title (Freedom of Labour) shall be subject to the following sanctions: (a) fines of up to five hundred lempiras (Lps .) for the first offence;  ? It is not true that the fine was imposed to  force the organization and its members to conform to government guidelines and policies, in contempt and in violation of the right freely to organize activities and formulate a programme of action set out in ILO Convention No. '  The fines were imposed for violent acts and ill-timed strikes which constituted a breach of the peace.
.As regards the application to the Court for the suspension of the legal personality of the teachers' organizations, COPEMH and COPRUMH, by the Public Prosecutor s Office, the Government says that this was a case of a legitimate act by the Public Prosecutor s Office. The action was not taken on grounds of repression of the organizations in question for supposedly demanding compliance with the Honduras Teachers' Statute. The application for suspension was due to the unreasonable and violent behaviour of the two teachers' organizations which chose to unleash public demonstrations at national level, involving roadblocks, occupation of streets and public buildings, setting fire to vehicles, looting and destruction of school furniture, expression of insults through the media, homemade incendiary bombs (molotov cocktails), use of clubs, stones and bricks, all of which caused injury to members of the public and the police, and, of course, suspension at national level of their teaching duties, leaving the entire school population without education. At the root of all of this was the agreement concluded with the Government through the bipartite committee consisting of representatives of the Administration and four teachers' organizations. Under this agreement, the Act of  July  was concluded for the application of the Honduran Teachers' Statute to teachers' pay claims and the times at which increases would occur. This Act was approved by Legislative Decree No. -, published in the official journal on  December . This agreement was rejected in the manner described above by the leadership of the two teachers' associations, COPEMH and COPRUMH. Even when their members received the benefit of the salary increase, none of them returned that payment, nor did they make any claim or reservation in respect of the pay received, thereby consenting to the agreements from which they derived benefits. Faced with disorder and anarchy at national level, where there was a total disruption of public order, the Public Prosecutor s Office took action, seeking the suspension of legal personality.
.As regards the allegation of suspension by the Secretariat for Education of the deduction of the contribution paid by members of COPEMH and COPRUMH, the Government states that the decision by the Secretariat for Education not to make deductions of contributions of members of COPEMH and COPRUMH was purely due to economic reasons. On the one hand, there was no legal requirement for the Secretariat to make such deductions, and on the other, the operation involved very high administrative costs. It is not true that the Secretariat for Education was in breach of paragraph , of article , of the Honduran Teachers' Statute, since this provision does not require the Secretariat of State to make such deductions. The actual text of the provision states as follows:  Make voluntary, legal and judicial deductions from the teacher s salary and pay them promptly to the corresponding institutions'  In addition, article  of the constitution of the Association of Secondary Teachers of Honduras (COPEMH) states in paragraph (d):  Demand and collect the agreed ordinary and extraordinary dues'  and the constitution of the Professional Association of School Teachers of Honduras (COPRUMH), article , paragraph (c), provides that the duties of the organization s finance secretary include  collecting the association s income and making legally authorized payments' 
.It is clear from the foregoing that the Secretariat of Education is under no obligation to deduct contributions by teachers to their respective teachers' associations and that in view of the administrative constraints to which the Secretariat of Education is subject, it was necessary to reduce its costs. Moreover, as teachers' organizations have an obligation under their respective rules to collect dues from their members, it is not clear why the non deduction be them causes injury to their members. Appropriate legal appeals were lodged by COPEMH and COPRUMH against the decision of the Secretary of Education not to continue making the deduction of members' dues, and the litigation is in progress (the matter was settled by conciliation on  July , as described below).
.As to the prosecution of officials and members of the teachers' associations, the Government states that in view of the acts of vandalism committed by the teachers' leaders and members, totally outside the law, the Prosecutor-General, as legal representative of the State of Honduras, indicted the leaders of the teachers' associations for wounding, arson and damage against the State of Honduras and its internal public order during the events of  and  October . The towns of Tegucigalpa were witness to these lamentable events. It should be noted that the charge of slander, libel and defamation by Mr. Nelson Edgardo Clix against the Minister of Education, Mr. Carlos Avila Molina, was the subject of a personal action and the law which assists anyone to have access to the courts as laid down in article  of the Constitution of the Republic. Mr. Clix was the subject of a criminal indictment and the case is still in progress in the courts. It should be clearly understood that all the actions instigated against teachers' members and leaders have nothing to do with trade union activities under the principle of trade union freedom.
.As regards the complainants' allegation that supposedly  their right to represent their members and provide them with legal defence is being impeded and denied'  the Government points out that the teachers' associations applied for an injunction to set aside the administrative act consisting of Legislative Decree No. -, which approves the resolution of  July  on salary adjustments with which they did not agree. On  May , the Administrative Disputes Court declared the application inadmissible, since it had been submitted by a person with legal capacity who was not properly represented and not authorized since neither the constitution of COPEMH nor that of COPRUMH contains any provision allowing them to act as legal representative of their members. The argument advanced by the teachers' organizations is that this decision denies  the right of members to be represented by the organization conferred by the Constitution'  This argument, firstly, has nothing to do with the Secretariat of Education, since it is a decision by the judicial authority and, secondly, it is not stated which part of the decision contains this assertion.
.Concerning the alleged breach of the right of collective bargaining, the Government indicates that the complainants argue that Decree No. - of  December , which contains the law on the restructuring of the central government salary system derogates from the regime established in the Honduran Teachers' Statute, violates and diminishes the agreement of  July  between the State and the",0,2004,Honduras
51,"other trade unions. This assertion is based on Article  of ILO Convention No.  and Articles ,  and  of ILO Convention No. .
.In this respect, the growth in the salary account of central government and decentralized institutions in recent years has had no relation to inflation and economic growth, limiting the ability of the Honduran State to meet, from its own resources, the needs of the most vulnerable social groups and those who live in conditions of poverty, as well as its capacity for investment.
.With respect to the foregoing, it should be noted that the law on the restructuring of the central government salary system applies to all public servants generally, without any distinction whatsoever.
.Lastly, the Government states that on  July , the Government ended the teachers' dispute through a conciliation commission which heard the complaint by COPEMH and COPRUMH. Thus, as the parties to the dispute reached an agreement with the title  Proposed solution to the education problem'  the causes underlying the dispute disappeared and the dispute was settled. The settlement document, which includes salary and remuneration clauses, and a commitment by the Government to deduct the arrears of members' dues to the complainant organizations, is attached. For their part, the organizations undertake to make up all the days lost to strikes. The settlement includes clauses on social security, training, provision of materials, improvement of building and maintenance programmes, etc. The Government also undertakes not to take any kind of reprisals against the teachers for their actions during the campaign and the teachers undertake to return to their classes immediately.
.The Committee observes that in this complaint the complainant organizations have presented the following allegations mostly concerning  and  and that they are set against a background of a salary dispute in the teaching sector: ban on teachers' organizations from organizing meetings and demonstrations classifying such activities as offences; imposition of fines for alleged illegal acts by the teachers' organizations; application by the Public Prosecutor s Office for suspension of the legal personality of two teachers' organizations; suspension of the deduction of trade union dues of members of the teachers' organizations, thus impairing members' social protection; prosecution of  trade union officials, on charges of arson and damage to property (the court later acquitted them) and one of the leaders for alleged slander, libel and defamation, and refusal of the authorities to recognize the right of the teachers' organizations to represent their members. The complainant organizations also allege that the Government breached collective agreements and the Honduran Teachers' Statute by issuing Decree No.   which came into force on January  and which, according to the complainants, violates the Honduran Teachers' Statute and an act (contract) concluded by the authorities and other teachers' organizations on  July  containing salary-related clauses.
.As regards the last allegation, and the suspension of deduction of members' dues to the complainant organizations, the Committee notes with interest the conciliation settlement of  July , concluded between the Government and the teachers' organizations (including the complainants in this case) which includes salary and remuneration clauses, and a commitment by the Government to deduct the arrears of members' dues to the complainant organizations. For their part, the organizations undertake to make up all the days lost to strikes. The settlement includes clauses on social security, training, provision of materials, improvement of building and maintenance programmes, etc. The Government also undertakes not to take any kind of reprisals against the teachers for their actions during the campaign and the teachers undertake to return to their classes immediately. The Committee recalls in this respect that the withdrawal of the check-off facility, which could lead to financial difficulties for trade union organizations, is not conducive to the development of harmonious industrial relations and should therefore be avoided [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. ].
.As regards the allegations relating to  and , the Committee notes the Government s statements that: () in  there were violent demonstrations by teachers in which members of the complainant organizations used clubs, homemade bombs (molotov cocktails), stones, destroyed public and private property and blocked roads, committing offences of injury (against members of the public and police) arson and damage to property which had nothing to do with trade union activities. In this connection, the Secretariat of Education issued a call in the form of a resolution to cease the disruption and breach of the peace and ill-timed suspension of work and walkouts and to cease making public pronouncements and statements which offended and demeaned the image of the institution and its representative; () fines were imposed for acts of violence and ill-timed strikes which breached the peace; () application for suspension of the legal personality of the organizations was a result of the acts of violence mentioned above and the suspension by teachers of their duties at national level which left the entire school population without education; () the prosecution of officials and members of the complainant organizations was a consequence of the abovementioned offences (the complainants pointed out that the persons in question were acquitted by the courts); the lawsuit for slander, libel and defamation committed by the president of the teachers' organization (Mr. Nelson Edgardo Clix) was filed by the Minister of Education as a personal action; () as regards the salary adjustment signed by other organizations on  July , no legal provision authorizes the complainant organizations to engage in legal representation of their members; the salary question, as indicated, was the subject of a conciliation settlement with the participation of the complainant organizations.
.The Committee deplores the acts of violence which occurred arising out of the salary dispute in late . The Committee recalls that trade unions should respect legal provisions which are intended to ensure the maintenance of public order; the public authorities should, for their part, refrain from any interference which would restrict the right of trade unions to organize the holding and proceedings of their meetings in full freedom [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. The Committee observes that the conciliation settlement of  July , signed by the complainant organizations, contains a clause on non-reprisal against teachers for their actions during the campaign (dispute). The Committee requests the Government to indicate whether by virtue of that non-reprisal clause the sanctions (fines) on the president of COPEMH and against COPEMH and COPRUMH and the application for suspension of these organizations' legal personality have been abandoned or set aside. The Committee also requests the Government to keep it informed of the result of the lawsuit by the Minister of Education against the official Nelson Edgardo Clix for slander, libel and defamation.
.Finally, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the result of the application for protection of constitutional rights entered by the complainant organizations against the judgements which, it is alleged, deny the right of these organizations to represent their members.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) While noting with interest the settlement reached on  July  between the Government and the complainant organizations and in particular its clauses on salaries and deduction of trade union dues, the Committee requests the Government to indicate whether by virtue of that non-reprisal clause the sanctions (fines) on the president of COPEMH and against COPEMH and COPRUMH and the application for suspension of these organizations' legal personality have been abandoned or set aside.(b) The Committee also requests the Government to keep it informed of the result of the lawsuit by the Minister of Education against the official Nelson Edgardo Clix for slander, libel and defamation.(c) Finally, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the result of the application for protection of constitutional rights entered by the complainant organizations against the judgements which, it is alleged, deny the right of these organizations to represent their members.",-1,2004,Honduras
52,".The Committee last examined this case, concerning the refusal to grant workers the right to organize trade unions of their own choosing without previous authorization and the obstruction of trade union pluralism, at its June  meeting [see th Report, paras. -]. On that occasion, the Committee requested the Government to take into account that the free exercise of the right to establish and join trade unions implies the free determination of the structure and composition of these trade unions, and that workers should be free to decide whether they prefer to establish, at the primary level, a works union or another form of basic organization, such as an industrial or craft union. The Committee also requested the Government to amend its legislation to bring it into conformity with Conventions Nos.  and , and to guarantee that workers had the right to establish and join the organizations of their own choosing. Lastly, it requested the Government, considering the foregoing, to inform it of any new requests submitted by SITRAIMASH for legal personality.
.In its communication of  September , the Government indicates that it will take the recommendations formulated by the Committee concerning this case into account once the Labour Code has been amended according to a tripartite procedure. Furthermore, it states that although the current labour legislation still has some shortcomings, all workers and employers enjoy freedom of association. As regards the procedure for trade union registration, the Government explains that the competent bodies check that registration requests meet all of the legal requirements so as to avoid any subsequent cancellations, and that if not all the necessary conditions are met, it provides the interested parties with the relevant observations so that the indicated flaws can be corrected and, therefore, the objectives of Convention No.  are met. With regard to the procedure for obtaining legal personality through registration, the Government states that this is governed by an administrative resolution, without the right of workers and employers to establish organizations of their own choosing being undermined. Lastly, the Government states that SITRAIMASH has not made another request for registration with the Labour Administration.
.The Committee notes this information and brings the legislative aspect of this case to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.
.In its communication of  August , the International Textile, Garment and Leather Workers' Federation (ITGLWF) states that the Government of Honduras refused to grant official recognition to one of its members, the Trade Union of Assembly and Allied Industries Workers of Honduras (SITRAIMASH). This industrial trade union was founded in July  with more than  members employed in two factories: Yoo Yang and Kimi. The complainant states that the latter factory, which is now closed after having transferred its production to Guatemala, at that time already had a trade union, which on no occasion entered into competition with SITRAIMASH and strongly supported the establishment of an industrial trade union.
.The decision to establish an industrial trade union reflected the commitment of SITRAIMASH to consolidate worker representation both inside and outside the industrial estate, by enabling workers to unionize themselves without having to rely on the recognition of a new trade union in each factory. Therefore, on  August , SITRAIMASH submitted its request for legal recognition to the Ministry of Labour. However, on  September , that is, four days after the deadline had passed for assessing this request for legal recognition, the trade union sent a trade unionist, Ms. Enma Leal, to the Ministry of Labour to ascertain what stage had been reached in processing its request. The official responsible for social organizations informed Ms. Enma Leal that the request contained serious defects and persuaded her to withdraw it. The complainant organization indicates that the Ministry acted in violation of section  of the Labour Code, which states that the request should have remained in the legal system until the trade union had made the relevant amendments.
.Therefore, on  November , the trade union once again submitted its request for legal recognition. On  December , and  and  January , the trade union s lawyer, Mr. Fliz Suazo, travelled to Tegucigalpa to inquire about the status of the request, but was persistently refused any kind of information. On  February , the trade union and ITGLWF wrote to the Minister of Labour, Ms. Rosa Miranda de Galo, requesting her intervention in the matter. On  March , the Secretary-General of the State Department for the Labour and Social Security Offices wrote to the Minister of Labour in response to the letter from the trade union, and recommended that legal recognition of the trade union be refused for three reasons: a lack of documentation, discrepancies between the founding documents and the by-laws, and the fact that two trade unions could not exist at the same time at Kimi.
.On the same day, that is, almost three months after the statutory deadline, the Director of Legal Services of the Ministry of Labour notified the trade union that its request had been rejected for not having followed the established legal procedure (by allowing the creation of an industrial trade union in one of the plants covered by a factory trade union which already existed) and that it was not appropriate for all of the , assembly industry workers of Honduras to be represented by the workers from two factories, given that  legally recognized trade unions already existed in that sector.
.On  April , SITRAIMASH lodged a remedy of appeal to the Ministry of Labour, requesting that the relevant body revoke its decision; the Ministry has yet to reply. Furthermore, the complainant organization states that, even though section  of the Labour Code prohibits simultaneous membership of several trade unions of the same kind, or involved in similar activities, in this case, SITRAIMASH and the Trade Union of Workers of Kimi Enterprise of Honduras, S.A (SITRAKIMI) belong to two different categories (one is a factory trade union and the other an industry trade union). In any event, the former does not include members of the latter.
.According to the Government, the official recognition of SITRAIMASH was refused under the following circumstances. On  August , the provisional executive committee of SITRAIMASH submitted a request for recognition and the registration of legal personality before the General Directorate of Labour of the State Department for the Labour and Social Security Offices. However, the request to the Directorate-General of Labour was withdrawn with the endorsement of Ms. Magdalia Erazo Palma in her capacity as General Secretary of the new trade union s provisional executive committee, given that in accordance with section  of the Labour Code,  legal representation of the trade union shall be the function of the president of the executive committee and, in his or her absence, of the general secretary'  The Government stresses that the aforementioned observations show that the file was voluntarily withdrawn by the General Secretary of the trade union organization, not as a result of informal or unofficial action.
.However, on  November , the new trade union submitted a new request through its representative. In January , having assessed and studied the request, the Department of Social Organizations of the General Directorate of Labour issued the respective ruling in which it recommended the outright refusal of this request on the basis of sections ,  (under which it is primarily for enterprise or primary trade unions to represent members in all labour relations), , , nd paragraph, and  of the Labour Code. The General Directorate of Labour approved this ruling on  January , and the proceedings were sent to the Secretariat of Labour and Social Security for the corresponding legal formalities. On  February , the Secretariat ordered the transfer of the proceedings concerning the request for recognition and the registration of legal personality of SITRAIMASH to the Directorate of Legal Services for the purposes of the ruling. It should be noted that the applicants' legal representative should have been personally informed of this decision and should, therefore, have known of the ruling issued by the Department of Social Organizations, so that the respective amendments could be made. However, the representative did not respond in this manner. Indeed, one of the main causes of the delay in dealing with the file was the lack of acknowledgement given by this representative of the decision made by the Secretariat of Labour.
.This alleged violation of the right of defence can clearly be dismissed given that the time allowed for such action was not used, thus leading to the official notification to avoid a delay in the proceedings. On  March , the Secretariat of Labour and Social Security issued a decision declaring that the request was unfounded since it was not in accordance with the law owing to errors of form, and because it sought to form this industrial trade union with workers from two enterprises, one of which (Kimi), at that time already had a registered",0,2000,Honduras
53,"trade union. The Government adds that this decision was made available to the legal representative for a period of one month, and, in view of the lack of action on his part, it made an official notification on  April .
.In accordance with the law, the Secretariat of Labour has two days in which to notify the applicants' legal representative of its definitive decision, when unfavourable to the parties involved, but, to their benefit, this was not done within the given period in order to make it easier for the trade union organization to lodge a relevant appeal. According to the law on administrative procedures, only a remedy of reconsideration would have been an appropriate response to the Secretariat s decision, not a remedy of appeal, which was wrongly pursued by the legal representative, and declared to be inadmissible.
.Lastly, on  July , the same applicants submitted a request for the recognition and registration of legal personality of the Trade Union of Workers of the Yoo Yang Enterprise, S.A. This request was processed and approved on  November . The Government states that all workers who requested the establishment of the SITRAIMASH trade union enjoy the right of freedom of association through membership of the Yoo Yang Enterprise Trade Union (STEYY) or of the Trade Union of Workers of Kimi Enterprise of Honduras, S.A. (SITRAKIMI).
.The Committee notes that this case relates to allegations of refusal to grant workers the right to establish organizations of their own choosing without previous authorization, and the obstruction of trade union pluralism. The Committee takes note that in this regard the Government of Honduras received the request for legal personality of SITRAIMASH, submitted on  August , which was withdrawn on  September  by a member of the trade union, and then resubmitted on  November .
.The Committee observes that, according to the Government, the first application had not been processed when the General Secretary of the trade union prematurely withdrew it, whereas according to the complainant organization it was withdrawn, after the processing deadline had expired, by a trade union activist who was influenced by the official responsible for registration. The Committee takes note of these divergences, but notes that, in any event, the executive committee of the trade union submitted a second request.
.The Committee takes note that this new request for recognition and registration was rejected on the grounds of lack of form (missing documents and discrepancies between the registration of the founding instrument and the by-laws) and of content (the existence of a primary trade union and a trade union at the branch level at the same time).
.With regard to the errors of form, the Committee notes that there is a lack of evidence to make a judgement, but emphasizes that if the rejection of this request is based on a few formal errors that are difficult to correct, and if the conditions for the granting of registration are tantamount to obtaining previous authorization from the public authorities for the establishment or functioning of a trade union, this would undeniably constitute an infringement of Convention No. . This, however, would not seem to be the case when the registration of trade unions consists solely of a formality where the conditions are not such as to impair the guarantees laid down by the Convention [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. ].
.As for the substantive error invoked by the authorities to refuse legal recognition, namely the existence of a primary trade union and a trade union at the branch level at the same time, the Committee is bound to recall that under section  of the Labour Code even if it is primarily for enterprise or primary trade unions to represent members in all labour relations, this should not mean that an enterprise cannot have various trade unions of different levels at the same time. Indeed, the Committee recalls that workers should be able, if they so wish, to join trade unions at the branch level as well as the enterprise level at the same time [see Digest, th edition, , para. ]. Similarly, the Committee emphasizes that the free exercise of the right to establish and join unions implies the free determination of the structure and composition of unions, and that all workers should be free to decide whether they prefer to establish, at the primary level, a works union or another form of basic organization, such as an industrial or craft union [see Digest, th edition, , paras.  and ].
.Finally, the Committee notes that on  July  the applicants who had made the aforementioned request asked the relevant authorities to recognize the Trade Union of Workers of the Yoo Yang Enterprise, S.A. and to grant it legal personality. This request was processed and accepted on  November . The Committee also notes that, according to the Government, all workers who requested the establishment of the SITRAIMASH trade union enjoy the right of freedom of association through membership of the YOO YANG Enterprise Trade Union (STEYY) or of the Trade Union of Workers of Kimi Enterprise of Honduras, S.A. (SITRAKIMI). However, bearing in mind the right of workers to join a trade union at the branch level and at enterprise level at the same time, the Committee requests the Government to amend its legislation to bring it into conformity with Conventions Nos.  and , and so that it guarantees that workers have the right to form and join organizations of their own choosing. Moreover, the Committee requests the Government in this case, to inform it of the course of action adopted by the labour administration in response to any new requests submitted by the complainant for legal personality.
.In light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to take into account the following principles:(i) the free exercise of the right to establish and join trade unions implies the free determination of the structure and composition of unions; and(ii) workers should be free to decide whether they prefer to establish, at the primary level, a works union or another form of basic organization, such as an industrial or craft union.(b) The Committee requests the Government to amend its legislation to bring it into conformity with Conventions Nos.  and , and so that it guarantees that workers have the right to form and join organizations of their own choosing.(c) The Committee requests the Government, considering the foregoing, to inform it of the course of action adopted by the labour administration in response to any new requests submitted by SITRAIMASH for legal personality.",0,2000,Honduras
54,".The Committee examined this case at its meeting of March  (see th Report, paras.  and , approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session (March-April )) in which it reached interim conclusions. The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  May .
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee observes that in its examination of this case in March , it had requested the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the judicial proceedings under way in connection with the dismissals of workers from the Tela Railroad Company who had participated in a strike. There also remained pending the allegation concerning the raid on the trade union premises of the Central Federation of Free Trade Unions of Workers of Honduras (FECESITLIH) on  October .
.As regards the judicial proceedings under way concerning the dismissal of workers from the Tela Railroad Company who had participated in a strike, the Committee notes that the Government has requested the intervention of the judicial authorities with a view to obtaining the reinstatement in their jobs of the persons dismissed. The Committee also takes note that the Government will provide it with information on the respective judicial proceedings. The Committee expresses the firm expectation that the court will hand down its ruling shortly and that the dismissed persons will be reinstated in their jobs as soon as possible. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.As regards the pending allegation concerning the raid on the FECESITLIH premises on  October , the Committee notes that the Government states that: () on the date in question and at a time when negotiations were being held between employers and workers from the urban transport sector, a group of persons committed acts which disturbed public order and security; () it is not sure that the security forces, mobilized to protect the safety of the public, had carried out the alleged raid; and () the intervention by the security forces was not intended to violate the rights of workers and that if the raid did occur, a complaint should have been made to the national competent authorities.
.In this respect, while noting the Government's observations, the Committee reminds the Government that the inviolability of trade union premises and assets is one of the essential civil freedoms for the exercise of trade union rights (see the Resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties, adopted by the International Labour Conference in ). In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to take measures to guarantee at all times that there is full respect of the principle whereby the public authorities may not enter trade union premises without prior authorization of the occupants or without having obtained a judicial warrant.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) As regards the dismissal of workers from the Tela Railroad Company who had participated in a strike, the Committee expresses the firm expectation that the court will hand down its ruling shortly and that the dismissed workers will be reinstated in their jobs as soon as possible. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome, as it has undertaken to do so.(b) As regards the alleged raid on the FECESITLIH premises on  October , the Committee requests the Government to take measures to guarantee at all times that there is full respect of the principle whereby the public authorities may not enter trade union premises without prior authorization by the occupants or without having obtained a judicial warrant.
.The complaints in this case are contained in a communication of  July  from the Trade Union of Workers of the Tela Railroad Company (SITRATERCO) and in a communication from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) of  September . The ICFTU sent supplementary information in a communication of  November . The Government sent its observations in a communication of  December .
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and the Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ), as well as the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  July  the Trade Union of Workers of Railroad Company (SITRATERCO) states that in December  a collective agreement was negotiated with the Tela Railroad Company, and that it stipulated that the wage clause could be revised if the country's economy were to undergo serious disruptions. It adds that owing to the currently high rate of inflation, and on the basis of this provision, a wage increase was requested in January . After five months of negotiations during which the desired increase was not obtained, a general strike was declared in June . The complainant organization indicates that the labour authorities, who had been informed of the strike, convened the parties on various occasions in order to seek a solution. Following an offer made by the Government to increase wages, the strike was called off on  July. Finally, the complainant organization alleges that when the workers returned to their posts on  July , the enterprise dismissed  of them (most of whom were leaders of the local trade union committees) and closed two large farms (fincas), effectively eliminating the posts of  workers. In its communication of  September  the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) makes the same allegations as those presented by the Trade Union of Workers of the Tela Railroad Company (SITRATERCO).
.Finally, in its communication of  November , the ICFTU alleges that members of the security forces raided the premises of the Central Federation of Free Trade Unions of Workers of Honduras (FECESITLIH) on  October .
.In its communication of  December , the Government refers to the dispute between SITRATERCO and the Tela Railroad Company enterprise and states that the Ministry of Labour had on its own initiative and on numerous occasions heard the cases of the parties and tried to help them reach an agreement. The Government adds that while it was committed to encouraging the enterprises to help alleviate the current serious economic crisis, it could not demand that they reach wage agreements within certain time frames. The Government acknowledges that  workers, most of whom were trade union leaders, were dismissed after the strike began, and reports that the Ministry of Labour denounced these dismissals to the courts so that they would be aware of the injustice done to the workers and order their reinstatement. The workers have taken legal action, which is now being handled by the labour courts. Finally, the Government states that the administrative authorities have issued a decision rejecting the enterprise's request for the closing of four large farms (fincas), as the request did not comply with the provisions of the Labour Code.
.The Committee observes that the allegations refer to anti-trade union dismissals and the closing of workplaces (fincas) as a consequence of a strike, as well as the raiding by security forces of a trade union's premises.
.As regards the dismissal of a large number of trade union leaders and workers () from the Tela Railroad Company, the Committee notes that the Government: () states that the Ministry of Labour attempted to find a solution to the disputes; () confirms that  workers were dismissed following a strike; () reports that it denounced these dismissals to the courts so that they would be aware of the ""injustice done"" and would order the reinstatement of the workers.
.In this regard, the Committee considers that the evidence demonstrates the anti-trade union character of the dismissals, as they took place immediately after a strike and mainly involved trade union leaders. In this connection, the Committee welcomes the Government's call for the intervention of the judicial authorities to obtain the reinstatement of the dismissed workers in their posts, and presses the firm hope that the court will hand down its ruling in this sense shortly. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the judicial proceedings under way and hopes that those concerned will be reinstated.
.The Committee takes note of the closing of two large farms (fincas) of the Tela Railroad Company. In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to take measures to avoid the closure of worksites from being used as an anti-trade union measure.
.As regards the allegation concerning the raid on  October  by members of the security forces of the premises of the Central Federation of Free Trade Unions of Workers of Honduras (FECESITLIH), observing that the Government has not communicated its observations in this respect, the Committee draws its attention to the fact that ""the entry by police or military forces into trade union premises without a judicial warrant constitutes a serious and unjustifiable interference in trade union activities"" (see th",-1,1994,Honduras
55,"Report, Case No.  (Peru), para. ). In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to communicate its observations in this respect as rapidly as possible so that it can come to a conclusion with full knowledge of the case.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) Welcoming the Government's call for the intervention of the judicial authorities to obtain the reinstatement of the workers dismissed following the strike at the Tela Railroad Company, the Committee expresses the firm hope that the court will hand down its ruling shortly. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the judicial proceedings under way and hopes that the dismissed workers will be reinstated in their posts.(b) As regards the closing of fincas of the Tela Railroad Company, the Committee requests the Government to take measures to avoid the closure of worksites from being used as an anti-trade union measure.(c) As regards the raid on  October  of the premises of the FECESITLIH, the Committee requests the Government to communicate its observations in this respect as quickly as possible.",0,1994,Honduras
56,".The Committee has examined this case on two occasions (see st and rd reports of the Committee, paragraphs  to  and  to , approved by the Governing Body at its nd and rd Sessions (March and May-June of )), when it reached interim conclusions. Subsequently, the Government sent its observations in a communication dated  February .
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The pending allegations refer to the dismissal of workers and trade unionists at the ""El Mochito"" mine, the subsequent repression by the army of a strike held at the same mine, as well as various acts of anti-trade union discrimination at different enterprises and the need for legislative measures to prohibit solidarist associations from exercising trade union activities. In this respect, the Committee made the following recommendations (see rd report, paragraph ):The Committee deeply deplores the death of Mr. Daniel Carrasco and the physical attacks perpetrated in the course of the labour dispute following the dismissal of workers and trade union representative at the ""El Mochito"" mine. In view of the inadequacy of the Government's explanation the Committee requests the Government to take measures, if it has not already done so, to set up a judicial investigation to clarify the facts, determine responsibility and punish the guilty parties, and to keep the Committee informed of the outcome of the investigation. The Committee also requests the Government to provide further details on the reasons which led the army to intervene in the labour dispute.The Committee requests the Government to supply information on the re-instatement proceedings concerning the workers who were dismissed during the dispute in the ""El Mochito"" mine and to indicate whether they have in fact been re-instated.The Committee regrets that the Government has not responded to the remaining allegations and therefore reiterates the recommendation it made at its March  Meeting, as follows:- the Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the allegations concerning discrimination on the part of some employers against workers who are members of unions, specifically in the cases of changes in jobs of Messrs. Perdomo, Rivera and Mateo (Polymer Industrial enterprise), the suspension of workers from the Polymer enterprise, the dismissal of Mrs. Girn (Cervera Hondurea enterprise), and Messrs. Moreira and Rodrguez (Polymer Industrial enterprise) and the stipulation of non-union membership as a prerequisite for joining a solidarist association (statutes of the solidarist association at the Cervera Hondurea and Polymer enterprises);- the Committee also requests the Government to indicate the protection afforded to workers under existing national legislation against acts of anti-union discrimination, as well as the measures it intends to take to redress the anti-union dismissals which have been identified in ten enterprises and which are recognized by the Government (Kativa de Honduras, Pinturas Surekota S.A., Textiles San Pedro, Polytubo, Hondufibras, Polyproductos S.A., Termoplast, Banco del Ahorro Hondureo, Banco Futuro and Grupo de Empresas Camaroneras del Sur del Pas);- the Committee requests the Government urgently to take the legislative and other measures necessary to prohibit solidarist associations from exercising trade union activities, particularly collective bargaining, and asks to be kept informed in this respect.
.As regards the request by the Committee for an explanation of the reasons why the army intervened in the dispute at the ""El Mochito"" mine ( October ), the Government states in its communication of  February  that on  October  a military contingent on its way to the Las Vegas municipality was suddenly attacked by certain individuals at the time of the dispute and that the members of the army responded to the attack. The criminal court of Las Vegas initiated proceedings to determine the reasons and authors of the incidents which occurred in which nine workers and  soldiers were injured or suffered bruises and of one person who was not an employee of the enterprise was killed.
.As regards the dismissals in the ""El Mochito"" mine, the Government reviews in detail the circumstances of the dismissals, including in some cases the procedural aspects, and encloses a number of annexes. According to this information, on  October  the enterprise dismissed  workers (four of whom enjoyed trade union immunity - and thus according to the legislation, the enterprise was required to pay them one month's wages - and another four who accepted the full payment of their benefits). As a result of these dismissals, a group of  workers occupied the entrance to the mine between  and  October . After several attempts at conciliation by the Ministry of Labour, an agreement was reached by the parties on  October for the reinstatement of the  workers initially dismissed and the examination by a supernumerary judge of the case of  other workers who had been dismissed but who had not requested payment of their legal benefits but rather re-instatement in their workplaces. During the judicial proceedings, all the workers reached agreements with the enterprise, except four, who after several judicial refusals for their re-instatement, subsequently lodged a final appeal with the Supreme Court of Justice, an appeal which was not receivable because of a procedural error by the proxy of these workers (failure to evaluate the amount of the claim).
.As regards the allegations concerning the Cervera Hondurea enterprise, the Government denies that Mrs. Yelbania del Carmen Girn of the Cervera Hondurea enterprise was dismissed; on the contrary she was even recently promoted (the Government provides certification). As regards the Polymer Industrial enterprise, the Government states that Messrs. Santiago Mateo, Leonel Perdomo and Miguel Angel Rivera (amongst those whose jobs were allegedly changed) were never members of the trade union; that Mr. Roney Moreira was dismissed for not following the security measures indicated to him and that Mr. Vitalicio Rodrguez (product supervisor) was suspended for eight days for failing to carry out an order based on the collective agreement and the work regulations of the enterprise. The Government also denies that the Polymer Industrial enterprise dismissed  workers. The Government provides labour inspection certificates to substantiate its observations.
.The Government also states that on  November  it signed a special agreement with the workers' central organizations to submit a preliminary Bill to the National Congress to prohibit recognition of the solidarist movement (""solidarismo""). This preliminary Bill was submitted on  December  by the Ministry of Labour and the workers' central organizations. However, the National Congress did not discuss the reform because the text had not been agreed on with employers and without their participation the Congress believed it could be accused of infringing the principle of tripartism.
.The Government provides a copy of the statutes of the solidarist association of the Cervecera Hondurea enterprise (article  of which prohibits trade union members from joining the solidarist association), although it points out that the collective agreement signed in February  contains a clause in which the enterprise undertakes not to conclude pacts or agreements with organizations of non-unionized workers.
.The Government recognizes however that the Polymer solidarist association negotiates collective pacts with the enterprise, in accordance with section  of the Labour Code which applies to non-unionized workers. The trade union, however, engages in collective bargaining. The Government has not received denunciations from any of the parties.
.As regards the acts of violence which occurred during the labour dispute in the ""El Mochito"" mine, the Committee notes the explanations furnished by the Government on the participation of the army (which had allegedly been attacked by strikers when it was moving through the area of the dispute) and that the judicial authorities are carrying out an inquiry into the acts of violence against workers and soldiers. Once again the Committee deplores these acts of violence and asks the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the inquiry.
.The Committee also notes that the subject of the dismissals in the ""El Mochito"" mine was dealt with in an agreement between the parties which included the reinstatement of  workers, the payment of benefits to workers who had so requested ( workers) or recourse to the judicial authorities to settle the respective dismissals ( workers). (In the end,  of these  workers accepted the payment of benefits during the judicial proceedings; the other four workers lost their case for re-instatement on procedural grounds.) In this respect, the Committee believes that it is not competent to comment on the content of the agreement reached by the parties since this was the result of free negotiations between them, and it notes that the terms of the agreement were carried out. However, the Committee requests the Government to do its utmost to obtain the reinstatement of the four workers who could not be reinstated in their jobs for procedural reasons, and to keep it informed in this respect.
.As regards the acts of discrimination in the Cervecera Hondurea and Polymer Industrial enterprises, the Committee notes the certificates issued by the labour inspectorate certifying the existence",-1,1990,Honduras
57,"of faults of a professional nature or the non-unionization of the workers concerned or the non-existence of dismissals or alleged suspensions. As regards the other allegations of anti-union discrimination, the Committee observes that neither the complainant nor the Government has given the names of the dismissed workers, although the latter recognized in general the existence of dismissals (see st Report, paragraphs  and ). Since most of these occurred in enterprises in which solidarist associations existed, the Committee refers to the conclusions contained in the following paragraph on solidarism.
.The Committee notes that the Government, in agreement with the trade unions central organizations, presented on  December  a preliminary Bill to the National Congress prohibiting recognition of solidarism. The Committee notes that the National Congress did not discuss the preliminary Bill in order not to violate the principle of tripartism, since the text had not been agreed upon with the employers. The Committee observes furthermore that the Government recognizes the legal possibility of concluding collective pacts with non-unionized workers and that solidarist associations in fact conclude collective pacts. In this respect, the Committee repeats the conclusions of its first examination of this case (see st Report, paragraphs  and ):The interference of solidarist associations in trade union activities including collective bargaining, through direct settlements signed between an employer and a group of non-unionized workers even when a union existed in the undertaking, does not promote collective bargaining as set out in Article  of Convention No.  which refers to the development of negotiations between employers or their organizations and workers' organizations. The Committee also considers that, since solidarist associations are financed partly by employers, are comprised of workers but also of senior staff or personnel having the employers' confidence and are often started up by employers, they cannot play the role of independent organizations in the collective bargaining process, a process which should be carried out between an employer (or an employers' organization) and one or more workers' organizations totally independent of each other. This situation therefore gives rise to problems in the application of Article  in the Convention No.  which sets out the principle of full independence of workers' organizations in carrying out their activities. ... The Committee expresses the hope that the Government will urgently take the legislative and other measures necessary to prohibit solidarist associations from exercising trade union activities, particularly collective bargaining.In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to consult immediately the most representative employers' and workers' organizations with a view to submitting to the National Congress and having adopted by it, a Bill that would ensure that solidarist associations cannot exercise trade union functions and that would guarantee adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) Deploring once again the acts of violence which occurred in the ""El Mochito"" mine, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in the inquiry under way.(b) The Committee requests the Government to consult immediately the most representative employers' and workers' organizations with a view to submitting to the National Congress and having adopted by it, a Bill that would ensure that solidarist associations cannot exercise trade union functions and that would guarantee adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination.(c) The Committee requests the Government to do its utmost to obtain the reinstatement of the four workers of the ""El Mochito"" mine who could not be reinstated in their jobs for procedural reasons, and to keep it informed in this respect.(d) The Committee draws the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to the legislative aspects of this case, which refer to the application of Articles  and  of Convention No.  respecting protection against anti-union discrimination and interference in trade union activities.(e) Noting that the Government wishes to review the labour legislation, the Committee recalls that the technical services of the ILO are available to provide it with assistance in the drafting of such legislation.
.The Committee examined this case at its February  meeting and submitted an interim report to the Governing Body (see st Report of the Committee, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session (March )). Subsequently, the Government sent certain observations in a communication of  February .
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.Several allegations remained pending after the previous examination of the case: () various acts of anti-union discrimination following the creation of solidarist associations; () the assumption of trade union activities (such as collective bargaining) by solidarist associations; () the dismissal of workers and trade union representatives at the ""El Mochito"" mine, followed, shortly after, by the suppression of a strike, which left one person dead and more than  injured.
.On this last point, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) had alleged (see st Report, para. ) that at the beginning of October , the management of the American Pacific Mining Company of Canada (AMPAC) dismissed  workers, including representatives of the union protected by the Labour Code, from the ""El Mochito"" mine, accusing them of spreading union propaganda at the mine. On  October , a group of workers from the enterprise protested against these dismissals by blocking the entrance to the mine. The complainant reports that the managers of the mine requested the army to intervene and there was violent repression of the workers in an effort to remove them. The army suppression resulted in the death of Mr. Daniel Carrasco and left more than  workers injured. Furthermore, the complainant organisation regards the large-scale dismissal of workers as an indication that the American Pacific enterprise seeks to replace the existing union by a solidarist association, known as the Junta de Fomento.
.The Committee made the following recommendations (see st Report, para. ):(a) the Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the allegations concerning discrimination on the part of some employers against workers who are members of unions, specifically in the cases of changes in jobs of Messrs. Perdomo, Rivera and Mateo (Polymer Industrial enterprise), the suspension of workers from the Polymer enterprise, the dismissal of Mrs. Girn (Cervecera Hondurea enterprise) and Messrs. Moreira and Rodrguez (Polymer Industrial enterprise) and the stipulation of non-union membership as a prerequisite for joining a solidarist association (statutes of the solidarist associations at the Cervecera Hondurea and Polymer enterprises);(b) the Committee also requests the Government to indicate the protection afforded to workers under existing national legislation against acts of anti-union discrimination, as well as the measures it intends to take to redress the anti-union dismissals which have been identified in ten enterprises and which are recognised by the Government (Kativo de Honduras, Pinturas Surekota S.A., Textiles San Pedro, Polytubo, Hondufibras, Polyproductos S.A., Termoplast, Banco del Ahorro Hondureo, Banco Futuro and Grupo de Empresas Camaroneras del Sur del Pas);(c) the Committee requests the Government urgently to take the legislative and other measures necessary to prohibit solidarist associations from exercising trade union activities, particularly collective bargaining, and asks to be kept informed in this respect;(d) the Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the recent allegation concerning the dismissal of  workers from the ""El Mochito"" mine and the violent army suppression of strikers at the mine on  October , in the course of which Mr. Daniel Carrasco died and more than  persons were injured;(e) the Committee draws to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations the legislative aspects of these case concerning Articles  and  of the Convention No.  relating to protection against anti-union discrimination and against interference in trade union activities.
.The Government, in its communication of  February , states that the dispute between the Workers' Trade Union of American Pacific Inc. (SINTRAPACIFIC) and the enterprise itself following the dismissal of workers from the ""El Mochito"" mine, was of great concern to the Ministry of Labour, which immediately appointed a mediation committee. The Government adds that on  November , in an effort to settle the dispute, a high-level government committee, together with representatives of the workers who had been dismissed, of various trade union organisations and of the enterprise, agreed in writing that: () the Supreme Court of Justice should be urged to appoint a judge to rule within  days on the cases of the  dismissed workers who have not filed for social security benefits; () all the workers involved in the actions taken as a result of the dispute should be reinstated; () no reprisals should be taken against those workers who were directly or indirectly involved in the dispute, etc.
.The Government also states that Mr. David Carrasco's death did not occur on the premises of the ""El Mochito"" mine, but in the surrounding village which",0,1990,Honduras
58,"belongs to the American Pacific mining company. The Government points out that Mr. Carrasco was not a pensioner, as indicated in the allegations, although he was indeed a former employee of the mine when it was under different ownership. The Government indicates that unfortunate incidents did, in fact, take place on  October  as a result of the violent behaviour of local inhabitants, which left one person dead and several injured (including civilians as well as military staff who had been requested to help maintain order).
.The Government adds that there has never been any doubt about its declared intention to recognise SINTRAPACIFIC as the sole representatives of workers' interests, to recognise trade unions as the exclusive vehicle for the organisation of workers, and to condemn solidarism and ban it from the social and labour sphere. On no account are there grounds for blaming the Government for an ""intention"" to promote solidarism that, if it did exist, was never fostered by the Government. The Government points out that labour law in Honduras is in need of reform so that it can be implemented within a society which has undergone a radical socio-economic transformation, to prevent the creation of organisations rivalling trade unions, which are the only forms of labour organisation recognised by the present Government.
.The Committee deeply deplores the death of Mr. Daniel Carrasco and the physical attacks which took place in the course of the dispute following the dismissal of workers and trade union representatives at the ""El Mochito"" mine. The Committee notes the Government's explanations that the incidents were a result of violent behaviour of local inhabitants; that casualties included both civilians and servicemen; that Mr. Carrasco did not work at the ""El Mochito"" mine and that his death did not occur on its premises. Given the inadequacy of the Government's explanation, the Committee requests the Government to take measures, if it has not already done so, to set up a judicial investigation to clarify the facts, determine responsibility and punish the guilty parties, and to keep it informed in this connection. The Committee also reqests the Government to supply further details on the reasons for the army's intervention in the dispute, since it has merely stated that the aim was to maintain order. In addition, the Committee notes that on  November  a high-level government committee, together with representatives of the workers who had been dismissed from the ""El Mochito"" mine, of various trade union organisations and of the American Pacific enterprise concluded an agreement on how to settle the dispute at the mine following the dismissals. The Committee requests the Government to supply information on the reinstatement proceedings concerning the workers who were dismissed during this dispute and to indicate whether they have in fact been reinstated.
.As regards the complainant organisation's statement that the dismissals at the ""El Mochito"" mine heralded the enterprise's intention to replace the trade union by a solidarist association, the Committee notes the Government's condemnation of solidarism and its statement that the labour legislation is in need of reform to prevent the creation of organisations rivalling the trade unions, and that the intention, if any, to substitute the SINTRAPACIFIC trade union by a solidarist association had in no way been fostered by the Government. In this regard the Committee refers to the recommendation it made at its February  meeting, requesting the Government urgently to take legislative and other necessary measures to prohibit solidarist associations from engaging in trade union activities, particularly collective bargaining, and asking to be kept informed in this respect (see st Report, para. (c)). It reminds the Government that the ILO's technical services are at its disposal to assist in preparing new labour legislation.
.Lastly, as regards the remaining allegations concerning various acts of anti-union discrimination following the establishment of solidarist associations, and the various examples of the assumption of trade union activities (such as collective bargaining) by solidarist associations, the Committee regrets that the Government has not sent specific observations in this connection and, therefore, reiterates the recommendations it made at its February  meeting (see st Report, para. (a), (b), (c) and (e)).
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee deeply deplores the death of Mr. Daniel Carrasco and the physical attacks perpetrated in the course of the labour dispute following the dismissal of workers and trade union representatives at the ""El Mochito"" mine. In view of the inadequacy of the Government's explanation the Committee requests the Government to take measures, if it has not already done so, to set up a judicial investigation to clarify the facts, determine responsibility and punish the guilty parties, and to keep the Committee informed of the outcome of the investigation. The Committee also requests the Government to provide further details on the reasons which led the army to intervene in the labour dispute.(b) The Committee requests the Government to supply information on the reinstatement proceedings concerning the workers who were dismissed during the dispute in the ""El Mochito"" mine and to indicate whether they have in fact been reinstated.(c) The Committee regrets that the Government has not responded to the remaining allegations and therefore reiterates the recommendations it made at its March  meeting, as follows:- the Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the allegations concerning discrimination on the part of some employers against workers who are members of unions, specifically in the cases of changes in jobs of Messrs. Perdomo, Rivera and Mateo (Polymer Industrial enterprise), the suspension of workers from the Polymer enterprise, the dismissal of Mrs. Girn (Cervecera Hondurea enterprise), and Messrs. Moreira and Rodrguez (Polymer Industrial enterprise) and the stipulation of non-union membership as a prerequisite for joining a solidarist association (statutes of the solidarist associations at the Cervecera Hondurea and Polymer enterprises);- the Committee also requests the Government to indicate the protection afforded to workers under existing national legislation against acts of anti-union discrimination, as well as the measures it intends to take to redress the anti-union dismissals which have been identified in ten enterprises and which are recognised by the Government (Kativa de Honduras, Pinturas Surekota S.A., Textiles San Pedro, Polytubo, Hondufibras, Polyproductos S.A., Termoplast, Banco del Ahorro Hondureo, Banco Futuro and Grupo de Empresas Camaroneras del Sur del Pas);- the Committee requests the Government urgently to take the legislative and other measures necessary to prohibit solidarist associations from exercising trade union activities, particularly collective bargaining, and asks to be kept informed in this respect;- the Committee draws to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations the legislative aspects of this case concerning Articles  and  of Convention No.  relating to protection against anti-union discrimination and against interference in trade union activities.(d) Noting that the Government has referred to future labour legislation, the Committee reminds the Government that the ILO's technical services are at its disposal to assist in preparing this new labour legislation.
.In a communication dated  December  the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), along with the Confederation of Workers of Honduras (CTH), the General Confederation of Workers (CGT), the Coordinating Council of Peasant Organisations of Honduras (COCOH), the Independent Workers' Federation of Honduras (FITH) and the United Federation of Honduran Workers (FUTH), presented a complaint concerning the violation of trade union rights against the Government of Honduras.
.The Government submitted certain observations in a communication dated  June . In a letter of  June , the Office requested the Government to supply additional observations giving specific replies to each of the allegations presented. The additional observations have not yet been furnished. The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) presented fresh allegations in a communication dated  November .
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  December , the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), along with the Confederation of Workers of Honduras (CTH), the General Confederation of Workers (CGT), the Coordinating Council of Peasant Organisations of Honduras (COCOH), the Independent Workers' Federation of Honduras (FITH) and the United Federation of Honduran Workers (FUTH) voice their concern over the appearance in Honduras of the phenomenon known as ""solidarism"", alleging that it is undermining the Conventions on freedom of association and violating various provisions of national legislation.
.The complainants allege that the Government of Honduras has allowed the appearance and unlawful development of solidarist associations. According to the complainants, solidarism is an employers' movement, the exercise of which is directly linked to labour policies which tend towards trade union persecution, the dismissal of union leaders, coercive membership of solidarist associations, an anti-union stance, and encourage the signing of direct settlements (concluded outside the union organisation) in the place of collective agreements.
.The complainant organisations allege that solidarist associations are encroaching on the area of trade union activities and thus",1,1990,Honduras
59,"request that they be forbidden to operate and that the Labour Code expressly forbid solidarist associations from engaging in union activities such as collective bargaining.
.More specifically, the complainant organisations allege that there have been the following violations related to solidarism:- CERVECERIA HONDUREA S.A.: At a seminar, the enterprise made moves to establish a solidarist association, offering workers an organisation running parallel to the union, with interference on the part of the employers. According to the statutes of the association, workers may participate only if they do not belong to a union (article  states that the Solidarist Association of the Employees of Cervecera Hondurea S.A. is duly established and consists of permanent employees of the enterprise who are non-union members). The statutes also indicate the duties and powers of the executive committee, which include concluding agreements and collective agreements with the enterprise, which in the opinion of the complainants is a violation of Convention No.  (section  states that the duties and powers of the executive committee are to conclude agreements and collective agreements with the enterprise on behalf of the Association). Similarly, anti-union discrimination takes place in the enterprise against workers who join the union. An example of this discrimination is the dismissal of Mrs. Yelvania del Carmen Girn.- AMERICAN PACIFIC OF HONDURAS S.A.: Organisations that are parallel to the union have been established at the enterprise, including the ""Junta de fomento"" (solidarist association) and a collective agreement committee (an agreement aimed at regulating working conditions with non-unionised workers on a collective basis), which has led to direct confrontation with the union organisation. The Junta de fomento (solidarist association) includes a financial adviser and a commissary appointed by the enterprise, which shows the level of managerial support for the solidarist organisation, as does the granting by the enterprise to the organisation of company shops, electric, water and security services, as well as an administrator and a secretary. The enterprise also finances travel, per diem and training for personnel in Costa Rica. The Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare has registered the collective agreement made at the enterprise with a group of non-unionised workers.- TEXTILES SAN PEDRO: The Solidarist Association of Employees of the Managerial Group of Handall Industries is in operation at this enterprise and situations similar to those described above have arisen.- POLYMER INDUSTRIAL: The constituent documents of the Solidarist Association (text provided by the complainants) at the enterprise state the aims of the Association to maintain harmonious industrial relations within the enterprise, promote the development of salaried employees and wage-earners, promote and maintain good working conditions, and encourage saving and credit among its members. The statutes of the Association authorise it to negotiate and sign collective agreements (a means by which working conditions are regulated outside the union) and provide for the posts of commissary and administrative adviser, appointed and removed from office by the enterprise. According to the statutes of the Solidarist Association, the permanent posts of commissary and administrative adviser should ensure the smooth operation of the Association. The General Assembly resolves that both positions should be occupied by members of the Association but freely appointed and removed by the Polymer general management. In addition, the Industrial Polymer enterprise, which had initially offered a collective agreement, subsequently recommended, through its most senior solidarist activist, that collective agreements not be negotiated but replaced by individual contracts. Similarly, workers belonging to the enterprise's trade union are suffering anti-union discrimination. Specific reference is made to Messrs. Leonel Perdomo, Miguel Angel Rivera and Santiago Mateo whose usual jobs have been changed, along with Messrs. Roney Moreira and Vitalicio Rodrguez whose contracts of employment have been terminated. Sixty-three workers have also been suspended.- ENTERPRISES IN THE POLYMER GROUP (HONDUFIBRAS AND POLITUBO): A number of workers have been dismissed for attempting to set up a union, and solidarism is gaining ground quite easily since there are no union organisations at these enterprises.- TERMOPLAST S.A.: The Solidarist Association of Termoplast Employees (ASODET) has advised its members that any attempt to join an organisation other than ASODET is a violation of its statutes (to support this, the text of a communiqu sent by ASODET is provided). Similarly, the complainants report that the Collective Agreement of Termoplast Solidarist Association (text enclosed) includes clauses which establish the sole right of the Association to represent workers' interests and to use termination funds. The relevant clauses of the Collective Agreement state that: ""Clause  - the enterprise recognises the Association as the sole representative of the labour interests of its members and undertakes to negotiate with its executive committee in all individual or collective labour disputes which may arise ... Clause  - the enterprise agrees to transfer to the Association up to  per cent per month of the basic wage of the worker members provided that they contribute to the Association an equivalent percentage of savings, as laid down in its statutes. This transfer will be by way of trust funds and will be taken from the assets held in reserve by the enterprise for the payment of benefits to the workers.""- TELA RAIL ROAD COMPANY: The complainants state that the enterprise refuses to sign a new collective contract, offering instead to extend the current contract and to pay a lump sum. According to the complainants, the ulterior motive behind this action is the intention to introduce solidarism into the enterprise.
.The complainant organisations state that solidarist organisations exist in other enterprises, thus restricting the freedom of association of the workers and precluding any possibility of negotiating collective agreements. (These enterprises include: Kativo de Honduras S.A., Pinturas Surekota S.A., el Banco del Ahorro, el Banco del Futuro and Empresas Camaroneras del Sur del Pas, etc.)
.According to the complainants, the Ministry of the Interior has granted or is considering granting legal personality to various solidarist associations: the Association of Salaried Employees and Wage Earners of Polymer Industrial S.A., the Savings Association of Staff of the Kativo Company and Industrias Surekota S.A., the Solidarist Association of the Grupo Accesorios Elctricos y Controles S.A. de C.V. (ACEYCO) and various solidarist associations in enterprises dealing in hardware. Similarly, the complainants report the existence of a National Committee of Honduran Solidarist Associations, established with the aim of formulating and carrying out a plan of action which would help strengthen solidarism in Honduras.
.The ICFTU, in a communication of  November , alleges that at the beginning of October , the management of the American Pacific Mining Company (AMPAC) of Canada dismissed  workers, including representatives of the union protected by the Labour Code, from the ""El Mochito"" mine, accusing them of spreading union propaganda at the mine. On  October , a group of workers from the enterprise protested against these dismissals by blocking the entrance to the mine. The complainant reports that the managers of the mine requested the army to intervene and there was violent repression of the workers in an effort to remove them. It is reported that the alleged army suppression resulted in the death of Mr. Daniel Carrasco and left more than  workers injured. Furthermore, the complainant organisation regards the large-scale dismissal of workers as an indication that the American Pacific enterprise seeks to replace the existing union by a solidarist association, known as the Junta de fomento.
.The Government, in its communication of  June , states that it respects Conventions Nos.  and  and that the Secretariat of State and the Labour Inspectorate monitor their implementation. The Government reports that faced with the allegations presented, the General Directorate of the Regional Office of San Pedro Sula (a region where solidarism has a stronghold and the location of enterprises in which the alleged violation of trade union rights have taken place) carried out the appropriate investigation.
.The Government adds that the General Directorate of the aforementioned Office reported that legally established unions were in existence in the Cervecera Hondurea S.A., American Pacific S.A., Polymer Industrial S.A. and Tela Rail Road Company, with a collective labour contract governing relations between employers and workers. Furthermore, it states that in the other enterprises (Kativo de Honduras, Pinturas Surekota S.A., Textiles San Pedro, Polytubo, Hondufibras, Polyproductos S.A., Termoplast, Banco del Ahorro Hondureo, Banco Futuro and the Grupo de Empresas Camaroneras del Sur del Pas) trade unions did not exist, since these enterprises have used various methods to avoid being notified by trade union branches of their constituent resolutions and regard all contracts of employment with employees who participate in setting up such branches as terminated.
.As regards the solidarist associations, the Government points out that according to the General Directorate such organisations do exist in some of the aforementioned enterprises, and it indicates that these movements have not gathered enough strength to undermine the existing union organisations. Similarly, it states that investigations at various enterprises (not named) show that violations of freedom of association have not been proven.
.The Committee notes that the complainant organisations allege:- discrimination on the part of some employers against workers who are members of unions, in",0,1990,Honduras
60,"the form of changes in jobs, suspensions and dismissals of an anti-union nature following the establishment of solidarist associations;- the involvement of solidarist associations in union activities such as collective bargaining;- the dismissal of  workers including representatives of the union protected by the Labour Code, from the ""El Mochito"" mine who were accused of spreading union propaganda within the mine; and the violent army suppression of the strike called at the mine following these dismissals, in the course of which Mr. Daniel Carrasco died and more than  persons were injured.
.The Committee strongly regrets that, despite the length of time which has elapsed since the complaint was submitted in December , the Government has not sent a reply to the very detailed allegations in spite of repeated requests to do so by the Committee and the Office. As regards the alleged discrimination on the part of some employers against union members, in the form of suspensions, changes in jobs, dismissals, and the use of threats to ensure participation in solidarist associations, the Committee observes that the complainant organisations have made specific reference to the following cases: () the dismissal of Mrs. Yelvania del Carmen Girn, from the Cervecera Hondurea enterprise; () the change in jobs affecting Messrs. Leonel Perdomo, Miguel Angel Rivera and Santiago Mateo at the Polymer enterprise; () the termination of the employment contracts of Messrs. Roney Moreira and Vitalicio Rodrguez at the Polymer enterprise; () the suspension of  workers at the Polymer enterprise; and () the criterion of non-union membership as a prerequisite for belonging to a solidarist association (statutes of the solidarist associations of the Cervecera Hondurea enterprise and the Polymer enterprise). Given that the Government has not offered specific observations on these allegations, the Committee requests that it send its reply and indicate the protection afforded to workers under existing national legislation against acts of anti-union discrimination. At the same time, the Committee notes that the Government clearly recognises that in ten enterprises where solidarist associations exist, workers who have tried to set up a union have been dismissed. In these circumstances, the Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that under Article  of Convention No. , ""workers shall enjoy adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment"". It calls upon the Government to indicate the measures it intends to take to redress the acts of anti-union discrimination found by the authorities at the ten enterprises in question. It also recalls the importance that it attaches to the principles contained in Article  of Convention No.  which establishes the total independence of workers' organisations from employers in the exercise of their activities.
.As regards the solidarist associations' alleged involvement in union activities, the Committee notes that the Government has limited itself to declaring that solidarist associations do not interfere in union activities. The Committee must point out, however, that the statutes of various solidarist associations provided by the complainants indicate that, at least in some cases, they are authorised to conclude agreements and collective agreements with enterprises (statute of the solidarist association in Cervecera Hondurea, and statute of the solidarist association in Polymer Industrial). Similarly, the Committee observes that at the American Pacific enterprise, where a union is in existence, industrial relations (wages, working conditions, etc.) are governed by a collective agreement negotiated in the framework of the solidarist association. Furthermore, the Committee observes that the statutes of the solidarist associations at the Polymer Industrial and American Pacific enterprises provide for the posts of commissary and financial administrator, appointed by the enterprise, and that the complainant organisations have pointed out - and the Government has not denied - that the American Pacific enterprise has granted considerable facilities and advantages to the solidarist association. Finally, the Committee observes that the Ministry of Labour has registered collective agreements made in the framework of solidarist associations (for example, in the case of the American Pacific and Termoplast enterprises). The Committee therefore concludes that at certain enterprises solidarist associations are carrying out what are specifically union activities, particularly in the area of collective bargaining. In this regard, the Committee repeats the conclusions it made at its May  meeting relating to another case involving solidarism, in which it stated:The interference of solidarist associations in trade union activities including collective bargaining, through direct settlements signed between an employer and a group of non-unionised workers even when a union existed in the undertaking, does not promote collective bargaining as set out in Article  of Convention No.  which refers to the development of negotiations between employers or their organisations and workers' organisations. The Committee also considers that, since solidarist associations are financed partly by employers, are comprised of workers but also of senior staff or personnel having the employers' confidence and are often started up by employers, they cannot play the role of independent organisations in the collective bargaining process, a process which should be carried out between an employer (or an employers' organisation) and one or more workers' organisations totally independent of each other. This situation therefore gives rise to problems in the application of Article  of Convention No.  which sets out the principle of full independence of workers' organisations in carrying out their activities. (See th Report, Case No.  (Costa Rica), para. .)
.In these circumstances, the Committee expresses the hope that the Government will urgently take the legislative and other measures necessary to prohibit solidarist associations from exercising trade union activities, particularly collective bargaining.
.As regards the recent allegations concerning the dismissal of  workers from the ""El Mochito"" mine, and the violent army suppression of the strike called there, in the course of which Mr. Daniel Carrasco died and more than  persons were injured, the Committee notes that the Government has not sent observations on this matter. The Committee observes that these are recent allegations and requests the Government to reply as soon as possible.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the allegations concerning discrimination on the part of some employers against workers who are members of unions, specifically in the cases of changes in jobs of Messrs. Perdomo, Rivera and Mateo (Polymer Industrial enterprise), the suspension of workers from the Polymer enterprise, the dismissal of Mrs. Girn (Cervecera Hondurea enterprise), and Messrs. Moreira and Rodrquez (Polymer Industrial enterprise) and the stipulation of non-union membership as a prerequisite for joining a solidarist association (statutes of the solidarist associations at the Cervecera Hondurea and Polymer enterprises).(b) The Committee also requests the Government to indicate the protection afforded to workers under existing national legislation against acts of anti-union discrimination, as well as the measures it intends to take to redress the anti-union dismissals which have been identified in ten enterprises and which are recognised by the Government.(c) The Committee requests the Government urgently to take the legislative and other measures necessary to prohibit solidarist associations from exercising trade union activities, particularly collective bargaining, and asks to be kept informed in this respect.(d) The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the recent allegations concerning the dismissal of  workers from the ""El Mochito"" mine and the violent army suppression of strikers at the mine on  October , in the course of which Mr. Daniel Carrasco died and more than  persons were injured.(e) The Committee draws to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations the legislative aspects of this case concerning Articles  and  of Convention No.  relating to protection against anti-union discrimination and against interference in trade union activities.",-1,1990,Honduras
61,".The United Federation of Workers of Honduras (FUTH) presented a complaint of infringement of freedom of association and of trade union rights in a communication dated  October . The Government furnished its observations on the case in a letter dated  December , which reached the ILO on  February .
.Honduras has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In a letter dated  October , the United Federation of Workers of Honduras (FUTH) alleges that members of the executive committee and  members of the Union of Workers of the Housing Office (SITRAINVA) were dismissed for trade union activities in breach of national legislation and of international standards.
.The complainant Federation explains that on  October  the general administrator of the Housing Office (INVA) used the restructuring that had been taking place in this state enterprise as an excuse to carry out these dismissals and that, despite section  of the Labour Code which affords special protection to members of the executive committee of a trade union, these persons were dismissed without just cause. The said section  provides that:It shall not be lawful to dismiss from his employment any worker who is a member of the executive committee of a union, at any time from the date of his election until six months after he has ceased to hold office, unless evidence is first submitted to the competent labour or civil judge showing that there is lawful cause for terminating his contract of employment. The judge shall decide the matter in accordance with summary procedure. Where a union is divided into branches and sub-branches, this rule shall apply only to the central executive committee.Any employer contravening the preceding paragraph shall be required to pay the union concerned the equivalent of the worker's wages for six months by way of damages, without prejudice to the rights of the worker himself.
.Furthermore, the Federation goes on to say, the administrator of the INVA is said to have alleged that there had been no infringement of trade union rights since the union's executive committee was not registered as such with the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare.
.The Federation states in this respect that on  August  the new chairman of the SITRAINVA sent a written communication to the Director-General for Labour and Social Welfare, within the specified time-limit, informing him of the change in the executive committee and requesting, on the basis of supporting documentation, registration of the new executive committee. However, states the Federation, because of circumstances which give reason to question the intentions of the authorities, examination of the application was delayed with the result that, when the administrator of the INVA decided on the dismissals in question, the executive committee had still not been registered.
.The Federation considers moreover that failure to register the executive committee cannot justify - as the administrator of the INVA sought to do - the non-application of section  of the Labour Code since the only condition stipulated by this condition is that the election of the members of the executive committee must have been lawfully organised, as was the case.
.The Federation considers the dismissal of the  trade unionists to be unlawful since the reason invoked, namely restructuring of the enterprise, does not constitute a valid reason for termination of a contract of employment by the employer under section  of the Labour Code.
.According to the Federation, the above-stated facts demonstrate collusion between the administrator of the INVA and the Ministry of Labour authorities and are an infringement not only of national laws and regulations but of international standards, and in particular of Convention No. .
.The Federation therefore calls for the ending of these infringements of national and international law which are causing serious prejudice to the workers concerned, for the restoring of the law that is now being disregarded and for reinstatement of the dismissed workers.
.The Government begins its communication by stating that the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare has definitely not acted in collusion with any official in order to undermine the workers' interests since it is he who safeguards the strict application of labour standards based on social justice and equity.
.As regards the alleged dismissal of members of the executive committee and of  trade unionists of the SITRAINVA for trade union activities, the Government refers to the records of the General Directorate of Labour in which all the facts connected with this affair since  July  are filed. It states in particular that in July  an objection was lodged against the executive committee of the SITRAINVA in respect of the election of its members which, it was maintained, should be rendered null and void. The signatories of the application for registration then demanded that this objection be disregarded, but this was contrary to legal procedure; following examination of the facts, which showed the objection to be founded, the executive committee of the SITRAINVA, in accordance with the law, was not registered. All that was recorded in respect of the executive committee of the SITRAINVA was therefore its registration for the period from August  to August . Nothing else has been recorded since  August , when the executive committee of the SITRAINVA ceased to exist legally.
.Under the circumstances, the Government maintains, section  of the Labour Code which affords special protection to members of the executive committee of a trade union in the event of dismissals does not apply since the conditions covered by the provision had not been fulfilled and, furthermore, the six months' period referred to had expired in February .
.As regards the allegation of delay in the examination of this case, the Government refers to section  of the Act in respect of administrative procedure which provides for an appeal to the superiors of any official, in the event of unjustified delay and other failings in administrative procedure.
.Finally, as regards the grounds for the dismissals, the Government states that section  of the Labour Code admittedly does not refer to the restructuring of an enterprise as one of the valid reasons for terminating a contract of employment; on the other hand, it does provide that any worker or group of workers who consider that their interests have been prejudiced may appeal to the competent authorities for a hearing and to seek justice.
.The complaint in this case concerns the dismissal, on  October , of the members of the executive committee and  members of the Trade Union of Workers of the Housing Office (SITRAINVA) at the Housing Office (INVA).
.The Committee notes that, according to the Government, in July  an application for the registration of a former executive committee of the SITRAINVA, elected on  July, was rejected following an objection that had been lawfully lodged against this election. This meant that, as from  August , no executive committee of the SITRAINVA had been registered and that section  of the Labour Code could not therefore be invoked in this case.
.As regards the alleged reason for the dismissals - the restructuring of the INVA which the Federation challenges as illegal - the Committee notes that the Government does not comment on this and merely confines itself to stating that any worker who believes himself to have been unlawfully dismissed may, in accordance with the laws and regulations, initiate proceedings which lead to an award of damages. It does not, however, state whether, in this particular case, the workers dismissed from the INVA availed themselves of this right.
.Since the dismissals affected the entire union executive committee, the Committee asks both the complainant and the Government to indicate the specific reasons which motivated these dismissals so that the Committee is able to determine whether they were based on union activities.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee requests both the complainant and the Government to indicate the specific reasons which motivated the dismissals of the entire union executive committee and  members of the Trade Union of Workers of the Housing Office so that the Committee is able to determine whether they were based on union activities.",1,1990,Honduras
62,".The Committee examined this case on two previous occasions (see th and rd Reports of the Committee, paras. - and -, approved by the Governing Body at its th and rd Sessions (May-June  and May-June  respectively)) when it presented interim conclusions. The Government sent new observations in a communication dated  May .
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.At its last examination of the case (May ), there remained pending the allegations concerning the murders of trade union leaders Javier Bonilla Medina and Ramn Antonio Briceo, threats on the lives of trade unionists Hilario Aguilera and his family and the forced entry into his home by an armed group. The Committee requested the Government to inform it of the outcome of the inquiries undertaken to throw light on these serious events and to adopt appropriate measures to guarantee the physical safety of the trade unionist Hilario Aguilera and his family and his rights and freedoms as a citizen (see rd Report of the Committee, para. ).
.In its communication of  May , the Government states that the inquiries into the murder of Mr. Javier Bonilla Medina are at the pre-trial stage and that it has been established that the persons initially accused of the murder were not the real culprits. As regards the assassination of Mr. Briceo, the Government states that inquiries are also at the pre-trial stage.
.Finally, as regards the search carried out on the home of Mr. Hilario Aguilera, the Government states that there was insufficient evidence to corroborate the denunciation of criminal conduct and that the matter has not been pursued since then by the party concerned.
.As regards the murders of the trade union leaders Javier Bonilla Medina and Ramn Antonio Briceo, the Committee notes that the Government merely states that the proceedings and investigations continue at the pre-trial stage. The Committee expresses its deep concern, observing that according to the information sent by the Government judicial investigations into the murder and disappearance of trade unionists rarely lead to the identification of the alleged culprits. In the Committee's opinion, this situation means that in practice the guilty parties enjoy impunity, which reinforces the climate of violence and insecurity and thus has an extremely damaging effect on the exercise of trade union rights. The Committee once again deplores these murders and trusts that the judicial inquiries can be concluded as soon as possible. It requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of these inquiries.
.As regards the allegation concerning the threats on the lives of trade unionists Hilario Aguilera and his wife, and the forced entry into his home by an armed group, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, the denunciation of criminal conduct lodged by Mr. Aguilera was not supported with sufficient evidence and that the party concerned has not pursued the matter. In order to be able to make a fully informed decision on this aspect of the case, the Committee requests the complainant to provide further information on this matter, and in particular to indicate why the person in question did not pursue the matter.
.The Committee deeply regrets that the Government has not replied to the request made to it in May  for the adoption of appropriate measures to guarantee the physical safety of the trade unionist and his family and his rights and freedoms as a citizen. In these circumstances, the Committee urges the Government to take these measures, if still requested by the person concerned and his family, and draws the attention of the Government to the fact that trade union rights can only be exercised in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind against trade unionists, and that it is for governments to ensure that this principle is respected (see rd Report of the Committee on Freedom of Association, para. ).
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee once again deplores the murders of the trade union officials Javier Bonilla Medina and Ramn Antonio Briceo. The Committee expresses its deep concern, observing that according to the information sent by the Government judicial investigations into the murder and disappearance of trade unionists rarely lead to the identification of the alleged culprits. In the Committee's opinion, this situation means that, in practice, the guilty parties enjoy impunity, which reinforces the climate of violence and insecurity and thus has an extremely damaging effect on the exercise of trade union rights. The Committee trusts that the judicial inquiries under way can be concluded as soon as possible and asks the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of these inquiries.(b) The Committee asks the complainant to provide detailed information on the allegation according to which the trade union official Mr. Aguilera, who was allegedly the victim of death threats and forced entry into his home, did not maintain his complaint before the courts.(c) The Committee deeply regrets that the Government has not supplied information on the request made to it in  for the adoption of appropriate measures to guarantee the physical safety of this trade unionist and his family as well as his rights and freedoms as a citizen. The Committee urges the Government to take such measures if still requested by the person concerned and his family, and draws the attention of the Government to the fact that trade union rights can only be exercised in a climate that is free from violence and pressure of any kind against trade unionists, and that it is for governments to ensure that this principle is respected.
.The Committee examined this case at its May  meeting and submitted an interim report to the Governing Body (see th Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (May-June )). Because it had not received the Government's observations by the time of its subsequent meetings, the Committee had to postpone the examination of this case on two occasions; at its meeting of February  the Committee launched an urgent appeal and drew the attention of the Government to the fact that in accordance with the procedural rules set out in paragraph  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body, it would present a report on the substance of this case at its next meeting even if the observations or information requested from the Government had not been received in due time. Since then, the Committee has still not received any communication from the Government.
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations which remained pending following the Committee's previous examination of the case (May ) concern the murders of trade union leaders Javier Bonilla Medina and Ramn Antonio Briceo, threats to the lives of trade unionists Hilario Aguilera and his family, and the forced entry into his home by an armed group.
.At its meeting of May , the Committee formulated the following recommendations (see th Report, para. ):As regards the murders of the trade union officials Javier Bonilla Medina and Ramn Antonio Briceo, the Committee stresses that a climate of violence such as described in this case constitutes a serious obstacle to the exercise of trade union rights; the violent acts in question require severe measures to be taken by the authorities to ascertain fully the facts, determine responsibilities, punish those responsible and prevent the repetition of such actions. The Committee urges the Government to inform it of the outcome of the inquiries undertaken to throw light on these serious events and of the report of the Supreme Court of Justice and the armed forces' special committee, once these have been completed.Concerning the death threats against the trade union official Hilario Aguilera and his wife, and the violent entry into their home by unidentified armed persons, the Committee deplores this type of intimidation and recalls that trade union rights can only be exercised in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind against trade unionists, and that it is for governments to ensure that this principle is respected. The Committee urges the Government to adopt appropriate measures without delay to guarantee not only the physical integrity of the trade unionist Hilario Aguilera and his family, but also his rights and freedoms as a citizen. It requests the Government to keep it informed of the measures taken in this respect and of the outcome of the judicial inquiries undertaken.
.The Committee deeply deplores the Government's silence on these allegations and its failure to cooperate with the Committee's procedures, and specifically, the fact that it has not sent the information requested in spite of an urgent appeal. Owing to the time which elapsed since the allegations were filed ( June",-1,1990,Honduras
63,"), the Committee has no choice but to examine this case without the benefit of the Government's observations.
.The Committee draws the attention of the Governing Body to the Government's attitude in this case, considering that acts of violence and murders which have been perpetrated against trade union leaders require the authorities to take severe measures in order to throw light on all the alleged deplorable acts. The Committee stresses that a climate of violence, coercion and threats aimed at trade union leaders and their families does not encourage the free exercise and full enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set out in Conventions Nos.  and . The Committee considers that all States have the undeniable duty to promote and defend a social climate where respect of the law reigns as the only way of guaranteeing respect for and protection of life, honour and property of citizens. It urges the Government once again to send its full observations on all of the pending allegations.
.The Committee reminds the Government that the purpose of the whole procedure set up in the ILO for the examination of allegations of violations of freedom of association is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact. If the procedure protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side should recognise the importance of formulating, so as to allow objective examination, detailed replies to the allegations brought against them (see First Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body in March ).
.The Committee emphasises the seriousness of the allegations concerning the murders of trade union leaders (Javier Bonilla Medina and Ramn Antonio Briceo), death threats and the search of a trade unionist's home (Hilario Aguilera). The Committee again draws the Government's attention to the fact that a climate of violence such as that surrounding the murder or disappearance of trade union leaders constitutes a serious obstacle to the exercise of trade union rights; such acts require severe measures to be taken by the authorities (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, rd edition, , para. ).
.The Committee reiterates the conclusions and recommendations which it had formulated in its previous examination of this case. Therefore, it requests the Government to report the outcome of judicial investigations and to take the necessary measures to guarantee the physical integrity of trade unionist Hilario Aguilera and his family.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee deeply deplores the Government's silence on these allegations and its failure to cooperate with the Committee's procedure in spite of the urgent appeal which the Committee addressed to it at its previous meeting.(b) The Committee draws the attention of the Governing Body to the Government's attitude in this case, considering that acts of violence and murders which have been perpetrated against trade union leaders require the authorities to take severe measures in order to throw light on all the alleged deplorable acts.(c) The Committee stresses that a climate of violence, coercion and threats aimed at trade union leaders and their families does not encourage the free exercise and full enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set out in Conventions Nos.  and .(d) The Committee considers that all States have the undeniable duty to promote and defend a social climate where respect of the law reigns as the only way of guaranteeing respect for and protection of life, honour and property of citizens. It urges the Government once again to send its full observations on all of the pending allegations.(e) The Committee reiterates the recommendations it formulated at its May  meeting which are set out below:As regards the murders of the trade union officials Javier Bonilla Medina and Ramn Antonio Briceo, the Committee stresses that a climate of violence such as described in this case constitutes a serious obstacle to the exercise of trade union rights; the violent acts in question require severe measures to be taken by the authorities to ascertain fully the facts, determine responsibilities, punish those responsible and prevent the repetition of such actions.

It requests the Government to keep it informed of the measures taken in this respect and of the outcome of the judicial inquiries undertaken.
.The ICFTU submitted its allegations of violations of freedom of association in Honduras in a communication dated  June . The FUTH sent a communication dated  October  in support of the allegations submitted by the ICFTU. The Government sent its observations on some of the allegations in a communication dated  March .
.Honduras has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  June , the ICFTU expressed its concern at the wave of violence that swept Honduras in May and June . The majority of persons affected were members or leaders of various trade union organisations, seeming to imply that there were political motives behind these occurrences.
.In its communication of  May , the ICFTU deplored the fact that in San Pedro Sula, armed civilians violently broke into the home of the Secretary of International Relations of the Union of Workers of the National Electricity Enterprise (STENEE), Hilario Aguilera, and illegally interrogated his wife, Antonia Ortega, demanding information on her husband's activities. On  May at . p.m., two armed persons once again broke into Antonia Ortega's home, threatening her with death if she did not reveal the whereabouts of her husband. Later, on  May, at . p.m., armed individuals stopped Antonia Ortega in the street, threatening her with death if she did not hand over the keys to her home. Thanks to the intervention of a number of passers-by, she was able to escape. Those responsible for these actions were travelling in vehicles that have not been identified. Its methods are similar to those used by the members of the Anti-Insurrectional Department of the Navy (former batallion -), responsible for various violations of human rights.
.On  May , at . p.m., an armed unidentified person murdered the leader Francisco Javier Bonilla Medina, who was until last year the president of the Trade Union of Workers of the Honduran Social Security Institute (SITRAIHSS), on the El Chile bridge in Tegucigalpa. In addition, Francisco Bonilla was a delegate of the Congress of Trade Unions and member of the advisory council of the FUTH (Single Federation of Workers of Honduras). He worked in the department of electrical equipment. He was murdered when leaving a meeting of the trade union in the company of some of his colleagues. When they were crossing the El Chile bridge, an individual emerged from the darkness at the extreme north of the bridge and fired on the trade unionist at close range. After committing the crime, the murderer immediately fled to an outlying suburb, poorly lit and with little police surveillance. The criminal fired further shots in an attempt to kill the victim, but did not succeed.
.The ICFTU notes that given the background to the case, this is a political crime and cannot be anything else because the victim did not have any personal enemies. He died later when being transported urgently to hospital. The ICFTU also points out that the crime occurred when the trade union to which the victim belonged was threatened with dissolution, because the employers were demanding that its legal personality be withdrawn. What is more, the new Director of the Social Security Institute fails to respect clauses of the collective labour agreement and wants to set up a parrallel trade union; to attain this end, he has carried out massive dismissals and recruited new staff acknowledged to be officials having military training who joined the trade union in that capacity.
.The communication from the ICFTU concludes by deploring the fact that on  June  at  p.m., the body of the -year old trade unionist Ramon Antonio Briceo, was found; Mr. Briceo was a leader and active member of the Trade Union of the Central Bank of",0,1990,Honduras
64,"Honduras. He was employed by this same bank, held a degree in economics and was a leader of the FRU (University Reform Front). The body was discovered on a deserted plot between the Kennedy and los Llanos districts in Tegucigalpa. It showed obvious signs of having been tortured before being riddled with  bullets. His face was almost shattered by the impact of four bullets (one in the mouth, two in the forehead and one in the right eye). Many neighbours believe that the victim was not executed in the place where he was found as no shots had been heard. However, the body was pierced in  places as a result of shots from a firearm.
.In its communication of  October , the FUTH sent press cuttings giving details of the murders of the trade union leaders reported by the ICFTU and expressed its full support for the complaint submitted by the ICFTU.
.In its communication of  March , the Government refers to the complaint alleging death threats against Hilario Aguilera, secretary of international relations of the Union of Workers of the National Electricity Enterprise (STENEE) and encloses a copy of the ""criminal complaint for attempted kidnapping and death threats"" brought by the victim before the rd Departmental Criminal Court of San Pedro Sula - which was acknowledged and sealed by the above-mentioned court. The ruling pronounced by the Supreme Court of Justice will be sent to the Committee since it is being treated as a matter of urgency.
.As regards the murder of Francisco Javier Bonilla, former president of the Trade Union of Workers of the Honduran Institute of Social Security (SITRAIHSS), many theories as to the grounds for this crime have been aired, both in the daily newspapers and the trade union media. It has been suggested that it was a crime of passion, being revenge based on occupational differences with the employers and even persecution by the armed forces in the country. The Government points out that no light has been shed on all these occurrences and that the only information it has is that contained in the newspapers and in the decision of the Supreme Court of Justice, which will be sent to the ILO as soon as it has been completed. The Government points out that it would be irresponsible to ascribe the crime to any grounds whatsoever without having any evidence to confirm the accusation, because nothing is  per cent certain; the only thing that is certain is the deplorable death of the leader, Mr. Bonilla Medina, which has deeply saddened the social organisations of the trade union movements in particular and Honduran society in general.
.The Government adds that when the armed forces were informed that they had been cited as possible perpetrators of these events, they promised publicly to carry out a detailed inquiry and set up a special committee for this purpose. They declared their horror and sorrow at the crime committed and rejected the irresponsible accusations that recognised organisations had made against them.
.The Government also refers to the discovery of the body of Ramon Antonio Briceo on  June  and points out that there has been much speculation, similar to the other cases mentioned. In trade union circles, there has been conjecture as to the possible grounds for this death ranging from trade union reasons to personal motives. Information on this case has also been requested from the Supreme Court of Justice and it will be sent in due time. The Government encloses a number of press cuttings and points out that this is more or less all the information it has on these deplorable deaths.
.Finally, the Government reiterates its promise to send the report it has requested from the Supreme Court of Justice, which it trusts will contain elements of information that might cast a certain light on the justified complaints and satisfy the Committee on Freedom of Association.
.The Committee observes with concern that the allegations submitted in this case refer to the murder of the trade union leader Javier Bonilla Medina on  May ; to the bloody murder of Ramon Antonio Briceo, trade union activist of the Trade Union of the Central Bank of Honduras on  June ; and to death threats and the violent breaking into the home of the trade union official Hilario Aguilera and his family by armed persons on two occasions.
.As concerns the murders of the trade union officials Javier Bonilla Medina and Ramon Antonio Briceo, the Committee, while noting that the Government maintains that it has no evidence as to the possible motives of this crime or presumed guilty persons and that the armed forces have set up a special committee to investigate these events, emphasises that a climate of violence such as that described in this case constitutes a serious obstacle to the exercise of trade union rights. The violent acts in question require severe measures to be taken by the authorities to ascertain fully the facts, determine responsibilities, punish those responsible and prevent the repetition of such actions (see, in this respect, the Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, rd edition, , paras.  and ). The Committee urges the Government to inform it of the outcome of the inquiries being carried out so as to cast light on these serious events and of the report of the Supreme Court of Justice and the special committee of the armed forces, when these have been completed.
.As concerns the death threats against the trade union official Hilario Aguilera and his wife and the violent entry into their home by unidentified armed persons, the Committee deplores this type of intimidation. It recalls that trade union rights can only be exercised in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind against trade unionists and that it is for governments to ensure that this principle is respected (see in this respect, Digest, para. ). The Committee urges the Government to adopt appropriate measures without delay not only to guarantee the physical integrity of the trade unionist Hilario Aguilera and his family but also his rights and freedoms as a citizen. It requests the Government to keep it informed of the measures taken in this respect and of the outcome of the judicial inquiries undertaken.

65,".The complaint is contained in a letter from the Single Federation ofWorkers of Honduras (FUTH) dated  June . The Government replied in aletter of  February .
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of theRight to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and Right to Organise andCollective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Single Federation of Workers of Honduras (FUTH) alleges in itsletter of  June  that, since May , it has repeatedly butunsuccessfully been applying to the authorities to be registered and for itslegal personality to be recognised, complying for this purpose with all therelevant legal requirements. The FUTH emphasises that this non-registration isa clear violation of Convention No.  and it attaches a copy of theapplications it has been making to the Ministry of Labour since .B. The Government's reply
.In its letter of  February , the Government states that bydecision of  December  it granted legal personality to the SingleFederation of Workers of Honduras.
.According to the Government's observations, the application for legalpersonality submitted by the FUTH in  contained some anomalies, of whichthe Federation was duly informed. The organisation, however, did not responduntil January , when anomalies were again noted but which the FUTH agreedto amend. On  June  the Department for Social Organisations of theSecretariat of State for Labour issued a ruling in favour of granting theFederation legal personality, of approving its statutes and of delivering therelevant official papers. Nevertheless, following an opinion by the legaladviser to the Secretariat of State for Labour within the framework ofministerial policy to prevent inter-union disputes, the Secretariat of Stateissued a ruling on  August  according to which ""on the basis of section
.The Committee notes with interest the granting of legal personality tothe Single Federation of Workers of Honduras, by decision of  December .The Committee nevertheless observes that this legal personality was grantedseven years after it had first been applied for; that the Government hasfurnished no observations on the reasons for not acceding to the applicationfor legal personality submitted by the FUTH in  (a copy of which issupplied by the Federation), the Government's explanations covering only theperiod -; and that the Government's version of the facts revealsconsiderable delays in dealing with the application, which delays in somecases were caused by the FUTH but also by the authorities. For example, theproposal to include in the rules a provision allowing for the settlement ofinter-union disputes since the Labour Code does not require - it merelypermits - the inclusion of provisions of this kind. Consequently, theCommittee regrets the delays which took place in dealing with FUTH'sapplication for legal personality, which without a doubt prevented thisorganisation from lawfully exercising its trade union rights for a long periodof time.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites theGoverning Body to approve the following recommendations:a) The Committee is pleased that the Single Federation of Workers ofHonduras was granted legal personality after so many years.b) The Committee hopes that measures will be taken to speed up theprocedure in respect of the granting of legal personality to trade unionorganisations so as to avoid undue delay.",1,1988,Honduras
66,".The complaint is contained in a communication from a trade union named ""El Mochito"" (SOEM) dated  March . The Government submitted its observations in a communication dated  June .
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  March , the SOEM alleges that the management of the mining company Rosario Resources Corporation harassed workers and their representatives with a view to destroying the trade union organisation which represents them. The company set up shock units and dismissed workers for symphathising with the trade union, thereby infringing the collective labour agreement drawn up between the parties, which establishes procedures for laying off staff.
.The SOEM points out that the company selectively dismissed workers connected with the trade union, as in the case of Cristbal Almendrez and Eva Ros, trade union officials who were dismissed for no apparent reason. The Rosario Resources Corporation also downgraded several workers to lower posts, with less wages, which, in accordance with legislation in force, is tantamount to an indirect dismissal. This, for example, happened to Maximiliano Salinas. The SOEM adds in its communication that the Rosarios Resources Corporation, as from  January , withheld more than , Lempiras (L,) belonging to the trade union, allegedly to pay the trade union contribution and loans, with a view to paralysing the trade union financially.
.As regards the official recognition of the SOEM's executive committee, the communication adds that, in January , the Ministry of Labour issued a certificate stating that as long as there were two executive committees and that neither had been legally recognised, the executive committee which completed its term of office on  December last year would continue to carry out its functions. However, the company refused to accept the Ministry of Labour's certificate, stating that it was invalid.
.As regards the collective agreement signed between the workers and the company, it was mentioned that the company had not fulfilled the terms of article  of the agreement signed with the workers, according to which ""the company, acknowledging the need to contribute towards the natural culture by training its workers and dependents, undertakes to provide a sum in legal tender for a bipartite committee composed of the company's and trade union's representatives, set up to promote secondary, technical and university education"". As regards the agreement concluded by the company to provide housing for the workers, the communication states that claims for improvements and building of housing, in accordance with the worker's needs, had been disregarded.
.Finally, the SOEM states, in its communication, that medical assistance, towards which workers contribute with a . per cent reduction in their net wage, has deteriorated since .
.The communication concludes by requesting the Government to instruct the Ministry of Labour to take legal measures against the above-mentioned company in order to settle the problems affecting the workers.
.In its communication of  June , the Government states that it has tried to attend to all the claims put forward by the trade union ""El Mochito"" and that on many occasions, the Secretary of Labour and Social Welfare has ordered staff members of the Labour Inspectorates to go on the spot to investigate allegations made by the SOEM, in an immediate attempt to reconcile the parties involved and to settle the problems raised by meeting and discussing with trade union officials.
.In its communication, the Government points out that the President of the Republic received the company's management and workers' representatives and that it undertook to grant a subsidy which would benefit all workers affected by the strike decreed in the Rosario Resources Corporation at the ""El Mochito"" workplace, half-way through .
.In its communication, the Government points out that the Rosario Resources Corporation has closed down and that, in accordance with the labour legislation in force, the corporation has, to date, paid all the corresponding benefits to the workers engaged by it.
.Finally, the Government points out that there are strong possibilities that at least half of the workers laid off as a result of the closure of the Rosario Resources Corporation will be recruited by the other company negotiating the purchase of the ""El Mochito"" mine. The Government also sends copies of the records on the inspection carried out by the staff of the General Labour Inspectorate and official documents stating that the President of the Republic fulfilled his commitment to pay a subsidy to the workers, which bear witness to the good faith of the Government's efforts; it adds that it will send any information it receives on the number of workers recruited by the new company.
.The Committee notes that in the present case the complainant has submitted allegations in connection with the selective dismissals of workers sympathising with the trade union ""El Mochito""; it also alleges that the company held back funds belonging to the trade union, that it did not recognise the trade union executive and that it failed to fulfil the commitments entered into in the collective agreement concluded between the employer and workers.
.The Committee notes the efforts made by the Government to try and resolve the problems alleged by the complainant, particularly its attempts to reconcile the parties, the inspections carried out by staff of the labour inspection offices at the workplaces and the meeting the President of the Republic held with representatives of the company and trade union officials of the SOEM.
.However, the Committee notes that, at the time the complaint was submitted (March ), the trade union ""El Mochito"" was still encountering problems with the mining company Rosario Resources Corporation.
.In these circumstances, the Committee feels bound to draw attention to certain principles which are relevant to the allegations submitted by the complainant. As regards the dismissal of trade unionists, the Committee, noting the allegation that the company infringed the clauses of the collective agreement relating to cuts in staff, feels bound to recall generally that, in accordance with Article  of Convention No. , ratified by Honduras, workers shall enjoy adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment. Similarly, the Committee would recall that the basic regulations that exist in the national legislation of Honduras prohibiting acts of anti-union discrimination are inadequate when they are not, as in the present case, accompanied by procedures to ensure that effective protection against such acts is guaranteed.
.As regards the company's failure to acknowledge the temporary recognition by the Ministry of Labour of one of the two trade union's executives, the Committee would point out that the complainant has not supplied sufficient information to determine which of the two executive committees is the legitimate one. In this connection, the Committee would recall the principle that recognition by an employer of the main unions represented in his undertaking, or the most representative of those unions, is the very basis for any procedure for collective bargaining on conditions of employment in his undertaking.
.Finally, the Committee takes note of the information provided by the Government on the closure of the mining company Rosario Resources Corporation and that negotiations are taking place with another company for the purchase of the ""El Mochito"" mine.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:a) The Committee considers that the Government should adopt measures to permit the effective application of the provisions designed to protect workers against acts of anti-union discrimination.b) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the number of workers who are reinstated by the new company in the ""El Mochito"" mine, and the manner in which trade union rights are exercised in the new company.",-1,1987,Honduras

.The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) states that Mr. Cristbal Prez Daz was a leader of the Beverage and Allied Workers' Trade Union, and that he was gunned down in front of his home in Tegucigalpa by unidentified civilians. The ICFTU adds that Mr. Cristbal Prez Daz was a member of the trade union committee which was negotiating a collective agreement with the authorities responsible for the Honduran social security, and that he had led the workers' demonstration on May Day. The ICFTU adds that trade union, political and church leaders agree that the killing was motivated by political and trade union considerations.
.In its communication of  November  the Government regretfully states that it can shed little light on the death of Mr. Cristbal Prez Daz on  May , since the National Investigation Department as well as the Criminal Court of San Pedro Sula are unable to provide additional information as the case is still in its preliminary stages. The Government adds that the unfortunate event occurred in San Pedro Sula, and not in Tegucigalpa.
.In its communication of  March , the Government reiterates that it is unable to provide additional information, given the status of the case.
.The Committee deeply regrets the violent death of trade union leader Cristbal Prez Daz on  May . On previous occasions in cases involving allegations concerning the death of a trade union leader, the Committee has urged that judicial investigations be held with a view to clarifying the facts, and identifying and punishing the guilty parties. In this connection, the Committee notes that the Criminal Court of San Pedro Sula has instituted proceedings concerning the death of Mr. Cristbal Prez Daz, and that the proceedings are still in a preliminary stage. The Committee expresses the hope that the proceedings will conclude in the near future with the identification of the guilty parties.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee deeply regrets the violent death of trade union leader Cristbal Prez Daz, and requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in the corresponding investigation and proceedings.",-1,1986,Honduras
68,".The Committee on Freedom of Association at its meeting in May , in considering the cases concerning Honduras (Nos.  and ) requested the Government to accept a direct contacts mission, given the gravity of the allegations and the lack of information available concerning Case No.  (see th Report of the Committee, para. ), and in order that the various aspects of Case No.  might be fully examined (see th Report, para. ) . Moreover, at its November  meeting, the Committee expressed the hope that the direct contacts mission would be able to obtain information on the allegation pending in connection with Case No.  (see st Report, para. ). Finally, an allegation made in the context of Case No.  was still pending before the Committee (see th Report, para. ).
.At the st Session of the International Labour Conference (Geneva, ) the Government representative of Honduras formally requested that the direct contacts be carried out in order to elucidate the situation and to bring the country's legislation into conformity with Conventions Nos.  and .
.Subsequently, the Government of Honduras, in a communication dated  November , agreed that the mission should take place from  to  January .
.The Director-General of the ILO appointed as his representative to carry out this mission Mr. Andrs Aguilar, ex-president of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, and a member of that Commission and the Committee on Human Rights. The mission took place in Tegucigalpa on the dates mentioned above. Mr. Alberto Odero, a member of the Freedom of Association Branch of the International Labour Standards Department, and Mr. Luis Zamudio, Regional Adviser on Standards, accompanied the representative of the Director-General during the mission.
.The mission held talks with His Excellency Mr. Amado H. Nez, Minister of Labour and Social Welfare, and with senior officials of the Ministry, as well as representatives of the employers' and workers' organisations.
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee wishes first of all to thank Mr. Andrs Aguilar for having agreed to carry out the direct contacts mission and for his detailed report on the pending cases, which made it possible for the Committee to examine them. The Committee considers that the report of the representative of the Director-General shows how useful missions of this kind are in elucidating the matters arising from allegations by the complainant organisations.
.Since the content of the allegations and the information supplied by the Government, as well as the information obtained by the representative of the Director-General during the mission are contained in the mission report (see Annex), the Committee may proceed directly to formulate its conclusions on the various cases.
.The Committee takes note of the report of the representative of the Director-General on the mission to Honduras from  to  January . The Committee notes with interest the fact that the representative of the Director-General received every facility from the authorities of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare in carrying out the mission. In this connection the Committee notes that the information obtained during the mission on the disappearance of two trade union leaders referred to in the complaints does not contain any new elements.
.When the Committee considered this case at its May  meeting (see th Report, paras. -) two matters were still pending. First, the Committee had requested the Government to supply information on the alleged murder of Jacobo Hernndez, a trade union leader of the Honduran National Peasants' Association (ANACH), and had called attention to the need to carry out judicial inquiries in that regard. The Committee had also requested the Government to supply information on the latest developments in the proceedings concerning the murder of Dagoberto Padilla, Ismael Ulloa, Angel Alvarado and Carlos Alcides Meja, and on the attempted murder of Pedro Chavarra, Jacobo Nez and Eulogio Figueroa, all leaders or members of the Workers' Union of the Agricultural and Cattle Raising Company of Sula (SITRACOAGS). The Committee had stressed the seriousness of the allegation that the manager and owners of SITRACOAGS were involved in the murder and attempted murders and considered that since it was a penal matter it should be subject to a criminal investigation. It therefore urged the Government to provide information on this investigation. Finally, subsequent to the latest examination of the case by the Committee, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), in a communication dated  October , presented new allegations concerning the disappearance of Mr. Jos Manuel Guerrero, President of the ""El Mochito"" Mineworkers' Union, who was reported by the ICFTU to have been detained by soldiers of the th Infantry Brigade.
.Concerning the death of Mr. Jacobo Hernndez, the ANACH union leader, the Committee notes that, according to the mission report, proceedings commenced on  March  against Mr. Marco Tulio Pineda Torres (at present detained in the central penitentiary of Tegucigalpa) for the crime of homicide.
.Regarding the murder of four SITRACOAGS leaders and the attempted murder of three other leaders of that organisation, the Committee notes that, according to the mission report, the relevant trial for murder or attempted murder is still at the indictment stage. The Committee also takes note of the various developments that have taken place in that trial: () of those who were earlier detained on charges of murder, Mr. Alfredo Villeda Henrquez and Mr. Moiss Orellana have been found not guilty of criminal liability; () those charged with the attempted murder of Pedro Chavarra, Jacobo Nez and Eulogio Figuera are the subject of warrants of arrest; () Mr. Marco Antonio Molina and Mr. Fausto Isal Garca are still fugitives from justice and before escaping from prison they confessed to the judicial authorities that they had committed the murders, as may be seen from the court documents given to the mission.
.As to the involvement of the manager (Mr. Carlos Gonzlez) and the owners of the Agricultural and Cattle Raising Company of Sula (particularly, Mr. Jaime Echeverra) in the murders, the Committee notes that the judicial authorities have released these persons since there were no grounds for their continued detention.
.Whenever allegations concerning the death or serious injury of trade union leaders or unionists have been submitted to it, the Committee has always insisted that a judicial inquiry be carried out with a view to elucidating the facts in full, determining responsibilities and punishing the guilty parties. In the present case, the Committee notes that trials are under way, and that it has been possible to identify the two alleged perpetrators of the murders or attempted murders, even though they are fugitives from justice. In these circumstances, the Committee expresses the hope that the proceedings in question will be concluded as soon as possible and will enable the guilty parties to be punished; it requests the Government to keep it informed of the final results.
.With respect to the disappearance of the trade union leader Mr. Jos Manuel Guerrero, the Committee takes note of the written communication given to the mission by the Minister of Labour, indicating that absolutely reliable sources have informed the security authorities that Mr. Jos Manuel Guerrero, President of the ""El Mochito"" workers' union, was trafficking in explosives and was involved in other activities tending to undermine the tranquillity of the nation, peace and democracy, and that he was therefore arrested on  October . However, given that the necessary investigations proved his innocence, he was released immediately and continues to exercise his trade union functions; Mr. Guerrero is now engaged in politics and was elected a deputy to the Congress by the National Party.
.In these conditions, in view of the fact that Mr. Guerrero was imprisoned because he was falsely accused of trafficking in explosives, and that he was freed once his innocence was proved, the Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that the arrest or detention of trade union leaders or trade unionists in conditions such as those presently alleged may not only constitute a serious interference in union activities, but also may create a climate of intimidation and fear prejudicial to the normal development of trade union activities. When taken on trade union grounds, they are contrary to the principles of Convention No. .
.When the Committee examined this case at its May  meeting (th Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (May-June )), two questions were pending. The first concerned the alleged interference by the Government in the constitution of an organisation and in the election of trade union leaders through the adoption, in , of an Act governing the constitution of the teachers' organisation COLPROSUMAH. The Committee recalled with firmness that in ratifying Convention No.  the Government had undertaken to grant workers' organisations the right to draw up their constitutions and rules and elect their representatives in full freedom. The Committee therefore requested the Government to indicate what measures it envisaged taking to",-1,1984,Honduras
69,"repeal the provisions of the national legislation which are incompatible with the Convention and to enable the organisation in question to adopt its own rules in conformity with Article  of Convention No. . The second pending question referred to the non-reinstatement of  teachers, mentioned by name, who were dismissed on account of a strike in . The Committee considered that dismissal on account of a strike constituted serious discrimination in employment for the exercise of a lawful trade union activity, and was contrary to Convention No. , ratified by Honduras; it insisted that the Government state what measures it envisaged taking to secure the reinstatement of the dismissed teachers.
.Moreover, the complainant organisation in a communication of  December  presented new allegations in which it stated that on  December Mr. Ambrosio Sabio, former President of COLPROSUMAH, had been arrested. The complainant added that it appeared that the arrest had been made at the request of the rival group formed by the Government within this organisation.
.The Committee notes that the Minister of Labour told the mission that it would be very difficult to take steps to repeal the  Act which governs the constitution of the Professional College for the Advancement of Teaching in Honduras (COLPROSUMAH). The Committee also notes that, according to the Government, the  Act was adopted by the National Congress at the request of the executive committee of COLPROSUMAH that is recognised by the authorities. The Committee observes in this connection that, according to the Government, COLPROSUMAH is not a trade union organisation but a professional college of teachers. A  Act already governed the constitution of COLPROSUMAH before the adoption of the  Act and according to the Government teachers are not barred from forming trade unions.
.Apart from the fact that COLPROSUMAH is a professional college, the Committee wishes to recall that at its May  meeting (see th Report, para. ) it concluded that COLPROSUMAH was an organisation which should enjoy the guarantees of Convention No.  since its aim was to promote and defend the interests of teachers (see th Report, Case No.  (Honduras), para. ). Moreover, with respect to the  election of the executive committee which was later recognised by the authorities, the Committee had implicitly considered that acts of interference contrary to the principles of Convention No.  had been committed (see th Report, Case No.  (Honduras), para. ).
.With respect to the  teachers who are still dismissed because of the  strike, the Committee notes the detailed information provided by the Government from which it concludes that a number of the teachers mentioned by the complainant organisation were teaching in State schools, and that the rest had given up teaching to take up other non-teaching jobs or activities of a political nature, or for legally sanctionable reasons not connected with the above-mentioned strike were not employed in the service. The Committee observes that the executive committee of COLPROSUMAH which was not recognised by the authorities told the mission that the problem of the dismissed teachers had not been resolved: one of the persons interviewed by the mission (Mr. Marcelino Borjas) said that he was still dismissed and that others were teaching in private schools.
.Since the unrecognised COLPROSUMAH executive committee undertook, during the mission, to send the ILO a precise account of the position of the persons dismissed, the Committee adjourns examination of this allegation pending receipt of this information.
.Regarding the arrest of Mr. Ambrosio Sabio (ex-President of COLPROSUMAH), the Committee notes that, according to the Government, the proceedings that began in  against Mr. Sabio for the offences of forging private documents, usurpation of functions and persistent embezzlement of COLPROSUMAH, are at the indictment stage. The Committee also notes that according to the Government Mr. Sabio was arrested on  December  and provisionally released on  January , certain proceedings having been declared invalid and there being insufficient grounds for the issue of a warrant of arrest.
.The Committee also notes the statement made by Mr. Sabio to the mission, particularly the fact that the accusation against him dates from  and that already then the First Criminal Court found no grounds for his arrest. He was arrested some days after the regular congress of COLPROSUMAH which had been convened by the unrecognised board on  December . Since  four judges have been dealing with the matter without issuing a warrant of arrest for lack of grounds. Inexplicably, in the course of a very short substitution in December , the warrant was issued by a judge, who, in total disregard for legality, certified that in November  the officially recognised executive committee of COLPROSUMAH had been properly elected.
.In these circumstances, the Committee, noting that Mr. Sabio was released  days after his arrest since there were no grounds for his imprisonment, concludes that the measures taken to deprive Mr. Sabio of his freedom were of an anti-union nature. The Committee deplores Mr. Sabio's imprisonment and at the same time draws the Government's attention to the fact that the arrest or detention of trade union leaders or trade unionists because of their functions or their activities as such are contrary to the principles of Convention No. .
.The Committee had requested the Government to communicate the results of the investigation being carried out concerning the whereabouts of the trade union leaders Mr. Rolando Vindel Gonzlez (see th Report, Case No. , para. ) and Mr. Gustavo Morales (see st Report, Case No. , para. ).
.The Committee notes that, as mentioned in the mission report, the investigations are continuing, but that as yet the whereabouts of the leaders are still not known. In these circumstances, the Committee expresses its concern at the length of time that has elapsed since the disappearance of these leaders, and requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in the investigations being carried out to discover their whereabouts.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:a) The Committee takes note of the report of the representative of the Director-General on the mission carried out from  to  January  in Honduras. The Committee notes with interest that the representative of the Director-General received every facility from the authorities of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare in carrying out the mission.b) With respect to the murder of a leader of ANACH, the murder of four leaders of SITRACOAGS and the attempted murder of three leaders of that organisation, the Committee observes that trials are under way and that two of the alleged perpetrators have been identified although they are fugitives from justice. The Committee expresses the hope that the trials under way will be concluded as soon as possible and that they will enable the guilty parties to be punished; it requests the Government to keep it informed of the final results.c) As regards  teachers who are still dismissed because of the  strike, the Committee notes the information provided by the Government but adjourns examination of this allegation pending receipt of information on the present position of the dismissed teachers which, during the direct contacts mission, the unrecognised COLPROSUMAH executive committee undertook to send.d) Concerning the arrest of two trade union leaders who have now been released (Mr. Jos Manuel Guerrero and Mr. Ambrosio Sabio), the Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that the arrest or detention of trade union leaders or trade unionists because of their functions or activities as such are contrary to the principles of Convention No. .e) The Committee expresses its concern at the long period that has elapsed since the disappearance of the trade union leaders Messrs. Roldando Vindel and Gustavo Morales, and requests the Government to keep it informed of developments of the investigations under way to ascertain their whereabouts.
.The Committee examined this case at its February  meeting when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body (see th Report, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (February-March )). Subsequently, the Government submitted its observations in a communication dated  April .
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No.), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No.).
.When the Committee examined the case at its February  meeting, two questions remained unresolved. The first of these concerned a decision taken by the judicial authority to suspend the legal personality of the National Power and Electricity Undertaking trade union for six months as a result of the strike held on  September . The Committee requested the Government to provide information on this matter.
.The second question remaining unresolved concerned the disappearance of the trade union leader, Gustavo Morales. The Committee requested the Government to communicate the results of the investigation being carried out by the authorities as a matter of urgency.
.In its communication of  April , the Government states",-1,1984,Honduras
70,"that the decision taken by the judicial authority to suspend for six months the legal personality of the trade union of the National Power and Electricity Undertaking was appealed against in the Labour Appeals Court. The Government communicates the decision of the Appeals Court, dated  October , revoking the judicial decision of the tribunal of first instance and reducing the period of suspension of legal personality from six to two months. Consequently, the legal personality of the above-mentioned trade union was restored on  November .
.Regarding the disappearance of the trade union leader, Gustavo Morales, the Government expressed its concern at the situation and stated that it would be in touch with the relevant authority for information on the investigations into the matter.
.The Committee notes the decision of the Labour Appeals Court of  October , whereby the period of suspension of the legal personality of the trade union of the National Power and Electricity Undertaking was reduced from six to two months. Considering that, as a result of this decision, legal personality was restored to this trade union on  November , and that the Committee concluded at its February  meeting that the declaration of illegality of the strike held on  September  in the National Power and Electricity Undertaking did not infringe the principles of freedom of association because the undertaking in question was providing an essential service in the strict sense of the term (see th Report, para. ), the Committee considers that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.
.With respect to the disappearance of the trade union leader, Gustavo Morales, the Committee regrets not having received information on the outcome of the investigation into this matter, and requests the Government to communicate the results of this investigation. The Committee expresses the hope that the direct contacts mission accepted by the Government, and scheduled for January , will be able to obtain information and discuss this question with the authorities.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:a) the Committee considers that the allegation concerning the suspension of the legal personality of the National Power and Electricity Undertaking trade union does not call for further examination;b) regarding the disappearance of the trade union leader, Gustavo Morales, the Committee regrets not having received information on the outcome of the investigations into this matter and requests the Government to communicate the results of these investigations;c) the Committee expresses the hope that the direct contacts mission accepted by the Government and scheduled for January , will be able to obtain information and discuss this matter with the authorities.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the World Federation of Trade Unions dated  September . The Government replied in communications of  October and  November .
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No.), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No.).
.The complainant alleges that on  September , , workers of the National Power and Electricity Undertaking (ENEE) went on strike, demanding a  per cent wage increase; they also demanded to know the whereabouts of their leaders and called for the latter's release.
.The complainant adds that on  September , the Minister of Labour declared that the strike was illegal and that all the strikers were dismissed. This meant that the undertaking was not obliged to pay the strikers any seniority-related severance allowance. At the same time, the undertaking decreed the mobilisation by the military of all its employees.
.The complainant further alleges that the strike was put down by military and para-military units, resulting in the disappearance of a number of trade union officials, including the President of STENEE (Mr. Rolando Vindel) and another trade union official (Mr. Gustavo Morales). (The Committee has already examined the allegation relating to the disappearance of Mr. Vindel under Case No. : see th Report, paragraphs -.) According to the complainant, the number of trade union leaders and activists in the country who have disappeared or been murdered as a result of the intervention of the government forces against the workers is .
.The Government states that on  June  the National Electricity Undertaking and its Union of Workers signed a collective labour agreement which was to run for a period of three years. Accordingly, both parties, making use of their rights and in accordance with sections  and  of the Labour Code, denounced the collective agreement before the corresponding authority of the Ministry of Labour with the objective of negotiating a new collective agreement. For this purpose the parties opened discussions with a view to a direct settlement; these discussions ended on  December  without a solution to the dispute having been found.
.The Government adds that the Union of Workers of the National Electricity Undertaking asked the Ministry of Labour to open mediation proceedings, and the Ministry accordingly declared closed the discussions aimed at direct settlement and open the mediation proceedings, appointing mediators in accordance with the provisions of sections  and  of the Labour Code. During the mediation proceedings, the parties were unable to reconcile their views in order to arrive at a satisfactory agreement, and the Board declared the mediation proceedings closed on  September .
.The Government further states that, in the light of the report presented by the Mediation Commission to the Ministry pronouncing the closure of the mediation proceedings in connection with the negotiation of the new collective labour contract to be signed between the National Electricity Undertaking and its Union of Workers, the Ministry was concerned at the outcome of this disagreement, and attempted to find a point of convergence between the parties so as to enable the dispute to be settled peacefully. Accordingly, by official decision of  September  the Ministry ordered the opening of conciliation proceedings and for this purpose required the undertaking and the trade union each to present a list of three candidates to form a Special Conciliation Board, with the proviso that if the parties failed to execute its order the Ministry would appoint the Board itself. The undertaking and the union presented their lists in conformity with the above-mentioned decision. The Ministry of Labour, by a decision dated  September , declared the conciliation proceedings open, designating the members of the Special Conciliation Board which was officially established on  September . In conformity with the procedure laid down in section  of the Labour Code the Special Conciliation Board called a hearing of both parties on  September at  p.m. Both parties appeared at the hearing, which took place in accordance with the established public order, and agreement was reached on four out of the five clauses in dispute that had remained pending from the mediation proceedings. The clause on which no agreement was reached was the wage clause. The hearing was suspended at . a.m. on  September  and was resumed at the appointed time on the same day, namely  p.m. The hearing began with an exchange of views, but no agreement was reached on the disputed clause. The hearing lasted until . a.m. on  September , and it was agreed to resume it at  p.m. on the same day, when it was decided that the Special Conciliation Board would present a final proposal to help the parties reach an agreement which would put an end to the dispute. This proposal could not be formulated because at  p.m., before the appointed time of  p.m., the union issued a call to strike, and the discussions thus remained at the conciliation stage.
.The Government claims that, in calling the strike, the union was contravening the provisions of section  of the Labour Code, which provides that a collective stoppage of work shall be unlawful ""when the preliminary procedure for a direct settlement or for mediation, conciliation and arbitration has not been followed as laid down by law"". An aggravating factor in this case was that the undertaking was a state undertaking providing public or essential services, in which case the parties are obliged, under section  of the Labour Code, to submit the dispute for compulsory arbitration if no agreement can be reached through conciliation proceedings. In virtue of the infringement of the law by the trade union in failing to exhaust the procedures provided for thereunder, the undertaking applied to the Ministry of Labour to have the strike declared illegal, and the Ministry granted this application. In pursuance of section  of the Labour Code, as amended by Decree No.  of  May , the undertaking further applied to the competent court for suspension of the legal personality of the trade union organisation; this application was granted by the court and the suspension of the legal personality of the trade union was ordered for a period of six months. According to the Government it is nevertheless false",-1,1984,Honduras
71,"that the military mobilised the employees of the undertaking and that military groups had repressed the strike movement.
.According to the Government, notwithstanding the facts related above and the efforts which it had had to make to find a just and definitive solution which would satisfy both parties and at the same time be in the national interest, it decided to appoint a high-level commission composed of the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare, the Minister of the Cabinet, the Director of the National Electricity Undertaking, two representatives of the General Central of Workers (CGT), the General Secretary of the Confederation of Workers of Honduras (CTH) and the President of the Federation of Workers of Honduras (FESITRANH); this commission reached the following conclusions, which are regarded as having provided a definitive solution to the problem in question: "". Once all acts of work stoppage have ceased and work has resumed normally, the National Electricity Undertaking shall honour each and every one of the clauses negotiated up to the date on which the negotiation proceedings were interrupted. . In connection with clause -, the undertaking shall grant a  per cent wage increase every year in the manner proposed by the undertaking on the date on which the conciliation proceedings were interrupted. . Notwithstanding the declaration of illegality of the strike adopted by the Ministry of Labour, the undertaking shall undertake to refrain from reprisals or dismissals of workers who have given their moral or material support to the strike. . The time lost during the strike shall be made up in a manner to be agreed on between the parties, which shall endeavour to find a just solution. . The suspension of the legal personality of STENEE is the responsibility of the competent courts, which have the sole power to apply the law, passing and executing judgements in concrete cases. In order to reach a definitive solution to the dispute, the commissions shall undertake to expedite the relevant procedure. . At the suggestion of the legally organised trade union committee, the ENEE shall allow the legal representative of the STENEE provisionally to represent the trade union for the signing of the present document and the collective labour agreement and in other relevant matters. . The undertaking shall allow the sectoral and subsectoral managing committees to continue to represent the workers in all internal labour questions arising in the undertaking. . Once the present document has been signed by the parties, the work stoppage called by the Union of Workers of the National Electricity Undertaking shall be deemed to be terminated.

.In addition, the Government states that the disappearance of the PANI trade union leader, Mr. Gustavo Morales, occurred many months prior to the strike which commenced on  September  and that the competent authorities are investigating the matter.
.The Committee notes that in the present complaint the complainant alleges that the strike of the workers of the National Power and Electricity Undertaking (ENEE), called on  September  to demand wage increases, was declared illegal and that, as a consequence, the dismissal of all the strikers was announced, the military mobilisation of the employees of the undertaking was decreed and the strike was put down by military and para-military units, as a result of which the trade union leader, Gustavo Morales, disappeared.
.As regards the declaration of illegality of the strike, the Committee notes that Honduran legislation recognises the right to strike for workers in the electricity sector (section  of the Labour Code), although its exercise is subject to the fulfilment of certain requirements; in particular, the obligation to make available the necessary personnel to ensure that a suspension of the services provided does not result in serious and immediate danger to public health or safety or to the economy in general (section  of the Labour Code) and to exhaust the possibilities offered for the direct settlement of disputes and for mediation, conciliation and arbitration (section  of the Labour Code), such arbitration being compulsory in the case of the electricity sector as in other public services (section  of the Labour Code).
.In this connection the Committee wishes to recall that a strike may be subject to major restrictions such as compulsory arbitration in essential services in the strict sense of the term (i.e. those whose interruption might endanger the lives, safety or health of all or part of the population). (See, for example, th Report of the Committee, Case No.  (Brazil), paragraph .) The Committee considers that the services rendered throughout the country by the National Electricity Undertaking would appear to fall within the concept of essential services.
.In these circumstances, and noting that the Union of Workers of the National Electricity Undertaking called the strike on  September  four hours before the appointed time for the final meeting under the statutory conciliation procedure and without submitting to the compulsory arbitration procedure (a restriction which, as has been seen, is admissible in the case of essential services in the strict sense, as is the case of the electricity services), the Committee concludes that the declaration of illegality of the strike begun on  September  by the trade union does not infringe the principles of freedom of association.
.As regards the alleged consequences of the declaration of illegality of the strike in question (repression of the strike, dismissals of strikers and military mobilisation of workers), the Committee notes that the Government denies any repression of the strike or mobilisation by the military of the workers. It also notes that a high-level tripartite commission, including representatives of the central Honduran confederations, reached definitive conclusions in which the undertaking undertakes to refrain from dismissals of workers who took part in the strike. The Committee also notes that, according to the Government, the National Electricity Undertaking obtained the suspension of the legal personality of the union for six months from the judicial authority by virtue of section  of the Labour Code, amended by Decree No.  of  May . The Committee requests the Government to provide detailed information on the conclusions reached by the said commission on this last point.
.Lastly, as regards the allegation concerning the disappearance of the trade union leader, Gustavo Morales, the Committee notes that this disappearance had nothing to do with the strike which took place in the ENEE undertaking on  September  since it occurred many months prior to the events. It expresses its serious concern over this allegation and requests the Government to send the results of the investigation which is being carried out by the authorities as a matter of urgency.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:a) The Committee notes that a high-level tripartite commission, including representatives of the central Honduran confederations, reached definitive conclusions when examining the dispute in question in which the National Electricity Undertaking undertakes to refrain from dismissals of workers who took part in the strike.b) The Committee requests the Government to supply detailed information on the conclusions reached by the above-mentioned commission as regards the decision taken by the judicial authority to suspend the legal personality of the trade union for six months in consequence of the illegality of the strike called by the union.c) The Committee expresses its serious concern over the allegation concerning the disappearance of the trade union leader, Gustavo Morales, and requests the Government to communicate the results of the investigation being carried out by the authorities as a matter of urgency.",1,1984,Honduras
72,".The Committee examined this case on two previous occasions (see th Report (May ), paras.  to , and rd Report (February ), paras.  to ). On the first occasion, the Committee had not received any information or observations from the Government, despite an urgent appeal from the Committee; the second examination of the case took place after the direct contact mission requested by the Government with a view to resolving the trade union problems arising from several complaints against Honduras, had visited the country and submitted its report. The only question left unresolved after the most recent examination of the case concerns the situation of teachers who were dismissed following the strike of ; the Government had sent detailed information in this respect, but the Committee was awaiting a report from the non-recognised executive committee of the Professional College for the Advancement of Teaching in Honduras (COLPROSUMAH) . To date, this report has not been received.
.In a communication of  February  the WCOTP presented a number of additional allegations, enclosing a communication from the COLPROSUMAH and several articles from the Honduran press. The WCOTP sent further information in communications dated  March,  May and  November .
.The Government of Honduras sent its observations in communications dated  March,  May and  November , and  March .
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  February , the WCOTP alleges that on  February some  members of the genuine COLPROSUMAH trade union, led by their president, Mrs. Rosario Avila de Dominguez, peacefully reoccupied the ""Casa del maestro"" (the COLPROSUMAH headquarters in Tegucigalpa), which had previously been taken over by a dissident group of teachers with the support of the former Honduran Government. The WCOTP reports that the ""Casa del maestro"" was again taken over at . a.m. on  February, by the unlawful dissident group of teachers, under the leadership of Mr. Pablo Portillo, a senior official of the Ministry of Education with the assistance of para-military personnel. It adds that  masked and heavily armed persons violently assaulted the premises, injuring several members of the genuine COLPROSUMAH, one of whom very seriously; Professors Luis Alonzo Cartagena, Adalid Ramos, Victor Cache Morales and Nicolas Romero Santos, a trade union employee, were seriously injured, while Professors Rul Meja, Ramn Vallecillo and Margoth Meja were savagely beaten. These facts were confirmed by several eye-witnesses and by the press.
.The WCOTP sent additional information on  March , including a copy of a letter from the COLPROSUMAH's genuine executive committee to the head of the Honduran armed forces denouncing the events of  February undertaken by heavily armed individuals, some of which belonged to the State's security forces, and requesting that the matter be thoroughly investigated.
.In its communication of  May , the WCOTP describes the trade union situation of teachers in Honduras. The complainant organisation states that the COLPROSUMAH ""group"" recognised by the Government does not represent the country's teachers; nevertheless, this group has appropriated the premises and property of the trade union and, in accordance with a government decision, it receives the proceeds of trade union dues and controls the teachers' pension fund; in other words, it has complete control over the entire structure set up by teachers in Honduras over the years. The WCOTP alleges that the non-recognised COLPROSUMAH group is the genuine representative of Honduran teachers, a criterion which it substantiates by citing the fact that  delegates from  of the trade union's  locals were represented at the most recent congress (December ) and that, in spite of this, the democratically elected executive committee has access neither to the trade union's premises nor to its assets and property. Lastly, the complainant informs the Committee that the dispute was submitted to a court which ruled in favour of the smaller, government-supported group.
.The latest communication received from the WCOTP is dated  November ; it states that the Government has yet to recognise the genuine COLPROSUMAH trade union. Instead, it has recognised a small group of persons who are clearly pro-government and who were organised by the former government of Mr. Suazo Crdoba; according to the complainant organisation, this constitutes a violation of Article  of Convention No. . The WCOTP reports that the genuine COLPROSUMAH was implicitly recognised on  July , when the Minister of Education granted special leave for trade union activities to three trade union leaders, in accordance with section  of the COLPROSUMAH organic Act, which was subsequently repealed on  and  September ; the WCOTP encloses copies of these letters in its communication. The WCOTP further states that on  September , the President of the Republic of Honduras signed Decision No. -EP-, which called for the creation of a working party to consider wage increases for ; it adds that a representative of the genuine COLPROSUMAH was appointed to the working party, and that this constitutes an implicit recognition by the Government of the majority group of teachers. None the less, the WCOTP points out that when the working party's conclusions were published, the signature of the above-mentioned representative was replaced by that of Mr. Roberto Lpez Tinoco, a representative of the government-supported minority group, although he had not participated in the working party's negotations or discussions. This situation prompted the other trade unions involved in the working party (COPRUM, COPEMH and PRICPHMA) to issue a formal protest in a joint statement of  October , a copy of which is attached to the WCOTP's letter.
.In its letter of  May , the Government of Honduras recognises that the events described by the WCOTP did in fact occur, but adds that the central Government was not involved. Nevertheless, it states that the National Congress appointed a commission of inquiry to establish the facts and the root causes of the schism in the teachers' movement. The Government assures the Committee that it will keep it informed of the Commission's findings. In conclusion, the Government states that it has no intention to interfere in the affairs of trade union organisations, and that it hopes that an extraordinary congress of all teachers will succeed in settling COLPROSUMAH's internal conflict.
.On  November  the Government informs the Committee that the Ministry of Education appealed to the interested parties to resolve their differences in a peaceful manner. In this connection, the Government suggests that the above-mentioned commission of inquiry should help in finding a solution, and that the plebiscite it proposed might clarify the situation and allow all persons in the teaching profession to express their opinion; however, the members of the so-called genuine executive committee have proved intransingent and have not accepted this proposal. The Government adds that the National Institute of Teachers' Welfare (INPREMA) suspended the COLPROSUMAH's representation by means of resolution No.  (III) on  February ; this decision was appealed before the First Court of Appeals which, in a judgement of  April , unanimously and without reservation recognised Professors Roberto Lpez Tinoco and Idalia Portillo de Zelaya as the organisation's lawful representatives for the period  December - December ; at the same time, the court overturned the resolution of  February. The Government states that the President of the Republic has made every effort to promote a settlement to the dispute so far as circumstances allow; on  September  he signed Decision No. -EP- appointing a working party to study, analyse and propose alternatives concerning the general wage increase for  for teachers connected with the Public Education Secretariat; this working party is made up of the lawful representatives of teachers' organisations, including the COLPROSUMAH. The Government states that this working party was successful in negotiating an agreement signed by the Government and teachers' representatives on  October.
.In its last communication of  March , the Government informs the Committee of recent developments in the case which, according to the Government, took place in a climate of harmony and freedom, without any interference whatsoever. In accordance with the COLPROSUMAH's by-laws, elections were held on  February  to appoint the organisation's new leaders for the next two-year period. Owing to their differences, the ""genuine"" faction and the ""democratic"" faction elected their respective representatives unilaterally. In order to obtain official recognition and the legitimacy of the committees so elected, each of the factions appeared before the COLPROSUMAH's tribunal, which, in accordance with the organisation's internal regulations, was responsible for settling the dispute. The Government encloses a certificate dated  February , issued by the President and the Secretary of Internal Affairs of the democratic executive committee, which lists the names of persons belonging to the COLPROSUMAH's executive committee, tribunal and administrative committee as at  December .
.Two questions were raised when the Committee examined this case at its May  and February  meetings. The first, concerned allegations that",-1,1984,Honduras
73,"the Government had interferred in the by-laws of an organisation and in the election of trade union leaders through the adoption of an Act of  concerning the by-laws of the teachers' organisation, the COLPROSUMAH. The Committee firmly noted that in ratifying Convention No. , the Government had agreed to allow workers' organisations the right to formulate their by-laws and administrative regulations and to elect their representatives freely. Thus, the Committee requested the Government to indicate the measures it envisaged to repeal the provisions of national legislation which were incompatible with the Convention, and to allow the organisation in question to formulate its own by-laws, in accordance with Article  of Convention No. . The second question concerned the non-reinstatement of  teachers identified by name, who had been dismissed following a strike in . The Committee considered that these dismissals, which were based on strike activities, constituted a serious case of discrimination in employment on the basis of lawful trade union activities, and a violation of Convention No. , which Honduras has ratified. It urged the Government to indicate the measures it envisaged to obtain the reinstatement of the dismissed teachers. The Committee adjourned its examination of these allegation pending receipt of a detailed account concerning the situation of the dismissed teachers from the non-recognised executive committee of COLPROSUMAH. However, the Committee has not yet received this information.
.In the light of the new allegations, the Committee notes that the dispute between the two factions of the COLPROSUMAH, in other words between the so-called ""genuine"" committee and the so-called ""democratic"" committee, which can be traced to the  strike, has not yet been settled.
.In the first place, the Committee notes with regret that this dispute degenerated into violence when the executive committee recognised by the Government sought to regain possession of the COLPROSUMAH premises following their reoccupation by the non-recognised executive committee. The Committee notes that according to the complainant organisation, the assault was carried out at . in the morning: the circumstances surrounding this attempt by a faction which sees itself as legitimate, to recover the premises which it considers legally to be its own, appears to the Committee to be significant. The Committee notes that the allegation that the armed commando was led by a senior official of the Ministry of Education was not contested by the Government, but on the contrary, that it prompted the National Congress to appoint a commission of inquiry to examine the facts and the causes of the schism in the representation of teachers. Nevertheless, the Committee notes that the plebiscite proposed by this commission with a view to clarifying the situation and giving all teachers the opportunity of expressing their opinion, was spurned by the non-recognised executive committee. The Committee regrets that the parties are hardening their positions, since it would appear that the only way to resolve this dispute is through negotiation and dialogue.
.According to information supplied by the Government in its communication of  November, the Committee notes that the legitimacy of the recognised executive committee of the COLPROSUMAH was upheld in court. Nevertheless, the Committee recalls that the legislative foundation of the COLPROSUMAH is its Organic Act of  (Decree No. -), which has been contested by the non-recognised executive committee on the grounds that it was adopted by the National Congress at the request of the executive committee recognised by the authorities, but without the COLPROSUMAH's participation. Consequently, it is the Committee's understanding that any decision, even by the courts, which is based on the application of this text, would not be acceptable to the so-called ""genuine"" faction of the COLPROSUMAH.
.It appears to the Committee that the Government has shown a sincere willingness to resolve the dispute to the satisfaction of both parties. Thus, the Committee notes that the President of the Republic appointed a working party on  September  to discuss wage increases for teachers for ; according to the complainant organisation, the non-recognised executive committee participated in these discussions and this represents a de facto recognition of this so-called genuine group by the Government. Nevertheless, according to the complainant, the final document adopted by the working party was not signed by all of the participants, since the only signature on behalf of the COLPROSUMAH is that of Dr. Roberto Lpez Tinoco, president of the recognised executive committee, who is alleged not to have participated in the working party's deliberations. The Committee notes that the Government did not reply to this allegation.
.As regards the current status of affairs, the Committee observes that elections took place on  February ; it has received information concerning these elections from the Government, but not from the complainants. The Committee notes that, owing to their differences, the two factions held separate elections and that proceedings are now pending before the COLPROSUMAH internal tribunal in order to settle the question of the legitimacy of one or the other of the newly elected executive committees. This situation is a source of concern since the COLPROSUMAH's certificate attached to the Government's letter of  March  shows that the tribunal was appointed at the same time and by the same persons as the executive committee. Consequently, the Committee wonders if a dispute concerning such elections can be fairly settled by a body whose authority derives from the same source as that of one of the parties in the case.
.In these circumstances, the Committee considers that the dispute concerns the internal management of an occupational organisation, and that for this reason, does not fall within its competence, unless the Government has interferred in a manner which might affect the exercise of trade union rights and the normal functioning of an organisation (see th Report, Case No.  (Greece), para. ). As the Committee already observed during its previous examinations of this case, it considers that the Government has in fact interferred in this case by favouring one faction to the detriment of the other, in particular, through the adoption of the COLPROSUMAH Organic Act in , on which the COLPROSUMAH executive committee recognised by the Government bases its legitimacy. The Committee draws the Government's attention to the general principle according to which freedom of association implies the right of workers (and employers) to organise their affairs and activities without any interference on the part of the public authorities. The Committee recognises that the Government is ready to play a role in resolving the dispute, and considers that it could do so without interferring in the affairs and activities of the organisation, for example, by promoting a process of conciliation through mutually acceptable machinery, and also by promoting free elections which would determine the representativity of each of the factions.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:a) The Committee requests the Government to respect the principle of non-interference by public authorities in the affairs and activities of trade unions, as mentioned above.b) The Committee urges the Government to promote impartial and mutually acceptable conciliation procedures with a view to resolving the dispute within the COLPROSUMAH, and to keep it informed of the developments in this respect.c) As regards the allegations of acts of violence against the non-recognised executive committee of the COLPROSUMAH, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the parliamentary inquiry currently under way into these charges.
.The Committee on Freedom of Association at its meeting in May , in considering the cases concerning Honduras (Nos.  and ) requested the Government to accept a direct contacts mission, given the gravity of the allegations and the lack of information available concerning Case No.  (see th Report of the Committee, para. ), and in order that the various aspects of Case No.  might be fully examined (see th Report, para. ) . Moreover, at its November  meeting, the Committee expressed the hope that the direct contacts mission would be able to obtain information on the allegation pending in connection with Case No.  (see st Report, para. ). Finally, an allegation made in the context of Case No.  was still pending before the Committee (see th Report, para. ).
.At the st Session of the International Labour Conference (Geneva, ) the Government representative of Honduras formally requested that the direct contacts be carried out in order to elucidate the situation and to bring the country's legislation into conformity with Conventions Nos.  and .
.Subsequently, the Government of Honduras, in a communication dated  November , agreed that the mission should take place from  to  January .
.The Director-General of the ILO appointed as his representative to carry out this mission Mr. Andrs Aguilar, ex-president of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, and a member of that Commission and the Committee on Human Rights. The mission took place in Tegucigalpa on the dates mentioned above. Mr. Alberto Odero, a member of the Freedom of Association Branch of the International Labour Standards Department, and Mr. Luis Zamudio, Regional",-1,1984,Honduras
74,"Adviser on Standards, accompanied the representative of the Director-General during the mission.
.The mission held talks with His Excellency Mr. Amado H. Nez, Minister of Labour and Social Welfare, and with senior officials of the Ministry, as well as representatives of the employers' and workers' organisations.
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee wishes first of all to thank Mr. Andrs Aguilar for having agreed to carry out the direct contacts mission and for his detailed report on the pending cases, which made it possible for the Committee to examine them. The Committee considers that the report of the representative of the Director-General shows how useful missions of this kind are in elucidating the matters arising from allegations by the complainant organisations.
.Since the content of the allegations and the information supplied by the Government, as well as the information obtained by the representative of the Director-General during the mission are contained in the mission report (see Annex), the Committee may proceed directly to formulate its conclusions on the various cases.
.The Committee takes note of the report of the representative of the Director-General on the mission to Honduras from  to  January . The Committee notes with interest the fact that the representative of the Director-General received every facility from the authorities of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare in carrying out the mission. In this connection the Committee notes that the information obtained during the mission on the disappearance of two trade union leaders referred to in the complaints does not contain any new elements.
.When the Committee considered this case at its May  meeting (see th Report, paras. -) two matters were still pending. First, the Committee had requested the Government to supply information on the alleged murder of Jacobo Hernndez, a trade union leader of the Honduran National Peasants' Association (ANACH), and had called attention to the need to carry out judicial inquiries in that regard. The Committee had also requested the Government to supply information on the latest developments in the proceedings concerning the murder of Dagoberto Padilla, Ismael Ulloa, Angel Alvarado and Carlos Alcides Meja, and on the attempted murder of Pedro Chavarra, Jacobo Nez and Eulogio Figueroa, all leaders or members of the Workers' Union of the Agricultural and Cattle Raising Company of Sula (SITRACOAGS). The Committee had stressed the seriousness of the allegation that the manager and owners of SITRACOAGS were involved in the murder and attempted murders and considered that since it was a penal matter it should be subject to a criminal investigation. It therefore urged the Government to provide information on this investigation. Finally, subsequent to the latest examination of the case by the Committee, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), in a communication dated  October , presented new allegations concerning the disappearance of Mr. Jos Manuel Guerrero, President of the ""El Mochito"" Mineworkers' Union, who was reported by the ICFTU to have been detained by soldiers of the th Infantry Brigade.
.Concerning the death of Mr. Jacobo Hernndez, the ANACH union leader, the Committee notes that, according to the mission report, proceedings commenced on  March  against Mr. Marco Tulio Pineda Torres (at present detained in the central penitentiary of Tegucigalpa) for the crime of homicide.
.Regarding the murder of four SITRACOAGS leaders and the attempted murder of three other leaders of that organisation, the Committee notes that, according to the mission report, the relevant trial for murder or attempted murder is still at the indictment stage. The Committee also takes note of the various developments that have taken place in that trial: () of those who were earlier detained on charges of murder, Mr. Alfredo Villeda Henrquez and Mr. Moiss Orellana have been found not guilty of criminal liability; () those charged with the attempted murder of Pedro Chavarra, Jacobo Nez and Eulogio Figuera are the subject of warrants of arrest; () Mr. Marco Antonio Molina and Mr. Fausto Isal Garca are still fugitives from justice and before escaping from prison they confessed to the judicial authorities that they had committed the murders, as may be seen from the court documents given to the mission.
.As to the involvement of the manager (Mr. Carlos Gonzlez) and the owners of the Agricultural and Cattle Raising Company of Sula (particularly, Mr. Jaime Echeverra) in the murders, the Committee notes that the judicial authorities have released these persons since there were no grounds for their continued detention.
.Whenever allegations concerning the death or serious injury of trade union leaders or unionists have been submitted to it, the Committee has always insisted that a judicial inquiry be carried out with a view to elucidating the facts in full, determining responsibilities and punishing the guilty parties. In the present case, the Committee notes that trials are under way, and that it has been possible to identify the two alleged perpetrators of the murders or attempted murders, even though they are fugitives from justice. In these circumstances, the Committee expresses the hope that the proceedings in question will be concluded as soon as possible and will enable the guilty parties to be punished; it requests the Government to keep it informed of the final results.
.With respect to the disappearance of the trade union leader Mr. Jos Manuel Guerrero, the Committee takes note of the written communication given to the mission by the Minister of Labour, indicating that absolutely reliable sources have informed the security authorities that Mr. Jos Manuel Guerrero, President of the ""El Mochito"" workers' union, was trafficking in explosives and was involved in other activities tending to undermine the tranquillity of the nation, peace and democracy, and that he was therefore arrested on  October . However, given that the necessary investigations proved his innocence, he was released immediately and continues to exercise his trade union functions; Mr. Guerrero is now engaged in politics and was elected a deputy to the Congress by the National Party.
.In these conditions, in view of the fact that Mr. Guerrero was imprisoned because he was falsely accused of trafficking in explosives, and that he was freed once his innocence was proved, the Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that the arrest or detention of trade union leaders or trade unionists in conditions such as those presently alleged may not only constitute a serious interference in union activities, but also may create a climate of intimidation and fear prejudicial to the normal development of trade union activities. When taken on trade union grounds, they are contrary to the principles of Convention No. .
.When the Committee examined this case at its May  meeting (th Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (May-June )), two questions were pending. The first concerned the alleged interference by the Government in the constitution of an organisation and in the election of trade union leaders through the adoption, in , of an Act governing the constitution of the teachers' organisation COLPROSUMAH. The Committee recalled with firmness that in ratifying Convention No.  the Government had undertaken to grant workers' organisations the right to draw up their constitutions and rules and elect their representatives in full freedom. The Committee therefore requested the Government to indicate what measures it envisaged taking to repeal the provisions of the national legislation which are incompatible with the Convention and to enable the organisation in question to adopt its own rules in conformity with Article  of Convention No. . The second pending question referred to the non-reinstatement of  teachers, mentioned by name, who were dismissed on account of a strike in . The Committee considered that dismissal on account of a strike constituted serious discrimination in employment for the exercise of a lawful trade union activity, and was contrary to Convention No. , ratified by Honduras; it insisted that the Government state what measures it envisaged taking to secure the reinstatement of the dismissed teachers.
.Moreover, the complainant organisation in a communication of  December  presented new allegations in which it stated that on  December Mr. Ambrosio Sabio, former President of COLPROSUMAH, had been arrested. The complainant added that it appeared that the arrest had been made at the request of the rival group formed by the Government within this organisation.
.The Committee notes that the Minister of Labour told the mission that it would be very difficult to take steps to repeal the  Act which governs the constitution of the Professional College for the Advancement of Teaching in Honduras (COLPROSUMAH). The Committee also notes that, according to the Government, the  Act was adopted by the National Congress at the request of the executive committee of COLPROSUMAH that is recognised by the authorities. The Committee observes in this connection that, according to the Government, COLPROSUMAH is not a trade union organisation but a professional college of teachers. A  Act already governed the constitution",-1,1984,Honduras
75,"of COLPROSUMAH before the adoption of the  Act and according to the Government teachers are not barred from forming trade unions.
.Apart from the fact that COLPROSUMAH is a professional college, the Committee wishes to recall that at its May  meeting (see th Report, para. ) it concluded that COLPROSUMAH was an organisation which should enjoy the guarantees of Convention No.  since its aim was to promote and defend the interests of teachers (see th Report, Case No.  (Honduras), para. ). Moreover, with respect to the  election of the executive committee which was later recognised by the authorities, the Committee had implicitly considered that acts of interference contrary to the principles of Convention No.  had been committed (see th Report, Case No.  (Honduras), para. ).
.With respect to the  teachers who are still dismissed because of the  strike, the Committee notes the detailed information provided by the Government from which it concludes that a number of the teachers mentioned by the complainant organisation were teaching in State schools, and that the rest had given up teaching to take up other non-teaching jobs or activities of a political nature, or for legally sanctionable reasons not connected with the above-mentioned strike were not employed in the service. The Committee observes that the executive committee of COLPROSUMAH which was not recognised by the authorities told the mission that the problem of the dismissed teachers had not been resolved: one of the persons interviewed by the mission (Mr. Marcelino Borjas) said that he was still dismissed and that others were teaching in private schools.
.Since the unrecognised COLPROSUMAH executive committee undertook, during the mission, to send the ILO a precise account of the position of the persons dismissed, the Committee adjourns examination of this allegation pending receipt of this information.
.Regarding the arrest of Mr. Ambrosio Sabio (ex-President of COLPROSUMAH), the Committee notes that, according to the Government, the proceedings that began in  against Mr. Sabio for the offences of forging private documents, usurpation of functions and persistent embezzlement of COLPROSUMAH, are at the indictment stage. The Committee also notes that according to the Government Mr. Sabio was arrested on  December  and provisionally released on  January , certain proceedings having been declared invalid and there being insufficient grounds for the issue of a warrant of arrest.
.The Committee also notes the statement made by Mr. Sabio to the mission, particularly the fact that the accusation against him dates from  and that already then the First Criminal Court found no grounds for his arrest. He was arrested some days after the regular congress of COLPROSUMAH which had been convened by the unrecognised board on  December . Since  four judges have been dealing with the matter without issuing a warrant of arrest for lack of grounds. Inexplicably, in the course of a very short substitution in December , the warrant was issued by a judge, who, in total disregard for legality, certified that in November  the officially recognised executive committee of COLPROSUMAH had been properly elected.
.In these circumstances, the Committee, noting that Mr. Sabio was released  days after his arrest since there were no grounds for his imprisonment, concludes that the measures taken to deprive Mr. Sabio of his freedom were of an anti-union nature. The Committee deplores Mr. Sabio's imprisonment and at the same time draws the Government's attention to the fact that the arrest or detention of trade union leaders or trade unionists because of their functions or their activities as such are contrary to the principles of Convention No. .
.The Committee had requested the Government to communicate the results of the investigation being carried out concerning the whereabouts of the trade union leaders Mr. Rolando Vindel Gonzlez (see th Report, Case No. , para. ) and Mr. Gustavo Morales (see st Report, Case No. , para. ).
.The Committee notes that, as mentioned in the mission report, the investigations are continuing, but that as yet the whereabouts of the leaders are still not known. In these circumstances, the Committee expresses its concern at the length of time that has elapsed since the disappearance of these leaders, and requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in the investigations being carried out to discover their whereabouts.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:a) The Committee takes note of the report of the representative of the Director-General on the mission carried out from  to  January  in Honduras. The Committee notes with interest that the representative of the Director-General received every facility from the authorities of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare in carrying out the mission.b) With respect to the murder of a leader of ANACH, the murder of four leaders of SITRACOAGS and the attempted murder of three leaders of that organisation, the Committee observes that trials are under way and that two of the alleged perpetrators have been identified although they are fugitives from justice. The Committee expresses the hope that the trials under way will be concluded as soon as possible and that they will enable the guilty parties to be punished; it requests the Government to keep it informed of the final results.c) As regards  teachers who are still dismissed because of the  strike, the Committee notes the information provided by the Government but adjourns examination of this allegation pending receipt of information on the present position of the dismissed teachers which, during the direct contacts mission, the unrecognised COLPROSUMAH executive committee undertook to send.d) Concerning the arrest of two trade union leaders who have now been released (Mr. Jos Manuel Guerrero and Mr. Ambrosio Sabio), the Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that the arrest or detention of trade union leaders or trade unionists because of their functions or activities as such are contrary to the principles of Convention No. .e) The Committee expresses its concern at the long period that has elapsed since the disappearance of the trade union leaders Messrs. Roldando Vindel and Gustavo Morales, and requests the Government to keep it informed of developments of the investigations under way to ascertain their whereabouts.
.The complaint of the World Confederation of Organisations of the Teaching Profession was presented in a communication dated  March . At its meeting in February  the Committee, having noted that despite several requests the Government had still not sent the information and observations requested from it appealed to it to supply its observations as a matter of urgency. The Committee also drew the Government's attention to the fact that, in accordance with the rule of procedure established in paragraph  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body, the Committee could submit a report on the substance of the matter even if the Government's observations had not been received by its next session (th Report of the Committee, para. ). Since then the Government has still not furnished information or observations on the matter.
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No.) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No.) .
.The complaint of violation of freedom of association is lodged against the Government of Honduras by the World Confederation of Organisations of the Teaching Profession (WCOTP) on behalf of its affiliate, the Professional College for the Advancement of Teaching in Honduras (COLPROSUMAH). According to the WCOTP, the Government has interfered with the right of organisations to draw up their rules and to elect their representatives by adopting legislative measures, and with the right of the most representative organisation to elect its representatives to advisory bodies by withdrawing this right of representation from genuine representatives of the teaching personnel of Honduras and giving it to a dissident group set up with the support of the Government and of the police and military.
.The WCOTP explains that on  September  the Government adopted Legislative Decree No. - to promulgate an Act respecting the Professional College for the Advancement of Teaching in Honduras (COLPROSUMAH) , repealing the previous Act of  December  on the matter. The new Act was published in the Official Gazette on  October . It was prepared without the participation of this trade union organisation and, in drafting it, Parliament established new standards for the election of the executive committee of the organisation stipulating that trade union leaders may not be re-elected until two two-year periods had elapsed (sections  and  of the Act). According to the WCOTP, this text was adopted with a view to prejudicing the trade union executive of the COLPROSUMAH and in order to favour a group of teachers who have taken over the organisation with the support of the Government.
.The WCOTP states that the adoption of this legislation and the change of trade union representatives on the various advisory bodies must be seen against the background of the events",-1,1984,Honduras
76,"of - which were the subject of a complaint to the Committee on Freedom of Association (Case No.  concerning the dismissal of teachers, the occupation of trade union premises and the confiscation of the assets of COLPROSUMAH).
.The WCOTP recalls that, in the case in question, the Government had adopted repressive measures following a strike and a demonstration, dismissing  teachers,  of whom remained unemployed, and subjecting the schools to military supervision. Moreover, the Government had supported a dissident group within COLPROSUMAH, made up of  persons who, with a view to disrupting the annual meeting in December , had organised a parallel meeting at which a different trade union executive was elected and recognised by the authorities. Furthermore, during the annual meeting of COLPROSUMAH, elements of the National Department for Investigations and members of the public security forces took possession of the COLPROSUMAH premises, preventing trade unionists from entering. Shortly afterwards, a representative of the Supreme Court of Justice handed over the COLPROSUMAH assets and property to the dissident group.
.The WCOTP adds that since the setting up of this dissident group which, according to its affiliate, is not trusted by the teaching personnel of Honduras, the genuine representatives of COLPROSUMAH have been divested of the right to represent the teachers on the various advisory bodies and institutions established by the Act respecting COLPROSUMAH. This Act provides for co-operation between the educational authorities and COLPROSUMAH on teaching matters (section (f)).
.According to the WCOTP, this proves that the allegations made in Case No.  concerning the close links between this group and the Government were well founded and proves also the erroneous nature of the Government's statements concerning the events leading up to the election of the COLPROSUMAH executive committee. The WCOTP recalls that the Government stated ""these are events which fall exclusively within the competence of this organisation"" and ""the participation of the Government cannot exceed that permitted by the laws of the country"" (th Report, Case No. , para. ) . However, the WCOTP maintains that, by modifying the representation of the teaching personnel on the various public bodies, the Government has interfered in the trade union affairs of this organisation.
.The complainant organisation concludes by stating that the dissident group is still occupying the COLPROSUMAH premises and enjoying the use of its assets, including the dues of the union's members. Moreover, the Government attempted to ban a meeting of the United Front of Teachers of Honduras and interfered in the activities of the College of Secondary School Teachers (COPEMH) and of the first Primary Teachers' College (PRICPHMA), as is borne out by the newspaper articles attached to the WCOTP's communication. The complainant organisation furnishes the list of teachers who have not been reinstated despite the assurances given on this point by the Government.
.The present complaint concerns allegations of interference by the Government in the affairs of a teachers' union of Honduras by legislative measures and the non-reinstatement of teachers dismissed following a labour dispute despite assurances given on the matter by the Government.
.First of all, the Committee deplores the fact that the Government has failed to supply observations on this case despite the time that has elapsed since the complaint was presented and despite the numerous requests made to it.
.The Committee considers it necessary to draw the Government's attention to the fact that the purpose of the whole procedure concerning allegations of infringements of freedom of association is to ensure respect for freedom of association both in law and in fact. The Committee recalls that while this procedure protects governments against unreasonable accusations, the governments should in turn recognise the importance of supplying, for objective examination, detailed replies to the allegations made against them.
.In the present case, the complainant organisation has attached the text of the Legislative Decree of  September  to establish rules for the trade union organisation which is the subject of the complaint. The Committee is obliged to observe that the Government, by adopting this Act, has seriously undermined the right of this organisation to draw up its rules freely and that it has also undermined the workers' right freely to elect their representatives by adopting legislative measures forbidding teachers to re-elect their trade union leaders until two two-year periods have expired.
.The Committee recalls with firmness that in ratifying Convention No.  the Government undertook to leave workers' organisations themselves the right to draw up their constitutions and rules and to elect their representatives in full freedom. The Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that public authorities must refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof.
.The Committee therefore requests the Government to indicate what measures it envisages taking to repeal the provisions of the national legislation which are incompatible with the Convention and to enable the organisation in question to adopt itself its own rules in accordance with Article  of Convention No. .
.Furthermore, the Committee observes with regret that, despite the Government's assurances in Case No. , a number of teachers dismissed on account of a strike have still not been reinstated. The Committee considers that the dismissal of workers because of a strike, which is a lawful trade union activity, constitutes serious discrimination in employment and is contrary to Convention No. , ratified by Honduras. It insists that the Government should indicate what measures it envisages taking to secure the reinstatment of the teachers whose names are given in the Annex to this case.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report and in particular the following conclusions:(a) The Committee deplores the fact that, despite the time that has elapsed since the complaint was lodged and despite the numerous requests made to it, the Government has not communicated its observations on this case.(b) As regards the Government's interference in the rules of an organisation and in the elections of trade union leaders by its adoption of a  Act to issue rules for COLPROSUMAH, a teacher's organisation affiliated to the complainant confederation, the Committee recalls with firmness that, in ratifying Convention No. , the Government undertook to leave it to workers' organisations themselves to draw up their own constitutions and rules and to elect their representatives in full freedom. The Committee therefore requests the Government to state what measures it envisages taking to repeal the provisions of the national legislation which are incompatible with the Convention and to enable the organisation to adopt itself its own rules in accordance with Article  of Convention No. .(c) With regard to the non-reinstatement of a number of teachers who were dismissed on account of a strike in  (and whose names are given in the Annex to this case), the Committee considers that dismissal on account of a strike constitutes serious discrimination in employment for the exercise of a lawful trade union activity and is contrary to Convention No. , ratified by Honduras. It insists that the Government should state what measures it envisages taking to secure the reinstatement of the dismissed teachers whose names are given by the complainant organisation.(d) The Committee requests the Government to consent to the carrying out of a direct contacts mission to the country so that the various aspects of this case may be fully examined.",-1,1984,Honduras
77,".The Committee on Freedom of Association at its meeting in May , in considering the cases concerning Honduras (Nos.  and ) requested the Government to accept a direct contacts mission, given the gravity of the allegations and the lack of information available concerning Case No.  (see th Report of the Committee, para. ), and in order that the various aspects of Case No.  might be fully examined (see th Report, para. ) . Moreover, at its November  meeting, the Committee expressed the hope that the direct contacts mission would be able to obtain information on the allegation pending in connection with Case No.  (see st Report, para. ). Finally, an allegation made in the context of Case No.  was still pending before the Committee (see th Report, para. ).
.At the st Session of the International Labour Conference (Geneva, ) the Government representative of Honduras formally requested that the direct contacts be carried out in order to elucidate the situation and to bring the country's legislation into conformity with Conventions Nos.  and .
.Subsequently, the Government of Honduras, in a communication dated  November , agreed that the mission should take place from  to  January .
.The Director-General of the ILO appointed as his representative to carry out this mission Mr. Andrs Aguilar, ex-president of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, and a member of that Commission and the Committee on Human Rights. The mission took place in Tegucigalpa on the dates mentioned above. Mr. Alberto Odero, a member of the Freedom of Association Branch of the International Labour Standards Department, and Mr. Luis Zamudio, Regional Adviser on Standards, accompanied the representative of the Director-General during the mission.
.The mission held talks with His Excellency Mr. Amado H. Nez, Minister of Labour and Social Welfare, and with senior officials of the Ministry, as well as representatives of the employers' and workers' organisations.
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee wishes first of all to thank Mr. Andrs Aguilar for having agreed to carry out the direct contacts mission and for his detailed report on the pending cases, which made it possible for the Committee to examine them. The Committee considers that the report of the representative of the Director-General shows how useful missions of this kind are in elucidating the matters arising from allegations by the complainant organisations.
.Since the content of the allegations and the information supplied by the Government, as well as the information obtained by the representative of the Director-General during the mission are contained in the mission report (see Annex), the Committee may proceed directly to formulate its conclusions on the various cases.
.The Committee takes note of the report of the representative of the Director-General on the mission to Honduras from  to  January . The Committee notes with interest the fact that the representative of the Director-General received every facility from the authorities of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare in carrying out the mission. In this connection the Committee notes that the information obtained during the mission on the disappearance of two trade union leaders referred to in the complaints does not contain any new elements.
.When the Committee considered this case at its May  meeting (see th Report, paras. -) two matters were still pending. First, the Committee had requested the Government to supply information on the alleged murder of Jacobo Hernndez, a trade union leader of the Honduran National Peasants' Association (ANACH), and had called attention to the need to carry out judicial inquiries in that regard. The Committee had also requested the Government to supply information on the latest developments in the proceedings concerning the murder of Dagoberto Padilla, Ismael Ulloa, Angel Alvarado and Carlos Alcides Meja, and on the attempted murder of Pedro Chavarra, Jacobo Nez and Eulogio Figueroa, all leaders or members of the Workers' Union of the Agricultural and Cattle Raising Company of Sula (SITRACOAGS). The Committee had stressed the seriousness of the allegation that the manager and owners of SITRACOAGS were involved in the murder and attempted murders and considered that since it was a penal matter it should be subject to a criminal investigation. It therefore urged the Government to provide information on this investigation. Finally, subsequent to the latest examination of the case by the Committee, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), in a communication dated  October , presented new allegations concerning the disappearance of Mr. Jos Manuel Guerrero, President of the ""El Mochito"" Mineworkers' Union, who was reported by the ICFTU to have been detained by soldiers of the th Infantry Brigade.
.Concerning the death of Mr. Jacobo Hernndez, the ANACH union leader, the Committee notes that, according to the mission report, proceedings commenced on  March  against Mr. Marco Tulio Pineda Torres (at present detained in the central penitentiary of Tegucigalpa) for the crime of homicide.
.Regarding the murder of four SITRACOAGS leaders and the attempted murder of three other leaders of that organisation, the Committee notes that, according to the mission report, the relevant trial for murder or attempted murder is still at the indictment stage. The Committee also takes note of the various developments that have taken place in that trial: () of those who were earlier detained on charges of murder, Mr. Alfredo Villeda Henrquez and Mr. Moiss Orellana have been found not guilty of criminal liability; () those charged with the attempted murder of Pedro Chavarra, Jacobo Nez and Eulogio Figuera are the subject of warrants of arrest; () Mr. Marco Antonio Molina and Mr. Fausto Isal Garca are still fugitives from justice and before escaping from prison they confessed to the judicial authorities that they had committed the murders, as may be seen from the court documents given to the mission.
.As to the involvement of the manager (Mr. Carlos Gonzlez) and the owners of the Agricultural and Cattle Raising Company of Sula (particularly, Mr. Jaime Echeverra) in the murders, the Committee notes that the judicial authorities have released these persons since there were no grounds for their continued detention.
.Whenever allegations concerning the death or serious injury of trade union leaders or unionists have been submitted to it, the Committee has always insisted that a judicial inquiry be carried out with a view to elucidating the facts in full, determining responsibilities and punishing the guilty parties. In the present case, the Committee notes that trials are under way, and that it has been possible to identify the two alleged perpetrators of the murders or attempted murders, even though they are fugitives from justice. In these circumstances, the Committee expresses the hope that the proceedings in question will be concluded as soon as possible and will enable the guilty parties to be punished; it requests the Government to keep it informed of the final results.
.With respect to the disappearance of the trade union leader Mr. Jos Manuel Guerrero, the Committee takes note of the written communication given to the mission by the Minister of Labour, indicating that absolutely reliable sources have informed the security authorities that Mr. Jos Manuel Guerrero, President of the ""El Mochito"" workers' union, was trafficking in explosives and was involved in other activities tending to undermine the tranquillity of the nation, peace and democracy, and that he was therefore arrested on  October . However, given that the necessary investigations proved his innocence, he was released immediately and continues to exercise his trade union functions; Mr. Guerrero is now engaged in politics and was elected a deputy to the Congress by the National Party.
.In these conditions, in view of the fact that Mr. Guerrero was imprisoned because he was falsely accused of trafficking in explosives, and that he was freed once his innocence was proved, the Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that the arrest or detention of trade union leaders or trade unionists in conditions such as those presently alleged may not only constitute a serious interference in union activities, but also may create a climate of intimidation and fear prejudicial to the normal development of trade union activities. When taken on trade union grounds, they are contrary to the principles of Convention No. .
.When the Committee examined this case at its May  meeting (th Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (May-June )), two questions were pending. The first concerned the alleged interference by the Government in the constitution of an organisation and in the election of trade union leaders through the adoption, in , of an Act governing the constitution of the teachers' organisation COLPROSUMAH. The Committee recalled with firmness that in ratifying Convention No.  the Government had undertaken to grant workers' organisations the right to draw up their constitutions and rules and elect their representatives in full freedom. The Committee therefore requested the Government to indicate what measures it envisaged taking to",-1,1984,Honduras
78,"repeal the provisions of the national legislation which are incompatible with the Convention and to enable the organisation in question to adopt its own rules in conformity with Article  of Convention No. . The second pending question referred to the non-reinstatement of  teachers, mentioned by name, who were dismissed on account of a strike in . The Committee considered that dismissal on account of a strike constituted serious discrimination in employment for the exercise of a lawful trade union activity, and was contrary to Convention No. , ratified by Honduras; it insisted that the Government state what measures it envisaged taking to secure the reinstatement of the dismissed teachers.
.Moreover, the complainant organisation in a communication of  December  presented new allegations in which it stated that on  December Mr. Ambrosio Sabio, former President of COLPROSUMAH, had been arrested. The complainant added that it appeared that the arrest had been made at the request of the rival group formed by the Government within this organisation.
.The Committee notes that the Minister of Labour told the mission that it would be very difficult to take steps to repeal the  Act which governs the constitution of the Professional College for the Advancement of Teaching in Honduras (COLPROSUMAH). The Committee also notes that, according to the Government, the  Act was adopted by the National Congress at the request of the executive committee of COLPROSUMAH that is recognised by the authorities. The Committee observes in this connection that, according to the Government, COLPROSUMAH is not a trade union organisation but a professional college of teachers. A  Act already governed the constitution of COLPROSUMAH before the adoption of the  Act and according to the Government teachers are not barred from forming trade unions.
.Apart from the fact that COLPROSUMAH is a professional college, the Committee wishes to recall that at its May  meeting (see th Report, para. ) it concluded that COLPROSUMAH was an organisation which should enjoy the guarantees of Convention No.  since its aim was to promote and defend the interests of teachers (see th Report, Case No.  (Honduras), para. ). Moreover, with respect to the  election of the executive committee which was later recognised by the authorities, the Committee had implicitly considered that acts of interference contrary to the principles of Convention No.  had been committed (see th Report, Case No.  (Honduras), para. ).
.With respect to the  teachers who are still dismissed because of the  strike, the Committee notes the detailed information provided by the Government from which it concludes that a number of the teachers mentioned by the complainant organisation were teaching in State schools, and that the rest had given up teaching to take up other non-teaching jobs or activities of a political nature, or for legally sanctionable reasons not connected with the above-mentioned strike were not employed in the service. The Committee observes that the executive committee of COLPROSUMAH which was not recognised by the authorities told the mission that the problem of the dismissed teachers had not been resolved: one of the persons interviewed by the mission (Mr. Marcelino Borjas) said that he was still dismissed and that others were teaching in private schools.
.Since the unrecognised COLPROSUMAH executive committee undertook, during the mission, to send the ILO a precise account of the position of the persons dismissed, the Committee adjourns examination of this allegation pending receipt of this information.
.Regarding the arrest of Mr. Ambrosio Sabio (ex-President of COLPROSUMAH), the Committee notes that, according to the Government, the proceedings that began in  against Mr. Sabio for the offences of forging private documents, usurpation of functions and persistent embezzlement of COLPROSUMAH, are at the indictment stage. The Committee also notes that according to the Government Mr. Sabio was arrested on  December  and provisionally released on  January , certain proceedings having been declared invalid and there being insufficient grounds for the issue of a warrant of arrest.
.The Committee also notes the statement made by Mr. Sabio to the mission, particularly the fact that the accusation against him dates from  and that already then the First Criminal Court found no grounds for his arrest. He was arrested some days after the regular congress of COLPROSUMAH which had been convened by the unrecognised board on  December . Since  four judges have been dealing with the matter without issuing a warrant of arrest for lack of grounds. Inexplicably, in the course of a very short substitution in December , the warrant was issued by a judge, who, in total disregard for legality, certified that in November  the officially recognised executive committee of COLPROSUMAH had been properly elected.
.In these circumstances, the Committee, noting that Mr. Sabio was released  days after his arrest since there were no grounds for his imprisonment, concludes that the measures taken to deprive Mr. Sabio of his freedom were of an anti-union nature. The Committee deplores Mr. Sabio's imprisonment and at the same time draws the Government's attention to the fact that the arrest or detention of trade union leaders or trade unionists because of their functions or their activities as such are contrary to the principles of Convention No. .
.The Committee had requested the Government to communicate the results of the investigation being carried out concerning the whereabouts of the trade union leaders Mr. Rolando Vindel Gonzlez (see th Report, Case No. , para. ) and Mr. Gustavo Morales (see st Report, Case No. , para. ).
.The Committee notes that, as mentioned in the mission report, the investigations are continuing, but that as yet the whereabouts of the leaders are still not known. In these circumstances, the Committee expresses its concern at the length of time that has elapsed since the disappearance of these leaders, and requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in the investigations being carried out to discover their whereabouts.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:a) The Committee takes note of the report of the representative of the Director-General on the mission carried out from  to  January  in Honduras. The Committee notes with interest that the representative of the Director-General received every facility from the authorities of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare in carrying out the mission.b) With respect to the murder of a leader of ANACH, the murder of four leaders of SITRACOAGS and the attempted murder of three leaders of that organisation, the Committee observes that trials are under way and that two of the alleged perpetrators have been identified although they are fugitives from justice. The Committee expresses the hope that the trials under way will be concluded as soon as possible and that they will enable the guilty parties to be punished; it requests the Government to keep it informed of the final results.c) As regards  teachers who are still dismissed because of the  strike, the Committee notes the information provided by the Government but adjourns examination of this allegation pending receipt of information on the present position of the dismissed teachers which, during the direct contacts mission, the unrecognised COLPROSUMAH executive committee undertook to send.d) Concerning the arrest of two trade union leaders who have now been released (Mr. Jos Manuel Guerrero and Mr. Ambrosio Sabio), the Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that the arrest or detention of trade union leaders or trade unionists because of their functions or activities as such are contrary to the principles of Convention No. .e) The Committee expresses its concern at the long period that has elapsed since the disappearance of the trade union leaders Messrs. Roldando Vindel and Gustavo Morales, and requests the Government to keep it informed of developments of the investigations under way to ascertain their whereabouts.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) dated  March . The Government replied in a letter of  April .
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainant alleges that Rolando Vindel, General Secretary of the Union of Workers in the Electricity Undertaking, disappeared on  March  when he was taking part in a collective bargaining meeting.
.The complainant also alleges that hundreds of workers from the Electricity Undertaking are under arrest for having exercised their right to strike.
.The complainant states that it fears for the safety of Mr. Vindel and of the arrested workers.
.As regards the disappearance of Mr. Rolando Vindel, the Government encloses a document dated  March  in which the General Command of the Public Security Forces states that none of its units has arrested or detained Rolando Vindel Gonzlez, and that the Public Security Forces are doing all they can to ascertain his whereabouts and to bring those responsible for the offence",-1,1984,Honduras
79,"before the courts.
.The Government also states that two writs of habeas corpus f have been lodged with the courts on behalf of Rolando Vindel Gonzlez (one against an order for his arrest supposedly given. by the National Investigations Director and another against an order for his arrest allegedly issued by the Chief of Military Intelligence G-) and are being dealt with. The investigations carried out by the judges appointed for this purpose reveal that Mr. Vindel has not been held on the premises of the Military Intelligence Bureau nor in the cells of the National Investigations Directorate. The Chief of Military Intelligence stated that he had no knowledge of Mr. Vindel having been arrested by the authorities.
.With regard to the arrest of workers of the National Electricity Undertaking (ENEE), the Government states that, at the request of the management of the ENEE, the Public Security Forces arrested a number of members of the union of this undertaking who were subsequently released. The Government encloses a photocopy of the request from the manager of the ENEE to the Commander of the Public Security Forces, dated  March , requesting the Security Forces to intervene since on the same day ""without having fulfilled the relevant legal requirements and without there being any reason, the workers took over the premises of the undertaking and prevented management and administrative staff from getting on with their work which, from any point of view, was illegal and furthermore constituted an attack on personal safety"".
.With regard to the disappearance on  March  of Mr. Rolando Vindel Gonzlez, General Secretary of the Union of Workers in the Electricity Undertaking, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, as a result of two writs of habeas corpus lodged with the courts, a legal inquiry has been set in motion to ascertain the whereabouts of this trade union leader and that, according to the investigations undertaken, he is not being held in the cells of the National Investigations Directorate.
.In this connection, the Committee expresses its serious concern at the fact that over two months have already gone by since Mr. Vindel's disappearance without information having been obtained as to the circumstances in which the disappearance took place or as to his state of health and whereabouts. In these circumstances, the Committee wishes to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that freedom of association can only be exercised in conditions in which fundamental human rights, and in particular those relating to human life and personal safety, are fully respected and guaranteed [see, for example, rd Report, Case No.  (El Salvador), paragraph ]. The Committee trusts that the court inquiries under way will make it possible to ascertain the whereabouts of Mr. Vindel, to determine the circumstances of his disappearance and to punish those responsible, and it requests the Government to keep it informed on this matter.
.With regard to the allegation concerning the arrest of hundreds of workers of the Electricity Undertaking (ENEE) for exercising their right to strike, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, the Public Security Forces arrested only a few members of the union who were subsequently released. The Committee observes that, according to the documents sent by the Government in connection with the reasons for the arrest, the strike had taken place without the legal requirements having been respected and, furthermore, that the workers had taken over the premises of the undertaking, preventing management and administrative staff from having access.
.In these circumstances, in view of the fact that the persons arrested were released, of the complainant's failure to supply details as to the reasons for the strike, as to compliance with the legal requirements or as to the manner in which the strike took place, the Committee considers that examination of this allegation should not be pursued.
.In the circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present report and in particular the following conclusions:(a) The Committee expresses its serious concern at the fact that over two months have already elapsed since the disappearance of the trade union leader Rolando Vindel Gonzlez, without information having been obtained as to the circumstances of his disappearance, his state of health or his whereabouts.(b) The Committee draws the attention of the Government to the fact that freedom of association can only be exercised in conditions in which fundamental human rights, and in particular those relating to human life and personal safety, are fully respected and guaranteed.(c) The Committee trusts that the court inquiries being carried out will make it possible to ascertain the whereabouts of Mr. Vindel, to determine the circumstances of his disappearance and to punish those responsible, and it requests the Government to keep it informed on the matter.",-1,1984,Honduras
80,".The Committee on Freedom of Association at its meeting in May , in considering the cases concerning Honduras (Nos.  and ) requested the Government to accept a direct contacts mission, given the gravity of the allegations and the lack of information available concerning Case No.  (see th Report of the Committee, para. ), and in order that the various aspects of Case No.  might be fully examined (see th Report, para. ) . Moreover, at its November  meeting, the Committee expressed the hope that the direct contacts mission would be able to obtain information on the allegation pending in connection with Case No.  (see st Report, para. ). Finally, an allegation made in the context of Case No.  was still pending before the Committee (see th Report, para. ).
.At the st Session of the International Labour Conference (Geneva, ) the Government representative of Honduras formally requested that the direct contacts be carried out in order to elucidate the situation and to bring the country's legislation into conformity with Conventions Nos.  and .
.Subsequently, the Government of Honduras, in a communication dated  November , agreed that the mission should take place from  to  January .
.The Director-General of the ILO appointed as his representative to carry out this mission Mr. Andrs Aguilar, ex-president of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, and a member of that Commission and the Committee on Human Rights. The mission took place in Tegucigalpa on the dates mentioned above. Mr. Alberto Odero, a member of the Freedom of Association Branch of the International Labour Standards Department, and Mr. Luis Zamudio, Regional Adviser on Standards, accompanied the representative of the Director-General during the mission.
.The mission held talks with His Excellency Mr. Amado H. Nez, Minister of Labour and Social Welfare, and with senior officials of the Ministry, as well as representatives of the employers' and workers' organisations.
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee wishes first of all to thank Mr. Andrs Aguilar for having agreed to carry out the direct contacts mission and for his detailed report on the pending cases, which made it possible for the Committee to examine them. The Committee considers that the report of the representative of the Director-General shows how useful missions of this kind are in elucidating the matters arising from allegations by the complainant organisations.
.Since the content of the allegations and the information supplied by the Government, as well as the information obtained by the representative of the Director-General during the mission are contained in the mission report (see Annex), the Committee may proceed directly to formulate its conclusions on the various cases.
.The Committee takes note of the report of the representative of the Director-General on the mission to Honduras from  to  January . The Committee notes with interest the fact that the representative of the Director-General received every facility from the authorities of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare in carrying out the mission. In this connection the Committee notes that the information obtained during the mission on the disappearance of two trade union leaders referred to in the complaints does not contain any new elements.
.When the Committee considered this case at its May  meeting (see th Report, paras. -) two matters were still pending. First, the Committee had requested the Government to supply information on the alleged murder of Jacobo Hernndez, a trade union leader of the Honduran National Peasants' Association (ANACH), and had called attention to the need to carry out judicial inquiries in that regard. The Committee had also requested the Government to supply information on the latest developments in the proceedings concerning the murder of Dagoberto Padilla, Ismael Ulloa, Angel Alvarado and Carlos Alcides Meja, and on the attempted murder of Pedro Chavarra, Jacobo Nez and Eulogio Figueroa, all leaders or members of the Workers' Union of the Agricultural and Cattle Raising Company of Sula (SITRACOAGS). The Committee had stressed the seriousness of the allegation that the manager and owners of SITRACOAGS were involved in the murder and attempted murders and considered that since it was a penal matter it should be subject to a criminal investigation. It therefore urged the Government to provide information on this investigation. Finally, subsequent to the latest examination of the case by the Committee, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), in a communication dated  October , presented new allegations concerning the disappearance of Mr. Jos Manuel Guerrero, President of the ""El Mochito"" Mineworkers' Union, who was reported by the ICFTU to have been detained by soldiers of the th Infantry Brigade.
.Concerning the death of Mr. Jacobo Hernndez, the ANACH union leader, the Committee notes that, according to the mission report, proceedings commenced on  March  against Mr. Marco Tulio Pineda Torres (at present detained in the central penitentiary of Tegucigalpa) for the crime of homicide.
.Regarding the murder of four SITRACOAGS leaders and the attempted murder of three other leaders of that organisation, the Committee notes that, according to the mission report, the relevant trial for murder or attempted murder is still at the indictment stage. The Committee also takes note of the various developments that have taken place in that trial: () of those who were earlier detained on charges of murder, Mr. Alfredo Villeda Henrquez and Mr. Moiss Orellana have been found not guilty of criminal liability; () those charged with the attempted murder of Pedro Chavarra, Jacobo Nez and Eulogio Figuera are the subject of warrants of arrest; () Mr. Marco Antonio Molina and Mr. Fausto Isal Garca are still fugitives from justice and before escaping from prison they confessed to the judicial authorities that they had committed the murders, as may be seen from the court documents given to the mission.
.As to the involvement of the manager (Mr. Carlos Gonzlez) and the owners of the Agricultural and Cattle Raising Company of Sula (particularly, Mr. Jaime Echeverra) in the murders, the Committee notes that the judicial authorities have released these persons since there were no grounds for their continued detention.
.Whenever allegations concerning the death or serious injury of trade union leaders or unionists have been submitted to it, the Committee has always insisted that a judicial inquiry be carried out with a view to elucidating the facts in full, determining responsibilities and punishing the guilty parties. In the present case, the Committee notes that trials are under way, and that it has been possible to identify the two alleged perpetrators of the murders or attempted murders, even though they are fugitives from justice. In these circumstances, the Committee expresses the hope that the proceedings in question will be concluded as soon as possible and will enable the guilty parties to be punished; it requests the Government to keep it informed of the final results.
.With respect to the disappearance of the trade union leader Mr. Jos Manuel Guerrero, the Committee takes note of the written communication given to the mission by the Minister of Labour, indicating that absolutely reliable sources have informed the security authorities that Mr. Jos Manuel Guerrero, President of the ""El Mochito"" workers' union, was trafficking in explosives and was involved in other activities tending to undermine the tranquillity of the nation, peace and democracy, and that he was therefore arrested on  October . However, given that the necessary investigations proved his innocence, he was released immediately and continues to exercise his trade union functions; Mr. Guerrero is now engaged in politics and was elected a deputy to the Congress by the National Party.
.In these conditions, in view of the fact that Mr. Guerrero was imprisoned because he was falsely accused of trafficking in explosives, and that he was freed once his innocence was proved, the Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that the arrest or detention of trade union leaders or trade unionists in conditions such as those presently alleged may not only constitute a serious interference in union activities, but also may create a climate of intimidation and fear prejudicial to the normal development of trade union activities. When taken on trade union grounds, they are contrary to the principles of Convention No. .

The second pending question referred to the non-reinstatement of  teachers, mentioned by name, who were dismissed on account of a strike in . The Committee considered that dismissal on account of a strike constituted serious discrimination in employment for the exercise of a lawful trade union activity, and was contrary to Convention No. , ratified by Honduras; it insisted that the Government state what measures it envisaged taking to secure the reinstatement of the dismissed teachers.
.Moreover, the complainant organisation in a communication of  December  presented new allegations in which it stated that on  December Mr. Ambrosio Sabio, former President of COLPROSUMAH, had been arrested. The complainant added that it appeared that the arrest had been made at the request of the rival group formed by the Government within this organisation.
.The Committee notes that the Minister of Labour told the mission that it would be very difficult to take steps to repeal the  Act which governs the constitution of the Professional College for the Advancement of Teaching in Honduras (COLPROSUMAH). The Committee also notes that, according to the Government, the  Act was adopted by the National Congress at the request of the executive committee of COLPROSUMAH that is recognised by the authorities.

.The Committee also notes the statement made by Mr. Sabio to the mission, particularly the fact that the accusation against him dates from  and that already then the First Criminal Court found no grounds for his arrest. He was arrested some days after the regular congress of COLPROSUMAH which had been convened by the unrecognised board on  December . Since  four judges have been dealing with the matter without issuing a warrant of arrest for lack of grounds. Inexplicably, in the course of a very short substitution in December , the warrant was issued by a judge, who, in total disregard for legality, certified that in November  the officially recognised executive committee of COLPROSUMAH had been properly elected.
.In these circumstances, the Committee, noting that Mr. Sabio was released  days after his arrest since there were no grounds for his imprisonment, concludes that the measures taken to deprive Mr. Sabio of his freedom were of an anti-union nature. The Committee deplores Mr. Sabio's imprisonment and at the same time draws the Government's attention to the fact that the arrest or detention of trade union leaders or trade unionists because of their functions or their activities as such are contrary to the principles of Convention No. .
.The Committee had requested the Government to communicate the results of the investigation being carried out concerning the whereabouts of the trade union leaders Mr. Rolando Vindel Gonzlez (see th Report, Case No. , para. ) and Mr. Gustavo Morales (see st Report, Case No. , para. ).
.The Committee notes that, as mentioned in the mission report, the investigations are continuing, but that as yet the whereabouts of the leaders are still not known. In these circumstances, the Committee expresses its concern at the length of time that has elapsed since the disappearance of these leaders, and requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in the investigations being carried out to discover their whereabouts.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:a) The Committee takes note of the report of the representative of the Director-General on the mission carried out from  to  January  in Honduras. The Committee notes with interest that the representative of the Director-General received every facility from the authorities of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare in carrying out the mission.b) With respect to the murder of a leader of ANACH, the murder of four leaders of SITRACOAGS and the attempted murder of three leaders of that organisation, the Committee observes that trials are under way and that two of the alleged perpetrators have been identified although they are fugitives from justice. The Committee expresses the hope that the trials under way will be concluded as soon as possible and that they will enable the guilty parties to be punished; it requests the Government to keep it informed of the final results.c) As regards  teachers who are still dismissed because of the  strike, the Committee notes the information provided by the Government but adjourns examination of this allegation pending receipt of information on the present position of the dismissed teachers which, during the direct contacts mission, the unrecognised COLPROSUMAH executive committee undertook to send.d) Concerning the arrest of two trade union leaders who have now been released (Mr. Jos Manuel Guerrero and Mr. Ambrosio Sabio), the Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that the arrest or detention of trade union leaders or trade unionists because of their functions or activities as such are contrary to the principles of Convention No. .e) The Committee expresses its concern at the long period that has elapsed since the disappearance of the trade union leaders Messrs. Roldando Vindel and Gustavo Morales, and requests the Government to keep it informed of developments of the investigations under way to ascertain their whereabouts.
.The Committee already examined this case at its May  meeting and presented interim conclusions to the Governing Body in its th Report, paragraphs  to  (approved at its th Session, May-June ). The Government supplied partial information in communications dated  June,  August and  October .
.At its meeting in February , the Committee addressed an urgent appeal to the Government for complete details on the outstanding issues in this case. It pointed out to the Government that, in accordance with the procedural rules in force, it would present a report on this case at its next meeting even if the Government's further observations had not been received. (See th Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session, February-March .) No further communications have been received from the Government.
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No.).
.This case concerns the murder of four trade union leaders who were named in the complaint and who were members of the Workers' Union of the",-1,1983,Honduras
82,"Agricultural and Cattle Raising Company of Sula (SITRACOAGS) and the serious wounding of three other union leaders on  March  allegedly by vigilantes in the pay of the manager and owners of the company. It also concerns the subsequent assassination by an unknown person of another named trade union leader of the National Peasants' Association (ANACH) at Danli and the dismissal of  members of SITRACOAGS. The Government replied that, on  March , proceedings had been instituted in the district criminal court against four named accused for murder and attempted murder and that, as at July , the proceedings were at the indictment stage.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommended the Government Body to approve the following conclusions:- The Committee expressed its deep concern at the serious nature of the allegations which concerned the assassination of three trade union leaders and a trade unionist of SITRACOAGS and a trade union leader of ANACH, the attempted assassination of three other leaders of SITRACOAGS and the subsequent dismissal of  members of SITRACOAGS, especially since the complainant organisations had stressed the involvement in the alleged events of the manager and owners of the Agricultural and Cattle Raising Company of Sula, on which the Government had not commented.- The Committee expressed its deep concern at the assassinations and the serious physical attacks against the trade union leaders and trade unionists concerned and requested the Government to inform it of developments in the judicial investigations under way into the crimes and to send it the text of the judgement to be handed down.- The Committee regretted that the Government has not replied to the allegations concerning the assassination of the trade union leader of ANACH, Jacobo Hernndez and the dismissal of  members of SITRACOAGS. It requested the Government to transmit its observations on these allegations as a matter of the greatest urgency and to open - if it had not already done so - a judicial inquiry into the assassination of this trade union leader and to inform it of the results.- In general, the Committee drew the Government's attention to the fact that freedom of association can only be exercised in conditions in which fundamental human rights, and in particular those relating to human life and personal safety, are fully respected and guaranteed. The Committee requested the Government to take urgent and appropriate measures to ensure that there would be no recurrence of the incidents that were described in this complaint.
.In a communication dated  June , the Government encloses a note, dated  May , from the Supreme Court advising that the judge at first instance had called a stay in proceedings in the murder trial as concerns three of the accused and that, although two further accused had escaped from prison, the trial against them was at the indictment stage.
.In a communication of  August , the Government indicates that it is awaiting further information from the Supreme Court as to whether the murder case is being heard or has been finalised. As regards the  SITRACOAGS members who were allegedly dismissed, it states that investigations are under way as to whether the dismissals in fact took place and to ascertain the reasons. The Government also states that it has requested the Supreme Court to supply information on the alleged murder of the ANACH trade union leader, Jacobo Hernndez, in April .
.In a communication of  October , the Government supplies information from the Labour Inspectorate on the  alleged dismissals. It states that the undertaking did restructure its personnel over - and there were staff reductions and some direct dismissals, both with payment of social benefits. The majority of dismissed workers opted to settle their problems through the Regional Office of the Ministry of Labour in San Pedro Sula.
.The Committee regrets that in spite of the time which has elapsed since the last examination of this case, the serious nature of the allegations and the many requests made to the Government, the latter has not sent detailed observations on all the outstanding aspects of this case.
.Consequently, the Committee is bound to recall that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and it is confident that if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side should recognise the importance of formulating for objective examination detailed replies to the allegation submitted against them.
.As regards the trial of certain persons accused of the murder or attempted murder of trade union leaders and members of SITRACOAGS in March , the Committee notes with regret that proceedings - now only against two accused - were still at the indictment stage in May  with no final decision being handed down. It draws the Government's attention to the importance it has always attached to a prompt and independent legal investigation of alleged cases of death and assault of trade unionists with a view to elucidating the facts, identifying the persons responsible and taking proceedings against them. The Committee, accordingly, urges the Government to communicate information on the latest developments in the proceedings, and, if the trial has been concluded, to send it the text of the judgement.
.As regards the alleged involvement of the employers in the murders and attempted murders, the Committee deeply regrets that the Government has never commented on this serious allegation. It considers that, since this matter falls within the competence of the criminal courts, a criminal inquiry should be carried out. It urges the Government to supply information on any such investigations.
.The Committee notes with regret that no concrete information has been supplied on the alleged murder of the ANACH trade union leader, Mr. Jacobo Hernndez, in April . It would again draw attention to the principle set out above concerning the necessity of speedy and independent legal investigations into allegations of this nature and urges the Government to supply information on this aspect of the case.
.As regards the alleged dismissal of  members of SITRACOAGS after the assassinations of March , the Committee notes that the complainants do not specifically state that this took place as a consequence of trade union membership or activities. On the other hand, the Government indicates that the majority left voluntarily with payment of certain benefits. It also notes from the Government's reply that there were some direct dismissals with compensation, a majority of which were challenged through the Regional Office of the Ministry of Labour.
.In addition to the information supplied by the complainants and the Government, the Committee observes that s.  of the Honduran Constitution protects workers against unjustified dismissal and empowers a dismissed worker to choose between compensation or reinstatement in his post. It also observes that s. () of the Labour Code prohibits employers from dismissing or in any way prejudicing their employees because of lawful trade union activities or membership and that the labour courts have wide jurisdiction in reviewing observance of the Code (Part IX). The Committee would accordingly express the hope that all necessary steps have been or will be taken to ensure that all cases of unfair dismissal that are brought to the attention of the authorities will be dealt with rapidly.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report, and, in particular, the following conclusions:(a) The Committee regrets that, in spite of the time which has elapsed since the previous examination of this case, the serious nature of the allegations and the many requests made to the Government, the latter has not communicated detailed observations on all the outstanding aspects of the complaint.(b) As regards the assassinations and serious wounding of a total of eight trade union leaders and members of SITRACOAGS and ANACH in March and April , the Committee notes with regret that proceedings in the murder trial were still at the indictment stage in May  and that no concrete information has been supplied on investigations into the murder of the ANACH trade union leader.(c) The Committee draws the Government's attention to the importance it has always attached to a prompt and independent legal investigation being carried out into alleged cases of death and assault of trade unionists with a view to elucidating the facts, identifying the persons responsible and taking proceedings against them. It urges the Government to supply information on the latest development in the proceedings and to send it the text of any judgement which has been handed down.(d) The Committee stresses the seriousness of the allegation concerning the involvement of the manager and owners of the Agricultural and Cattle Raising Company of Sula in the murders and attempted murders. It considers that since this allegation falls within the competence of the criminal courts, a criminal investigation should be carried out and urges the Government to supply information on any such investigations.(e) The Committee urges the Government to supply information concerning the alleged murder of the ANACH trade union leader, Mr. Jacobo Hernndez.(f) As regards the  SITRACOAGS unionists who",-1,1983,Honduras
83,"were dismissed after the assassinations in March , the Committee expresses the hope that all cases of unfair dismissal that are brought to the attention of the authorities will be dealt with rapidly.(g) Given the seriousness of the allegations in this case and the lack of information before the Committee, it requests the Government to consent to the carrying out of a direct contacts mission to the country in order that the various aspects of this case may be fully examined.
.The complaint appears in a joint communication from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the International Federation of Plantation, Agricultural and Allied Workers (IFPAAW) dated  June . IFPAAW sent additional information in communications dated  and  July, and  August . The Government replied in communications dated  July and  August  and  April .
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants allege that on  March  between  and  p.m., in the vicinity known as El Blsamo village, between the city of El Progreso and Santa Rita de Yoro, the following trade union leaders and trade unionists of the Workers' Union of the Agricultural and Cattle Raising Company of Sula (SITRACOAGS), affiliated to the IFPAAW in Honduras, were assassinated: Dagoberto Padilla Escoto (president), Ismael Ulloa (records secretary of the Finca  (Guanchias) branch office), Angel Alvarado (secretary general of the Finca  branch office) and Carlos Aicides Meja (member of the trade union). Furthermore, Pedro Chavarra (secretary responsible for records and education), Jacobo Nez (vice-president of the discipline committee) and Eulogio Figueroa (vice-president of the Finca  branch) were seriously wounded.
.The complainants point out that the assassinations occurred three-and-a-half hours after an assembly of workers which had been held in Finca . The assembly had been called as a matter of urgency to inform members on agreements which had been reached between the trade union, the undertaking and the Ministry of Labour concerning various unresolved problems.
.According to the complainants, the events occurred as follows: around  p.m., after the end of the meeting, some leaders returned to their respective fields in a Toyota jeep which was the property of the trade union. As they were returning to El Progreso, in Finca , they were intercepted by two men dressed in olive green military uniform who were carrying a ""Falck"" rifle and a shotgun. The so-called military officers asked the trade unionists to drive them to Santa Rita, which they agreed to do. They all got in to the above-mentioned vehicle. As they were leaving the dirt tracks of the banana plantations and reaching the paved road, one of the persons in uniform turned to Dagoberto Padilla, who was driving, and asked him to stop the vehicle in the El Blsamo village. It was in this place that without any warning the uniformed officer carrying the shotgun fired against Mr. Padilla who fell dead onto the road. The officer fired a second shot at Mr. Padilla when he was already lying dead on the road. The uniformed officer who was carrying the ""Falck"" rifle then fired against the other trade unionists, using up all his rounds of ammunition. As a result four trade unionists were killed and three seriously wounded.
.The complainants allege that it was subsequently established that the two assassins masquerading as military officers were in fact vigilantes of the banana plantations who were acting on the direct orders of the steward of the manager's office, for which each had been paid , lempiras (national currency) and that the steward had received instructions from the security chief of the plantations authorised by the manager and the owners named Echeverri.
.The complainants also allege that various trade unions reacted publicly to this horrible crime. This was the case in particular with the National Peasants' Association of Honduras (ANACH) which published a communiqu demanding that the civil and military authorities clarify the events as quickly as possible and arrest those responsible. Two days later, the trade union leader of the Executive Council of ANACH, Jacobo Hernndez, was assassinated in the city of Danli, at approximately  p.m. by an unknown person who fired from a short distance without any provocation. This trade union leader had been participating in settling a dispute concerning unfarmed land.
.IFPAAW also alleges that after the assassinations,  members of the trade union (SITRACOAGS) were dismissed and that at the beginning of July a number of prisoners escaped from the prison at El Progreso-Yoro, including Fausto Rivera Garca and Marco Antonio Molina, two of the actual perpetrators of the massacre carried out on  March .
.The Government sends a document from the Supreme Court of justice which transcribes a note from the Departmental Court of El Progreso-Yoro, dated  July . The said note states that on  March  proceedings were instituted in the district criminal court of the above-mentioned city against Marco Antonio Molina Martnez, Fausto Garca Rivera, Alfredo Villeda Henrriquez and Moiss Reyes Orellana for the murder of Dagoberto Padilla Escoto, Ismael Ulloa, Angel Alvarado and Carlos Alcides Mejia and the attempted murder of Pedro Chavarra, Jacobo Nez and Eulogio Figueroa, and that the case is still before the court. The proceedings are at the indictment stage and for this reason it is not possible to give more information.
.The Committee expresses its deep concern of the serious nature of the allegations which concern the assassination of three trade union leaders and a trade union member of SITRACOAGS and a leader of ANACH, the attempted assassination of three other leaders of SITRACOAGS and the subsequent dismissal of  members of SITRACOAGS, especially since it notes that the complainant organisations have stressed the involvement in the alleged events of the manager and owners of the Agricultural and Cattle Raising Company of Sula, on which the Government has not commented.
.On previous occasions when examining allegations concerning the death of or physical attacks on trade union leaders [see, for example, rd Report, Case No.  (El Salvador), paragraph ] the Committee has requested the Government to undertake without delay an independent judicial inquiry with a view to elucidating the facts in full, determining responsibilities and punishing the guilty parties. The Committee notes in this connection that proceedings have been instituted by the district criminal court against Marco Antonio Molina Martinez, Fausto Garcia Rivera, Alfredo Villeda Henriquez and Moiss Reyes Orellana for the murder of Dagoberto Padilla Escoto, Ismael Ulloa, Angel Alvarado and Carlos Alcides Meja and the attempted murder of Pedro Chavarra, Jacobo Nez and Eulogio Figueroa. In these circumstances, the Committee expresses its deep concern at the assassinations and the serious physical attacks against the above-mentioned trade union leaders and trade unionists and requests the Government to inform it of developments in the judicial investigations and to send the text of the judgment to be handed down.
.The Committee regrets that the Government has not replied to the allegations concerning the assassination of the trade union leader of ANACH, Jacobo Hernndez, and the dismissal of  members of SITRACOAGS. The Committee requests the Government to transmit its observations on these allegations as a matter of the greatest urgency and to open - if it has not already done so - a judicial inquiry into the assassination of this trade union leader and to inform it of the results.
.In general, the Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that freedom of association can only be exercised in conditions in which fundamental human rights, and in particular those relating to the human life and personal safety, are fully respected and guaranteed [see, for example, rd Report, Case No.  (El Salvador), paragraph ]. The Committee requests the Government to take urgent and appropriate measures to ensure that there is no recurrence of the kind of incidents that are described in this complaint.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:(a) The Committee expresses its deep concern at the serious nature of the allegations which concern the assassination of three trade union leaders and a trade unionist of SITRACOAGS and a trade union leader of ANACH, the attempted assassination of three of other leaders of SITRACOAGS and the subsequent dismissal of  members of SITRACOAGS, especially since it notes that the complainant organisations have stressed the involvement in the alleged events of the manager and owners of the Agricultural and Cattle Raising Company of Sula, on which the Government has not commented.(b) The Committee expresses its deep concern at the assassinations and the serious physical attacks against the trade union leaders and trade unionists concerned and requests the Government to inform it of developments in the judicial investigations under way into the crimes perpetrated against the leaders and trade unionists of SITRACOAGS and to send it the text of the judgment to be handed down.(c) The Committee regrets that",1,1983,Honduras

85,".The Committee already examined this case in May-June  when it presented an interim report to the Governing Body. 
.The Government subsequently sent a communication dated  August .
.Honduras has ratified both the Freedom of Association and the Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.When the Committee examined this case in May-June , there remained pending the allegations concerning the dismissal of  teachers following strike action taken in the second half of ; the search carried out by the police on the premises of the College for the Advancement of the Honduran Teaching Profession (COLPROSUMAH) in July ; the holding in custody for  hours of this organisation's leaders because of a telephone call to Nicaragua (the authorities accused the COLPROSUMAH leaders of demonstrating their sympathy and solidarity with their colleagues in Nicaragua and El Salvador); and the acts of interference by the authorities during the annual meeting of COLPROSUMAH which was held in December  to elect its executive committee.
.The Committee requested the Government to take steps to reinstate the  teachers who remained dismissed and to send its observations on the other allegations.
.The Government states in its communication of  August  that as it had already pointed out, the dispute which arose in the teaching sector in  was the result of the intransigence of the teachers' leaders who encouraged a state of institutional instability brought about by continuous work stoppages by teachers ( per cent of the working time of a school year had been lost in such stoppages) and by the insistence on obtaining wage increases from the Government which were impossible to grant in view of the serious economic crisis which the country was facing and continues to face. The Government ads that the teachers who were suspended as a result of the events which occurred in  have now been reinstated and that at the moment, no teacher remains dismissed for this reason. The conditions brought about during the previous year have been overcome and the present year has been marked by a spirit of work in the different schools and institutes of the country.
.As regards the events which occurred within COLPROSUMAH and which resulted in the election of the executive committee, the Government states that these are events which fall exclusively within the competence of this organisation since its statutes define the procedure regarding the taking of its decisions and the competent appeal bodies. At all events, the participation of the Government cannot exceed that permitted by the laws of the country.
.The Committee notes with interest that according to the Government, no teachers now remain dismissed as a result of the strike action taken in the teaching sector in the second half of .
.The Committee also notes the Government's statement with regard to the allegations of interference by the authorities in the election of the executive committee of COLPROSUMAH that the events which occurred within this organisation fall exclusively within the competence of the said organisation and that its statutes regulate the procedure regarding the taking of decisions and the appeal bodies. In this respect, the Committee observes that the Government has not replied with sufficient clarity to these allegations. In these circumstances. the Committee cannot but recall that in pursuance of Article  of Convention No.  the public authorities should refrain from any interference which could restrict the right of organisations to elect their representatives in full freedom.
.With regard to the remaining allegations (search by the police of the COLPROSUMAH premises and the detention of this organisation's leaders for  hours), the Committee regrets that the Government has not replied to them. In these circumstances, the Committee draws the attention of the Government to the fact that measures of preventive detention against the trade union leaders for activities connected with the exercise of trade union rights are contrary to the principles of freedom of association, and that the search of trade union premises should only be made following the issue of a warrant by the judicial authority within the framework of a criminal investigation.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this report and in particular the following conclusions:(a) The Committee notes with interest that no teachers remain dismissed as a result of the strike action taken in the teaching sector in the second half of .(b) The Committee recalls that in pursuance of Article  of Convention No.  the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict the right of workers' organisations to elect their representatives in full freedom.(c) The Committee draws the attention of the Government to the fact that the detention of trade union leaders for activities connected with the exercise of trade union rights are contrary to the principles of freedom of association and that the search of trade union premises should only be made following the issue of a warrant by the judicial authority within the framework of a criminal investigation.
.The World Confederation of Organisations of the Teaching Profession (WCOTP) presented its complaint in a communication dated  October . It sent additional information in communications dated  December  and  February . The Government replied in a communication dated  March .
.Honduras has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communications dated  October and  December , the complainant alleges that, following a strike called on  August by the organisations affiliated to the Honduran Teachers' Unity Front (FUMH) in connection with wage negotiations and a peaceful demonstration in front of a number of ministries and the presidential Palace,  teachers were dismissed (except for  who are still out of work, most were subsequently reinstated), salary deductions were made for the days the teachers were on strike, the schools were placed under military control and the dismissed teachers were replaced. The complainant adds that, although the teachers' organisations proposed various compromise solutions, the Government refused any increase in salary on the grounds of the country's economic situation and, specifically, the size of its foreign debt.
.The complainant points out that the Government based its action on section  of the Labour Code which provides that trade unions of civil servants are not permitted to strike; it considers, however, that teaching personnel are entitled to do so inasmuch as article , paragraph , of the Constitution states: ""The right to strike or participate in a work stoppage is recognised. The law shall regulate its exercise and may subject it to special restrictions in specified public services"".
.In its communication dated  February , the complainant alleges that, during the opening session of the annual meeting of the College for the Advancement of the Honduran. Teaching Profession (COLPROSUMAH) on  December ,  persons broke into the meeting - they were subsequently excluded - and attempted to reverse the existing majority, to have the meeting cancelled and to persuade the delegates to join them. According to the complainant, the intruders were neither delegates of regional assemblies nor invested with any mandate by them but were COLPROSUMAH members close to the Ministry of Education and school directors who were accompanied by members of the police and public security force.
.The complainant adds that the  persons met on the same day in a nearby building belonging to the State, where they proceeded to elect a self-styled COLPROSUMAH committee, and that the record of the election mentions the names of delegates from various regional assemblies who deny having participated in the meeting. The  delegates to the annual meeting themselves elected, or rather re-elected, the legitimate COLPROSUMAH committee.
.In spite of this, during the annual meeting which was being held in Ocotepeque, members of the National Investigation Department, accompanied by members of the public security force, took over the headquarters of CGLPROSUMAH where there was only a watchman left. Since then the organisation's headquarters has been guarded by the police who have accused COLPROSUMAH of possessing subversive literature and will not allow the legitimate leaders of COLPROSUMAH to enter the premises even to retrieve their personal belongings. The complainant adds that, on  December , a lawyer apparently representing the Supreme Court of justice handed over to the executive committee appointed by the  person referred to earlier all the fixed and moveable assets of COLPROSUMAH. The complainant points out that, in any case, the mandate of the former committee expired on  January 
.Finally, the complainant alleges that in July  the police conducted a search of the COIPROMUSAH offices and held the organisation's leaders in custody for  hours because of a telephone call to Nicaragua; the authorities accuse the COLPROSUMAH leaders o demonstrating their sympathy and solidarity with their colleagues in Nicaragua and El Salvador.
.In its communication dated  March  the Government states that on  April  the four",-1,1982,Honduras
86,"teachers' colleges affiliated to the Honduran Teachers' Unity Front (FUMH) submitted to the Secretariat for Public Education a set of draft regulations for the Honduran teaching staff which, inter alia, defined the basic salary for teachers at the various levels of the education system and provided for the teachers' colleges to take over the running of national education.
.The Government points out that the proposed salary increase was more than  per cent above the existing level and was beyond the means of the Government. Moreover, articles  and  of the Honduran Constitution contain the following provisions:Article . Education at every level of the formal educational system except higher education shall be authorised, organised, directed and supervised exclusively by the Executive power through the Secretariat for Public Education, which shall administer the system's education centres, the latter being wholly financed out of public funds.Article . Officially dispensed education shall be free of charge; basic education shall, moreover, be compulsory and entirely financed by the State. The State shall establish enforcement machinery to ensure compliance with this provision.
.The Government adds that on  May  the Secretariat for Public Education submitted to the FUME a set of draft regulations for teaching personnel which conform to the laws currently in force in the country. On  June , the teachers nevertheless organised a public demonstration and ceased work, to the detriment of tae system of education. In an effort to find a just and equitable solution to the problem posed by the FUMH, the Government appointed a committee on  June  to discuss the draft regulations for the teaching staff with another committee designated by the FUMH: however, in spite of the Government's manifest interest in the matter, during the course of discussions on the draft regulations the teachers ceased work to hold public demonstrations and, on  June , when the aforementioned committees were still negotiating, went so far as to call a -hour national work stoppage.
.The Government states that a meeting was subsequently held at Government House which was attended by representatives of the FUMH and part of the Cabinet and at which the FUMH was informed that, for economic reasons, it was impossible for the Government to accede to its salary demands. The FUME responded the following day with a nation-wide work stoppage of  hours, whereupon the Government warned that deductions would be made from salaries for the days not worked and that more rigorous measures would be taken if the FUME persisted in its attitude. In spite of these warnings, the FUME leaders called a work stoppage of  hours on  August  and,  days later, a further stoppage of  hours, regardless of the fact that such action by teachers is defined by articles  and  of the Regulations issued under the Teachers' Register Act as dereliction of duty and that the corresponding sanction provided for under article  is the dismissal of all those involved.
.The Government goes on to say that on  August  the President of the Republic and the Cabinet held a meeting with members of the FUME executive committee in order to settle the matter. After several hours of dialogue during which it was explained that the economic situation of the country was such that it was impossible to meet their salary demands, the members of the executive committee called an indefinite work stoppage as from  August. In spite of this, the President expressed his desire to keep the dialogue open and to give priority to the request for a salary increase if and when the country's economic situation improved; this proposal was rejected by the FMUH leaders who maintained their work stoppage.
.In view of their intransigent attitude, the Government called upon the leaders of the FUME to give the matter further thought and to change their attitude and invited them to resume classes on  August , with the warning that failure to do so would lead to cancellation of the appointments of any teachers who did not comply with the order issued by the Executive and that other teachers would be appointed to the vacancies thus created. The Government accordingly took this action and the situation remained unchanged until  August when the FUMH called upon the teachers to return to work on  August.
.In the Government's view, the foregoing shows that it exhausted every possible means within its scope to find a basis of agreement with the teaching sector but that all its efforts were in vain, owing to the intransigence shown by the teachers' leaders throughout the negotiations. The Government adds that there can be no doubt that it has treated the law-breaking teachers fairly, since their repeated offences (unauthorised absence from work, repeated acts of indiscipline, frequent and u justified dereliction of duty, failure to act with the sense of responsibility, decorum and dignity expected of their post) were such as to justify summary dismissal. The Government reiterates that, although the seriousness of their offence, which has been duly proved in this instance, rendered them liable to the said disciplinary action, it has reinstated almost  per cent of the dismissed teachers.
.In the Government's opinion, the complainant organisation's assertion that freedom of association is being infringed in Honduras is untrue since the teachers' organisations are considered not as trade unions but as occupational organisations; even in the event that they were to form a trade union, they would still be subject to certain restrictions imposed by national legislation, inasmuch as trade unions of public servants do not have the same rights and functions as are granted by law to other workers' trade union organisations. Specifically, they do not have the power vested in trade unions by section () of the Labour Code to call strikes in accordance with the law. On the contrary, section  of the Code makes the following provision with respect to trade unions of civil servants:Article . No trade union of civil servants may submit claims or conclude collective agreements, but the trade unions of other persons employed by the State shall have all the powers of other workers' unions, and their claims shall be examined in the same way, even though they are not permitted to call or conduct a strike.
.The allegations in this case refer to measures taken and sanctions imposed by the authorities following the strike and protest action undertaken by the teachers' organisations from the beginning of June  in response to the authorities' refusal to agree to salary increases; to the searching of the COLPROSUMAH's offices and holding of its leaders in custody for  hours; and to interference in COLPROSUMAH's general meeting in December .
.With regard to the measures taken and sanctions imposed by the authorities because of the strike and protest action of the teachers' organisations (dismissal of  teachers,  of whom have not yet been reinstated, deductions from salary for days not worked, military control of schools and replacement of dismissed strikers), the Committee notes that, according to the Government, the sanctions were imposed as a result of the intransigent attitude of the FUMH during and after the salary negotiations between the teachers"" organisations and the authorities and, specifically, their rejection of the President's proposal to give priority to their request for a salary increase if the country's economic situation improved and the fact that they called a number of work stoppages and public demonstrations. The Committee notes that although under the legislation in, force the offences committed (unauthorised absence from work, repeated acts of indiscipline, etc.) were such as to justify the dismissal of those involved, almost  per cent of the dismissed teachers have been reinstated. The Committee also notes the complainant's statement that  teachers continue to be out of work and that the Government has refused any salary increase in spite of being offered various compromise solutions.
.The Committee observes that the principal grounds for the measures taken and sanctions imposed by the authorities are that the national legislation does not recognise the right to strike of public servants (including teachers) or of their organisations. The committee further observes that the teachers' organisations which organised the strikes and public demonstrations referred to in the allegations are workers' organisations in the sense of Article  of Convention. No.  (i.e. ""any organisation of workers for furthering and defending the interests of workers"") and that the guarantees embodied in the Convention are therefore fully applicable to them.
.The Committee has indicated on a number of occasions that, as one of the essential means through which workers and their organisations may promote and defend their occupational interests,' the right to strike may be denied or seriously restricted only in public services or services essential in the strict sense of the term. The Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has stated in this connection that the concept of public servant should be confined to those acting in their capacity as agents of the public authority and",-1,1982,Honduras
87,"that essential services should be interpreted as referring to those whose interruption would endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population and that, otherwise, if the legislation defines the public service or essential services too broadly, the principle whereby the right to strike may be limited or prohibited in those sectors would become meaningless. Furthermore, the Committee on Freedom of Association has already had occasion to state its views on the education sector and has found that workers in that sector should not be considered as engaged in essential services in the strict sense of the term.
.In, these circumstances, the Committee considers that workers in the education sector ought to enjoy the right to strike since they cannot be considered as public servants acting in their capacity as agents of the public authorities nor as working in an essential service in the strict sense of the term. These authorities or services should benefit from compensatory guarantees if the right to strike is denied. Consequently the Committee keenly regrets the large number of teachers dismissed as a result of the strike action. It requests the Government to take steps to reinstate those teachers who are still dismissed ( according to the complainant) and to take the necessary measures so as to recognise the right to strike of workers in the education sector.
.With regard to the other measures taken as a result of the strike and protest action organised by the teachers' organisations, the Committee considers that no objection can be made to the deductions from salary for days or, strike from the standpoint of the principles of freedom of association. However, it wishes to point out that placing schools under military control is not conducive to a climate of confidence and respect which should prevail in negotiation procedures, above all where negotiations are taking place in the context of an industrial dispute. Consequently, the authorities should not have recourse to this kind of measure.
.Finally, the Committee observes that the Government has not replied to the allegations contained in the communication from ' the complainant organisation dated  February  regarding the search of the COLPROSUMAH premises by the police and the detention in custody of the leaders of the organisation for  hours in July , and regarding the alleged acts of interference on the occasion of the COLPROSUMAH annual meeting. The Committee requests the Government to send its observations in this respect.",-1,1982,Honduras
88,".The World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) presented its complaint in communications dated  and  July . The Government replied in a communication dated  December .
.Honduras has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The WFTU claims that on  July  the police surrounded and broke into the home of Mrs. Rosario Roiz, leader of the Workers' Trade Union of the National Electrical Energy Enterprise (STENEE), who nevertheless managed to escape. The complainant adds that the police removed the belongings of Mrs. Roiz and are still looking for her and continue surveillance of her empty house.
.On the day referred to, according to the complainant, Mr. Calixto Garrido was in the same house; he was attacked and brutally beaten to death. His body was left in a ditch.
.The WFTU concludes with the assertion that repressive action against political and trade union leaders has been on the increase since a recent terrorist attack on two electrical power stations in Tegucigalpa. The authorities are now trying to link these events to the trade union led by Mrs. Roiz, continues the complainant, and she is therefore in serious danger.
.The Government states that the suggestion that the police attacked Mrs. Roiz's residence on  July  in order to arrest her, as the complainant alleges, is absurd as it would have been easier for them to do so at her place of work. To support its declarations the Government has sent documentation from the National Electrical Energy Enterprise, where Mrs. Roiz worked showing that' after being granted leave on several occasions for trade union reasons, Mrs. Roiz returned to work on  June  where she remained until  July  when she requested, and was granted, leave without pay for a period of two months.
.The Government also encloses a note from- the Director-General of National investigations stating that no charge has been brought against Mrs. Roiz and that it is untrue that the police are looking for her or that they intend to arrest her.
.With regard to the death of Mr. Calixto Garrido, the Government states that, according to its information, the incident was perpetuated by criminals with personal grievances against Mr. Garrido who intended to rob him and is therefore quite unconnected with the foregoing.
.The committee notes that on  July , according to the complainant, the police surrounded and broke into the home of Mrs. Rosario Roiz, leader of the STENEE, removed her belongings and are still looking for her and continue surveillance of her house, where a certain Mr. Calixto Garrido had been on the same day before being murdered. On the latter point the Government has stated that Mr. Calixto Garrido's murder is quite unconnected with the complaint but was perpetrated by delinquents with personal grievances against Mr, Garrido who intended to rob him.
.With regard to the allegation that Mrs. Roiz, union leader of the STENEE, is being looked for by the police, the Committee notes that the Government has submitted a document from the Director-General of National Investigations stating that no charge has been brought against her and that it is untrue that the police are looking for her or that they intend to arrest her. The Government has also pointed out that, if the police had intended to arrest Mrs. Roiz on  July , they could easily have done so at her place of work where, according to information from the enterprise concerned, the trade union leader was working on the day of the incident and thereafter. In these circumstances, the Committee considers that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.
.With regard to the remaining allegations (violation of domicile and appropriation of Mrs. Roiz's belongings in her home by the police), the Committee, while observing that the Government has not provided any specific information on the subject, notes that the complainant has not demonstrated that a link exists between the alleged events and an infringement of trade union rights but merely asserts in general terms that the authorities wish to link a recent terrorist attack on two power stations in Tegucigalpa with the trade union led by Mrs. Roiz. In these circumstances, and considering that the complainant has not supplied further details concerning its allegations in spite of being given the opportunity to send additional information, the Committee considers that the allegations do not call for further examination.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.",-1,1982,Honduras
89,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the Latin American Central of Workers dated  July . The Government's reply is contained in a communication dated  August .
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  July , the Latin American Central of Workers alleges that  workers of the municipality of San Pedro Sula were arrested on the order of the Mayor of the town, and that one of the detainees is Mr. Israel Salinas, President of the trade union to which these workers belong. According to the complainant, the arrests took place when workers demanded compliance with the collective agreement, reinstatement of  dismissed workers and payment of trade union dues amounting to , lempiras, which had been withheld.
.In its communication of  August , the Government states that the workers of the municipality of San Pedro Sula were arrested for one day for attacking municipal property, and were released the next day.
.The Committee observes that in the present complaint the complainant has alleged that  workers of the municipality of San Pedro Sula, including a trade union leader, were arrested for demanding that certain claims be met. The Government, for its part, has stated that the detained workers were released the next day and that the reason for the arrests was an attack on municipal property.
.The Committee also observes that in their brief communications neither the complainant nor the Government has provided details on the circumstances of the attack in question and that, in particular, it is not possible, from these communications, to assess the extent to which the workers of the municipality committed acts of violence. In consequence, in the absence of more detailed information on the basis of which conclusions might be reached on the allegations made and considering that the workers who took part in the attack on the property of the municipality of San Pedro Sula were apparently released the day after their arrest, the Committee considers that this case does not call for further examination.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.",-1,1982,Honduras
90,".The complaint is contained in a communication dated  June  from the Latin American Federation of Farm Workers. The Government sent its observations in a letter dated  August .
.Honduras has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Latin American Federation of Farm Workers (FCL) alleges that massive arrests of peasant leaders have been carried out in the Department of Copn.
.The Government states that after several peasants had been indicted on charges involving various offences committed against individual persons and the State, and after investigations had established reasonable evidence of their guilt; the respective courts sentenced the persons in question to imprisonment. The Government points out that the offences for which they were prosecuted were in no way related to their participation in trade union activities and it encloses the reports of the First and Second Superior Courts of Santa Rosa de Copn in which the names of the accused and their offences are recorded (usurpation, assault, damage to property, intimidation or arson).
.The Committee notes that according to the Government the imprisonment of the peasants whose names it provides was ordered by the judicial authorities after it was concluded that there was reasonable evidence that the accused had committed offences in common law, and that the charges were in no way related to the trade union, activities of the peasants, as can be seen from the relevant reports of the judicial authorities.
.The Committee notes that the complainant has not made use of the procedural right to present additional information and that it gave no information in its brief communication of  June  as regards the names of the peasant leaders who had been arrested and the motives and circumstances of their arrest.",-1,1981,Honduras
91,".The complaints are contained in a communication from the Trade Union Committee of the Workers of Central America and Panama (CUSCA) dated  April  and a communication from the international Federation of Commercial, Clerical and Technical Employees (FIST) dated  August . The Government replied in a communication dated  September .
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants allege that under legislative decree No.  of  March  liquidating the National Development Bank (BNF) and establishing the National Agricultural Development Bank (BANADESA), the entire staff of the former were dismissed on  March  and the social benefits to which they were entitled liquidated, thus terminating all previous labour commitments, both individual and collective, contracted by BNF.
.The complainants state that the dismissal of the staff en masse is a violation of the Labour Code and the existing collective agreement, and aims in reality at destroying the BNF trade union. This is clear from the fact that its national and sectoral leaders were dismissed without any opportunity of reinstatement or possibility of defending themselves, and the fact that BANADESA has been looking for new employees. Also, the BNF staff who have gone to work for BANADESA are employed on terms vastly inferior to these enjoyed by the BNF employees under the collective agreement then in force.
.The Government states that total reorganisation of BNF had been considered at various times since the late s. The establishment of BANADESA thus sprang from the need for reorganisation that, geared to the actual requirements of the country's agricultural sector, would do away with outdated administrative procedures and an attitude on the part of the staff to resist improvement of their skills and that the said reorganisation would be able to cope with rising running costs and correct the current stagnation of the credit portfolio.
.The Government adds that the staff with whom BANADESA's operations were begun were selected from among former BNF employees according to technical requirements and their past records so that the new undertaking would be staffed by the most qualified employees. Thus,  BANADESA employees previously worked for BNF. The Government states that the establishment of BANADESA was, for the various reasons mentioned above, due to the need to develop the agricultural sector and was never intended for the petty purpose of destroying a trade union.
.The Committee notes that there is a clear contradiction between the complainants' statement that the establishment of BANADESA and the consequent dismissal of the BNF staff were intended to destroy the BNF trade union and the Government's reply that these measures obeyed strictly economic reasons and that the subsequent recruitment of BANADESA staff was based exclusively on considerations of occupational qualifications on this point, the Committee recalls that its terms of reference do not include the problem of breach of employment contract by dismissal, unless the dismissal was an act of anti-union discrimination. In this connection, the Committee takes note of the complainants' statement that, pursuant to the decree of  March  providing that BANADESA's administration would enjoy complete freedom in selecting and hiring its staff, the national and sectoral leaders of the BNF Trade Union, were dismissed without any opportunity of being reinstated in BANADESA or any possibility of defending themselves. The Committee wishes to point out that in such circumstances workers who consider themselves prejudiced by anti-union discriminatory measures should be able to appeal to a court or some other independent authority. The Committee also notes that the Labour Code of Honduras forbids employers to dismiss or prejudice in any way their workers on account of trade union membership or participation it lawful trade union activities.
.Furthermore, the Committee considers that for the sake of sound labour relations it would have been advantageous for the employers and workers to discuss jointly such matters as the way in which BNF was to be reorganised, the continuing application of the provisions of the collective agreement, or the implementation of impartial procedures to ensure that workers entering BANADESA would be selected according to objective criteria, all of which should have been done in the light of the Co-operation at the Level of the Undertaking Recommendation,  (No. ).
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to draw the attention of the Government to the importance, as stressed it the two last paragraphs, of observing the principles relating to co-operation between employers and workers at the level of the undertaking and to those relating to protection against anti-union discrimination, in particular the principle that workers who feel that they have been the subject of discriminatory measures, should be able to appeal to a court or some other independent authority in order to secure the application of section () of the Labour Code of Honduras expressly forbidding employers to dismiss or prejudice in any way their workers on account of trade union membership or participation in lawful trade union activities.",1,1980,Honduras
92,".The Committee already examined these cases at several of its sessions, most recently in February , when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body. Since then, observations have been received from the Government in communications dated  April,  May and  September .
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Eight to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The dispute arose in the Bemis Handal textile plant in San Pedro Saul as a result of a collective bargaining disagreement. A strike followed on  March  and the workers occupied the plant. According to the complainants, when the workers had locked themselves in the authorities called in the police to break up the strike who, using firearms and tear gas, set fire to the plant and caused the death of several workers.
.The complainants alleged that the authorities arrested numerous workers, claiming that the trade union leaders were responsible for the fire. Also, in a letter dated  July  the WFTU supplied a list of  trade unionists and  professors who had allegedly been arrested for organising the strike at the Bemis Handal plant.
.The Government replied that the fire was deliberately started by the occupants with the intention of destroying the plant. It stated that the investigation concerning the fire led to the remand in custody of  persons on the order of the criminal judge for the purpose of his inquiry,  of whom were subsequently released on bail. The other persons under investigation were still detained in San Pedro Sula. The Government also confirmed the death of one worker, which it stated had bean caused by a . calibre weapon not used by the police force. It added that a judicial inquiry was under way.
.According to this information, the only persons still held in custody pending trial were Hector Hernndez, Jos A. Espinoza, Rigoberto Gutirrez, Edwin Salmn Caas, Oscar Enamorado and Tofilo Castro.
.At its March  Session, the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, requested the Government to provide the texts of the judgements and transmit its observations concerning the alleged detention of five trade unionists, namely, Juan Emilio Oliva, Alejandro Vallecillo, Herminio Deras, Pedro Brizuela and Victor Sabillon, listed in the WFTU's complaint and about whom no information had been supplied by the Government.
.In a telegram of  April , confirmed by a letter of  May , the Government replied that Juan Emilio Oliva, Alejandro Vallecillo, Herminio Deras, Pedro Brizuela and Victor Sabillon are no longer in prison. Pedro Brizuela, Herminio Deras and Juan Emilio Oliva have been released, no judicial or police procedure having been brought against them for reasons of health, Victor Sabillon Fernndez, a lawyer suspected of intellectual participation in the events, was never detained and has been able to continue his practice.
.The Government explains that the proceedings, because of the voluminous and complex nature of the case, are not yet concluded. It states that the persons still in prison have appointed their lawyers and that the judgement will take place according to law and older the Constitutional safeguards. In a telegram of  September, the Government announced that on  September  Messrs. Hernndez Morales, Salmon Caas, Enamorado, Gutirrez, Vallecillo and Castro have been released.
.With regard to the findings of the inquiry into the death of ore worker and the fire at the Bemis Handal plant, the Committee takes note of the Government's statement that seven persons who had been remanded in custody on the order of the criminal court were released on  September , four have been released on bail, no action has been brought against three and one was not detained and was able to continue his activities. The Committee notes however that Jos A. Espinoza has not yet been released and has not been tried.
.While taking note of the information supplied by the Government, the Committee recalls that trade union leaders were detained without trial since March , and that one of them is still in detection. In this correction, the Committee points out, as it has done on a number of previous occasions, that in all cases in which trade union leaders are held in custody without trial, these measures may involves a serious interference with the exercise of trade union rights, and the Committee has always emphasised the right of all detained persons to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment. Holding persons indefinitely in custody without trial on account of tea difficulty of securing evidence is a practice which involves the inherent danger of abuse and is subject to criticism.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(i) as regards the remand in custody since March  of Jos A. Espinoza, to draw the attention of the Government to the principles and considerations set forth by the Committee in the previous paragraph, especially the fact that such detention may involve a serious interference with the exercise of trade union rights;(ii) as regards the findings of the inquiry into the death of one worker and the fire at the Bemis Handal plant, to request the Government to provide the texts of the judgements and the reasons adduced therefore, as soon as the judgements have been delivered.
.Case No.  was examined by the Committee in May  when it submitted interim conclusions thereon, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session. The World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) presented allegations which were treated in Case No. , and the two cases together were considered by the Committee and further interim conclusions were submitted to the Governing Body which approved them at its th Session. The Government has submitted additional information in a letter dated  December .
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations arise, in part, from events which took place on  March  in the Bemis Handal textile plant in San Pedro Sula. According to the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the intervention of the police and security forces to break up the workers' strike and their occupation of the plant resulted in the burning down of the plant and the death of several workers. The WFTU provided a list of trade unionists and professors who had allegedly beau arrested for organising a strike in Honduras.
.In its previous replies, the Government stated that during the incidents on  March , the fire was deliberately started in the Bemis Handai undertaking by the occupants with the intention of destroying it. Investigations led to the detention of  persons who remained at the disposal of the criminal judge, and according to the Government's statements no account was taken of their trade union affiliation in the decision of this judge to detain them. The Government confirmed the death of one worker, indicating that he had been shot with a . calibre weapon not used by the public security forces and stated that judicial proceedings were underway into the death of this worker. In a later communication the Government stated that two of the persons detained had requested and been granted medical examinations which resulted in their release on bail, along with another detainee.
.At its November  Session, the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, requested the Government to provide the texts of the judgements and to transmit its observations about the WFTU complaint.
.In its letter of  December , the Government indicates that, on  December  two more of the persons detained, Messrs. Adalberto Crdova Turcios and Tmas Nativi, have also been released on bail following medical examinations. The other remaining persons under investigation for the events at the Bemis Handal plant are still detained in San Pedro Sula. Judicial proceedings concerning the eleven persons who had been arrested are still underway.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note the release on bail of two persons involved in the inquiry into the death of one worker and the fire at the Bemis Handal plant, to note that the criminal proceedings are still underway against the eleven who had been arrested, and to reiterate its request to the Government to provide the texts of the judgements and reasons adduced therefore, when available;(b) to reiterate its request to the Government to transmit its observations about the alleged detention of  trade unionists (namely, Messrs. Juan Emilio Oliva, Alejandro Vallecillo, Herminio Deras, Pedro Brizuela, and Victor Baillon) listed in the WFTU's complaint and concerning which no information has been supplied;(c) to take note of this interim report.
.Case No.  has been examined by the Committee in May  when it submitted interim conclusions thereon, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session, The World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), by letter dated",-1,1979,Honduras
93," July , presented further allegations (Case No. ). The Government provided additional information in two letters dated  May  and in letters dated  and  August .
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations arise, in part, from events which took place on  March  in .he Bemis Handal textile plant in San Pedro Sula. According to the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the intervention of the police and security forces to break up the workers' strike and their occupation of the plant resulted in the burning down of the plant and the death of several workers. Also according to the complainants, many workers were arrested. For its part, the WCL provided a list of  workers, members of the National Peasants' Union, who were said to be detained in various prisons in the country. The WFTU in its letter of  July  provides a list of  trade unionists and  professors who have been allegedly arrested for organising a strike in Honduras.
.The Government, in its previous replies, stated that during the incidents on  March , the fire was deliberately started in the Bemis Handal undertaking by the occupants with the intention of destroying this work centre. The authorities therefore immediately had undertaken investigations to find the authors of the arson and bring them to trial in order to determine their participation in the matter. These investigations led to the detention of  persons who remained at the disposal of the criminal judge. The Government stated that these arrests were carried out in the course of the judicial inquiry on the case and that no account had been taken of the eventual trade union affiliation of those concerned. The Government confirmed the death of one worker, indicating that he had been shot with a . calibre weapon not used by the public security forces. It also stated that judicial proceedings were underway into the death of this worker.
.The Committee noted that in view of the largely contradictory nature of the complainants' allegations and the Government's replies, it could not at that stage come to any conclusions in full knowledge of the facts. Nevertheless, it expressed its concern over the seriousness of the events resulting from the intervention of the police, and deplored the death of a worker, confirmed by the Government. It noted that the inquiries carried out concern the origin of the fire in the factory and the circumstances of the death of the worker, and asked the Government to provide information on the results of these inquiries, the texts of the judgements handed down and the reasons adduced therefore. The Committee also requested the Government to transmit its observations about the  agricultural trade unionists who were allegedly detained.,
.In its letters of  May , the Government indicates that of the  agricultural trade unionists named by the WCL,  had been arrested in connection with the investigation of various offences of attempted murder, robbery or theft, in , and were set free by the courts in April and May  because there was no sufficient reason to continue their detention. Two others, Messrs. Emilio Arguijo Mencias and Eleuterio Nolasco Varela, are still detained by order of the criminal court, charged with theft and damages punishable under the Penal Code; and one, Mr. Genaro Medina Varela, remains detained by order of the judge of Yoro, charged with arson. The judicial proceedings regarding these three persons are continuing in accordance with the penal procedures of the country. The Government indicates that it has no record of the other two persons mentioned by the WCL, Messrs. Asuncin Cruz Miranda and Venancio Ramirez, ever having been held in detention. Attached to one of the letters are statements from various judges confirming the situation of the detainees. The Government adds that agricultural workers in the country enjoy the same rights and guarantees as do other citizens and it stresses that social justice can only be built on a democratic base.
.The Government, in its letters of  and  August , supplies information on the results of the inquiry into the death of one worker and the fire at the Bemis Handal plant. It states that on  March ,  men (whose names are given) were ordered to be held in preventive detention for these offences in accordance with the law. Two of them, Messrs. Antonio de Jests Hernndez Mendoza and Jorge Rodriguez Calderon, leaders of the Honduras General Central of Workers, appealed against this decision before the Appeal Court which, on  July , confirmed it. However, they requested and were granted medical examinations which resulted in their release on bail, on  July . The Government provides a photocopy of the judicial order setting them free, along with Luis Adolfo Portillo who was involved in the same affair.
.The Government states that the judicial inquiry is continuing as regards the  accused, and that at this stage it cannot supply any information or judicial decisions.
.Regarding the list of  trade unionists and  professors whose detention had been alleged by the WFTU, the Government states that  of them were amongst those detained on  March  for their involvement in the incidents at the Bemis Handal plant. Amongst them are Messrs. Antonio de Jests Hernndez Mendoza and Jorge Rodriguez Caldern who were set free on bail as indicated above.
.In its letter of  August , the Government stresses that there is in Honduras a well-organised, strong and independent trade union movement, led for the most part by people who have acquired much experience in trade union matters. Nevertheless, it points out, some union leaders carry out activities which are punishable under criminal law, and the Government does not accept the notion that their status as trade union leaders excuses them from criminal responsibility. It states that this is the case in the proceedings arising from the events which took place at the Bemis Handal plant.
.The Committee notes the information supplied by the Government.
.Regarding the WCL's allegation that  agricultural trade unionists were detained in various prisons in the country, the Committee notes the Government's statement and supporting information to the effect that these persons were arrested for suspected criminal offences. It also notes that, in support of their allegation, the complainants have presented no information indicating that they had been detained for their trade union activities. In these circumstances, the Committee considers that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.
.As regards the results of the inquiry into the death of one worker and the fire during the incidents at the Bemis Handal plant, the Committee takes note of the Government's statements that  workers were ordered to be held in preventive detention on  March  by the criminal court judge and that  of them were released on bail pending trial. The Committee hopes that the text of the judgements will be provided in due course, as previously requested.
.The Committee also notes that the Government has not provided information on  of the  persons listed in the WFTU's complaint, namely, Messrs. Juan Emilio Oliva, treasurer of a trade union organisation, Alejandro Vallecillo, trade union delegate and member of a strike Committee, Professor Herminio Deras, Pedro Brizuela, trade union counsellor, and Professor Victor Baillon.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the detention of  agricultural trade unionists:(i) to note that according to the information provided by the Government, these persons were accused of criminal offences and brought before the courts, which released  of them;(ii) also noting that the complainant did not supply particulars in support of its allegation, to decide that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination;(b) as regards the results of the inquiry into the death of one worker and the fire at the Bemis Handal plant, to note that the criminal proceedings are still underway and request the Government to provide the texts of the judgements and the reasons adduced therefore, when they are available;(c) to request the Government to transmit its observations about the alleged detention of five other trade unionists listed in paragraph  above;(d) to take note of this interim report.",-1,1979,Honduras

Pedro Brizuela, Herminio Deras and Juan Emilio Oliva have been released, no judicial or police procedure having been brought against them for reasons of health, Victor Sabillon Fernndez, a lawyer suspected of intellectual participation in the events, was never detained and has been able to continue his practice.
.The Government explains that the proceedings, because of the voluminous and complex nature of the case, are not yet concluded. It states that the persons still in prison have appointed their lawyers and that the judgement will take place according to law and older the Constitutional safeguards. In a telegram of  September, the Government announced that on  September  Messrs. Hernndez Morales, Salmon Caas, Enamorado, Gutirrez, Vallecillo and Castro have been released.
.With regard to the findings of the inquiry into the death of ore worker and the fire at the Bemis Handal plant, the Committee takes note of the Government's statement that seven persons who had been remanded in custody on the order of the criminal court were released on  September , four have been released on bail, no action has been brought against three and one was not detained and was able to continue his activities. The Committee notes however that Jos A. Espinoza has not yet been released and has not been tried.
.While taking note of the information supplied by the Government, the Committee recalls that trade union leaders were detained without trial since March , and that one of them is still in detection. In this correction, the Committee points out, as it has done on a number of previous occasions, that in all cases in which trade union leaders are held in custody without trial, these measures may involves a serious interference with the exercise of trade union rights, and the Committee has always emphasised the right of all detained persons to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment. Holding persons indefinitely in custody without trial on account of tea difficulty of securing evidence is a practice which involves the inherent danger of abuse and is subject to criticism.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(i) as regards the remand in custody since March  of Jos A. Espinoza, to draw the attention of the Government to the principles and considerations set forth by the Committee in the previous paragraph, especially the fact that such detention may involve a serious interference with the exercise of trade union rights;(ii) as regards the findings of the inquiry into the death of one worker and the fire at the Bemis Handal plant, to request the Government to provide the texts of the judgements and the reasons adduced therefore, as soon as the judgements have been delivered.
.Case No.  was examined by the Committee in May  when it submitted interim conclusions thereon, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session. The World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) presented allegations which were treated in Case No. , and the two cases together were considered by the Committee and further interim conclusions were submitted to the Governing Body which approved them at its th Session. The Government has submitted additional information in a letter dated  December .
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations arise, in part, from events which took place on  March  in the Bemis Handal textile plant in San Pedro Sula. According to the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the intervention of the police and security forces to break up the workers' strike and their occupation of the plant resulted in the burning down of the plant and the death of several workers. The WFTU provided a list of trade unionists and professors who had allegedly beau arrested for organising a strike in Honduras.
.In its previous replies, the Government stated that during the incidents on  March , the fire was deliberately started in the Bemis Handai undertaking by the occupants with the intention of destroying it. Investigations led to the detention of  persons who remained at the disposal of the criminal judge, and according to the Government's statements no account was taken of their trade union affiliation in the decision of this judge to detain them. The Government confirmed the death of one worker, indicating that he had been shot with a . calibre weapon not used by the public security forces and stated that judicial proceedings were underway into the death of this worker. In a later communication the Government stated that two of the persons detained had requested and been granted medical examinations which resulted in their release on bail, along with another detainee.
.At its November  Session, the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, requested the Government to provide the texts of the judgements and to transmit its observations about the WFTU complaint.
.In its letter of  December , the Government indicates that, on  December  two more of the persons detained, Messrs. Adalberto Crdova Turcios and Tmas Nativi, have also been released on bail following medical examinations. The other remaining persons under investigation for the events at the Bemis Handal plant are still detained in San Pedro Sula. Judicial proceedings concerning the eleven persons who had been arrested are still underway.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note the release on bail of two persons involved in the inquiry into the death of one worker and the fire at the Bemis Handal plant, to note that the criminal proceedings are still underway against the eleven who had been arrested, and to reiterate its request to the Government to provide the texts of the judgements and reasons adduced therefore, when available;(b) to reiterate its request to the Government to transmit its observations about the alleged detention of  trade unionists (namely, Messrs. Juan Emilio Oliva, Alejandro Vallecillo, Herminio Deras, Pedro Brizuela, and Victor Baillon) listed in the WFTU's complaint and concerning which no information has been supplied;(c) to take note of this interim report.
.Case No.  has been examined by the Committee in May  when it submitted interim conclusions thereon, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session, The World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), by letter dated",-1,1979,Honduras
95," July , presented further allegations (Case No. ). The Government provided additional information in two letters dated  May  and in letters dated  and  August .
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations arise, in part, from events which took place on  March  in .he Bemis Handal textile plant in San Pedro Sula. According to the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the intervention of the police and security forces to break up the workers' strike and their occupation of the plant resulted in the burning down of the plant and the death of several workers. Also according to the complainants, many workers were arrested. For its part, the WCL provided a list of  workers, members of the National Peasants' Union, who were said to be detained in various prisons in the country. The WFTU in its letter of  July  provides a list of  trade unionists and  professors who have been allegedly arrested for organising a strike in Honduras.
.The Government, in its previous replies, stated that during the incidents on  March , the fire was deliberately started in the Bemis Handal undertaking by the occupants with the intention of destroying this work centre. The authorities therefore immediately had undertaken investigations to find the authors of the arson and bring them to trial in order to determine their participation in the matter. These investigations led to the detention of  persons who remained at the disposal of the criminal judge. The Government stated that these arrests were carried out in the course of the judicial inquiry on the case and that no account had been taken of the eventual trade union affiliation of those concerned. The Government confirmed the death of one worker, indicating that he had been shot with a . calibre weapon not used by the public security forces. It also stated that judicial proceedings were underway into the death of this worker.
.The Committee noted that in view of the largely contradictory nature of the complainants' allegations and the Government's replies, it could not at that stage come to any conclusions in full knowledge of the facts. Nevertheless, it expressed its concern over the seriousness of the events resulting from the intervention of the police, and deplored the death of a worker, confirmed by the Government. It noted that the inquiries carried out concern the origin of the fire in the factory and the circumstances of the death of the worker, and asked the Government to provide information on the results of these inquiries, the texts of the judgements handed down and the reasons adduced therefore. The Committee also requested the Government to transmit its observations about the  agricultural trade unionists who were allegedly detained.,
.In its letters of  May , the Government indicates that of the  agricultural trade unionists named by the WCL,  had been arrested in connection with the investigation of various offences of attempted murder, robbery or theft, in , and were set free by the courts in April and May  because there was no sufficient reason to continue their detention. Two others, Messrs. Emilio Arguijo Mencias and Eleuterio Nolasco Varela, are still detained by order of the criminal court, charged with theft and damages punishable under the Penal Code; and one, Mr. Genaro Medina Varela, remains detained by order of the judge of Yoro, charged with arson. The judicial proceedings regarding these three persons are continuing in accordance with the penal procedures of the country. The Government indicates that it has no record of the other two persons mentioned by the WCL, Messrs. Asuncin Cruz Miranda and Venancio Ramirez, ever having been held in detention. Attached to one of the letters are statements from various judges confirming the situation of the detainees. The Government adds that agricultural workers in the country enjoy the same rights and guarantees as do other citizens and it stresses that social justice can only be built on a democratic base.
.The Government, in its letters of  and  August , supplies information on the results of the inquiry into the death of one worker and the fire at the Bemis Handal plant. It states that on  March ,  men (whose names are given) were ordered to be held in preventive detention for these offences in accordance with the law. Two of them, Messrs. Antonio de Jests Hernndez Mendoza and Jorge Rodriguez Calderon, leaders of the Honduras General Central of Workers, appealed against this decision before the Appeal Court which, on  July , confirmed it. However, they requested and were granted medical examinations which resulted in their release on bail, on  July . The Government provides a photocopy of the judicial order setting them free, along with Luis Adolfo Portillo who was involved in the same affair.
.The Government states that the judicial inquiry is continuing as regards the  accused, and that at this stage it cannot supply any information or judicial decisions.
.Regarding the list of  trade unionists and  professors whose detention had been alleged by the WFTU, the Government states that  of them were amongst those detained on  March  for their involvement in the incidents at the Bemis Handal plant. Amongst them are Messrs. Antonio de Jests Hernndez Mendoza and Jorge Rodriguez Caldern who were set free on bail as indicated above.
.In its letter of  August , the Government stresses that there is in Honduras a well-organised, strong and independent trade union movement, led for the most part by people who have acquired much experience in trade union matters. Nevertheless, it points out, some union leaders carry out activities which are punishable under criminal law, and the Government does not accept the notion that their status as trade union leaders excuses them from criminal responsibility. It states that this is the case in the proceedings arising from the events which took place at the Bemis Handal plant.
.The Committee notes the information supplied by the Government.
.Regarding the WCL's allegation that  agricultural trade unionists were detained in various prisons in the country, the Committee notes the Government's statement and supporting information to the effect that these persons were arrested for suspected criminal offences. It also notes that, in support of their allegation, the complainants have presented no information indicating that they had been detained for their trade union activities. In these circumstances, the Committee considers that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.
.As regards the results of the inquiry into the death of one worker and the fire during the incidents at the Bemis Handal plant, the Committee takes note of the Government's statements that  workers were ordered to be held in preventive detention on  March  by the criminal court judge and that  of them were released on bail pending trial. The Committee hopes that the text of the judgements will be provided in due course, as previously requested.
.The Committee also notes that the Government has not provided information on  of the  persons listed in the WFTU's complaint, namely, Messrs. Juan Emilio Oliva, treasurer of a trade union organisation, Alejandro Vallecillo, trade union delegate and member of a strike Committee, Professor Herminio Deras, Pedro Brizuela, trade union counsellor, and Professor Victor Baillon.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the detention of  agricultural trade unionists:(i) to note that according to the information provided by the Government, these persons were accused of criminal offences and brought before the courts, which released  of them;(ii) also noting that the complainant did not supply particulars in support of its allegation, to decide that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination;(b) as regards the results of the inquiry into the death of one worker and the fire at the Bemis Handal plant, to note that the criminal proceedings are still underway and request the Government to provide the texts of the judgements and the reasons adduced therefore, when they are available;(c) to request the Government to transmit its observations about the alleged detention of five other trade unionists listed in paragraph  above;(d) to take note of this interim report.
.By communications dated  and  March and  April  respectively, the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) presented allegations of violations of trade union rights in Honduras. The ICFTU supplied additional information in support of its complaint on  April . On its part, the WCL sent a new communication to the ILO on  April . The Government made its observations in communications dated  April and  and  May .
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom",-1,1979,Honduras
96,"of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants refer to events which took place on  March  in the Bemis Handal textile plant in the town of San Pedro Sula. They explain that the workers in that undertaking had submitted petitions of demands to the management and that the latter had reacted in an equivocal manner and finally refused to bargain. Faced with this refusal, the workers went on strike and occupied the plant on  March declaring that they would not leave until the management agreed to negotiate.
.The complainants add that in order to remove the occupiers the authorities acted brutally by having the public security forces intervene as well as the National Department of Investigations who used weapons and tear gas which, according to the ICFTU, caused the burning down of the factory. The WCL and the ICFTU point out that the authorities have tried to attribute the responsibility for the fire to the trade union leaders and their organisations.
.The CLAT and the WCL indicate that the intervention by the authorities brought about, the death of four workers. According to the ICFTU three workers were killed. A large number of workers were wounded and over  were arrested. In noting these events, the ICFTU mentions a statement by the ""Chief of the Homicide Division"" of the National Department of Investigations, according to which an inquiry was under way to discover whether the fire had been caused by people outside the workers' organisation. Moreover, the Vice-Chancellor of the Autonomous National University of Honduras is said to have stated that there could have been a mistake regarding this matter.
.In its communication of  April , the WCL gives a list of  workers, members of the National Peasants' Union, who are said to be detained in various prisons in the country.
.In its communication of  April , the Government states that the fire in the Bemis Handal undertaking was no accident. It had been intentionally caused with a view to completely destroying this work centre. The authorities therefore immediately undertook investigations to find the authors of the arson and bring them to trial in order to determine their participation in the matter.
.The Government explains that on  June , when the collective agreement, signed for a duration of three years, had been in force for a year and a half, the workers' union in the Bemis Handal undertaking presented demands to the management for a revision of salaries. On  June , the undertaking responded by pointing out that changes in salaries were provided for in the collective agreement. On  September , the union leadership approached the General Inspection of Labour denouncing the violation of many clauses in the collective agreement. Despite a thorough investigation by the labour inspectors, the existence of the alleged infringements could not be established.
.On  February , representatives of the undertaking and the trade union met at San Pedro Sula in the presence of the Regional Labour Director to discuss the points at issue. According to the Government, there was apparently a willingness to arrive at a long-term agreement. Thus  of the  points raised in the petition were resolved, leaving only one outstanding.
.However, the Government adds, on  March  the union set in motion a work stoppage with occupation of the plant which made any activity impossible. The Regional Labour Director met with the trade union leaders in an effort to resolve the dispute, and then with the legal representative of the undertaking, with whom he discussed the different points at issue. However, all these efforts were in vain since the said government official personally witnessed the acts of violence carried out by the workers, which finally resulted in the fire totally destroying the workplace.
.Police investigations carried out to discover those responsible led to the arrest of  persons suspected of having some responsibility in the fire. Amongst these persons were workers from the factory and from other workplaces, as well as some people arrested on the spot without being able to justify their presence inside the factory. These arrests were carried out in the course of the judicial inquiry on the case and no account was taken of the eventual trade union affiliation of those concerned.
.As the police inquiry and judicial proceedings progressed,  persons were released because there was no reason for prolonging their detention. The  persons still in detention are at the disposal of the criminal judge.
.The Government refers to statements by trade union leaders and organisations on the events in the Bemis Handal undertaking of which one, made by the Authentic Trade Onion Federation of Honduras, of the Christian-Democrat tendency, states that people from outside the trade union movement had penetrated different organisations with a view to creating a climate of insecurity for the workers and, therefore for the people of Honduras.
.Annexed to its letter, the Government communicates several press clippings as well as the Regional Labour Director's report on the events in question.
.In its communications of  and  May , the Government states that when the fire was started in the factory, the latter was entirely under the workers' control since they had shut all the access doors and prevented the labour authorities, the police and the management from entering. Regarding the allegations on the death of four workers, the Government states that during the first inquiries on the spot the body of a male person was discovered, who was identified as a worker in the undertaking and who bore a bullet wound from a . caliber weapon, i.e. a caliber which is never used by the public security forces. These investigations did not allow the discovery of other bodies, nor did they prove the existence of wounded workers. The Government states that the judicial proceedings under way cover both the fire at the factory and the death of the worker in question.
.The Committee notes that the allegations mainly concern the events that took place in March  at the Bemis Handal undertaking. These events took place during a strike action started by the workers which involved occupation of the premises. Then the police force intervened to evacuate the factory and at this point serious incidents broke out which led to the burning down of the factory, the death of a worker and the arrest of  persons.
.The Committee must point out that the information supplied by the complainants and by the Government on the origins of the dispute and the run of events are largely contradictory. According to the complainants, the employer refused to negotiate with the workers and the destruction of the factory was caused by the intervention of the police. On the other hand, according to the Government, the labour dispute was the object of negotiations with the participation of the labour inspection and the fire was brought on by the acts of violence of the workers and of those people foreign to the undertaking who were on the premises.
.Faced with these two contradictory versions, the Committee cannot at this stage come to any conclusions in full knowledge of the facts. Nevertheless, it must express its concern over the seriousness of events that took place after the intervention of the police. The Committee deplores the death of a worker, confirmed by the Government. It notes that the inquiries/ carried out concern the origin of the fire that took place in the factory and the circumstances of the death of the worker. So as to be able to formulate its Conclusions on this aspect of the case, the Committee would like to have at its disposal the results of the inquiry carried out on this death.
.The Committee notes that the judicial proceedings undertaken by the authorities have resulted in the continuing detention of  out of  arrested persons. From the Government's observations it appears that these  persons are going to be tried. The Committee considers that, in the present case, it would be particularly useful for it to have at its disposal information on the outcome of the judicial action undertaken and, in particular, the texts of the judgements handed down and the reasons adduced therefor.
.Finally, the Committee notes that the Government has not yet sent its observations concerning the list of agricultural trade unionists who, according to the WCL, have been detained.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to express its concern about the serious events which took place after the intervention of the police at the Bemis Handal undertaking;(b) to request the Government to supply information on the results of the inquiry into the death of one worker;(c) to note that the  people still detained appear to be subject to trial, to request the Government to supply information on the result of the judicial proceedings undertaken and, in particular, the texts of the judgements and the reasons adduced therefor;(d) to also request the Government to transmit",-1,1979,Honduras
97,"its observations about the agricultural trade unionists who, according to the WCL, are detained;(e) to take note of this interim report.Geneva,  May  (signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.",-1,1979,Honduras
98,".The Committee has already examined this case, at its February and May  sessions, when it presented an interim report to the Governing Body. The Government has since sent information in a communication dated  August .
.The allegations still outstanding in the present case relate to incidents which occurred at the Sula dairies. According to the complainant organisation the management dismissed the members of the union's executive and contrived, in the course of a manipulated meeting, to secure the appointment of a new executive, made up of persons whom the employer had won over.
.In its communication of  August  the Government states that in November  the manager of the undertaking concerned dismissed Manuel de Jess Zepeda Lobo, Victoriano Quintanilla, Orlando Venegas C, Irene Amaya Alvarado, Hctor Alberto Portillo and Ofelia Amador Rico, all of whom were officials of the trade union of the workers of the undertaking. In the manager's opinion these persons had committed misdemeanours which constituted grounds for dismissal under the labour legislation of Honduras.
.The Ministry of Labour, which considered that these dismissals were in flagrant violation of the legislation, demanded the reinstatement of the dismissed trade union officials through the intermediary of the Under-Secretary of State and General Director of Labour. On  November , continues the Government, the manager of the undertaking agreed to reinstate the persons concerned immediately, maintaining their grade and paying them arrears of wages.
.Subsequently, in February, April and May , five of the six trade unionists who had been dismissed resigned from their jobs in the undertaking and hence from trade union office. The Government attaches to its communication copies of the letters of resignation of the persons concerned and receipts for the indemnities which they received.
.Following these resignations, elections were held in the presence of a notary for the appointment of new leaders. Two of the workers who had resigned were confirmed in their office of controller and treasurer of the union.
.The Committee notes that the allegations referred to the dismissal of trade union officials in the Sula dairy undertaking and to manoeuvres in which the management is said to have engaged in order to organise the election of a new executive.
.As regards the dismissal of the trade union officials, it appears from the information supplied by the Government that the Ministry of Labour, considering that these measures were unlawful, intervened with the management of the undertaking and caused it to reinstate the persons who had been dismissed. The Committee notes in this connection that the Honduras Labour Code contains certain provisions which prohibit the unjustified dismissal of trade union officials. In particular, under section  of the Code, it is unlawful to dismiss from his employment any worker who is a member of a managing Committee of a union, at any time from the date of his election until the end of the six months after he ceases to hold office, unless evidence is first submitted to the competent judge showing that there is lawful cause for terminating his contract of employment.
.As regards the convening of an assembly to elect a new executive, the Committee notes that this election was made necessary by the resignation from their employment in the undertaking of five of the six officials who had previously been dismissed and subsequently reinstated. Most of the texts of the letters of resignation, which the Government attaches to its observations, mention that the decision to leave the undertaking was taken voluntarily by the persons concerned. Elections were held to fill the vacancies which had arisen in the trade union executive, apparently in conformity with the normal procedure provided for under the Labour Code. Moreover, it appears that two of the former trade union officials who had resigned were confirmed in their office.
.The Committee has already examined this case at its February  Session, when it presented an interim report to the Governing Body. Since then, two communications have been received from the Government, one dated  January  (received on  May ) and the other dated  March .
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations related, first of all, to the arrest of Pedro Antonio Brizuela, a trade union leader from San Pedro Sula, who was an active trade unionist belonging to the group of unions known as ""dissidents"" and adviser to a large number of unions in the region. He thus had connections with the Union of Workers in the National Construction Industry and the Union of Workers in the Drink and Related Industries. The complainants stated that they were convinced that the person concerned was being harassed, at the instigation of the employers, by minor officials because of his trade union views. He was charged with conspiring against the Government, which, according to the complainants, was an entirely unjustified accusation.
.The allegations also concern events that occurred in the Sula dairies: according to the complainant organisation, the management dismissed the members of the union's executive and contrived, in the course of a manipulated meeting, to secure the appointment of a new executive, made up of persons whom the employer had won over.
.No communication had been received from the Government at the time when the case was examined by the Committee at its February  session. In these circumstances, the Governing Body decided, on the recommendation of the Committee:(a) to regret that, in the absence of any reply from the Government, the Committee was unable to examine the views of the Government on this matter;(b) to draw the Government's attention to various principles and considerations with regard to the detention of trade unionists and protection against anti-trade union practices;(c) to urge the Government to communicate its observations in the near future on the various points raised in the complaint.
.In its communication of  January  received on  May  the Government states that for the purpose of investigating political movements whose activities were prejudicial to the security of the State, the trade union leader Pedro Brizuela was arrested on  October  and released a few hours later. The Government states that the arrest was motivated by purely political considerations which were unconnected with labour problems. The Government stresses that at all times Mr. Brizuela had enjoyed complete freedom to carry out his trade union activities.
.The Government attaches some press cuttings to its communication of  March , one of which concerns the arrest of Pedro Brizuela.
.The Committee notes the information supplied by the Government, in particular the statement that the trade union leader Pedro Brizuela was released a few hours after his arrest. The Committee must, however, note that the Government attributes the arrest to political grounds without specifying the facts imputable to the person concerned. In this connection, the Committee wishes to point out that the detention of trade unionists concerning whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found is liable to involve restrictions on trade union rights, and that governments should take steps to ensure that the authorities concerned have instructions appropriate to eliminate the danger of detention for trade union activities.
.Finally, the Committee notes that the Government has not sent observations regarding the allegations relating to the dismissal of the members of the executive of the trade union of the Sula dairies and the election of a new executive. The Committee observes that the Labour Code of Honduras contains certain provisions which prohibit the unjustified dismissal of trade union leaders but it considers that it is necessary for it to have at its disposal the observations of the Government on these allegations in order to be able to examine them with full knowledge of the facts.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note that Pedro Brizuela was released shortly after his arrest but to draw the attention of the Government to the principles and considerations set forth in paragraph  above regarding the arrest of trade unionists;(b) to request the Government to send its observations regarding the allegations concerning the dismissal of the leaders of the union of the Sula dairies and the election of a new executive;(c) to take note of the present interim report.
.The complaint of the Trade Union Unity Committee of the Workers of Central America and Panama is contained in a letter of  November  which was transmitted to the Government by letter of  December  for its observations on the allegations contained therein. Despite repeated requests, the Government has sent no reply. In May , the Committee had appealed to the Government to send its observations urgently. In November , moreover, the Government was informed that, in accordance with established procedure, at its following session the Committee might submit a report on the substance of the matter even if the information awaited had still not been received.
.Since there has still been no reply from the Government, the Committee considers it necessary, before examining the allegations, to recall",-1,1977,Honduras
99,"the considerations it set forth in its First Report and which it has subsequently repeated on many occasions: the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and the Committee is confident that, if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side will recognise the importance for the protection of their own good name of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to such detailed factual charges as may be put forward.
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations relate, first of all, to the arrest of Pedro Antonio Brizuela, a trade union leader from San Pedro Sula, who is an active trade unionist belonging to the group of unions known as ""dissidents"" and adviser to a large number of unions in the region. He thus has connections with the Union of Workers in the National Construction Industry and the Union of Workers in the Drink and Related Industries. The complainants state that they are convinced that the person concerned is being harassed, at the instigation of the employers, by minor officials because of his trade union views. He is charged with conspiring against the Government which, according to the complainants, is an entirely unjustified accusation.
.The allegations also concern events that occurred in the Sula Dairies: according to the complainant organisation, the management dismissed the members of the union's executive and contrived, in the course of a manipulated meeting, to secure the appointment of a new executive, made up of persons whom the employer had won over.
.As regards the first of these allegations, the Committee has no information from the Government confirming or denying that Mr. Brizuela has been arrested and, if appropriate, giving the reasons for this measure. In dealing with complaints concerning the arrest of trade unionists, the Committee has always emphasised the importance it has attached to the principle of prompt and fair trial by an independent and impartial judiciary in all cases, including cases in which the trade unionists are charged with political or criminal offences which the government considers have no relation to their trade union functions. The Committee has also made a point of ascertaining the reasons for the detention in order to make sure that these have no connection with the trade union membership or activities of the persons being detained. To this end, it has followed the rule that the governments concerned should be requested to submit as precise information as possible concerning the facts held against the persons detained.
.As regards the alleged anti-trade union practices, the Committee wishes to recall the provision of Articles  and  of Convention No. , which has been ratified by Honduras. Article  provides that workers shall enjoy adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment. Trade union leaders are particularly in need of protection since the nature of their functions renders them more vulnerable than other people to such acts. Article  of the same Convention provides that workers' organisations, likewise, shall enjoy adequate protection against any acts of interference by employers (or employers' associations) in their establishment, functioning or administration.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to regret that in the absence of any reply from the Government, the Committee is unable to examine the views of the Government on this matter;(b) to draw the Government's attention to the principles and considerations set out in the preceding paragraphs with regard to the detention of trade unionists and protection against anti-trade union practices;(c) to urge the Government to communicate its observations in the near future on the various points raised in the complaint, and(d) to take note of the present interim report.",1,1977,Honduras
100,".In a communication of  July , the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) presented a complaint containing allegations of violations of trade union rights in Honduras.
.The text of the communication was transmitted to the Government, which sent its observations in a communication dated  October .
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication the WFTU protested against what it regarded as the arbitrary dismissal of over  workers and a group of trade union leaders elected by the members of the National Union of Workers of the National Agrarian Institute.
.The Government attached to its communication a document prepared by the National Agrarian Institute concerning the allegation.
.In this document it is stated that, in order to meet the targets set by the Government for the implementation of agrarian reform, the National Agrarian Institute made a study for the purpose of reorganising its structure, and adopted Resolution No.  of  March , the preamble to which is quoted in the document. In particular, the preamble indicates that:- in accordance with section , clause , of the Labour Code, employers may make reductions in staff in accordance with the stipulations of the collective agreement, which in the present case establishes an order of priority subject to modification where the exigencies of the service require the employment of workers possessing certain levels of skill, experience and honesty;- in accordance with section  of the Labour Code, notice of any change in the membership of the managing Committee of a trade union shall be given to the Ministry of Labour and Social welfare, and no change shall be effective unless this requirement has been observed. In the present instance this obligation was not met when the managing Committee of the National Union of Workers of the National Agrarian Institute was elected on  April ;- in accordance with section  of the Agrarian Reform Act the Executive Director of the Institute is responsible for the appointment, transfer, promotion, suspension or dismissal of officials and employees of the Institute in accordance with the legal provisions; and- in accordance with sections  and  of the Labour Code, where a contract is made for an unspecified period, either of the parties may terminate it by giving notice to the other party or by paying an equivalent amount.
.In the studies undertaken by the Institute prior to the decision to terminate the contracts of employment, the amount of savings that would be effected was based on a  per cent reduction in the number of staff.
.According to the document furnished by the Institute, the provisions of the collective agreement in force were respected. It was also stated that no union leader had had his contract terminated in accordance with the legal provisions. As the only legally registered management Committee had held office between July  and July  and none of its workers had been dismissed, the National Union of Workers of the National Agrarian Institute had had no legally registered management Committee since July .
.Finally, it is stated in the report that all the workers affected by the reorganisation of the Institute have received the benefits legally due to them, and the situation has so far given rise to no complaints.
.The Committee notes that the case concerns measures of dismissal affecting workers of the National Agrarian Institute and in particular the leaders of the National Union of workers of this body, whose election, according to the Government, was not registered with the Ministry of Labour.
.The Committee has always taken the view that one of the fundamental principles of freedom of association is that workers should enjoy adequate protection against all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment, and that this protection is particularly desirable in the case of trade union officials. However, the principle that a worker or a union leader may not suffer prejudice by reason of his union activities does not necessarily imply that the fact that a person holds a trade union office confers on him immunity against dismissal irrespective of the circumstances.
.In the present case it would appear that the dismissals were part of a reorganisation of the National Agrarian Institute. Furthermore, the relative provisions of the collective agreement appear to have been respected and no complaints have been submitted at the national level.
.Finally, the Committee considers that the complaint is couched in very general terms which do not enable it to reach a conclusion as to whether the dismissals constituted acts of antiunion discrimination.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that the case calls for no further examination on its part.",1,1976,Honduras
101,".The Committee last examined this case at its session in November  when it submitted an interim report (contained in paragraphs  to  of its rd Report) to the Governing Body.
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The WCL had alleged that the Honduras army attacked the institute of the trade union federations in the Department of Olancho, killing five persons and injuring several. It had also alleged that all officers of the General Central of Workers had been arrested and that the Government was endeavouring to destroy the National Peasants' Union (a body affiliated to the WCL and the Latin American Workers' Confederation),  militant members of which were in prison. According to the complainants, , peasants marched on the capital to protest against the infringements of fundamental rights and freedom of association.
.The Latin American Federation of Peasants (FCL) claimed that the Government had massacred peasants in the Department of Olancho and that the military forces had occupied all headquarters of the National Peasants' Union and the General Central of Workers, arresting all their leaders. In other communications, the FCL stated that these events were the outcome of various problems which had been accumulating and which had remained unresolved over the years. It recalled the tragic events of  and stated that the persons responsible were the same as those who were responsible then (who maintain paramilitary organisations). The National Peasants' Union, added the complainants, had always maintained a positive attitude to these questions which remained unsolved despite numerous agreements with the Government. The FCL appended to its letters a large volume of documents relating in particular to the agrarian reforms demanded by the National Peasants' Union, to that body's meetings with the authorities and the results of the meetings, and to the dispute which had arisen. They included a partial list of the detainees.
.The Government had stated in its original reply that the allegations did not accurately reflect the events. It stated that a high-level military commission had been instructed to inquire into the events of  June . Certain persons (both civilian and military) who were suspected of being implicated in the events had been remanded in custody and held at the disposal of the competent courts. The Government also stated that the temporary occupation of the offices of the National Peasants' Union and the General Central of Workers had been decided upon in order to avoid a worse situation. These offices were returned to the organisations and the leaders, arrested as a precaution, were now free. The Government added that it would severely punish the persons responsible, without distinction.
.The Committee, taking the view that it did not have at its disposal sufficient information on which to reach a decision on these events at that stage, noted that the occupied trade union premises had been evacuated and that the arrested trade union leaders had been released. It requested the Government to provide detailed information on the results of the inquiry which was to be carried out by the military commission regarding the violence in the Department of Olancho.
.By two communications dated  January and  February , the Government transmitted additional information with regard to the complaint.
.The Government confirms that no trade unionists are being held in detention and that the persons responsible for the events which took place in the Department of Olancho are being dealt with by the competent courts.
.In addition, the Government transmits a copy of a text which it has sent to the Secretary-General of the United Nations in reply to a complaint against the Government of Honduras submitted to the Commission on Human Rights by the World Federation of Rural Workers concerning these events. From this text, the Committee notes that a commission of Inquiry was appointed by the Government to investigate the matter. When the detailed report of that Commission was issued the authorities ordered that charges be brought against those persons, whether civilian or military, who had been responsible for the above events. These persons were being held at the Central Prison and would be tried in accordance with the law. The events at Olancho, states the Government, occurred without the knowledge of the higher authorities of Honduras.
.The Government also states that the Secretary of Labour and Social Welfare has been instructed to carry out a full inquiry as to the measure of protection afforded by the law - and especially the Law on Agrarian Reform - to workers and peasants. In fact, through, the National Agrarian Institute, agreements have been reached with the peasant families concerning the lands in question which have been assigned to them legally.
.The Government appends to its communication the text of the order given to the Attorney General to take appropriate and speedy action to bring to justice the persons responsible for the events in the Department of Olancho in which a number of persons, including two women and two priests, lost their lives. The Government also appends to its communication a notice from the Director of the Central Prison in which several persons are named as being held in this connection.
.From the information at its disposal, the Committee notes that a Government inquiry into the serious events which took place in the Department of Olancho in June  has led to the arrest of a number of persons, both civilian and military, who were responsible for these events. It would also seem clear that the issues which culminated in the disturbances in Olancho related more particularly to questions of land tenure and agrarian reform. However, the Committee cannot overlook the fact that these disturbances led to the death of a number of peasants as well as to the occupation of trade union premises and the arrest of trade union leaders. The Committee notes the Government's statement that these premises have been evacuated and that the trade union leaders have all been released. In taking note of this information, the Committee would point out that the arrest of trade unionists against whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found is liable to involve restrictions on trade union rights, and that governments should take steps to ensure that the authorities concerned have instructions appropriate to eliminate the danger of detention for trade union activities.
.In all the circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note the confirmation given by the Government that no trade unionists are being detained and to draw the attention of the Government to the principle expressed in the preceding paragraph regarding the arrest of trade unionists;(b) to note that the persons responsible for the events referred to by the complainants have been arrested and will be brought to trial and to request the text of the judgments pronounced in these cases; and(c) subject to the above, to decide that, for the reasons indicated in paragraph  above, the case does not call for further examination on its part.
.The complaints were submitted in two communications of  June , one from the World Confederation of Labour and the other from the Latin American Federation of Peasants (FCL). The FCL submitted additional information in communications of  and  July . The Government submitted its observations by communications of  and  August .
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).

103,".When this case came before it at its meeting in November , the Committee decided to postpone consideration of it and asked the Director-General to secure additional information from both the complainants and the Government.
.The complaint was made in a letter dated  March  from the world Confederation of Labour to the Director-General. In two other communications, one dated  November  and the other  March , the World Confederation of Labour provided further information in support of the complaint.
.In two letters, one dated  May  and the other  December , the Government transmitted its comments.
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its letter dated  March , the World Confederation of Labour alleged that on  February  five peasants were killed when the Special Security Force opened fire on them as they were peacefully tilling the land belonging to the Peasants' League of Talanquera, in the township of Juticalpa (Department of Olancho). Five others were seriously wounded. According to the complainants, the order to open fire had been given by the head of the local Special Security Force, under pressure from the landowners.
.In its communication dated  May , the Government did not deny that peasants had lost their lives in the shooting - in fact, six peasants and one soldier had been killed in the clash. This had taken place after the Special Security Force and Army units had begun to clear the peasants squatting on an estate, in accordance with orders given by the Head of the Juticalpa Regional Office of the National Agrarian Institute (INA).
.The Government also quoted the conclusions reached by a special Committee of inquiry, made up of a representative of the National Agrarian Institute, the Chairman of the National Peasants' Association of Honduras (ANACH), a representative of the armed forces, and two representatives of the Legislature, belonging to the Liberal Party and National Party respectively. The events of Juticalpa had taken place in an atmosphere of confusion, due to conflicts concerning rights of ownership and pre-emption with regard to land and aggravated by the slowness shown by the courts in settling the dispute.
.In its answer, the Government added that the events in question were caused by an unfortunate combination of circumstances which it could have done nothing to prevent. Nevertheless, the courts were continuing their inquiries with a view to determining criminal liability.
.At its meeting in November , the Committee asked the Director-General to request the complainants and the Government to indicate the nature of the organisation known as the Peasants' League of Talanquera and state whether it was a trade union organisation and whether the disputed title of ownership belonged to the League or to the peasants individually or collectively.
.In its letter dated  March , the World Confederation of Labour said that it was the favourable attitude of the head of the INA Regional office which had led the peasants to take possession of the land in question. There was a dispute between the peasants and two co-proprietors of adjacent lands, who claimed to have a right to these plots, which had previously been occupied by Salvadorian peasants. The problem was to decide whether the land in question was public land, as the peasants claimed, or part of the adjacent holdings, as the two landowners claimed.
.The latter, added the World Confederation of Labour, then called in the Special Security Force to evict the peasants. The peasants refused to leave, arguing that the parties had agreed to meet that same day ( February ) to reach an understanding. Army units then joined in and shooting broke out, as a result of which seven persons were killed.
.The World Confederation of Labour added that two legal cases were under way, one brought by the families of the deceased peasants against one of the two co-proprietors for murder, and the other brought by the Departmental Officer of the Special Security Force against certain peasants for disrespect of authority.
.In its communication dated  December , the Government declared that the organisation known as the Peasants' League of Talanquera was not registered as a trade union with the Ministry of Labour, and hence the Government was unable to say what its standing was in the eyes of the law. It appended to its communication a report on the matter by the Supreme Court of Justice.
.In the letter accompanying its report, the Supreme Court stated that nothing in the written or oral evidence established a relation between what happened at La Talanquera and the exercise of freedom of association in Honduras. In its report, the Court confirmed the account given by the complainants.
.The case now before the Committee is a very grave one, but the Committee has first to consider whether it involves a breach of freedom of association that can be examined under the procedure in force.
.As regards the organisation called the Peasants' League of Talanquera, to which the peasants in the case belonged, the Government declares that it is not registered as a trade union and its standing in the eyes of the law is unknown. The Committee has always taken the view that in deciding whether or not any given organisation is occupational in character it is not bound by any national definition of what constitutes an occupational organisation, and that for example, failure by an organisation to file its rules in accordance with national legislation would be no adequate reason for declaring a complaint irreceivable, since the principle of freedom of association demands that workers should not have to obtain prior authorisation before setting up organisations of their choice to promote and defend their interests. However, even if this particular league is considered to be a peasants' occupational organisation, it still remains to be decided whether the events complained of had anything to do with trade union activities. In this respect, the Committee observes that in the light of the information available, the peasants in question seem to have occupied land to which they claimed a right, that this land was at that time the object of legal proceedings, and that the peasants had been ordered to leave. They refused, whereupon a dispute arose that ended in violent repression by the police and army units.
.While the Committee fully recognises that these events were extremely serious, especially bearing in mind that the land in question had been occupied by the peasants with the approval of the local INA representative, it considers that the issue was not the exercise of trade union rights but rather a question of land ownership and tenure governed by specific national legislation having nothing to do with the problems of freedom of association.
.Accordingly, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that the case calls for no further examination on its part.",-1,1972,Honduras
104,".This complaint, by the World Confederation of Labour, appears in a communication dated  November  sent direct to the ILO. It consists of a copy of a memorandum drafted by the body known as the "" Authentic Trade Union Federation of Honduras "" (FASH). The complaint was duly referred to the Government, which sent in its observations thereon in two communications, one dated  September and the other  October .
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The facts of the case, as extracted from the complaint itself, the Government's first communication and the abundant supporting documents submitted by Government and complainants alike can be summarised as follows.
.On  June  a group of employees of the Bank called "" El Ahorro Hondureo, S.A."" formed a union and on the th of the month the provisional executive of the union notified the labour authorities of the union's establishment so as to obtain the protection of the law. In a decision dated  June  the Director-General of Labour declared that the union enjoyed state protection; the persons concerned, and the Bank, were informed accordingly.
.The very same day the management of the Bank assembled various members of the union just set up. The complainants affirm that the manager forced these employees to sign a statement withdrawing from the union. The manager states that at this meeting there was a friendly discussion as to whether or not it was desirable to have a trade union within the Bank. One point discussed, so he affirms, was the possibility that in the event of a labour dispute, the Bank's employees might show their solidarity with another union by recourse to extreme measures, such as shutting down the Bank, contrary to the public interest, and despite the competition of foreign banks, in which no trade unionism existed. Furthermore, the workers had been told that the advantages enjoyed by them had not been the fruit of trade union battles, but had been freely granted by the Bank. As a result of this conversation, the workers had freely signed statements withdrawing from the union; such statements had been referred to the labour authorities.
.Nevertheless, three days thereafter, these same workers wrote to the manager to say that their statements of withdrawal were null and void, since they had been constrained to make them by the bank authorities. In its turn, the union executive wrote to the manager to say that to destroy the union the Bank had "" had recourse to measures similar to those employed by a prison warder, culminating in illegal threats and acts of constraint "" and "" shameful acts "".
.On the basis of the statements of withdrawal from the union and of a complaint alleging constraint, lodged by the Central Trade Union Federation of Free Workers of Honduras (FECESITLIH), the labour authorities decided to investigate the matter. Various officials of the Ministry of Labour questioned the employees who had attended the meeting referred to above. As is shown in the report dated  July  (available to the Committee), all but one of these people said that they had withdrawn under the threat of dismissal. In the light of the investigations made by its officials, the General Labour Inspectorate on  September  fined the manager of the Bank for a breach of freedom of association. This decision was upheld by the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare, and the Bank's appeal to the Supreme Court of Justice was rejected.
.In the meantime, the Bank "" in a summary procedure before the Primary Labour Court "" asked for permission to dismiss the members of the provisional executive of the union, invoking section , clause B, of the Labour Code ("" any act of violence, abuse, assault or serious insubordination committed by the worker in the course of his work against members of the employer's family, members of the managerial or supervisory staff or other workers ""). The Court ruled that the language used by the executive in its memorandum to the manager (see paragraph  above) was punishable under the aforementioned clause; it also took the view that the employees concerned had freely withdrawn from their union. The Attorney-General for Labour (responsible to the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare) had been against the Bank's petition on the grounds that the management had used pressure against the Bank's employees; that, he felt, ran counter to the legislation in force, which protected the right to organise.
.While thus appealing to the labour courts, the Bank had begun an action for slander against those employees who had attended the meeting mentioned above, and an action for defamation against the executive of the union. This action against the executive alleged the use of insulting language (see paragraph  above). The action taken against the other employees was based on the contention that they had voluntarily withdrawn from their union while later telling the manager that they had been constrained by the Bank to do so-a calumnious assertion. These cases had resulted, respectively, in charges and warrants of arrest against the accused; the latter were currently released on bail.
.The union itself was given official recognition on  August , and on  September it was registered with the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare. According to the manager, the members of the executive of the union were not in fact dismissed, although the Bank bad been authorised to dismiss them. Nevertheless, several members of the executive in fact left the Bank and withdrew from the union, while other members of the union also decided to withdraw from the organisation. Finally, on  November , the remaining nine members met and decided to call for the union to be wound up, since it now had fewer than the ten members laid down in the Labour Code. Commenting, the manager stated that, "" the good will shown by the Bank, visible in its attitude throughout, had at last been understood by those few employees who, innocently led astray by outside advice, had been ill-advised enough to take action damaging to the Bank ... These few employees ... decided to declare that the union could no longer exist, since its membership had fallen below the minimum "".
.The narrative of events shows that right from the beginning the manager had been against the creation of a union and that within a very few months of its establishment the latter ceased to exist, its membership having fallen below the prescribed minimum. The meeting attended by the bank authorities and a group of persons belonging to the union just set up assumes great importance in this case. With regard to this meeting, there are two contradictory versions of what happened; one alleges that the employees were forced to withdraw from their union, and the other that they did so voluntarily, as the result of a discussion as to whether or not it would be a good thing for a union to be set up within the Bank. From the documents referred to the Committee by Government and complainants, and especially from the resolution adopted by the General Labour Inspectorate (whereby, after investigation, the manager was fined for a breach of freedom of association), and from the report dated  July , setting forth statements made by those employees who had attended the meeting referred to above, the Committee concludes that certain acts of antitrade union discrimination, contrary to Convention No. , do indeed appear to have occurred. Neither the verdict rendered by the Labour Court nor the decisions taken in the actions for defamation and slander contain anything which would enable the Committee to reach any other conclusion; nor does it appear from the texts in question that the statements made by those employees who had alleged pressure and constraint were disproved. In reality, none of the legal decisions given specifically deals with the facts which, according to the employees concerned, induced them to withdraw from their union and later to go back on their decision.
.The Committee observes that, on the one hand, the labour authorities punished the manager of the Bank for acts in breach of freedom of association, and that on the other hand, a criminal court had taken the view that the employees' denunciation of such acts constituted slander. The Committee recommends the Governing Body to express to the Government its concern at this state of affairs, as well as to point out the considerations set forth in the foregoing paragraph.
.As regards the permission given to dismiss the members of the union executive, and as regards the action for defamation brought against these members, it should be pointed out that the expression used-indicating that the management of the Bank had "" had recourse to measures similar to those employed by a prison warder and culminating in illegal threats and acts of constraint "" and "" shameful acts ""-is based on",1,1969,Honduras
105,"statements made by employees as a result of which the manager of the Bank was later fined. Furthermore, this language was used by certain employees in their capacity as trade union officials on the occasion of a labour dispute (when violent language is not infrequently employed by both sides), and not by these employees in the course of their work against their employer, as provided in section  of the Labour Code. The Committee further recommends the Governing Body to bring these considerations to the Government's attention.",0,1969,Honduras
106,".The Committee examined this case at its meetings in May , February  and November , when it submitted to the Governing Body three interim reports contained, respectively, in paragraphs  to  of the Committee's nd Report, in paragraphs  to  of its th Report and in paragraphs  to  of its th Report.
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee observes that, since the employers' and workers' organisations did not attend the meeting convened to elect members of the permanent conciliation and arbitration board of the Department of Francisco Morazn, this body has apparently not been set up. Nevertheless, the Committee also notes that, in accordance with section  of the above-mentioned Regulations governing the appointment of workers' and employers' representatives to conciliation and arbitration boards, approved by government decision in compliance with section  of the Labour Code, if for any reason the meeting does not take place or is not attended by the majority of workers' or employers' delegates, or by both at the same time, the parties concerned will be deemed to have conferred their powers on the government delegate to elect representatives to the boards, or else the election will be undertaken by the minority present. The Committee cannot help emphasising the importance which the application of this provision seems to have in view of the role attributed by law to the conciliation and arbitration boards in undertaking the procedure which is a prerequisite to the declaration of a lawful strike.
.Furthermore the Committee recalls that in accordance with section  of the Labour Code, as amended, special conciliation and arbitration boards can be set up on a non-permanent basis, merely functioning when necessary if disputes arise in some of the different branches of industry or groups of occupations. It appears from the Government's communication that special boards of this kind have been set up on certain occasions. In this connection the Committee notes a further element, namely that in accordance with section  of the above-mentioned Regulations, this text also governs the special boards affected, in that their members can be appointed directly by the government delegate when complications arise with regard to the meeting at which such members should be elected. The Committee therefore considers that there is thus an additional means of setting up conciliation and arbitration boards which may participate in the procedure to be followed prior to the calling of a lawful strike.
.In these circumstances, having regard to the principle stated in paragraph  that when temporary restrictions are placed on the right to strike during conciliation and arbitration proceedings, such proceedings should be adequate, impartial and speedy, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to draw the Government's attention to the importance it attaches to the implementation, as soon as possible, of the provisions considered above, and to decide that this case calls for no further examination.
.The Committee examined this case previously at its meetings in May  and February , when it submitted to the Governing Body the two interim reports contained, respectively, in paragraphs  to  of the Committee's nd Report and paragraphs  to  of its th Report.
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.With regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to take note that the trade unionists Julio Csar Villalta Matamoros and Carlos Alberto Reyes Pineda were arrested by order of the judge, released on bail, and brought to trial, that they were assisted by an advocate, and that an acquittal was decided upon, and accordingly to decide that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination;(b) to request the Government once again to supply the information referred to in paragraph ;(c) to take note of this interim report, on the understanding that the Committee will submit a further report when it has received the additional information requested of the Government in clause (b) of this paragraph.

.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.With regard to the case as a whole the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) in respect of the allegations relating to the annulment of the resolutions of a trade union assembly, to decide, in view of the additional information supplied by the Government and reproduced in paragraph  above, that this aspect of the case does not call for further consideration;(b) in respect of the allegations relating to the strike by the Rio Lindo Textile Mill Workers' Union, to request the Government to be good enough to specify what measures it has taken or intends to take to establish the conciliation and arbitration boards called for by the law before a strike may lawfully be declared;(c) in respect of the allegations relating to the strike called by the Central Federation of Unions of Free Workers of Honduras, to decide, for the reasons set forth in paragraphs  and  above, to request the Government once again to supply as soon as possible additional information concerning the precise reasons which led to the arrest and trial of the trade unionists Mr. Julio Csar Villalta Matamoros and Mr. Carlos Alberto Reyes Pineda for offences against the security of the State, to keep it informed of the results of the trial, and to communicate the text of the judgments given together with the grounds therefor;(d) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report when it has received the information requested of the Government in subparagraphs (b) and (c) above.
.The complaint from the Central Federation of Unions of Free Workers of Honduras (FECESITLIH) is contained in a direct communication to the I.L.O dated  September . It was transmitted by a letter dated  October  to the Government, which sent its observations by a communication dated  January .
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.With regard to the case as a whole the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) in respect of the allegations relating to the strike by the Rio Lindo Textile Mill Workers' Union:(i) to draw the attention of the Government once again to the importance which it attaches to the opinion expressed by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations mentioned in paragraph  above;(ii) to draw the attention of the Government to the importance which it has always attached to the principle that, when temporary restrictions are placed on the right to strike such as, for example, refraining from strikes during conciliation and arbitration proceedings, such proceedings should be adequate, impartial and speedy, and to request the Government to be good enough to furnish the text of the amendments to sections  and  of the Labour Code relating to the establishment of conciliation and arbitration boards;(b) in respect of the allegations relating to the strike called by FECESITLIH, to draw the Government's attention to the importance which it attaches to the opinion expressed by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, namely that the provision of the Labour Code denying the right to strike to federations and Confederations is not compatible with Article  of Convention No. , and to request the Government to be good enough to supply the additional information mentioned in paragraphs  and  above and to reply to the allegations mentioned in paragraph ;(c) in respect of the allegations relating to the annulment of the resolutions of a trade union assembly, while again drawing the Government's attention to the principle that, when it is necessary to control the internal acts of a trade union, it is of maximum importance that, in order to guarantee an impartial and objective procedure, such control should be exercised by the relevant judicial authority, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to request the Government to inform it as soon as possible as to the present situation with regard to the procedure for the registration of the Executive Committee of FECESITLIH, and to enclose the text of",1,1965,Honduras
107,"any decisions which may have been issued, together with the grounds therefor;(d) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report when it has received the information requested of the Government in subparagraphs (a) (ii), (b) and (c) above.",-1,1965,Honduras
108,".This case has already come before the Committee, at its meetings in May  and May , on both of which occasions it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body. These reports will be found, respectively, in paragraphs  to  of the Committee's th Report and in paragraphs  to  of its th Report.
.In these reports the Committee made its final recommendations with respect to some of the allegations contained in the complaint, leaving outstanding only the allegations relating to the dismissal from his post of a public servant, Professor Amilcar Salinas Rivera, which according to the complainants took place four days after he had been elected to an official post in the National Trade Union of Public Servants of Honduras (SINASEPH).
.In paragraph  of its th Report the Committee noted that the Government had as yet made no comment as to the reasons for Professor Salinas Rivera's dismissal. In these circumstances the Committee recommended the Governing Body, in paragraph  (b) of the same report, to request the Government to be good enough to comment on the allegation that the said professor had been dismissed from his post in the public administration on account of his trade union activities. This recommendation having been agreed to by the Governing Body, the request for information in question was transmitted to the Government.
.In its reply, dated  November , the Government states first of all that none of the competent departments of the Ministry of Labour has any official knowledge of the establishment or Constitution of the National Trade Union of Public Servants of Honduras, and that it is therefore hardly possible to consider Professor Salinas Rivera (referred to as Rivera Salinas in the Government's letter) as a trade union official or to take account of his status as Secretary-General of the Action and Public Relations Committee of an organisation which has never acquired legal personality as either a civil or an industrial association. The Government adds that the person in question, who had been arrested on suspicion of a criminal attempt to undermine the democratic form of government, now enjoys unrestricted freedom.
.As regards the dismissal of Professor Salinas Rivera from his post in the public administration, the Government declares, in brief, that there is no objective and reliable evidence that the said dismissal was connected in any way with his election to a trade union post, about which the Government states that it has no authoritative information. There is nothing exceptional in the removal from his post of the person in question, which was decided upon on  October ; it is customary in the public administration of Honduras to terminate the appointments of public officials or employees simply at the discretion of the Minister concerned, who has full freedom to decide upon the desirability of such a step, particularly when, as in the present case, an official or employee engages in activities detrimental to the Government.
.The Committee recalls that in an earlier report it made recommendations to the Governing Body with respect to allegations to the effect that a group of public employees had formed a trade union (SINASEPH) on  August , but that when they applied for registration of the union and recognition of its legal personality, the Directorate-General of Labour decided on  November  that the documents submitted were in order, except for certain errors in wording discovered in its rules, yet failed to take steps to have the union - i.e. the complaining organisation - registered, which was one of the grounds for the complaint. Furthermore, SINASEPH attached to a subsequent communication dated  January  copy of a letter it had received from the Minister of Labour in reply to one from the union. At all events, bearing in mind that the initial observations of the Government, analysed by the Committee in its th Report, appeared to indicate that for the time being public employees in Honduras do not have the right to organise, the Committee recommended the Governing Body to draw the attention of the Government to "" the importance of ensuring that persons employed in the service of the State should enjoy the right to establish trade unions and to register them with a view to their lawful operation, this principle being laid down in Article  of the Convention No. , ratified by Honduras, which provides that workers, without distinction whatsoever, shall have the right to establish organisations of their own choosing without previous authorisation "". This recommendation was approved by the Governing Body and transmitted to the Government by letter dated  June .
.In view of the facts recapitulated in the preceding paragraph, especially as concerns the procedure initiated by the complaining organisation in  to secure registration and recognition of its legal personality, the decision which appears to have been taken in this respect in November  and the letter subsequently sent by the Minister of Labour to the complaining organisation, the Committee fails to understand what is meant by the remark made by the Government in its communication of  November  to the effect that the Government of Honduras has no official knowledge of the establishment or Constitution of SINASEPH.
.In any case, bearing in mind the background to this situation, and in particular the Committee's recommendation quoted in paragraph  above, the Committee considers that the fact that the complaining organisation has not been recognised nor registered does not, in the present instance, constitute a sufficient reason for rejecting the allegations which still remain outstanding.
.In regard to this last aspect of the case the point at issue is whether the dismissal of Professor Salinas Rivera was an infringement of freedom of association as the complainants maintain. The Committee notes the Government's statement to the effect that Professor Salinas Rivera was arrested on suspicion of a criminal offence, although it points out that the Government has supplied no information as to whether the charge in question was upheld in court proceedings.
.In any case the Government's observations raise a much vaster issue, namely the permissibility of dismissing employees and officials in the service of the State-and, it follows therefrom, members or officials of trade union organisations formed by them for the defence of their common economic and social interests-"" simply at the discretion of the Minister concerned, who has full freedom to decide upon the desirability of such a step "". Such a situation appears to be incompatible with the guarantee provided in Article  of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), that workers shall enjoy adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment, such protection applying more particularly in respect of acts calculated to cause the dismissal of or otherwise prejudice a worker by reason of union membership or because of participation in union activities. In effect, as matters stand at present, even if it were possible to prove that the dismissal of a public official or employee had been decided upon on grounds of union membership or participation in union activities, such proof would have no practical value as a means of defending trade union rights.
.It would consequently appear from the observations made by the Government in its communication dated  November  that in Honduras persons employed in the service of the State, whose right to form organisations of their own choosing is guaranteed by Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Honduras, do not enjoy adequate protection against possible acts of discrimination in respect of their employment of the kind referred to in Article  of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), likewise ratified by Honduras, the importance of which was already brought to the attention of the Government in paragraph  (a) (ii) of the Committee's th Report, approved by the Governing Body.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to take note of the Government's statement in its communication of  November  to the effect that it is customary in the public administration of Honduras to terminate the appointments of public officials or employees simply at the discretion of the Minister concerned, who has full freedom to decide upon the desirability of such a step, and of the fact that, in such circumstances, it would appear that officials and employees in the service of the State do not enjoy adequate protection against dismissal for reasons such as union membership or participation in lawful union activities;(b) in consequence, to draw the attention of the Government to the importance which it has always attached to the principle laid down in Article  of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Honduras, that workers shall enjoy adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment, such protection applying more particularly in respect of acts calculated to cause the dismissal of or otherwise prejudice a worker",-1,1964,Honduras
109,"by reason of union membership or because of participation in union activities;(c) to request the Government to be good enough to inform the Committee of the steps it has taken or proposes to take to guarantee to persons employed in the service of the State the adequate protection to which reference is made in subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this paragraph;(d) to bring these conclusions to the attention of the I.L.O. Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.
.This case already came before the Committee at its May  meeting, when it submitted an interim report on the subject which will be found in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session (May-June ). In that report the Committee submitted its final conclusions and recommendations with respect to the allegations relating to the registration and recognition of the complaining organisation, and the paragraphs which follow will deal only with the remaining allegations, examination of which was left outstanding pending the receipt of certain additional information requested from the Government.
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its complaint dated  November  the National Trade Union of Public Servants of Honduras (SINASEPH) stated that Professor Amilcar Salinas Rivera had been arrested and wrongfully dismissed from his post in the public administration four days after being elected Secretary-General of that organisation's Action and Public Relations Committee. The complainants held that the action taken against Professor Salinas Rivera was due to his trade union activities and added that Miss Marina Barnica, who had played a prominent part in the founding of the union, had been dismissed from her post as secretary at the Labour Inspectorate on the same day.
.When it examined the case at its meeting in May  the Committee observed that in its observations the Government had given no specific explanation with respect to these allegations, merely referring to certain purely political activities which could not be pursued by trade unions. In consequence, for the reasons stated in paragraphs  and  of its th Report, the Committee recommended the Governing Body, while reaffirming the importance it attached to ensuring that trade union members arrested for political offences or for offences under ordinary law should be tried within the shortest possible period by an impartial and independent judicial authority, to request the Government to make specific observations concerning the reasons for the arrest of Mr. Salinas Rivera, and his present situation, and also to request the Government to send its observations concerning the reasons for the dismissal of Miss Marina Barnica and Mr. Salinas Rivera. Since it appeared from an earlier communication from the Government that Mr. Aristides Mejia Castro, who had signed the complaint as President of the SINASEPH, had also been dismissed, the Committee also requested the Government for observations with respect to his case.
.These recommendations, having been approved by the Governing Body, were transmitted to the Government by letter dated  June , to which the Government replied on  January .
.The Government declares on the basis of a report from the National Investigation Corps, copy of which it attaches, that Professor Salinas Rivera was arrested for the proved offence of attempting to overthrow the democratic form of government, but that he was subsequently released. The Government adds that since  August  the person concerned has occupied a post as instructor at the Co-operative Technical Industrial Centre at San Pedro Sula, and attaches an attestation to that effect. Miss Marina Barnica was dismissed at the request of her immediate superior, the Chief of the Labour Inspectorate at San Pedro Sula, for failure to perform her duties. The Government also explains that Mr. Mejia Castro was not dismissed; he requested permission to resign from his post as Chief of the Workers' Education Department in order to go to the Central American Institute of Trade Union Studies, where he took up employment on  September . The Government attaches a number of documents relating to Mr. Mejia Castro's request, including a copy of the request itself, wherein, inter alia, he expresses his gratitude for the confidence shown in him during his employment with the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare and recommends a candidate to replace him. The Government denies having infringed Article  of Convention No. , considering that the persons named in the complaint have not been the victims of discrimination in respect of employment, nor were they dismissed on account of their trade union activities.
.The Committee takes due note of the information supplied by the Government, from which it appears that Mr. Mejia Castro left his post of his own accord and that Miss Barnica was dismissed purely on account of her work. As far as the latter is concerned, since the complainants confine themselves to mentioning her dismissal and her earlier trade union activities without furnishing any evidence which would serve to establish a link between the two, the Committee considers, in the light of the Government's reply, that it would serve no useful purpose to proceed with its examination of this aspect of the case.
.As regards Professor Salinas Rivera, the Government's reply announces that he has been released. The reply does not, however, refer specifically to the allegation that Professor Salinas Rivera was dismissed from his post in the public administration at the time of his arrest, i.e. four days after he was elected Secretary-General of the Action and Public Relations Committee of the National Trade Union of Public Servants of Honduras.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with respect to the allegation relating to the dismissal of Miss Marina Barnica, to take note of the Government's statement to the effect that she was dismissed on account of her work and to decide, for the reasons stated in paragraph  above, that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination;(b) to request the Government to be good enough to comment on the allegation that Professor Amilcar Salinas Rivera was dismissed from his post in the public administration on account of his trade union activities;(c) to take note of the present interim report, on the understanding that the Committee will report further to the Governing Body when it has received the information requested from the Government in subparagraph (b) of this paragraph.Geneva,  May . (Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.
.The complaints presented by the National Trade Union of Public Servants of Honduras (SINASEPH) are contained in its communication dated  November  and in the additional information sent on  January . This material was transmitted to the Government, which sent its observations on  February .
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.With its communication dated  November  the complaining organisation also forwarded a copy of a letter to the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare stating that a group of public employees had established a trade union on  August  in accordance with section  of the Labour Code. Following the organisation's application for registration and recognition of its legal personality, the Directorate-General of Labour decided that the documents submitted were in order, except for certain errors in wording discovered in its rules. However, from the time when this decision was communicated on  November  until the present the authorities had failed to give instructions for the union to be registered, although section  of the Labour Code lays down a period of  days within which this must be done. On  October  SINASEPH held its first extraordinary congress, at which it decided to set up an Action and Public Relations Committee, Professor Amilcar Salinas Rivera being elected Secretary-General of that Committee. Four days later Professor Salinas Rivera was arrested and wrongfully dismissed from his post in the public administration. The complainants consider that the action taken against Professor Salinas Rivera is due to his trade union activities and state that Miss Marina Barnica, who had been prominent in the formation of the union, was dismissed from her post as secretary at the Labour Inspectorate on the same day.
.With their communication dated  January  the complainants sent a letter received from the Minister of Labour replying to the protests made in connection with the action taken against Professor Salinas Rivera and Miss Barnica. This letter stated that the Minister would undertake the necessary investigation. The complainants allege that this is an attempt to evade the legal requirements. The complainants also sent a copy of the decision by the Directorate-General of Labour referred to above and a copy of a letter received from the Director-General of Labour stating that, since the union was in the process of being formed, its Executive Board would remain under the special protection",1,1964,Honduras
110,"of the State in accordance with the provisions of the Labour Code.
.In its reply dated  February  the Government states that officials and employees of the public administration are in a relationship sui generis and cannot be identified with private workers; the former are not in an ""employment relationship"" with the State, since the State is not an employer, but they have to be protected by a special system of "" guarantees "", since their relationship is governed by statutes and regulations drawn up by the State. The Government goes on to say that there is no civil service in Honduras and therefore no officials or employees of the State are covered by public servants' regulations, there are only de facto employees of the State who do not yet enjoy de jure guarantees. As de facto employees they enjoy the rights recognised by the Labour Code, subject to special conditions, and will be covered by the Civil Service Act soon to be promulgated. The Government states that SINASEPH has no legal personality for the reasons stated above and that its existence is therefore irregular and without validity within either the national or international sphere.
.With regard to the violation of freedom of association alleged to be practised by the authorities against the members of SINASEPH, the Government states that it must not be forgotten that purely political activities, such as participation in electoral campaigns, agitation and acts of violence and subversion, do not, either in Honduras or abroad, come within the scope of lawful activities such as may be pursued by duly established trade unions; in no case are such activities lawful for de facto groups like SINASEPH. The only security measures or legal sanctions adopted by the authorities are of an individual character and in no way general or collective against any union or group of persons. The Government further states that Mr. Aristides Mejia Castro, who signed the complaint dated  November  as President of SINASEPH, was relieved of his functions as a public official on  August  by decision of the Secretariat for Foreign Relations.
.The Committee observes that under existing legislation employees of the official services are entitled to establish trade unions. However, from the explanations provided by the Government, this right would seem to have been suspended, since state employees still do not enjoy the guarantees to which they should be entitled, since they are de facto employees in the absence of a regular civil service in Honduras. Until such time as the Civil Service Act comes into force, it wilt not be possible to reach a satisfactory solution concerning the status of officials and public servants. This is why the complainant organisation would not have been able to obtain legal personality, since its existence is unlawful according to the Government's statement.
.The Committee has stated on more than one occasion that the purpose of the procedure for the examination of cases where violation of freedom of association is alleged is to promote respect for trade union rights, both de jure and de facto, and that the workers' right freely to constitute organisations of their own choice cannot be considered to exist until such time as it is fully recognised and observed both de facto and de jure.
.In view of the allegations made by the complainants and of the statement by the Government concerning the difference between officials and public employees on the one hand and private employees on the other, with regard to the character of their employment relationship, the Committee considers that it must draw the Government's special attention to the provisions of Article  of Convention No. , which Honduras has ratified, stating that workers and employers, without distinction whatsoever and without previous authorisation, shall have the right to establish and join organisations of their own choosing.
.The Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has already pointed out that "" the principle of freedom of association might very often remain a dead letter if employers and workers were required to obtain any previous authorisation to enable them to establish an organisation, be it authorisation concerning the formation of the trade union organisation itself, need to obtain discretionary approval of the Constitution or rules of the organisation, or, again, authorisation for taking steps prior to establishment of the organisation "". This does not mean that the founders of an organisation are freed from the duty of observing formalities as to publicity or other similar formalities which may be prescribed by law. However, such requirements must not be such as to be equivalent in practice to previous authorisation, or as to constitute such an obstacle to the establishment of an organisation that they amount in practice to outright prohibition. Even in cases where registration is optional, if such registration confers on the organisation the basic rights enabling it to "" further and defend the interests "" of its members, the fact that the authority competent to effect registration has discretionary power to refuse this formality leads to a situation that is not very different from that in cases where previous authorisation is required.
.The present case relates to public officials who established a trade union and applied for it to be registered and granted legal personality with a view to normal operation within the framework of the law. However, although there were no major formal obstacles to registration, according to the outline of events submitted to the Committee, the authorities did not register the union, nor did they consequently grant it legal personality without which the organisation cannot lawfully exist. In these circumstances the Committee must expressly emphasise, as it has on other occasions, the importance of ensuring that persons employed in the service of the State should be guaranteed the right to establish trade unions and to register them with a view to their lawful operation.
.With regard to the allegations concerning the arrest of Mr. Salinas Rivera and his dismissal from the post he previously occupied in the public service, and the dismissal of Miss Barnica, the Government has not given any specific explanation, merely referring to certain purely political activities which could not be lawfully pursued by duly established trade unions, let alone de facto groups such as SINASEPH.
.The Committee recalls, in the first place, that on many occasions in the past, where allegations that trade union leaders or workers had been arrested or detained for trade union activities have been met by governments with statements that the arrests or detentions were made for subversive activities, for reasons of internal security or for common law crimes, it has followed the rule that the governments concerned should be requested to submit further and as precise information as possible concerning the arrests or detentions and the exact reasons therefor. If, in certain cases, the Committee has concluded that allegations relating to the arrests or detentions of trade union militants did not call for further examination, this has been after it has received information showing sufficiently precisely and with sufficient detail that the arrests or detentions were in no way occasioned by trade union activities but solely by activities outside the trade union sphere, which were either prejudicial to public order or of a political nature. In all cases where trade unionists have been arrested for political offences or for offences under ordinary law the Committee has insisted on the importance of ensuring that such persons should be tried within the shortest possible period by an impartial and independent judicial authority.
.In the second place the Committee has always attached great importance to the provisions of Article  of Convention No. , according to which workers shall enjoy adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment, such protection applying more particularly in respect of acts calculated to cause the dismissal of or otherwise prejudice a worker by reason of union membership or because of participation in union activities.
.With regard to the Government's statement that "" purely political activities, such as participation in electoral campaigns ... do not, either in Honduras or abroad, come within the scope of lawful activities such as may be pursued by duly established trade unions; in no case are such activities lawful for de facto groups like SINASEPH "", the Committee refers to the comments by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations in . That Committee stated that if trade unions are prohibited in general terms from engaging in any political activities this may raise difficulties by reason of the fact that the interpretation given to the relevant provisions in practice may change at any moment and considerably restrict the possibility of action of the organisations. In this connection the Committee of Experts thought it useful to refer to the resolution adopted by the International Labour Conference at its th Session (Geneva, ) in which it stated that when trade unions undertake or associate themselves with political action this action shall not be "" of such a nature as to compromise",1,1964,Honduras
111,"the continuance of the trade union movement or its social or economic functions, irrespective of political changes in the country "". It would therefore seem that States should be able, without prohibiting in general terms political activities of occupational organisations, to entrust to the judicial authorities the task of repressing abuses which might, in certain cases, be committed by organisations which had lost sight of the fact that their fundamental objective should be "" the economic and social advancement "" of their members.
.In these circumstances, with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the attention of the Government to:(i) the importance of ensuring that persons employed in the service of the State should enjoy the right to establish trade unions and to register them with a view to their lawful operation, this principle being laid down in Article  of Convention No. , ratified by Honduras, which provides that workers, without distinction whatsoever, shall have the right to establish organisations of their own choosing without previous authorisation;(ii) the importance which it has always attached to the principle laid down in Article  of Convention No. , ratified by Honduras, stating that workers shall enjoy adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment, such protection applying more particularly in respect of acts calculated to cause the dismissal of or otherwise prejudice a worker by reason of union membership or because of participation in union activities;(iii) the fact that, in the light of the statement contained in the  resolution concerning the independence of the trade union movement and of the opinion expressed by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, it is not appropriate to prohibit all political activities by occupational organisations in general terms but that the judicial authorities should be entrusted with the task of repressing abuses which might, in certain cases, be committed by organisations which had lost sight of the fact that their fundamental objective should be "" the economic and social advancement "" of their members;(b) in accordance with the comments in paragraph  above and reaffirming the importance it attaches to ensuring that trade union members arrested for political offences or for offences under ordinary law should be tried within the shortest possible period by an impartial and independent judicial authority, to request the Government to make specific observations concerning the reasons for the arrest of Mr. Salinas Rivera, and his present situation;(c) to request the Government to send its observations concerning the reasons for the dismissal of Miss Marina Barnica, Mr. Salinas Rivera and Mr. Meja Castro;(d) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will report further to the Governing Body when it has received the information requested from the Government.Geneva,  May .

112,".This case has already been examined by the Committee at its sessions in November  and February . On those occasions interim reports were submitted, and these appear in paragraphs  to  of the th Report and in paragraphs  to  of the th Report of the Committee respectively.
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee notes the additional information sent spontaneously by the Government with its communication of  May , concerning the points to which the recommendations of the Committee set out in paragraph  (a), (b) and (c) of its th Report referred. Concerning the recommendation in paragraph  (d) the Committee observes that the authorities have recognised the legal personality of the complainant organisation, a matter which formed the subject of the complaint.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to take note of the Government's statement of  May  from which it appears that the competent authority has issued a decision recognising the legal personality of the complainant organisation;(b) to take note of the Government's statement that it will study the amendments required to bring Honduran legislation into conformity with the provisions of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), regarding the matters referred to in paragraph  of the th Report of the Committee;(c) to request the Government to be good enough to keep the Governing Body informed concerning the measures which it is adopting or considers adopting for the purposes mentioned in the preceding subparagraph.
.This case was examined by the Committee at its meeting in November , when it submitted an interim report in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, which was approved by the Governing Body at its st Session (March ).
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complaining organisation, representing , workers and peasants, alleges that the Head of the Government has infringed freedom of association by refusing to grant it legal personality, although the necessary legal requirements have been complied with and the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare has given its approval.
.At its meeting in November  the Committee had before it a communication from the Government dated  August , in which the Government stated that legal personality had not been accorded to the organisation because of errors and omissions appearing in the documents submitted with its application for registration and recognition and that the organisation had been granted two months in which to make good such errors and omissions and thus comply with the requirements of the Labour Code.
.The Government listed ten requirements with which the organisation had been called upon to comply. The Committee took the view that seven of these requirements, listed in detail in paragraph  of its th Report, were formal requirements which a government could properly lay down without this implying a violation of the principles of freedom of association.
.The other three items with respect to which the complaining organisation was called upon to take remedial action were- (a) infringement of the provisions of section  of the Labour Code in connection with the special majority votes prescribed for the adoption of certain resolutions; (b) prior verification by the General Inspectorate of Labour of observance by the constituent unions of the complaining federation of the legal quorums referred to in section  of the Labour Code; (c) elimination or replacement by other means of the boycott tactics referred to in its by-laws, such a procedure being an illegal act under the Penal Code.
.With regard to the last of the three points referred to above, the Committee decided to request the Government to be good enough to inform it of the specific penal provisions in force in Honduras under which the boycott is considered to be an illegal act.
.In a communication dated  September  the Government states that the boycott is not specified under general penal law, but that it must be regarded, in the light of the system underlying the legislation of Honduras, as an unlawful act. The Government states that by a boycott it means "" any act or procedure contrary to free competition in production, industry, commerce or a public service "" and therefore harmful to the public economy. In the light of this definition it considers that a boycott is at variance with article  of the Constitution whereby the State recognises and guarantees freedom of consumption, saving, investment, occupation, initiative, commercial, enterprise and other freedoms which may tend to strengthen the system of free trade and competition within the national territory. The Government adds that if these freedoms are guaranteed it is logical to suppose that any act which offended them would call for sanction and, specifically, that in civil law their infringement would justify applying for an injunction in relief.
.Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Honduras, guarantees the right of workers' organisations to draw up their Constitutions and rules without any interference by the public authorities which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof, while Article  of the Convention provides that, while such organisations shall respect legality in exercising their rights, the law of the land shall not be such as to impair, nor shall it be so applied as to impair, the guarantees provided for in the Convention. The question at issue with regard to boycotts turns not so much on Article  as on Article  of the Convention because, although there is some doubt as to precisely which legal provisions render them unlawful, the Government maintains that boycotts-a particular aspect of strike action-are prohibited by the law of the land. If such prohibition does not constitute a violation of Article  of the Convention, clearly an organisation cannot claim the right, under Article , to provide for something in its rules which contravenes that prohibition.
.The Committee has always applied the principle that allegations relating to the right to strike are not outside its competence in so far as they affect the exercise of trade union rights. It has also pointed out that the right of workers and their organisations to strike as a legitimate means of defending their occupational interests is generally recognised.
.The evidence before the Committee relates to the legal prohibition of only one particular aspect of strike action-the boycott. The complainants themselves have made no direct reference to it at all. The Committee observes, however, that the question of boycotts, whether primary or secondary, has led to considerable divergency in the legislation of several countries in which, as in Honduras, strike action in the general sense of a stoppage of work is not as such illegal. The boycott, in other words, is a very special form of action which in some cases may involve a trade union whose members continue their work and are not directly involved in the dispute with the employer against whom the boycott is imposed. In such circumstances the prohibition of boycotts would not appear necessarily to involve an interference with trade union rights. In the absence of any evidence from the complainants in the present case as to the nature of the boycotts objected to by the Government as being illegal, the Committee considers that the complainants have furnished no proof that their legal prohibition involves an infringement of Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or, consequently, that any infringement of Article  of the Convention results from the refusal of the registering authorities to accept the provisions on this matter written into its Constitution by the complaining organisation.
.The two other reasons for which the Constitution and rules of the complaining organisation have not been accepted by the competent authorities involve questions of greater substance. The question at issue, as the Committee observed at its meeting in November , is whether the fact that the requirements of section  of the Labour Code with respect to special majority votes and quorums for the adoption of specific resolutions must be complied with in the Constitution and rules of a trade union in order for it to be granted legal personality are compatible with the said Convention No. . Article  of the Convention provides that the acquisition of legal personality by an organisation shall not be made subject to conditions of such a character as to restrict the application, among other things, of the provision in Article  of the Convention according to which workers' organisations shall have the right to draw up their Constitutions and rules without interference by the public authority.
.Section  of the Labour Code requires that, for the approval of union rules and",-1,1964,Honduras
113,"amendments thereto, the fixing of contributions, and decisions regarding expulsion of members, the majority vote shall be two-thirds of the members present at the general meeting; decisions regarding amalgamation, federation and dissolution need a majority vote of two-thirds of the total membership; the majority vote required for calling a strike shall be two-thirds of the total membership of the union or branch concerned.
.In Case No.  relating to Japan the Committee observed that the law and practice of a number of countries require absolute majorities of a union's membership -at least on a first ballot-for certain matters which affect the basic existence of a union (changes of Constitution and rules, dissolution, etc.), but that it is not the normal practice to require such majorities in the case of matters relating to the ordinary functioning of a trade union, such as elections. In cases of the latter kind it is the normally accepted principle that, provided all the members in good standing are enabled freely to exercise their right to vote, a simple majority of the votes cast shall, subject to any contrary rule voluntarily adopted by the union itself, be sufficient; any departure from this principle would mean that, in the absence of a system of compulsory voting, a union's activities would be paralysed unless an exceptionally high vote were cast on every occasion in order for a decision to be taken, a situation in which the law of the land would be such as to impair the rights accorded to organisations under Article  of Convention No. .
.It was in accordance with these considerations that the Committee, when examining the present case at its meeting in November , concluded, with respect to the majority votes required by section  of the Labour Code for certain matters other than strike action (see paragraph  above), that the requirements laid down did not imply interference by the authorities contrary to the Convention.
.With regard to the requirement of a two-thirds majority vote of the total membership for strike action, however, non-compliance with which might even entail the penalty of dissolution of a union by administrative authority, the Committee recalled the conclusions of the I.L.O. Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations concerning the application of Convention No.  by the Government of Honduras to the effect that the legal provisions involved constitute "" an intervention by the public authorities in the activities of trade unions which is of a nature to restrict the rights of such organisations, contrary to Article  of the Convention "".
.Since the Committee formulated that conclusion, further comments on the matter have been made by the Government in its communication dated  September .
.In its communication dated  September  the Government contends that the requirements as to special majorities do not imply "" previous authorisation "" for the formation of an organisation or interfere with its right to draw up its Constitution and rules.
.In the same communication the Government refers to the provision in section  of the Labour Code to the effect that a union concerned in an unlawful stoppage of work may be "" ordered to be dissolved if the authority or official issuing the declaration "" that the stoppage is unlawful "" so decides "". The Government states that this does not mean that a union can be dissolved by administrative decision, because, under section , it lies with the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare to decide whether resort shall be had to the provisions of section  () (d), according to which "" application may be made to the labour court to cancel the union's legal personality and to dissolve and liquidate the union itself ""; the competence of the labour court in this respect is also set forth in section . However, states the Government, there is some discrepancy between section  () (c) of the Code, which permits the suspension of an organisation's legal personality by administrative action, and Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), according to which workers' organisations shall not be liable to be dissolved or suspended by administrative authority. But, the Government explains, as the decree approving the ratification of the Convention was promulgated prior to the Code of  and has not been repealed, the provisions of the Convention are applicable and there has been no case in which the Ministry has, in fact, suspended the legal personality of any trade union.
.In this connection the Committee recalls that the I.L.O. Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, when examining these provisions in the legislation of Honduras, observed that section  () (c) of the Code was incompatible with Article  of the Convention.
.In all the circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the attention of the Government to the importance which the Governing Body attaches to the principles enunciated in Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Honduras, according to which workers' organisations shall have the right to draw up their Constitutions and rules and to organise their activities and the public authorities shall refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof; in Article , according to which workers' organisations shall not be liable to be dissolved or suspended by administrative authority; in Article , according to which the acquisition of legal personality shall not be made subject to conditions of such a character as to restrict the application of the provisions contained in the foregoing Articles; and in Article , according to which the law of the land shall not be such as to impair, nor shall it be so applied as to impair, the guarantees provided for in the Convention;(b) to draw attention to the view expressed by the I.L.O. Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations that the requirement of a two thirds majority vote of the total membership of the union or branch concerned before a lawful strike can be declared is not compatible with Article  of the said Convention, and that section  () (c) of the Labour Code, according to which the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare may suspend the legal personality of a trade union guilty of a contravention of the Code, is not compatible with Article  of the Convention;(c) to request the Government to be good enough to inform the Governing Body as to the steps it intends to take to bring its legislation in these respects into harmony with the provisions of the Convention;(d) to express the hope that the Government will now further review the case of the application for legal personality by the complaining organisation in the light of the foregoing considerations.
.The complaint is contained in a communication of  July  addressed directly to the I.L.O by the Authentic Trade Union Federation of Honduras (F.A.S.H.). It was forwarded by the I.L.O to the Government, which submitted its observations in a communication dated  August .
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communication the complainants, who state that they represent , workers and peasants, accuse the Head of the Government of infringing freedom of association by refusing to grant legal personality to F.A.S.H, although the legal requirements have been complied with and the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare has given its approval.
.In its reply the Government states that the reasons for which legal personality has not been granted to F.A.S.H are purely legal, since the organisers of the Federation have not complied with the requirements and conditions laid down in the Labour Code. In this connection the communication of the Government reproduces a decision of the Secretariat of State for Labour and Social Welfare, setting forth the reasons for which legal personality has not yet been granted to the Federation. According to this communication the Federation has been granted two months in which to make good the errors and omissions appearing in the documents submitted with its application for registration and recognition.
.According to the Secretariat of State referred to the observations made to the Federation relate to the following items:(a) omissions consisting in the absence of the numbers of the decisions recognising the legal personality of the affiliated unions and the numbers and dates of the issues of the official gazette in which they were published;(b) omission to record in the minutes the authorisations of the general meetings empowering the representatives of the affiliated unions to establish the Federation;(c) failure to comply with the requirement to submit a list of the provisional managing committee, showing personal data relating to its members;(d) omission to submit the certified copies of the articles of association and copies of the by-laws;(e) the use in the by-laws of the",0,1964,Honduras
114,"term "" Executive Committee "" instead of the term "" Managing Committee "" prescribed by the Labour Code;(f) infringement of the provisions of section  of the Labour Code in connection with the special majority votes required for the adoption of specific resolutions;(g) the term "" competent magistrate "" must be replaced by the term "" Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare "" where it refers to the authority empowered by the Labour Code to appoint a liquidation committee in the event of the dissolution of a trade union;(h) the elimination or replacement by other means of the boycott tactics referred to in the by-laws, since such a procedure comes within the scope of the Penal Code as an illegal act;(i) prior verification by the General Inspectorate of Labour of observance by the constituent organisations of F.A.S.H of the legal quorums referred to by section  of the Labour Code;(j) verification of the keeping by F.A.S.H of a register of members, minutes of the general meeting, minutes of the managing committee, inventories and balance sheets and income and expenditure accounts, as prescribed by the Labour Code.
.With regard to the observations contained in items (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (g) and (j), the Committee considers that they appear to relate to formal requirements that must be complied with by the Federation in its application for registration and the granting of legal personality, requirements that the Government can properly lay down without this implying a violation of the principles of freedom of association. In fact, although Article  of Convention No.  provides that workers and employers shall have the right to establish organisations "" without previous authorisation "", this does not free the founders of an organisation from the duty of "" observing formalities as to publicity or other similar formalities which may be prescribed in certain countries, either generally in respect of all associations or specifically in respect of trade unions "", as the I.L.O. Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has stated, though these formalities must not be such as to be equivalent, in practice, to previous authorisation or to constitute a serious obstacle to the establishment of an organisation.
.With regard to the requirements contained in items (f) and (i) the Committee considers that they relate not to matters of mere form, but directly to the right of the organisations "" to draw up their Constitutions and rules "" in accordance with Article  of Convention No. . These requirements refer to the legal obligation of trade unions to make provision for a specific majority and quorum for the adoption of their decisions, in accordance with section  of the Labour Code. It is prescribed that resolutions of the general meeting shall be adopted by a simple majority vote; but that in the cases of approving the by-laws and any amendments thereto, fixing the contributions and wages to be paid and deciding on the expulsion of members, the majority vote shall be two-thirds of the members present; in the cases of amalgamation of unions and affiliation with, or withdrawal from, a federation or Confederation and of the dissolution of the union, the majority vote shall be two-thirds of the total number of members of the union; and finally, in the case of a strike, the majority vote shall be two-thirds of the total number of members of the union or branch concerned.
.The Committee observes that Article , paragraph , of Convention No.  lays down that the public authorities shall refrain from any interference which would restrict or impede the lawful exercise of the right of the organisations "" to draw up their Constitutions and rules "", and that in accordance with Article  the acquisition of legal personality by an organisation shall not be made subject to conditions of such a character as to restrict the application of such provisions of the Convention as those contained in Article .
.On one occasion the Committee considered that legislation minutely regulating the procedure for internal trade union elections, the composition of its principal organs and the days of their meetings, the precise date for the annual assembly and the date when the terms of office of the officers should come to an end, was incompatible with the rights of the trade unions recognised by Convention No. . On another occasion the Committee admitted the Government's merely making specimen Constitutions available to organisations in process of creation without requiring them to accept an obligatory model, stating that this did not involve any interference with the right of organisations to draw up their Constitutions and rules in full freedom.
.In the present case the legal prescription of certain majority votes for the adoption of resolutions by the assembly of a trade union relates to a question of the highest importance for the life of the organisation and the rights of its members. The Committee considers that, in cases like this, involving basic matters relating to the existence and structure of a union and the fundamental rights of its members, the regulation by law of the majority votes for the adoption of the decisions involved does not imply interference by the authorities contrary to the Convention, provided that this regulation by law is not of such a nature as seriously to impede the running of a trade union in accordance with prevailing conditions, making practically impossible the adoption of the decisions proper to it, and provided that the purpose is to guarantee the right of members to participate democratically in the life of the union.
.Nevertheless, with regard to the majority vote required by law for the declaration of a legal strike (two-thirds of the total number of members of the union or branch concerned), non-compliance with which may entail a penalty by the administrative authorities going as far as dissolution of the union, the Committee recalls the conclusions of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations a concerning the application by the Government of Honduras of Convention No. , which it has ratified, to the effect that the legal provisions involved constitute "" an intervention by the public authorities in the activities of trade unions which is of a nature to restrict the rights of such organisations, contrary to Article  of the Convention "".
.With regard to the observation of the authorities contained in item (h), according to which boycott tactics must be eliminated from the by-laws, since such a procedure comes within the scope of the Penal Code as an illegal act, the Committee requests the Government to inform it of the specific penal provisions in force in Honduras under which the boycott is considered an illegal act, and in the meantime postpones the examination of this aspect of the case.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to take note of the observations furnished by the Government from which it would appear that the reasons for which legal personality has not been granted to the Authentic Trade Union Federation of Honduras are that it has not complied with certain formalities;(b) to take note of the present interim report of the Committee with regard to the remaining allegations, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report when it has received the information requested on the points referred to in paragraph  above.Geneva,  November . (Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.",0,1964,Honduras
115,".The Committee previously examined this case at its sessions held in February  and May , when it submitted interim reports to the Governing Body which are contained in paragraphs  to  of the nd Report and  to  of the th Report respectively.
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.This case refers to the assassination of Mr. Humberto Portillo, referred to as a "" Christian trade union leader "" in the complaint presented by the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unionists. The observations initially sent by the Government on  May  appeared to attribute this and other crimes to a clandestine organisation whose purpose was to promote agitation among workers and their unions. These observations referred to Mr. Portillo as a "" trade union leader "". The Committee examined the abovementioned documents at its session held in February  and recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the investigations which the Government had stated it would make to clear up this matter.
.At its session held in May  the Committee took note of a further communication from the Government, dated  January , which stated in substance that the investigation undertaken had not up to that time established the identity of the criminal or criminals or the motive for the crime, but that, in the opinion of the Government, there were no grounds for supposing the murder of Mr. Portillo to be necessarily connected with trade union activities and that in any case the Government was not responsible in any way for what had happened. The information submitted to the Committee to enable it to consider the case was not detailed or consistent enough to show whether the act denounced by the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unionists and which in itself constituted a crime was in any way connected with freedom of association. In these circumstances the Committee recommended the Governing Body in paragraph  of its th Report to express the hope that all steps necessary to establish the truth would be taken and to request the Government to keep it informed of any fresh information that might come to light.
.The Government answered this request for information by a communication dated  November  from which it appeared that the motive for the crime and the identity of its perpetrator were still unknown. The Government went on to state that it had made inquiries in order to ascertain whether Mr. Portillo was in actual fact a trade union leader, and attached an attestation signed by the Vice-President of the Authentic Trade Union Federation of Honduras (F.A.S.H.) which stated that Mr. Portillo had never been a member of any of the member unions of F.A.S.H or held any office of employment in that organisation. The Government therefore considered that the person in question was not a trade unionist, although that circumstance in no way affected the continuation of the inquiry concerning his death.
.Summing up the case, the Committee notes that, in the first place, the complaint referred to Mr. Portillo as a "" Christian trade union leader "" without giving further details. In the second place, the Government, after referring to Mr. Portillo as a trade union leader in its initial communications and giving indications that his assassination had been an act of terrorism aimed at workers and their unions, had subsequently stated that it had reached the conviction that he was not a trade unionist, and had reported that the investigation of the crime had produced no results up to the time of writing.
.In the circumstances, in view of the discrepancy between the terms of the complaint and those of the Government's observations as regards Mr. Portillo's capacity as a trade union leader, and bearing in mind the vagueness of the information set forth in the complaint and the fact that the investigation carried out by the authorities has not brought to light the exact circumstances of the crime, it does not appear that sufficient proof has been furnished to show that the assassination of Mr. Humberto Portillo raises any question relating to the exercise of trade union rights which would warrant further examination of this complaint.
.The Committee examined this case previously at its meeting in February , when it submitted an interim report appearing in paragraphs  to  of its nd Report, approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session (May ).
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its complaint dated  March  the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unionists alleged that the trade union leader Humberto Portillo had been murdered. In its reply dated  May , which is summarised in paragraph  of the nd Report, the Government mentioned the existence and activities of an organisation (the Integrated Liberation Movement) devoted to terrorism and sabotage, which had gone so far as to attack persons with the purpose of embarrassing the trade unions and workers. These acts of violence had made three victims-two officials murdered on the north-coast banana plantations and a trade union leader, Mr. Humberto Portillo, shot dead in the streets of Tegucigalpa in December . As the Government had stated that investigations were going on with the purpose of throwing light on the death of Mr. Portillo, the Committee recommended the Governing Body in paragraph  of the above-mentioned report to request the Government to furnish all possible information on the results of the investigations. This recommendation was approved by the Governing Body and communicated to the Government by a letter dated  June .
.In a letter dated  January  the Government states that it has not so far been possible to throw light on the crime but that investigations continue. From a report of the National Investigation Department, enclosed with the letter, it appears that, although various suspects were taken into custody and questioned, they were released because their complicity in the crime could not be proved.
.The Government states that no responsibility in the matter can be attributed to it. It adds that since the motives of the crime are unknown, there is no proof that it was necessarily connected with the trade union activities of Mr. Portillo. In any case the matter comes within the competence of the courts of justice, whose responsibility it is to establish the truth. Lastly, the Government states that it reaffirms its intention of complying to the full with its international obligations, especially with respect to the preservation of freedom of association.
.The Committee takes note of these statements by the Government, which appear to modify those contained in the latter's communication of  May , since the earlier statements seemed to be based on the assumption that Mr. Portillo had been murdered because he was a trade union leader, by members of an organisation devoted to embarrassing the trade unions and workers by this and other acts.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to take note of the statement by the Government that it has not yet been possible to throw light on the circumstances relating to the murder of the trade union leader Mr. Humberto Portillo;(b) to take note that the competent authorities are continuing to investigate the case;(c) to express the hope that the Government will take all the necessary steps to establish the truth concerning this grave matter;(d) to request the Government to be good enough to inform the Governing Body of everything new arising in connection with the case;(e) to take note of this interim report, on the understanding that the Committee will submit a new report when the Government has supplied the information referred to in subparagraph (d).
.The complaint of the Latin American Confederation of Christian Trade Unionists is contained in a communication dated  March . It was transmitted to the Government, which forwarded its observations on  May .
.Honduras has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communication the complainants beg the I.L.O to intervene with the Government with a view to its explaining the murder of the Christian trade union leader Humberto Portillo.
.In its reply of  May  the Government states that there exists in the country an organisation of young communists whose mission is to commit acts of terrorism and sabotage. This organisation, known as the Integrated Liberation Movement, has engaged in propaganda through the distribution of leaflets, and followed this up with acts of violence such as bomb explosions and armed attacks. In its desire to upset the trade unions and the workers the organisation went on to attack individuals. This last spell of violence",-1,1964,Honduras
116,"culminated in three deaths: two officials murdered on the north coast banana plantations and a trade union leader (Humberto Portillo) shot dead in the streets of Tegucigalpa. The latter event occurred early in December . Mr. Portillo was walking along one of the city streets when shots were fired at him from a car which immediately vanished. It has not been possible up to now to identify its occupants. The National Investigation Corps is still investigating this crime; several clues have been discovered which it is hoped will lead to the clearing up of the mystery.
.At its meeting in November  the Committee took cognizance of this case and decided to postpone examination of it until its next meeting, when it was hoped that fresh information would have been received from the Government as to the results of the inquiries being made. Up to now no such information has been forthcoming, despite the fact that the crime was committed in December  and that according to the Government's own statement several clues were being followed up which it was hoped would lead to the clearing up of the mystery.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to request the Government to be good enough to furnish all the information it has available concerning the results of the inquiries into the alleged murder of Mr. Humberto Portillo, and to keep it fully informed of any fresh light which may be thrown on the case.Geneva,  February .

.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).

118,".The original complaint was submitted on  July  by the Standard Fruit Company Workers' Union (SITRASFRUCO). A copy of the complaint was forwarded to the Government of Honduras, by letter dated  July , for its observations. These were forwarded on  September .
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the complaint the interference of the public authorities in the internal affairs of the Union is denounced. It is stated in this connection that during the Eighth Congress of SITRASFRUCO on  May  the President of the Honduran Republic sent a telegram to the Department Political Governor which read as follows:I have been informed that in the Eighth Ordinary Congress of the Workers of the Standard Fruit Company there are marked anti-democratic tendencies to obtain the inclusion in the Executive of the Union of elements of noted Marxist affiliation, some of whom have recently travelled in communist Cuba. Since the Constitution of the Republic prohibits all activity contrary to the democratic spirit of the Honduran Republic, please inform the most responsible leaders of the labour movement in this sector of employment that any infiltration of Marxist elements in the ranks of the Executive members will be considered as a practice harmful to the trade union movement, to worker/employer relations and to relationships between the Government and the workers' trade union organisations. Please get in touch with the trade union leaders of democratic views and inform me concerning the success of these steps designed to reinforce the democratic conquests achieved during the era of the Second Republic.Affectionately yours,(Signed) Ramn VILLEDA MORALES,President of the Republic.
.The complainants consider that this is a case of interference in trade union activities in contravention of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants also state that, ever since the change in the Executive Committee of the Union was registered with the Directorate-General of Labour, the authorities have declared that registration to be suspended without allowing the right to uphold legally the effects of the registration.
.In its reply the Government states that the presidential message does not imply any violation of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ). In fact under the National Constitution workers and employers may associate freely for the exclusive purposes of their economic and social activity. It appears that certain leaders of SITRASFRUCO engage in Marxist activities, which are prohibited by the National Constitution. Also under the Labour Code trade unions are not permitted to engage in party activities. In the above-mentioned message the workers were merely reminded that the trade union organisations guaranteed by Honduran legislation are inimical to communist trade union associations. In no case was there any question of limiting the right of election of trade union representatives.
.The Government also contests the allegation that in suspending the effect of the registration of the new Executive Committee Convention No.  was violated. The Government transmits in this connection the documents drawn up by the administrative authorities with regard to the facts related, as well as a copy of the award made on this matter by the Supreme Court of Justice. According to these documents, on  June , Mr. Hctor Costa Romero informed the Directorate-General of Labour of the change in the Executive Committee of which he was President. The Directorate-General confirmed that from the formal point of view the change in the Executive Committee had been accomplished legally. A few days later it was reported by the Directorate-General that irregularities had taken place in the election of that committee and the registration of another Executive Committee elected by dissident members of the Congress was requested. What happened was that, when the time came for the election of the new Executive Committee during the Eighth Congress of SITRASFRUCO, some dissident delegates abandoned the meeting and decided to elect their own Executive Committee. This occurred in the night of  May- June . In view of these facts and faced with the existence of two Executive Committees, the Directorate-General of Labour decided that the election of the trade union representatives would be temporarily without effect until the appropriate investigation had been made and until the defects of the action taken during the Congress had been rectified. The present complainants did not make an appeal against this decision of the Directorate-General.
.Subsequently another impeachment of the legality of the election of the Executive Committee with Mr. Costa Romero as President was made. According to this a series of irregularities went on during the Congress until finally a group of from  to  delegates to the Congress withdrew and those who remained decided to give a vote of confidence to the present Executive Committee of the union. In accordance with the position thus described, Mr. Costa Romero informed the Directorate-General of Labour of the appointment of a new Executive Committee. In reality, according to the rules, the election should proceed by secret ballot, nominal or otherwise, and be carried out by the Council of Delegates. For his part, Mr. Costa Romero contested the terms of the impeachment, rejecting them and explaining that in all cases the provisions of the rules had been complied with.
.The Ministry of Labour, acting through the Labour Inspectorate in La Ceiba town, carried out an investigation with a view to ascertaining whether the Congress proceeded in conformity with the legal provisions and the rules in force. According to the results of the investigation a series of acts took place which were in contravention of the provisions of the Labour Code and of the rules of the union. Consequently, the Directorate-General of Labour determined that the acts which occurred in the Congress were tainted with nullity and that neither of the two executive committees were valid. Mr. Costa Romero filed an appeal against this determination with the Supreme Court of Justice, which in its decision rejected that appeal on the grounds that no Constitutional guarantee had been violated. A few days before this decision a new Executive Committee had already been elected by the delegates duly accredited to the Thirteenth Extraordinary Congress of the Union.
.Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), provides that ""workers' and employers' organisations shall have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom, to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes"" and that the public authorities shall refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof. On a number of occasions the Committee has emphasised the importance it attaches to the generally accepted principle that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict the right of workers' organisations to elect their representatives in freedom and organise their administration and activities.
.The Committee notes that in the present case, at the time when the new Executive Committee was to be elected during the Congress held by SITRASFRUCO, a group of dissident delegates abandoned the meeting. This occurred immediately after the President of the Republic had sent the telegram mentioned in that complaint. In these circumstances the intervention of the President may have influenced the mood and the purpose of the delegates as well as influencing the attitude adopted in regard to the election of the new representatives of the organisation. The Committee considers that the fact that the authorities should intervene during the election proceedings of a union, expressing their opinion of the candidates and the consequences of the election, seriously challenges the principle whereby the trade union organisations are entitled to elect their representatives in full freedom.
.In regard to the allegations referring to the suspension of the effect of the registration of the new Executive Committee, the Committee observes that by reason of the measures of an administrative nature adopted by the Directorate-General of Labour the union was for some time deprived of ruling bodies and of representatives of the organisation. Already on other occasions the Committee has expressed the opinion that the removal by an administrative authority of a person from his office in a trade union is a procedure that might lead to abuses or to the violation of the generally recognised right which organisations possess of electing their representatives in full freedom and organising their own administration and activities.
.Since the suspension of the results of an election procedure may have similar effects to the suspension of the organisation itself, the Committee wishes to refer to what it has already pointed out on another occasion, namely that when the measures of suspension are adopted by the administrative authority there is a risk that they may appear arbitrary also when they are provisional and temporary and even when they are followed by judicial action. The Committee considers that the principles established in Article  of Convention No.  do not prevent supervision",1,1963,Honduras
119,"of control of the internal acts of a trade union if those internal acts do not violate legal provisions or rules. Nevertheless, the Committee considers that it is of maximum importance that, in order to guarantee an impartial and objective procedure, control should be exercised by the relevant judicial authority.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the attention of the Government to the importance which it has always attached to the principle that the public authorities should refrain from any intervention that might restrict the freedom of the workers' organisations to elect their representatives in full freedom;(b) to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that if the authorities intervene during the election proceedings of a union, expressing their opinion on the candidates and on the possible consequences of the elections, this constitutes a serious infringement of the principle that trade union organisations have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom;(c) to decide, with regard to the alleged administrative intervention arising out of the election of trade union representatives, to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that, in the event of it proving necessary to exercise any control over the internal acts of a trade union, it is of paramount importance, in order to guarantee an impartial and objective procedure, that such control should be exercised by the competent judicial authority.",0,1963,Honduras
120,".In accordance with Resolution No. A (XV) adopted on  April  by the Economic and Social Council, the Secretary-General of the United Nations transmitted to the Director-General of the I.L.O a communication dated  July , from the Honduras Brewery and Aerated Waters Workers' Union, San Pedro Sula, containing allegations of infringements of the exercise of trade union rights by the Government of Honduras.
.The complaint was communicated to the Government which forwarded its observations thereon in a letter dated  October .
.In the present case, clearly, no essential public service was involved. In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to draw the attention of the Government to the importance which it attaches to the fact that any use which is made of the police in the event of a strike, when exceptional circumstances so require, should be limited to the maintenance of public order and should not be for the purpose of breaking the strike, which might constitute a violation of trade union rights. However, in the present case, as it has not been established that the police and armed forces were used for the purpose of breaking the strike, which, moreover, was of short duration, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that no useful purpose would be served by pursuing further its examination of this aspect of the case.",-1,1958,Honduras
121,".The allegations made in a letter, dated  March , of the Confederation of Latin American Workers, as supplemented by its second letter of  April , are as follows.Allegations relating to Trade Union Policy and General Policy
.The Government of Honduras is said to have initiated a policy of repressing the trade union movement, and to have attacked the democratic Press, the students and the "" representatives of democratic movements fighting for democratic and trade union rights "". Hundreds of patriots are claimed to have been imprisoned without reason. The University is stated to have been occupied by police on  February  and a number of students to have been arrested and beaten up. The Government is said to have issued a series of decrees prohibiting public meetings, ordering forcible entry into private houses and permitting the seizure and violation of private correspondence. Members of the Government and of the foreign undertakings are said to have declared that they would "" shoot up "" any movement by workers in support of their claims, and to have organised punitive expeditions, with forces from the Basic Military School, against the banana workers. The Government is alleged to have declared its intention of seeking the armed intervention of the United States to stifle any attempt at national liberation. The Basic Military School is claimed to be under the command of United States officers and to have been established with funds from the United Fruit Company.
.In its second letter, dated  April , the Confederation of Latin American Workers adds-in connection with the specific allegations described later in this paper-that "" trade union and democratic rights, freedom of assembly, freedom of the press, freedom of association, freedom of movement and respect for human life are being subjected to serious limitations in Honduras "".Allegations relating to Legislative Decree No. , dated  February , respecting the Defence of the Democratic System
.The complainant organisation alleges that Legislative Decree No. , dated  February , was aimed principally at the working class and other democratic forces, and that through it "" the precarious individual and social guarantees have been totally liquidated "".Allegations relating to the Detention of Trade Unionists and Other Persons
.According to reports published in the daily El Cronista of  February , the police in Tegucigalpa detained on  February  and thereafter tortured Carlos M. Velzquez, official of the Tegucigalpa Butchers' Union, Guadalupe Reyes, General Secretary of the Building Workers' Union and Samuel Aguilera, General Secretary of the Tegucigalpa Tailors' Union. On  February, Humberto Laitano of the Boot and Shoe Industry Union is said to have been detained and "" savagely beaten up "" by the Tegucigalpa police. The "" workman "" Parker, a trade union official, is stated to have been also detained and tortured by the police of the same town.
.According to reports in the weekly Jornada of  February , Professor Julio C. Rivera of the Teachers' Union is alleged to have been arrested in Tegucigalpa on that day, Francisco Rios of the Tela Railroad Company Workers' Union is said to have been detained in La Ceiba on  January , Francisco Aguilar Martinez, Rubn Rodriguez, Santos Velzquez and Rodolfo Lpez, all workmen, are reported to have been arrested in Tegucigalpa at the end of February.
.Medardo Garcia, Efrain Irias Durn and Hctor Romero, officials of the Standard Fruit Company Workers' Union, are stated to have been detained and tortured at La Ceiba on  February  and have later been imprisoned in the Tegucigalpa penitentiary.
.Ral E. Estrada, Roberto Pancham, Cleo Gonzlez, Rufino Sosa and Jos Cubas Gross, members of the executive committee of the Tela Railroad Company Workers' Union (a union affiliated to the Inter-American Regional Organisation of Workers), are said to have been detained at the Port of Tela at the end of February .
.At the end of the same month the engineer Francisco Milla Bermdez, "" Dr. "" Paredes, and a university graduate named Jos Pineda Gmez, persons belonging to "" militant democratic and liberal circles "" were detained ; Manuel de Jess Pineda, a journalist, is reported in the local press to have been mortally wounded in reprisal for criticisms of the Government ; Len Adalberto Custodio and the "" poet "" Pompeyo del Valle, both progressive newspaper men, are stated to have been beaten up by the police of Tegucigalpa ; Buda Gautama Fonseca, university student, and other leaders of the Honduras University Students' Federation are said to have been threatened by the military commandant of Tegucigalpa because of a student meeting.
.The officials of the Melcher Estate Committee in Tela (La Lima area), which is a unit of the Tela Railroad Workers' Union, are stated to have been detained on  March  by order of the military commandant of the town. On  March Arturo Cardona and Daniel Ramos, railway workers who are General Secretary and Secretary of Minutes respectively of Section  of the Standard Fruit Company Union, are stated to have been detained at Los Planes (La Ceiba area). On  March three workmen, Abraham Castillo Flores, Conrado Ziga Zepeda and Rubn Rodriguez Andrade, are stated to have been detained in Tegucigalpa and sent to the Central Penitentiary. On the same day a warrant of commitment was issued by Criminal Court No.  of Tegucigalpa, for the alleged offence of "" subversive activity "", against the trade unionists Rodolfo Lopz, Abraham Castillo Flores, Conrado Ziga Zepeda, Francisco Aguilar Martinez, Samuel Aguilera Bohrquez, Carlos Martinez Velzquez, Guadalupe Reyes Guzmn and Rubn Rodriguez Andrade (all already mentioned in connection with their detention).ANALYSIS OF THE REPLY
.The Government of Honduras presented its comments on the above allegations in letters dated  May and  June  ; the second of these letters consists of an analysis of the documentary evidence transmitted by the Government. The following is a combined summary of the Government's comments and the documentary evidence submitted.Allegations relating to Trade Union Policy and General Policy
.The Government states on this point that it has at no time carried out a policy of repressing the trade union movement and that on the contrary it is the only government in the history of the country which has promoted social progress ; it has brought Honduras into the International Labour Organisation ; issued laws, such as the Charter of Labour Guarantees and the Trade Unions Law prepared with the technical advice of the I.L.O, which provide for a trade union system of the most authentic liberal pattern ; moreover, since the time of the alleged occurrences mentioned in the complaint of the Confederation of Latin American Workers it has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ). This legislation, including the provisions relating to freedom of association, has been fully implemented and it is hardly likely that the Government would ratify international Conventions if it were unable to apply them, or would repress a trade union movement which it had encouraged itself. The Government points out that the complainant organisation has not cited a single fact which can be regarded as an actual violation of the above national and international provisions.
.As regards the other allegations of a general character (apart from those relating to university matters which the Government-while rejecting them -considers to be outside the question of free exercise of trade union rights) the Government states that in Honduras both nationals and aliens enjoy and exercise all the liberties of the person in the same way and to the same extent as in the other democratic countries. A glance at the local papers would show the extent to which the right of assembly and freedom of speech are exercised, and no case of their limitation has been reported. It would be inconceivable, continues the Government, that any authority should issue decrees, as the complainant organisation maintains, ordering forcible entry of private houses, violation and seizure of correspondence, etc. Such acts may be carried out but only a cynical and ignorant dictatorship would issue decrees on the subject.
.The Government emphasises that the allegations of the Confederation of Latin American Workers respecting alleged declarations by "" individuals in the Government and foreign undertakings "" on the shooting up of any movement by workers in support of their claims are entirely unspecific. Who are these "" individuals "" in the Government and foreign undertakings ? Where are the victims of the alleged "" punitive "" methods practised ? The allegation that the Government has asked for the open armed intervention of the United States to suppress any attempt at national liberation represents a gratuitous insult against a free and independent State whose citizens will never accept intervention from a foreign power. The United Fruit Company has nothing to do with the Basic Military School. The only schools maintained by this undertaking are those prescribed by the law for the education of the workers' children, such as the Pan American Agricultural",-1,1956,Honduras
122,"School in El Zamoramo.Allegations relating to Legislative Decree No. , dated  February , respecting the Defence of the Democratic System
.The decree in question which is entitled "" Law for the Defence of the Democratic System Prevailing in the Republic "" has no relationship whatever to trade union matters. None of the guarantees enjoyed by workers' organisations as such, and none of the guarantees against discrimination on the grounds of trade union membership, are diminished in the least through the operation of the decree. The scope of the decree cannot come into conflict with the scope of the Trade Unions Law. If in a concrete case any question of this sort were to arise, the case would be settled in the following manner : since the Trade Unions Law is a special law it must be applied to the case in question, thus excluding the application of Legislative Decree No. , which is a general law of the penal type.
.The Government states, nevertheless, that it must be recognised that the promulgation of the law for the defence of the democratic system is the fundamental cause of the hostility shown by the Confederation of Latin American Workers towards the Honduras authorities. That law is not directed against the working class and democratic forces, as the complaint alleges, but against international communism. Its aim is limited to the prohibition of the Communist Party and related organisations and to defining acts constituting an offence against national security.Allegations relating to the Detention of Trade Unionists and Other Persons
.As regards the detention of Carlos M. Velzquez, Guadalupe Reyes and Samuel Aguilera, the Government states that Messrs. Velzquez and Aguilera cannot be officials of the alleged Butchers' and Tailors' Unions respectively, as there is no record of the existence of these unions in the register of workers' organisations kept in the Labour Department of the Office of the Secretary of State (of which the Government submits duly legalised documentary evidence). The status of these persons as trade union officials is merely affirmed by the Confederation of Latin American Workers without proof or foundation. Guadalupe Reyes is, indeed, the General Secretary of the Building Workers' Union, but his status as a trade union official does not exempt him from ordinary criminal liability. A legalised document issued by Criminal Court No.  of the Francisco Morazn Department, dated  May , shows that the three persons in question were prosecuted on  January  in that Court by the Office of the Director-General of Police, for the offence of Communist activity. The same Court, on  February  (as shown by a document also issued on  May ), issued an order for the preventive detention of the same persons "" by reason of the offence of Communist activity for the purpose of establishing a Communist system in Honduras, the acts being committed in Tegucigalpa in the last months of last year () and the first months of this year "". The detention order is based on Legislative Decree No.  of  February  and the ordinary legislation on judicial procedure. The Government stated that these proceedings are matters within the normal jurisdiction of the judiciary and that the head of the State has no power to intervene in them owing to the separation of powers. The three persons in question are at present held at the pleasure of the judge in the Central Penitentiary.
.As regards the alleged detention of Humberto Laitano, the Government submits a document issued by the same Court on  May , showing that information against this person was lodged by the Office of the Director-General of Police for the offence of Communist activity and that he is now a fugitive from justice. On the other hand there is no "" Boot and Shoe Industry Union "" in Honduras and therefore Laitano cannot be regarded as a militant worker for a non-existent organisation. As regards the alleged detention and torture of the ""workman "" Parker (whose full name and trade union are not given by the complainant organisation), the Government states that this is probably a man named Douglas Parker who was tried in Criminal Court No.  at San Pedro Sula (Corts Department) for the attempted kidnapping of a minor. Because of the infrequency of this offence in Honduras the local press devoted considerable space to it, and the Government feels that the Confederation of Latin American, Workers extracted these references from the newspapers, adding the words ""workman"" and ""trade union official"" to the name of the offender.
.The Government has been unable to obtain any information on the alleged seizure of Professor Julio C. Rivera, except that the weekly Jornada (the source mentioned by the complainant organisation) and the Teachers' Union (of which Professor Rivera is stated to be an official) are unknown in Honduras. Mr. Francisco Rios does not appear in the books of the Tela Railroad Company Workers' Union according to a certificate issued by the secretary of this organisation on  May . Messrs. Francisco Aguilar Martinez, Rubn Rodriguez and Rodolfo Lpez (the person called "" Santos Velzquez "" is probably Mr. Carlos M. Velzquez already mentioned) do not appear in the membership lists of the trade union organisations and are detained at the Central Penitentiary under imprisonment orders made by Criminal Court No.  of the Francisco Morazn Department on  February and  March  for the offence of Communist activity. According to the relevant documents issued by that court, they were prosecuted by the Office of the Director-General of Police on  January .
.As regards the allegation relating to the detention and torture of Medardo Garcia, Efrain Irias Durn and Hctor Romero, officials of the Standard Fruit Company Workers' Union, the Government states that there is no such person as Medardo Garcia among the officials of this union. Durn and Romero submit affidavits (which the Government encloses after legalisation), both dated  May . Durn stated "" It is true ... that I was detained on  February but it is not a fact that I was tortured by the Director of Police or by any other authority "". Romero states ""We were not beaten by the Director of Police ; on the contrary, we were treated with great consideration and were not interfered with by any of the authorities"". The Government explains that when these officials attempted to start a strike last February before carrying out the mediation and conciliation procedures prescribed by law, they were summoned to the office of the Director of Police in La Ceiba and informed that the authorities would not permit illegal strikes. When the Ministry of Labour learned of this, it took the necessary action to ensure that Durn and Romero were not interfered with in their trade union activity and an official of the Ministry was sent to La Ceiba. With the assistance of this official an agreement was reached between the union and the undertaking, and both trade union officials took an active part in the negotiations. The Government emphasises that paragraph III of this agreement signed in La Ceiba on  January  states that "" the discussions took place in complete harmony and both sides were able to express their points of view quite freely "". The Government has submitted a copy of the agreement and states that Messrs. Durn and Romero are continuing to act as trade union officials.
.As regards the detention of members of the executive committee of the Tela Railroad Company Workers' Union at the end of February in the port of Tela, the Government states that Messrs. Ral Edgardo Estrada, Roberto Pancham, Cleo Gonzlez, Rufino Sosa and Jos Cubas Gross were detained by the Tegucigalpa police for six days, which is the term permitted by the Honduras criminal procedure legislation for inquiries in cases of reported attempts to subvert public order. It was found that, despite the statutory provisions prohibiting the intervention of trade unions in political activities, "" these persons had been having lengthy interviews with the director of the anti-Government campaign for the purpose of successfully co-operating in an armed revolt or in a general strike of a political character "". When the Ministry of Labour learned of this detention, it intervened in view of the fact that the detainees were trade union officials, so that they might be freed at the end of the time allowed for inquiry. As certified by the Director of the Central Penitentiary, they were released and are continuing to carry out their trade union functions. The Government adds that the police, as the authority responsible for public order, makes no distinction between presumed offenders according to membership or non-membership of trade unions.
.Although these cases have nothing to do with the exercise of trade union rights, as is apparent from the text of the complaint, the Government offers the following explanations as regards Messrs. Francisco Milla Bermdez, ""Dr. "" Paredes, Jos Pineda Gmez, Manuel de Jess Pineda, Lon Adalberto Custodio, Pompeyo del Valle and",-1,1956,Honduras
123,"Buda Gautama Fonseca, who are "" all politicians of the Opposition "". Mr. Bermdez, ex-Councillor of State, has at no time been imprisoned ; Mr. Pineda Gmez is at liberty ; Mr. Manuel de Jess Pineda, lawyer at Santa Rosa de Copn, was attacked by a personal enemy ; Mr. Pompeyo del Valle is at complete liberty in San Pedro Sula and there is no record of his ever having been detained ; and Mr. Fonseca is working freely in Tegucigalpa as a student leader. It has not been possible to identify the person cited by the complainant as "" Dr."" Paredes. Lon Adalberto Custodio (or Jos Lon Custodio) is a fugitive from justice, as certified by the Secretary of Criminal Court No.  of the Francisco Morazn Department, following the laying of information against him (and the other persons already mentioned) by the police on  January  for the offence of Communist activity.
.As regards the detention of the officials of the Melcher Estate Committee in Tela, on the orders of the local military commandant, the Government states that the investigations (as evidenced by the police records and other documentary proof) showed that on  March  the foreman Santiago Olivera of the Melcher Estate was assaulted by the secretary of the union of that Estate and by three other men in the local police station during a discussion. The assaulted man asked the authorities to intervene, and they ordered the attackers to be apprehended and held for the competent criminal judge. The documents submitted show that on  March the persons detained had already been released. This was therefore a detention for the purpose of clearing up an ordinary misdemeanour of armed aggression.
.As regards the detention of Arturo Cardona and Daniel Ramos of the Standard Fruit Company Union, the Government states that the local subcommandant at La Paz detained them when he found them holding a trade union meeting in preparation for a labour congress to be held in La Ceiba. When the Minister of Labour was informed by telegram by another trade union official on  March  he communicated with the commandant of the armed forces in the Department, asking him to release the detained persons and to order sanctions to be taken against the subcommandant. On the same day an order was given for the release of the detained persons and the subcommandant responsible for the illegal detention was removed from his post. The released trade union officials themselves thanked the Minister of Labour for his intervention in a telegram dated  March . This fact, adds the Government, constitutes proof of the confidence felt by the trade union officials in the authorities.
.Lastly, as regards the allegation that the workmen Abraham Castillo Flores, Conrado Ziga Zepeda and Rubn Rodriguez Andrade were detained on  March  and sent to the Central Penitentiary, and that on the same day a warrant of commitment was issued for the offence of subversive activity against the trade unionists Rodolfo Lpez, Francisco Aguilar Martinez, Samuel Aguilera Bohrquez, Carlos Martinez Velzquez and Guadalupe Reyes Guzmn, the Government refers to the document issued by Criminal Court No.  of the Francisco Morazn Department on  May , showing that all the persons are undergoing preventive detention in the Central Penitentiary in virtue of orders dated  February and  March . The Government emphasises that the Executive has no power to intervene in acts of the judiciary since judges and courts are subordinate exclusively to the High Court of Justice and are completely independent in their functions.
.Having regard to all these considerations, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to take note of the ratification by Honduras of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ) ;(b) to decide that, subject to drawing the attention of the Government of Honduras to the observations contained in paragraphs ,  and  above, the case as a whole does not call for further examination.",-1,1956,Honduras
