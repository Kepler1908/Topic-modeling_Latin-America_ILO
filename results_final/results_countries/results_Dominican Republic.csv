0,".The complaint is contained in a communication dated  June  from the National Confederation of Trade Union Unity (CNUS) and the Dominican Association of Teachers (ADP).
.The Government sent its reply in communications dated  August ,  February  and  September .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants report that there is a legal prohibition of the right to strike in the public education sector. In particular, they allege that:In the context of the activities that were planned and carried out in the framework of ADP s plan of action to demand a pay rise for teachers, as well as the payment of unpaid wages that have not been received, starting on  January , there were isolated work stoppages in various public schools in Barahona province, none of which endangered the progress of the school year.Several sectors, mainly those with business connections to education, carried out a broad media campaign against ADP, as a way of avoiding public sector labour demands that they would later press for to improve conditions in the private sector. The activities carried out by ADP were twisted and blown up to such an extent that it led to an appeal for amparo (remedy for the protection of constitutional rights) by several people who were supposedly representing a number of children who were supposedly studying at the schools where protests had taken place, facts that were never proven in the subsequent legal proceedings.As a consequence of that appeal for amparo, on  March , the First Chamber of the Civil, Commercial and Labour Panel of the Court of First Instance of Barahona handed down ruling No. -: (a) ordering ADP to immediately lift its teaching stoppage and to call on the teaching staff to return to work; (b) warning ADP, going forward, to refrain from teaching stoppages that impede the fundamental right to education, because that takes precedence over the others, without prejudice to the legitimate right of ADP to make its demands to the competent authorities by other legal means; (c) affirming that stopping classes was illegal since preschool, primary and secondary school education are mandatory, and (d) imposing a penalty of , Dominican pesos (approximately US$) per day for any delay in compliance with the ruling, to be paid to the vocational school of the armed forces and the national police of Barahona.In the light of this ruling, ADP lodged an appeal for review with the Constitutional Tribunal, which unfortunately, in ruling TC//, dated  May , rejected the appeal and upheld the ruling. The complainants report that with this decision, the Constitutional Tribunal treated the education sector as an essential service, which contradicts the Committee s comments on the matter.
.The complainants believe that the fact that the exercise of the right to strike in the sector is not regulated ' even though it is generally recognized in the Constitution ' should not have led the courts to deny its existence. In that regard, they believe that in order to resolve the situation it is necessary to amend the applicable legislation so that it explicitly recognizes the right to strike in the public education sector. The complainants also state that the other dispute resolution mechanisms that the Constitutional Court referred to, such as mediation or arbitration in collective disputes, which are applicable to the private sector in the framework of the Labour Code, are not accessible to the public education sector, since neither the Civil Service Act (No. -) nor the Labour Relations Regulations provide for such mechanisms. The complainants believe that this leaves public education workers completely defenceless.
.The Government sent its observations on the case in communications dated  August ,  February  and  September .
.The Government notes that, in accordance with the Civil Service Act No. - and its implementing Regulation No. -, strikes are prohibited in the essential public services ' that is, those whose interruption could endanger the life, health or security of citizens ' although those who provide those kinds of services can submit the labour dispute for the consideration of the personnel committee of the relevant body.
.With regard to the specific case that is the subject of the complaint, the Government provides a transcript of the text of the  May  Constitutional Court ruling, which upheld the ruling that was appealed and in which it was established that: (i) a series of marches, pickets, meetings and partial teaching stoppages were held to call for improvements in the working conditions in public schools in the Barahona area and that these partial teaching stoppages affected the school hours that the students should have received, so a number of parents and tutors made an appeal for amparo; (ii) the teaching stoppages for the strike called by ADP seriously harmed the right to education and equality, since students at private schools had no such interruptions to their curriculums; (iii) minor students should not be used as a means to resolve disputes and have the right to receive a public education in the same conditions as everyone else; (iv) progressive and indiscriminate teaching stoppages, not taking into account the pupils' families, have collateral effects on fundamental rights, in that: they disrupt the student body with regard to the discipline developed in keeping up with educational commitments; they affect family scheduling in the social, economic and labour order, as well as food security; they change the emotional state of parents who take advantage of the time that their children are at school to become professionals and join the labour market; and they also change the emotional state of families in at-risk or vulnerable situations related to their children, and (v) as a result, the Court considered that free public education at the preschool, primary and secondary levels should be added to the traditional definition of essential services ' those whose stoppage endangers the life, health or security of people in all or part of the population ' in cases when there is a  progressive, prolonged and indiscriminate' teaching stoppage.
.In addition, the Government reports that, after the ruling, ADP and the Ministry of Education signed an agreement for quality education on  January , in which, with a view to obtaining a harmonious atmosphere that contributes to quality education, both parties committed, among other things: (i) to commit to adhere to the school timetable throughout the country; (ii) not to interfere in each other s affairs or structures, agreeing to maintain mutual respect; and (iii) that teacher transfers will be carried out with the consent of district and regional human resources, and ADP s suggestions will be heard.
.The present complaint alleges the prohibition, by means of a judicial ruling, of the right to strike in the public education sector. The Committee observes that, according to the ruling in question from the Constitutional Court, the actions underlying the complaint were  a series of marches, pickets, meetings and partial teaching stoppages to call for improvements in the working conditions in public schools' in the Barahona area, and that  these partial teaching stoppages affected the school hours that the students should have received, so a number of parents and tutors made an appeal for amparo'  The Committee observes that, as a result of the amparo, the Constitutional Court decided, based on its considerations, to  classify free public education at the preschool, primary and secondary levels as an essential service when there is a progressive, prolonged and indiscriminate teaching stoppage' 
.The Committee is not in a position to begin assessing the impact that the strike whose prohibition resulted in the presentation of the complaint could have had. The Committee recalls that what is meant by essential services in the strict sense of the term depends to a large extent on the particular circumstances prevailing in a country. Moreover, this concept is not absolute, in the sense that a non-essential service may become essential if a strike lasts beyond a certain time or extends beyond a certain scope, thus endangering the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population. The Committee also recalls that where the right to strike is restricted or prohibited in certain essential undertakings or services, adequate protection should be given to the workers to compensate for the limitation thereby placed on their freedom of action with regard to disputes affecting undertakings or services. The Committee further recalls that although the education sector does not constitute an essential service in the strict sense of the term and the possible long-term consequences of strikes in the teaching sector do not justify their prohibition, minimum services may be established in the education sector, in full consultation with the social partners, in cases of strikes of long duration. [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , paras , , ,  and",0,2019,Dominican Republic
1,"]. The Committee invites the Government, in consultation with ADP, to take the necessary measures to guarantee the exercise of the right to strike in the public education sector, including the possibility of establishing mechanisms to secure minimum services in full consultation with the social partners, in cases of strikes of long duration. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments.
.The Committee observes that according to the complainants' allegations, which the Government does not deny in its reply, public school teachers lack access to dispute resolution mechanisms that are available to private school workers, such as mediation or arbitration in collective disputes. The Committee notes that an agreement has been signed between the Ministry of Education and the ADP with a view to obtaining a harmonious atmosphere that contributes to quality education in the country and observes that the text of the agreement reflects a positive step in the dialogue between the parties and includes commitments on a number of matters. The Committee also observes that the agreement lacks specific provisions for the management of collective labour disputes. The Committee recalls that according to the Voluntary Conciliation and Arbitration Recommendation,  (No. ), voluntary conciliation machinery, appropriate to national conditions, should be made available to assist in the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes between employers and workers. Provision should be made to enable the procedure to be set in motion, either on the initiative of any of the parties to the dispute or ex officio by the voluntary conciliation authority [see Compilation, para. ]. In that regard, the Committee invites the Government to include in its consultations with ADP the consideration of measures to ensure the existence of adequate mechanisms for the resolution of collective disputes in the public education sector.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee invites the Government, in consultation with ADP, to take the necessary measures to guarantee the exercise of the right to strike in the public education sector, including the possibility of establishing mechanisms to secure minimum services in full consultation with the social partners, in cases of strikes of long duration. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments.(b)	The Committee invites the Government to include in its consultations with ADP the consideration of measures to ensure the existence of adequate mechanisms for the resolution of collective disputes in the public education sector.",0,2019,Dominican Republic
2,".The complaint is contained in a communication of the National Confederation of Trade Union Unity (CNUS), the National Union of Nursing Workers (SINATRAE) and the National Union of Health Technicians and Employees (SINATESA) dated  June .
.The Government sent observations in a communication dated  February .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communication of  June , the complainants allege that the Government of the Dominican Republic, through the National Council on Aging (hereinafter  the health body' , an official body attached to the Ministry of Health, has committed a series of violations of the principles of freedom of association and collective bargaining.
.The complainants indicate that on  August , SINATRAE, SINATESA and other trade unions from the health sector of the Dominican Republic signed an agreement with the Ministry of Health awarding nurses, bioanalysts, psychologists, dental surgeons and pharmacists a salary increase from January , pension calculation based on the last full salary, and incentives based on performance and seniority. The complainants state, however, that the health body refused to apply the agreement, including the negotiated salary increases, to nurses, technicians and employees providing services in the old people s homes and centres that are under its management. This led to a series of peaceful protests that, according to the allegations, resulted in the following retaliatory action: (i) Mr Julio Cesar Garca Cruceta and Ms Argentina Abreu, directors of the complainant organizations, were prevented from accessing the facilities of the health body and the old people s homes and centres; and (ii) among others, Ms Mara Teresa Valladares Curro and Ms Francia Ybelice Rodrguez Heredia, nurses who are members of SINATRAE, were prevented from returning to work and have not received their salaries since April , despite the fact that no disciplinary proceedings had been instituted against them.
.As the health body declined to meet with the directors of SINATRAE and SINATESA, the complainants indicate that efforts to resolve the conflict and restore the rights that had been breached were unsuccessful. Consequently, the complainants allege that the practices of the health body, implemented by its director, violated the principles of freedom of association and the right to due process in accordance with the Constitution of the Republic and Act No. - on the Public Service, as well as ILO Conventions Nos  and . On that basis, the complainants seek an end to the antiunion practices, and in particular: (i) recognition of SINATRAE and SINATESA as legitimate representatives of nurses and the technicians and employees, respectively, who provide services in the old people s homes and centres that are under the responsibility of the health body, and access for their directors to the facilities of the health body; (ii) application of the terms of the agreement signed in August  by SINATRAE, SINATESA and other trade unions with the Ministry of Health to the workers of the health body, in particular with regard to the negotiated salary increase; and (iii) the return of Ms Mara Teresa Valladares Curro and Ms Francia Ybelice Rodrguez Heredia to their usual tasks and payment of the salaries due to them until they are reinstated in their respective posts.
.In its communication of  February , the Government indicates that SINATRAE and SINATESA are duly registered, and that there had never been any reports of their being prevented from representing nurses and the technicians and employees who provide services in old people s homes and centres. As to the alleged refusal of the health body to meet with representatives of SINATRAE and SINATESA, the Government states that on  April , Mr Julio Cesar Garca Cruceta and Ms Argentina Abreu were received at the facilities of the health body. According to the executive director of the health body, on that occasion SINATRAE demanded that the union dues of the nurses affiliated to it be remitted to it, which in accordance with Act No. - on the Public Service was not possible without the explicit authorization of the nurses. The director of the health body alleges that because the demand to automatically remit the union dues to SINATRAE was denied, this led to the trade union accusing her of irregular management of funds.
.With regard to the alleged obstruction of access to the facilities of the health body and the old people s homes and centres, the Government states that on  June , as on other occasions, members of SINATRAE and SINATESA, including Mr Julio Cesar Garca Cruceta and Ms Argentina Abreu, were present in the San Francisco de Ass old people s home, where they promoted strikes and stoppages, despite the fact that Act No. - on the Public Service prohibits organizations of public servants from encouraging, initiating and supporting strikes in those public services whose disruption may endanger the life, health or safety of citizens. The Government indicates that persons providing this category of service are entitled to submit the labour dispute for the consideration of the human resources committee of the corresponding body, but that the said trade union organizations did not exhaust that process.
.Concerning the alleged non-application of the salary increase agreed upon with the Ministry of Health to the nurses who provide services in the various old people s homes and centres of the health body, the Government indicates that since the issuance of Decree No. - on  April , said nurses have been part of the health body s workforce, and no longer that of the Ministry of Health, which is why they are excluded from the application of the agreement with the Ministry. However, the Government indicates that annual performance reviews have awarded a salary increase for all staff working in the health body.
.Lastly, with respect to the alleged prevention from returning to work, specifically concerning Ms Mara Teresa Valladares Curro and Ms Francia Ybelice Rodrguez Heredia, the Government reports that both were dismissed from their posts for having committed, respectively, the following third-degree offences under article  of Act No.   on the Public Service: ' . Failing to be present at work for three () consecutive working days, or three () days in the same month, without authorization from the competent authority, or without good cause, thereby constituting job abandonment' and ' . Committing any other offences similar in nature or seriousness to the foregoing in the judgement of the authority that applies sanctions' 
.The Committee observes that this case refers, firstly, to the non-application of the Agreement between the National Government and the Workers' Organizations of the Health Sector, signed on  August , to the nurses, technicians and employees who provide services in the old people s homes and care centres managed by the health body and, secondly, to alleged antiunion acts following protests conducted by the trade union organizations with a view to obtaining the application of the said agreement.
.With regard to the non-application of the collective agreement of  August  to the workers of the health body, the Committee notes that the Government states that, under Decree No. -, since  April , the nurses under the direction of the health body report to that body for administrative purposes and no longer to the Ministry of Health, and therefore the Committee observes that there is a discrepancy between the parties on the scope of the aforementioned agreement. The Committee emphasizes, firstly, that it is not for the Committee to resolve disputes over the interpretation of the scope of clauses in collective agreements, as that is the responsibility of the national judicial organs or the specific bodies designated for that purpose by the same collective agreement. In this respect, the Committee recalls that, in the event of conflicting interpretations of a collective agreement in the public sector, the definitive interpretation should not be that of the public administration, which would be acting as judge as well as party in the case, but rather that of an independent authority [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , para. ].
.In the light of the foregoing, and observing that the parties make no reference to the existence of any judicial proceedings concerning the interpretation of the  collective agreement or to a process of dialogue to determine the arrangements for the exercise of the right to collective bargaining for the workers of the health body, the Committee trusts that the dispute over the scope of the  collective agreement will be resolved rapidly, whether through dialogue between the parties or through a decision of an independent authority. The Committee also emphasizes that, whatever the decision on the applicability of the collective agreement of  August  to the workers of the health body, the Government must ensure that those workers can exercise their right to collective bargaining.
.With regard to the alleged antiunion acts in response to the protests conducted by SINATRAE",0,2017,Dominican Republic
3,"and SINATESA to obtain the application of the agreement, the Committee notes that the complainants allege that, despite being peaceful, the protests resulted in the following retaliatory action: (i) the health body s lack of recognition of SINATRAE and SINATESA as legitimate representatives of the workers of the body, and the directors of those trade unions being prevented from accessing the facilities of the health body; and (ii) the exclusion of Ms Mara Teresa Valladares Curro and Ms Francia Ybelice Rodrguez Heredia, nurses who are members of SINATRAE, from their respective jobs, who have not received their salary since April , despite the fact that no disciplinary proceedings were initiated against them.
.The Committee notes that the Government states that there have never been any reports of the directors of SINATRAE and SINATESA having been prevented from representing nurses and the technicians and employees who provide services in the old people s homes and centres, and that on various occasions, the most senior directors of both unions accessed the health body s facilities, including to promote strikes and stoppages, despite a statutory prohibition on encouraging, initiating and supporting strikes in those public services whose disruption may endanger the life, health or safety of citizens. The Committee notes that the Government adds that the workers who provide this category of service are entitled to submit the labour dispute for the consideration of the human resources committee of the corresponding body but that the said trade union organizations did not use that process. Lastly, the Committee notes the documents provided by the Government showing that the nurses, Ms Mara Teresa Valladares Curro and Ms Francia Ybelice Rodrguez Heredia, were dismissed as a result of third-degree offences, in accordance with article  of Act No. - on the Public Service. According to the copies of the communications sent by the Government, Ms Mara Teresa Valladares Curro breached paragraph  of article :  Failing to be present at work for three () consecutive working days, or three days in the same month, without authorization from the competent authority, or without good cause, thereby constituting job abandonment'  and Ms Francia Ybelice Rodrguez Heredia breached paragraph  of article :  Committing any other offences similar in nature or seriousness to the foregoing in the judgement of the authority that applies sanctions' 
.As to the alleged non-recognition of SINATRAE and SINATESA as legitimate representatives of the workers of the health body, and the alleged denial of access of their directors to its facilities, the Committee observes that the Government denies these claims. In view of the differing versions of the Government and the complainant organizations, the Committee trusts that within the health body the right of the mentioned trade union organizations to access the working place of their members is fully respected .
.As to the situation of the nurses, Ms Mara Teresa Valladares Curro and Ms Francia Ybelice Rodrguez Heredia, while duly noting the documents provided by the Government on the dismissal of the two workers, the Committee observes that the Government does not respond to the allegation that the workers had not been subject to the disciplinary proceedings provided for in Act No. - on the Public Service, and that the offence that resulted in the dismissal of Ms Rodrguez is not specified. With a view to ensuring that the mechanisms affording appropriate protection against antiunion discrimination have been applied, the Committee requests the Government to take the requisite measures to verify that the disciplinary proceedings provided for in the legislation have been duly applied to both workers and to ensure that the grounds for the dismissals are not contrary to the principles of freedom of association.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee trusts that the dispute over the scope of the  collective agreement will be resolved rapidly, whether through dialogue between the parties or through a decision of an independent authority. The Committee also requests the Government to ensure that, whatever the decision on the aforementioned dispute over interpretation, the workers of the health body can exercise their right to collective bargaining.(b)	The Committee requests the Government to take the requisite measures to ensure that the disciplinary proceedings provided for in the legislation have been duly applied to Ms Mara Teresa Valladares Curro and Ms Francia Ybelice Rodrguez Heredia and to ensure that the grounds for the dismissals are not contrary to the principles of freedom of association.",0,2017,Dominican Republic
4,".The Committee last examined this case, which refers to anti-union dismissals in an airport sector company, at its October  session (see th Report, paras ' ). On that occasion, the Committee requested the Government to keep it informed of the judicial proceedings in which there would be an examination of the causes that gave rise to the dismissals of the members of the board of directors (Management Committee) of the workers' union of the enterprise (SITRAVIAM) and their alleged anti-union nature, and to send its observations with regard to the accusations against the membership of the Management Committee of a violation of State security, which had led to the decision of the National Department of Investigations (DNI) to withdraw the access card to the ramp and restricted areas of the airport.
.In a communication of  February , the Government indicates that: (i) on  July  it received a communication from the complainant, the National Confederation of Dominican Workers (CNTD), with information on a dialogue process between SITRAVIAM and the airport sector company in the framework of the Tripartite Round Table on Matters relating to International Labour Standards; and (ii) on  December , it received a communication from the Employers' Confederation of the Dominican Republic (COPARDOM) reporting that, as a result of the conciliation process with the intervention of the Mediation and Arbitration Directorate of the Ministry of Labour, SITRAVIAM and the airport sector company had settled their differences and reached an agreement. The Government attached a copy of the memorandum of settlement, of  November , in which, in addition to agreeing on various trade union demands relating to improvements in working conditions, it indicates that the parties briefly discussed the complaint that the trade union had presented to this Committee. The memorandum of settlement indicates that the trade union recognized that the facts that had led to the submission of this complaint had been resolved through frank and open dialogue, based on which the trade union supported its withdrawal.
.With respect to the withdrawal of the access card to the ramp and restricted areas of the airport, the Government indicates that the security checkpoints in the restricted areas of airports are in line with international security standards, as a protection and control measure both for aircraft crew and passengers, and hence the restriction applies to all workers working in the airport and therefore cannot be considered an anti-union measure.
.The Committee takes due note of the information provided by the Government. While it regrets that the Government had not provided information with respect to the judicial proceedings in which there would be an examination of the causes that gave rise to the dismissals of the members of Management Committee of SITRAVIAM and their alleged anti-union nature, the Committee, notes that, according to the tenth point of the above memorandum of settlement, SITRAVIAM stated that the facts that had provided the basis for the submission of the complaint had been successfully resolved. In the light of the above, the Committee considers that this case closed and will not pursue its examination.
.The complaint is contained in a communication of the National Confederation of Dominican Workers (CNTD) dated  June .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  January .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  June , the complainant organization indicates that due to poor working conditions, including low wages, long working hours and maltreatment, a group of workers at Aviam Ltd Aviation Ground Services (hereinafter the airport sector company) on  June  formed the Aviam Ltd Aviation Ground Services Workers' Union, and sent the accompanying documentation to the Ministry of Labour. In this regard, the complainant organization indicates that on  July , by Decision No. -, the Director-General of Labour approved the foundation of the union.
.The complainant organization indicates that on  June , the airport sector company was notified by Document No. - of the foundation of the union and of the membership of the board of directors (Management Committee) which included Messrs Ariel Silverio Peralta, ngel Ricardo Pea Perez, Luis Emilio Gonzlez Rodrguez, Roberto del Rosario Peralta, Alexis de Jess, Yey Marcos Santana Lugo, Rafaelito Medina Mndez, Claudio Gonzlez Solon, ngel Emilio Snchez Hernndez and Francisco Antonio Cuevas, Esther Rosario, Nicauris Henriquez Paredes and Netali Paredes Vsquez.
.The complainant organization alleges that as soon as it received notification of the establishment of the union, the airport sector company suspended the members of the Management Committee. On  July , the members of the Management Committee were notified (Document No. ) of their dismissal without stated cause (dismissal) in violation of the Labour Code on trade union immunity.
.According to the complainant organization, the flagrant violations committed by the airport sector company were confirmed during the inspection conducted by the Labour Inspectorate, which concluded in its report of  July  that the company, by its dismissal of the members of the Management Committee, had violated the freedom of association of the workers who had decided to form a trade union.
.The complainant organization points out that these reprisals against union activities constitute a violation of article  of the Constitution of the Dominican Republic and articles  and '  of the Labour Code, as well as of ILO Conventions Nos  and . In addition, it highlights that these dismissals not only caused serious economic, moral and social damage to the workers concerned, who lost their main means of subsistence, but also had a negative impact on the exercise of freedom of association since they created a hostile environment and widespread fear in the company and hindered the consolidation of the union.
.The trade union also denounces the lack of effectiveness of the national procedures and mechanisms to guarantee and protect freedom of association. In this respect, the complainant organization alleges that: (i) on  August , the union, supported by the CNTD, having exhausted all possible amicable and conciliatory means of resolving the conflict, lodged a formal claim seeking annulment of the dismissal, reinstatement, payment of lost wages and compensation for damages caused; (ii) on  March , by its Judgment No. -, the Labour Court of the La Altagracia judicial district declared the aforementioned claim valid in terms of form, but declared it inadmissible owing to insufficient legal grounds and lack of legal basis, ordering the union to pay costs; and (iii) on  March , the union and the workers concerned appealed Judgment No. - before the Labour Court of the San Pedro de Macors judicial department.
.The complainant organization alleges that the company requested extensions on four occasions in order to delay the appeals process. During the last hearing, which took place on  February , the company requested authorization from the Labour Court of the San Pedro de Macors judicial department to deposit certain documents, including a communication dated  February  from the National Department of Investigations (DNI), an intelligence agency under the authority of the armed forces of the Dominican Republic. This communication indicated that on  July , the DNI had required Punta Cana International Airport (AIPC) and the Specialized Airport Security Body (CESAC) to withdraw the access card to the ramp and restricted areas from members of the union s Management Committee, allegedly for reasons of national security, and that that measure remained in force.
.The complainant organization points out that accusing members of the Management Committee of acting against national security constitutes an extremely serious act, as it is associated with terrorist actions. Consequently, the members of the Management Committee, against whom this serious accusation has been made despite their not having a criminal record, have not only lost their jobs but have suffered serious repercussions in their personal and working lives, as well as in the exercise of their fundamental rights, such as the right to work and the right to freedom of movement, since it is common practice in the country to ask prospective workers for  certificates of good conduct' which are issued on the basis of information held by state security organizations, including the DNI.
.According to the complainant organization, the company presented the communication of the DNI as a means of evading responsibility for having made an unlawful dismissal. Furthermore, it indicates that the collusion of the DNI with the private company is inimical to freedom of association and thoroughly compromises the responsibility of the State, and concludes by indicating that the workers were subjected to anti-union discrimination.
.Lastly, the complainant organization requests the Committee to grant effective guarantees to the workers so that they can enjoy the right to organize and to order the company to desist from anti-union practices immediately, annul the dismissal of the workers, reinstate them in their normal work and pay them their lost wages.
.In its communication of  January , the Government indicates that: (i) on  June , the",0,2017,Dominican Republic
5,"union notified the company and the Ministry of Labour of the membership of the Management Committee; (ii) on  July , the company notified all members of the aforementioned union of the letter of dismissal; (iii) on  July , Mr Jacobo Ramos, President of the CNTD, made a request to Mr Luis Francisco Regalado, Director of Mediation and Arbitration and to Mr Andrs Valentn Herrera, Director-General of Labour in the Ministry of Labour for mediation in respect of the alleged violations of freedom of association; (iv) on  July , the Director of Mediation and Arbitration forwarded the request for mediation and inspection to the Director-General of Labour to order an investigation; (v) on  July , Mr Ariel Silverio Polanco, General Secretary of the airport sector company trade union, appeared before the Local Labour Representation of the Ministry of Labour alleging violations of freedom of association, including anti-union dismissals; the Ministry of Labour therefore appointed a labour inspector to conduct an investigation into the allegation; (vi) on  July , Decision No. - of the Director-General of Labour granting trade union registration was issued; (vii) the labour inspector, having conducted the inspection, concluded that the company was violating its workers' right to freedom of association and therefore proceeded to draft a warning report with a view to correcting the situation and, once the period granted had expired, drafted the corresponding violation report; (viii) on  July , the Directorate of Mediation and Arbitration summoned the company and the union to mediation which, at the request of the union and the company, was postponed on various occasions and took place on  September ; (ix) subsequently, the union brought a case for the annulment of the dismissal, reinstatement, payment of lost wages and compensation for damages against the company before the Labour Court of the La Altagracia judicial district, which, on  March , ruled in favour of the company (Judgment No. -); (x) on  March , the union appealed Judgment No. - before the Labour Court of the San Pedro de Macors judicial department; and (xi) on  February , the company filed a request for production of new documents relating to the appeal, annexing a communication dated  February  issued by the DNI, indicating that on  July  this body had required the AIPC and CESAC to withdraw the access card to the ramp and to restricted areas of the airport from members of the Management Committee on the grounds of national security.
.The Government considers that the Dominican State, through the Ministry of Labour and Directorate-General of Labour, the Directorate of the Inspection Coordination System and the Directorate of Mediation and Arbitration, intervened with the objective of bringing the union into existence, as evidenced by Decision No. - of the Director-General of Labour whereby the union was registered. Likewise, the Government underscores that a violation report was drafted by the Labour Inspectorate when it understood that the company had violated the Labour Code and constitutional principles, and that the State had promoted legal protection of freedom of association.
.The Committee notes that in this complaint, the complainant organization alleges that the members of the Management Committee involved in forming the Aviam Ltd Aviation Ground Services Workers' Union were subjected to anti-union dismissals by an airport sector company. Furthermore, the complainant organization denounces the ineffectiveness of the national procedures and mechanisms for guaranteeing respect for fundamental rights in relation to freedom of association; and the alleged collusion between the DNI and the company, which led to the access card to the ramp and restricted areas of the airport being withdrawn from members of the Management Committee on the grounds of national security.
.The Committee notes that both the complainant organization and the Government indicate that: (i) a group of workers at the airport sector company established the union on  June  and that the following day, the union notified the company and the Ministry of Labour of this fact and of the membership of the Management Committee; (ii) on  July , the company dismissed the Management Committee; (iii) on  July , the union was registered; (iv) the report of the labour inspector dated  July  noted  actions detrimental to freedom of association'  and (v) the union brought a case for the annulment of the dismissal, reinstatement, payment of lost wages and compensation for damages before the Labour Court of the La Altagracia judicial district, which by its Judgment No. - declared the case inadmissible  for insufficient legal grounds and lack of legal basis'  (vi) the union appealed the judgment before the Labour Court of the San Pedro de Macors judicial department; and (vii) on  February , the company sought authorization from the appeals court to deposit a communication from the DNI indicating that on  July  this body had required the AIPC and CESAC to withdraw the access card to the ramp and restricted areas of the airport from members of the Management Committee on the grounds of national security.
.The Committee notes that in its reply, the Government points out that through the Ministry of Labour and the Directorate-General of Labour, the Directorate of the Inspection Coordination System and the Directorate of Mediation and Arbitration intervened with the objective of bringing the union into existence, as evidenced by Decision No. - of the Director-General of Labour whereby the union was registered. The Committee also takes note of the Government s reply indicating that a violation report was drafted by the Labour Inspectorate, when it understood that the company had violated the Labour Code and constitutional principles; and that the State had promoted legal protection of freedom of association.
.In respect of the alleged anti-union dismissals and the alleged ineffectiveness of the national, administrative and judicial mechanisms in guaranteeing respect for freedom of association, the Committee takes note of the labour inspector s report, transmitted by the complainant organization and the Government, which indicates that once the deadline given to the company to reinstate the workers had expired, the labour inspector issued a violation report No.  because the company had taken  actions detrimental to freedom of association' by dismissing workers protected by trade union immunity in accordance with articles () and  of the Labour Code, and concludes that the company was violating the right to freedom of association of the workers who decided to form an establishment trade union. The Committee notes that at the judicial level, the court of first instance rejected the request for annulment of the dismissal, reinstatement, payment of lost wages and compensation for damages, on the specific grounds that: (i) the union acted outside its sphere of competence, namely  in defence of the particular interests of the workers of the union' and not in defence of their  common interests' as provided for in article  of the Labour Code; (ii)  there is no evidence in the file that the union notified both its employer and the labour authorities which workers were protected by trade union immunity'  and (iii) in respect of compensation, the fault attributed to the complainant was not established. While noting that the members of the Management Committee were dismissed days after the establishment of the union, the Committee notes that the first instance judge considered only the issue of the trade union s competence to bring an action to court on behalf of the members of the Management Committee, rejecting the request. Consequently, the first instance judgment did not examine the reasons for the dismissals and their alleged anti-union character nor does it refer in its whereas clauses to the aforementioned decision of the Labour Inspectorate. The Committee further notes that the complainant organization appealed Judgment No.   and that the judgment was pending resolution by the Labour Court of the San Pedro de Macors judicial department. The Committee, observing that the dismissals of the members of the Management Committee occurred more than three years ago, recalls that cases concerning anti-union discrimination contrary to Convention No.  should be examined rapidly so that the necessary remedies can be really effective. An excessive delay in processing cases of anti-union discrimination and, in particular, a lengthy delay in concluding the proceedings concerning the reinstatement of the trade union leaders who were dismissed, constitute a denial of justice and therefore a denial of the trade union rights of the persons concerned [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , para. ]. Furthermore, the Committee recalls in respect of the alleged lack of competence of the union to represent its members, that in a previous case (see th Report (India), paragraph ) the Committee considered that workers who consider that they have been prejudiced because of their trade union activities should have access to means of redress which are expeditious, inexpensive and fully impartial [see Compilation, op. cit., para. ] and requested the Government to adopt all the necessary measures, including",0,2017,Dominican Republic
6,"amending the legislation, to ensure that the unions could approach the courts directly. The Committee trusts that the Court of Appeal will issue its decision in the near future on the alleged anti-union dismissals, taking the above into account and that, in the framework of the judicial proceedings, there will be an examination of the causes that gave rise to the dismissals of the members of the Management Committee and their alleged anti-union nature. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.With regard to the decision of the DNI to withdraw the access card to the ramp and restricted areas from members of the union s Management Committee, allegedly on the grounds of national security, the Committee takes note of the allegations of the complainant organization indicating that: (i) the company sought the communication of  February  with the aim of evading criminal responsibility for having dismissed the members of the Management Committee in an unlawful manner and that the DNI, having lent itself to that exercise, compromised the responsibility of the State; (ii) the workers concerned had no criminal record; and (iii) the said accusation had serious economic and social consequences for the workers concerned. In this regard, the Committee regrets that, in its observations, the Government confines itself to annexing the communication of  February  sent by the DNI without indicating any facts relating to how the members of the Management Committee allegedly violated national security. Concerned about the impact of the accusations of violation of State security and of the withdrawal of the access card to the ramp and restricted areas on the employment of the trade union leaders, the Committee requests the Government to send its observations in this regard as soon as possible.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	With regard to the alleged anti-union dismissals of members of the Management Committee, the Committee trusts that the Court of Appeal will issue its decision on this matter in the near future, taking the above into account, and that in the framework of the judicial proceedings there will be an examination of the causes that gave rise to the dismissals of the members of the Management Committee and their alleged anti-union nature. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.(b)	Concerned about the impact of the accusations of violation of State security and of the withdrawal of the access card to the ramp and restricted areas on the employment of the trade union leaders, the Committee requests the Government to send its observations in this regard.",1,2017,Dominican Republic
7,".The complaint is contained in a communication dated  May  presented by the National Confederation of Dominican Workers (CNTD) and the Dominican Association of Air Traffic Controllers Inc. (ADCA). These organizations sent additional information and new allegations in communications dated  December  and  June .
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  September  and  March .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their joint communication dated  May , the CNTD and ADCA allege that the leaders of the ADCA have been promoting, and participating in, a range of activities with a view to guaranteeing respect for its members' rights and improving their working and living conditions.
.Following up on the agreement ( Memorandum of Understanding'  signed with the employer on  May , the ADCA developed a plan to implement the agreement and thereby improve its members' living and working conditions. This plan led to an inter institutional agreement to increase salaries by  per cent, in two stages: a  per cent increase in June , and a  per cent increase which should have come into effect in January . At the same time, the ADCA sought to resolve the technical problems existing in all the national air traffic control centres, problems which resulted from the state of disrepair of these installations. It requested basic equipment that is essential for the provision of air traffic control services, as well as maintenance and urgently needed repairs for the tools and technological infrastructure that are vital for the provision of service and the guaranteed safety of aerial operations ' such as communication systems, radio navigation aids and radars, which were about to fall to pieces. The ADCA had reported these technical problems in a written submission and a PowerPoint presentation, both addressed to the director of the Dominican Civil Aviation Institute (IDAC), following an exhaustive technical inventory of all air navigation centres nationwide which was delivered to the IDAC authorities on  July , and to the Air Navigation Directorate (DINA) on  September .
.According to the allegations, up until , the differences that existed between the ADCA and IDAC had been resolved by means of dialogue, without this causing any particular issues.
.The complainant organizations state that, along with the activities planned and executed under the ADCA s action plan, they opposed a proposal to amend article  of Civil Aviation Act No. -, which provides that:The Director General will establish the regulations governing employment conditions, social security and economic benefits, in accordance with the labour laws of the Dominican Republic and the recommendations and resolutions of the International Labour Organization (ILO), to ensure that the directors, employees, consultants and agents in the IDAC s service have the protection and support which is guaranteed them by the international legal instruments to which the Dominican State is a signatory.
.The amendment proposed in turn by the Director of the IDAC was as follows:Article . IDAC civil servants shall be subject to the Public Service Regulations, and to the regulations which govern the Dominican Social Security System.
.This proposal not only infringed workers' acquired labour rights, it also contravened the recommendations of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) contained in document No. -AN, which, for instance, advocates mixed committees comprising managerial staff and workers for the rapid settlement of disputes.
.Opposition to amending article  of Civil Aviation Act No. - is a just and legitimate cause for a workers' organization in view of the support that this article provides, by tying working conditions, social security and economic benefits to ILO Conventions. The director of IDAC s attempt to amend this article was covert, and he denied any such intention on numerous occasions. This plan to change the law was, however, moving forward ' without the knowledge or involvement of the parties whom it would affect ' and the proposed amendment was placed on the agenda of the meeting of the Senate of the Republic of  February . Fortunately, the ADCA s proposal was well received and understood by the Congress of the Republic, and the ADCA managed to retain the benefits provided for by article  of the abovementioned Act.
.The ADCA s battle also focused, and continues to focus, on trying to deflect efforts to privatize the essential air navigation services that the IDAC offers. The ADCA adds that on  February , along with the other technical workers' associations in the aeronautical sector, it sent to the director-general of the IDAC a number of defects and faults that affected, and still affect, air navigation services. There was no response, so the ADCA found itself obliged to resort to using the media to appeal to the highest national authorities to voice its concerns about the defects which it had reported, but which the IDAC authorities had not addressed. The association paid to publish its grievance in the  February  edition of the newspaper Listn Diario, along with the National Pilots' Association (ANP), the Dominican Association of Operations Inspectors (ADIO) and the Dominican Association for Aeronautical Maintenance (ADTEMA). That act, and the fact that the association had not approved the director of IDAC s abovementioned proposal to amend article , caused the IDAC authorities to distance themselves. Thereafter, the organization s authorities refused to receive ADCA representatives in their offices and, moreover, embarked on a series of actions that flagrantly violated freedom of association and other concomitant rights.
.From June  onwards, the hostile actions directed at the ADCA intensified: unilaterally and suddenly, the IDAC suspended the deduction of ADCA trade union dues. It had been deducting dues for  years. With this act, the IDAC not only denied the trade union organization s status, but also punished the union financially, and consequently weakened it. Without resources, the ADCA cannot implement its activities, plans or programmes; nor can it cover its necessary expenditures such as rent, electricity, communication and secretarial support.
.Among the actions taken against the air traffic controllers, the use of direct threats and intimidation to make them renounce the association stands out. They are threatened with: (a) not receiving due promotion; and (b) not being considered for new training. If they do not yield to the pressure to renounce, they risk the IDAC downgrading the positions that they occupy, arbitrarily transferring them or forcing them into involuntary retirement and making them accept a premature pension.
.In a new attempt to resolve the problems by means of dialogue, on  December , the ADCA sent an extensive communication to IDAC s Director, detailing each and every violation of and action contrary to good faith, and the law that it had committed. In this communication the ADCA also expressed to the authorities its intention to solve the disputes by means of dialogue, re-establishing the normal inter-institutional channels of communication; and its commitment to maintaining the highest standards of efficiency and safety in the delicate and strategic service that it offers. Additionally, it requested that:' the IDAC give due consideration, and responses, to the multiple communications sent to it by the ADCA, particularly the association s request to participate in the technical process of installing and making operational the new control centres which are currently being installed; and that the agreement reached in connection with the joint IDAC/ADCA technical report be implemented, in order to improve technical infrastructure at the national level;' the IDAC ensure, without delay, that its technical positions be filled on the basis of competitions, as Decree No. -, Regulation on Performance Evaluation and Promotion for Civil Servants, provides;' illegal and unfair sanctions against air traffic controllers be annulled, due to their retaliatory nature (such as unpaid suspensions of up to two months, and unilateral orders to take involuntary retirement ' which do not take into consideration the scarcity of specialized technical personnel ' given to air controllers who are fully capable of performing their duties); and' payments of wages to air traffic controllers be made regular and adequate, performance-based bonuses be paid, the  per cent salary increase be implemented, Bonus No.  be paid to control staff who are on medical leave or retired for pension purposes; as well as the regularization of payment of the school bonus that is referred to in the reference documents attached to the present communication, etc.
.As a result of the IDAC s failure to respond to its approaches, the ADCA decided to use peaceful protests and to organize, in conjunction with the CNTD, marches, pickets and sit ins, hoping that the application of pressure would lead to a solution.
.After a call on  January  to take part in a peaceful march organized by the ADCA and CNTD, the director of human resources published a circular, on  January, addressed to all the organization s staff, warning that participation in the scheduled activities would be punishable by the second and third degree sanctions",0,2014,Dominican Republic
8,"set out in Public Service Act No. -, and possibly dismissal.
.In response to the protests, the IDAC followed through on its threat and dismissed trade union leaders from their positions in retaliation for their activities. On  February , it suspended the leaders and most active members of the association, whom it subsequently dismissed: Mr Wellington F. Almonte Gmez, Ms Cristina Arelis Mateo Guerrero, Mr Josu Joel Prez Encarnacin, Mr Edwin A. Montero Luciano, Mr Leonardo Rivera, Ms Shelby Daro Ng Ruiz, Mr Carlos Alberto Carvajal Urea, Mr Ramn Armora Santos, Mr Rainier Pavel Ulerio Santos, Mr Arturo Napolen Rodrguez Cedano and Mr Erik Yohairy Echevarra P. The dismissal of Mr Breydys Laurel Tapia Disla was annulled when he gave in to pressure and renounced his ADCA membership (in a letter dated  March ); the resolution that establishes his reinstatement includes the fact:' that in his appeal for reconsideration, air traffic controller Tapia Disla went on to say:   let myself get involved in a fight that is not my own; I wanted to intervene and change things and I ended up wronged in the worst possible way: I believe that the Dominican Association of Air Traffic Controllers was, and is, on course for disaster and I cannot be a part of this  ?,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:
.According to the ADCA, none of the sanctioned employees committed any act in violation of the provisions of the law serious enough to warrant dismissal from his or her post; on the contrary, the employees exercised the rights that the Constitution of the Republic, Public Service Act No. - and the regulations governing its application, Civil Aviation Act No. - and ILO Convention No.  confer upon them.
.The sanctioned trade unionists filed administrative and judicial appeals for amparo (remedy for the protection of constitutional rights) and requests for protective measures, with a view to obtaining the reinstatement of the suspended controllers.
.On  April , the ADCA and CNTD submitted a formal request for mediation to the Minister of Labour, which resulted in a mediation session being held between the parties on  May . However, up to the present the mediation has not yielded any tangible outcome that facilitates the resolution of the dispute between the parties nor, in particular, an end to the arbitrary sanctions. During the mediation session, by contrast, the IDAC representative merely posited the non-existence of the ADCA as a legal person, brandishing a certificate awarded by the Ministry of Public Administration which showed that the ADCA was not registered with that Ministry.
.The complainant organizations also allege that the employer is promoting the establishment of a parallel trade union to compete with the ADCA.
.The complainant organizations state that, on  February , the Trade Union Confederation of the Americas (TUCA) sent a communication requesting the IDAC to cease its anti-union activities and demonstrate full respect for the fundamental rights of the air traffic controllers and their organization; the International Federation of Air Traffic Controllers' Associations (IFATCA) sent a communication along similar lines to the director of the IDAC on  February . On  February  Public Services International (PSI) also addressed a letter to the Director of the IDAC advocating dialogue, to no avail.
.Among the arguments it put forward at the mediation session at the Ministry of Labour on  May , the IDAC especially focussed on the ADCA s non-existence as a legal entity. On this point, it is necessary to clarify that the ADCA is a trade union organization under private law, duly registered and, as such, having legal personality by virtue of the provisions of the then Act No.  of  June  on non-profit associations. It was registered by Executive Decree No. - of  June , and subsequently re-registered in accordance with Act No. - of  May , on regulation and promotion of non profit associations in the Dominican Republic.
.In their communication of  December , the complainant organizations indicate that among the legal proceedings is the request for amparo submitted by the ADCA and the air traffic controllers who were victims of retaliatory measures. In response to said claim, the First Chamber of the Higher Administrative Court handed down Ruling No. - on  June , which recognized the truth of the events as reported by the claimants and the arbitrariness of the conduct of the Director of the IDAC, and ordered the immediate reinstatement of the air traffic controllers.
.The IDAC authorities ignored this ruling. It is important to emphasize that Ruling No. - recognizes the existence of the ADCA, even though it could not register its status under Public Service Act No. - ' because this Act, as the ILO Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations (CEACR) has expressed, contravenes the provisions of Convention No.  by requiring organizations of civil servants to affiliate at least  per cent of the employees of the institution concerned at the national level, and does not provide for the establishment of professional associations such as the ADCA (which affiliates workers in the air traffic control profession).
.Confronted with the IDAC s unjustified refusal to comply with Ruling No. -, the ADCA lodged a formal claim for financial liability against the director of the IDAC.
.In a communication dated  June , the complainant organizations list the various rulings handed down in relation to the present case. They add that the airport authorities, who maintain a blacklist of ADCA leaders with names and photographs, bar these leaders' access to workplaces in order to prevent them from communicating with their members. In this connection, the complainant organizations also send photographs of the arrest or temporary detention of union leaders, including that of Mr Antonio Rodrguez Fritz, general secretary of the International Transport Workers' Federation (ITF).
.In its communication of  September , the Government transmits the IDAC s position and the comments it made on  August  in relation to the complaint presented by the ADCA, which are transcribed in the following paragraphs.
.The IDAC is the autonomous, specialized and technical body established by Civil Aviation Act No. - of the Dominican Republic as the national aeronautical authority with responsibility for reporting to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) (which IDAC is governed by) and the international aeronautical community. It is responsible for ensuring compliance with international regulations and standards designed to guarantee the safety of civil aviation at the global level, and, in the national context, it is charged with the supervision, control and surveillance of civil aviation activities that take place across the territory and within national air space.
.As regards the complaint presented by the CNTD and ADCA to the ILO, it is important to emphasize that, far from intervening to ensure respect for workers' legitimate and constitutional right to strike in accordance with the legally established parameters, the complainant organizations are seeking to distort the reality of events and cover up the disciplinary offences committed by various air traffic controllers in the IDAC s employ.
.The complainants, reprehensibly, seek the ILO s intervention in order to apply international pressure and spread misinformation. The IDAC would thus like to present the following clarifications.
.At present, the events that have occurred, and the disciplinary proceedings that have been carried out, are being examined by the Higher Administrative Court and the Constitutional Court, and the IDAC will abide by the final decisions of these bodies. Up to now, there are four judicial proceedings the results of which are pending, these being:(a)	a request for protective measures initiated on  April , which is being examined by the President of the Higher Administrative Court;(b)	a request for protective measures initiated on  April , which is being examined by the President of the Higher Administrative Court;(c)	a contentious administrative appeal made on  June , which is being examined by the Higher Administrative Court; and(d)	a request for review made on  August , which is being examined by the Constitutional Court.
.The existence of these judicial proceedings demonstrates that the request for intervention made by the CNTD and ADCA to the ILO is inadmissible, as the Dominican courts are already protecting the interested parties' fundamental rights.
.Air traffic control is an essential public service: it prevents aircraft colliding and ensures the safety of air navigation. It is vital in safeguarding the lives of passengers and ensuring the safety of people on the ground, and the health of the whole or part of the population. It is the IDAC s exclusive responsibility to offer this service, which is regulated by Civil Aviation Act No. - and the Dominican Aeronautical Regulations on Air Traffic Services (RAD ), in accordance with the Convention on International Civil Aviation or  Chicago Convention' of , which the Dominican Republic has signed and ratified. Article  of Act No. - on Airport and Civil Aviation Security establishes that in extraordinary situations this service may be provided by the Air Force of the Dominican Republic (FARD).
.Notwithstanding, even though this case does not concern the right of unions to",0,2014,Dominican Republic
9,"strike or to suspend services, but relates to disciplinary proceedings initiated individually for violations of Public Service Act No. - of the Dominican Republic, it should be recalled that the ILO itself, through the Committee on Freedom of Association, has declared whether, generally speaking, a list of specific services are essential or non essential, as follows:' the Committee has considered to be essential services in the strict sense, where the right to strike may be subject to major restrictions or even prohibitions, to be: the hospital sector; electricity services; water supply services; the telephone service; air traffic control.
.As air traffic controllers are civil servants, their employment relationship with the IDAC is governed by the aforementioned Public Service Act No. - and its regulations, the provisions of which are aligned with article  of the Dominican Constitution of , which establishes the Public Service Regulations:Article . Public Service. The Public Service Regulations comprise a system of public law based on merit and professionalization with a view to efficient management and ensuring that the State fulfils its essential functions. These Regulations will govern civil servants' payment, promotion, performance evaluation, term of service and dismissal (Dominican Constitution).
.In addition to regulating the pay, career progression, promotion and dismissal of civil servants, the aforementioned Public Service Act clearly establishes that associations of civil servants only acquire legal personality when they register with the Ministry of Public Administration, specifically stating that any action by an unregistered civil servants' organization is considered automatically void:Article  of Act No. -. Associations, federations and confederations of civil servants acquire legal personality by virtue of their registration with the Secretariat of State for Public Administration, which will issue the appropriate certificate. Actions taken by organizations of civil servants which have not registered with the Secretariat of State for Public Administration are considered void.
.This requirement to register with the Ministry of Public Administration is also contained in paragraph VI of article  of Regulation No. - on Labour Relations in Public Administration.
.On  April , the Ministry of Public Administration issued a certificate which indicates that the ADCA:' in accordance with Public Service Act No. - and its accompanying Regulation No. - on Labour Relations in Public Administration, it is not registered with this Ministry as an established association, protected by these regulations. This document proves that all actions by the ADCA, in its alleged capacity as an association of civil servants, are automatically void by virtue of article  of Public Service Act No. -.
.The IDAC adds that the ADCA members who were dismissed from the IDAC, committed acts classified as third-degree offences by Public Service Act No. -, and were then subject to disciplinary proceedings in which their right to defence was respected.
.Since the beginning of , and following an increase in hostilities at the beginning of , a group of air traffic controllers (Mr Wellington Almonte and others), individually and/or on behalf of and/or representing the ADCA, carried out a series of activities which constitute third-degree disciplinary offences under Public Service Act No. -, and which are punishable by dismissal. Among these activities, the following were carried out repeatedly, in an arrogant manner and with a deliberate lack of discipline:(a)	the dissemination of false information to the national and international media, claiming that the communication equipment and radars used in air traffic control centres were in poor condition, and predicting an  imminent collapse' of the air navigation system;(b)	the use of the ADCA as a lobbying platform to influence the public opinion and within the IDAC, despite the fact that the association is not registered with the Ministry of Public Administration, meaning that it has no legal status as a civil servants' association and that its actions are void in law, as is expressly established in article  of Public Service Act No. -;(c)	the call to strike and picket, which were likely to interrupt the delivery of the essential public service of air traffic control, and which could have endangered the lives, health and safety of citizens. This action is also defined in the prohibition from: (i) encouraging their members to abandon their positions and duties; (ii) persuading their members to refuse to cooperate in the provision of efficient public services; and (iii) carrying out actions that violate the principles and regulations governing the development of the IDAC;(d)	the incitement of the ADCA members to refuse to comply with the administrative policies of the IDAC, which is an act included in the prohibitions listed in the previous paragraph; and(e)	disrespectful treatment and the dissemination of false information aimed at damaging the reputation of the IDAC as a public entity, and of its managers as senior officials.
.In response to a call to picket on the premises of the IDAC made by Mr Wellington Almonte and other individuals, in collusion with the CNTD (despite the fact that the IDAC effectively implemented a  per cent salary increase for air traffic controllers in January ), the Director of human resources at the IDAC sent a circular to all staff, requesting them to refrain from conducting any activities that may constitute disciplinary offences.
.Mr Wellington Almonte and other individuals ignored the aforementioned institutional warning and continued with their plan to lobby against and discredit the IDAC and its managers through the media, and consequently, the IDAC initiated an investigation and disciplinary proceedings which resulted in their dismissal. During this administrative process, the right to defence of Mr Wellington Almonte and other individuals was fully respected, as demonstrated by the proof presented by the IDAC before the Higher Administrative Court and/or the Constitutional Court.Timeline of the disciplinary procedure followed by the IDAC and the legal proceedings initiated by the appellants and the ADCAActions and/or eventsDates.

.It appears that the opposition to the amendment of article  of Act No. -, which the CNTD and the ADCA also expressed in the complaint, had no effect on the factual aspect of the disciplinary proceedings conducted, given that: (i) the legal provision was not changed and Act No. -, which amended Act No. -, was published in Official Gazette No.  of  April ; and (ii) following the publication of Act No. -, in June  and January , the IDAC implemented a progressive salary increase of  per cent for air traffic controllers.
.Despite its lack of legal status and the legal nullity of its actions, the ADCA has carried out acts that are expressly prohibited for civil servants' organizations registered with the Ministry of Public Administration. These acts are defined in the provisions of article  of Regulation No. - on Labour Relations in Public Administration:Article . rganizations of civil servants are prohibited from:' .	Encouraging, initiating and supporting strikes in public services whose interruption could endanger the lives, health and safety of citizens.' .	Inciting or forcing their members to abandon their positions and duties, in violation of the official regulations in force.' .	Persuading their members to refuse to cooperate in the provision of efficient public services..	Carrying out actions that violate the principles and regulations governing the development of the state administration, at any level or in any sectors or places where it is required to act.
.In this regard, Mr Wellington Almonte and other individuals committed the offences set out in paragraphs , ,  and  of article  of Act No. -:Article . The following actions committed by any civil servant in the public administration constitute third-degree offences that will lead to dismissal:' .

.The IDAC applies internal policies that encourage and promote the right to freedom of association. For this reason, the IDAC has six employees' organizations which, despite not having been established as civil servants' associations under Public Service Act No. -, but instead under Act No. - on Non-Profit Associations, have enjoyed and continue to enjoy the treatment and recognition received as part of the institutional role that they play. This demonstrates that the IDAC has respected and respects the rights of ADCA members at all times, and that there has been no violation of freedom of association.
.With regard to the employee members of the ADCA, the IDAC has promoted the right to freedom of association, as, far from creating obstacles to the exercise of this right, it has recognized the ADCA as a de facto association, supported its operation, addressed its claims and interacted with its leaders, even though the ADCA has no legal status and no status as a trade union or a civil servants' association.
.Likewise, in the disciplinary proceedings against several members of the ADCA for having committed third-degree offences established in Public Service Act No. -, the constitutional principle of due process was also ensured, and no threat or arbitrary act to the detriment of the members was carried out. Therefore, there has been and is no violation whatsoever of freedom of association by the IDAC.
.In its communication dated  March , the Government forwards the mediation agreement drafted by the Ministry of Labour on  June  in relation to this case, and Ruling No. -- of the Higher Administrative Court dated  June , Ruling No. TC// of the Constitutional Court of the Dominican Republic of  February , and Ruling No. - of the Higher Administrative Court.
.The Government adds that, in the Dominican Republic, freedom of association is a constitutional right, and therefore all necessary measures are taken to ensure that it is protected and observed.
.The Committee observes that, in the present case, the complainants allege that, in response to the trade union claims and activities of the ADCA in  and  (opposition to changes in the legislation applicable to the association; privatization attempts; a public trade union complaint in the press regarding the safety of air service operations in terms of equipment and repairs; delays in the organization of competitions; payment of salary increases and other entitlements, etc.), the IDAC suspended the deduction of trade union dues as from June , pressurized or threatened controllers to make them give up their membership or be excluded from training courses and promotions, did not accept the calls for dialogue made by the ADCA (and by other international trade union organizations), and its management refused to meet with ADCA representatives. They also allege that the IDAC sent a circular to all staff on  January , requesting them to refrain from participating in trade union activities (marches, pickets, sit-ins) or risk incurring the penalties provided for by law, including dismissal. The complainants underscore that the trade union activities carried out led, as an anti-union reprisal, to the suspension of  of the most active leaders and members on  February  and their subsequent dismissal, despite the fact that not one of them committed any offence established by law, which would justify their removal. The complainants add that the IDAC ignored the ruling dated  June  of the First Chamber of the Higher Administrative Court, which ordered, as part of an amparo appeal, the immediate reinstatement of the dismissed trade union leaders and members, and that the ADCA therefore initiated legal proceedings against the Director of the IDAC for financial liability, in contempt of the aforementioned ruling. The Committee also takes note of the complainants' allegations that the IDAC does not recognize the ADCA as a civil servants' association and claims that it has no legal status and that its acts are void. However, it observes that the legal rulings issued on the case rejected the IDAC s claims.
.The Committee notes that, in its reply, the Government recalls that freedom of association is a constitutional right in the country and that it includes the legal rulings issued in relation to the complaint by the complainant organizations, as well as the IDAC s comments on the case, which are summarized below:
.The Committee takes note of the three legal rulings issued in relation to the present case, which have been forwarded by the complainant organizations and by the Government. The Committee observes that the first ruling (No. - of  June ) was handed down by the Higher Administrative Court (First Chamber) in response to an amparo appeal lodged on  March  by the ADCA, which was declared admissible and well founded. The ruling ordered the revocation of the suspension of the trade unionists referred to in the complaint and the disciplinary proceedings against them to be reversed, in order to protect their fundamental right to freedom of association, and called for the immediate reinstatement of the plaintiffs to their positions in the IDAC. The second ruling (No. TC//) was issued by the Constitutional Court on  February  in response to an appeal for review lodged by the IDAC on  August  against Ruling No.   of the First Chamber of the Higher Labour Court. The ruling by the Constitutional Court revoked Ruling No. - of the Higher Administrative Court and declared the appeal lodged by the ADCA to be unjustified, on the specific grounds that: ()  in this case, there is a specialized court that is entitled by law to guarantee the rights that may be affected by the actions of the administration, in particular disciplinary actions, as an administrative dispute court'  and () the Higher Administrative Court (First Chamber) concluded that freedom of association had been violated but did not ascertain  the reasoning or evidence reviewed which would allow it to determine what constitutes, in the case, the violation of the rights mentioned'  The third ruling (No. -) of the Higher Administrative Court (First Chamber) was handed down on  February  in response to an appeal, dated  June , lodged by  air traffic controllers suspended by the IDAC and subsequently dismissed for, according to the appeal, having carried out legitimate protests. In its ruling, the Higher Administrative Court dismissed the appeal as the aforementioned controllers had failed to file it within the time frame prescribed by law.
.The Committee concludes that the only one of the three aforementioned rulings which examined the issue in depth, and which ordered, through an amparo appeal, the immediate reinstatement of the air traffic controllers dismissed on the grounds that the IDAC had violated their freedom of association, was revoked by a Constitutional Court ruling (on the grounds of flawed reasoning and evaluation of evidence by the Higher Labour Court, and the existence of an administrative dispute court to which the case should have been referred). The Committee also observes that the IDAC did not respond to the allegations that it had ignored the calls for dialogue by the ADCA and other international trade union organizations (including Public Services International (PSI)), and that it refused to meet representatives from the ADCA.
.In response to the proceedings described above, in which the legality of the dismissals carried out by the IDAC was not examined in depth by any authority independent of the parties to the dispute, the Committee does not have sufficient information to pursue its examination of the specific allegations made and issues raised in this case, which go beyond the allegations relating to the right to strike. The Committee recognizes that air traffic control can be considered as an essential service [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ] where the right to strike may be subject to major restrictions or even prohibitions. The Committee observes however that there appears not to have been a specific determination of the extent of alleged violations regarding the exercise of freedom",1,2014,Dominican Republic
11,"of association invoked by the employer, the type of action undertaken, and the legitimacy of concerns raised by the complainants about passenger safety. In this regard, the Committee also takes note of the allegations by the complainants regarding serious violations during the administrative process.
.The Committee furthermore highlights that the IDAC has not provided information or explanations on why, in June , it unilaterally suspended the deduction of trade union dues for the ADCA (which had benefited from this deduction for  years), or why it did not comply with the order to reinstate immediately the dismissed leaders, issued by the Supreme Labour Court on  June  (which was only revoked by the Constitutional Court on  February ), and has not referred to the allegations that the complaints regarding poor safety were supported by three other employees' associations (which apparently were not punished). The Committee also observes that the IDAC did not reply in sufficient detail to the allegations by the ADCA regarding the alleged coercion and intimidation of ADCA members to make them give up their membership, nor to the alleged actions of the employer to promote the creation of an organization parallel to the ADCA. Moreover, the Committee observes that the IDAC has not responded to the new allegations by the complainants, according to which the leaders of ADCA were denied access to their workplaces to prevent them from making contact with the ADCA members (by retaining them or detaining them for several hours when they attempted to enter the premises). Lastly, the Committee also observes that the IDAC has not responded to the allegation that it ignored the calls to dialogue made by the ADCA and other international trade union organizations (including the PSI), and that it refused to meet with ADCA representatives.
.Observing that it has not been possible to establish the substance of this case and emphasizing the fundamental importance of tripartite dialogue, the Committee invites the Government to refer the different issues raised in this complaint to tripartite dialogue, bearing in mind the elements noted above.
.In light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:Observing that it has not been possible to establish the substance of this case and emphasizing the fundamental importance of tripartite dialogue, the Committee invites the Government to refer the different issues raised in this complaint to tripartite dialogue, bearing in mind the elements noted in its conclusions.",1,2014,Dominican Republic
12,".The complaint is contained in a communication of the National Confederation of Trade Union Unity (CNUS) dated  April .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication of  July .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  April , the CNUS alleges that, since its foundation, the Labour Inspectors' Association of the Dominican Republic (ASITRAREDO) endeavoured to facilitate the improvement of inspection services by all legal means, through enhanced quality of inspections, improved conditions under which labour inspectors carry out their activities and better living and working conditions for them. In this context, ASITRAREDO requested, first verbally and later in writing, to meet with the Minister of Labour in order to discuss the topics of concern to the Association and the labour inspectors. The requests to meet and establish a forum for dialogue between the Ministry and the Association went unheeded.
.The complainant organization further states that in retaliation for the requests made and its trade union and association activities, the Minister of Labour sent ten inspectors, including Mr Enemencio Matos Gmez (President of the Association), Ms Evelyn Geraldina Meja Meja (Finance Secretary), Ms Elizabeth Batista (member of the Disciplinary Tribunal) and Mr Vctor Guerrero Ogando (External Relations Secretary), to remote centres. The other jurisdictions were extremely far from the places where they had been carrying out their functions, where their families were based and where research is conducted to improve their skills, and this caused them serious financial, family and other difficulties.
.The complainant organization alleges that, when the Minister of Labour refused ASITRAREDO s request for a meeting, the Association drew up the list of topics that it needed to discuss and, in a communication received by the Minister s office on  November , went into detail about each and every aspect that needed to be considered and resolved jointly by the parties, while repeating the request for a meeting. The planned topics included: the reinstatement to their previous posts of those who had been relocated; various economic demands; the provision of an area within the Ministry of Labour to be used as premises by the Association and to bring together the inspectors, supervisors and local labour representatives; the requirement that vacancies for local representatives be filled through an internal competition in which all inspectors who enter take part on equal terms.
.As the Association did not receive a response to this communication from the Minister either and the problems raised continued to adversely affect the inspectors, the Association devised and implemented a plan of action to make their voices heard and address their demands; the actions planned included a protest in front of the Ministry of Labour.
.The complainant organization specifies that a protest was indeed held by ASITRAREDO in front of the Ministry of Labour at  a.m. on  November , with the coordination and support of the CNUS, and unfolded peacefully and with complete respect for people and property. However, instead of receiving and meeting the Association s representatives to discuss how to solve the problems which had been raised by the Association, on  November , in retaliation for the legitimate claims of the ASITRAREDO members, the Minister of Labour issued warnings to the trade union officials, Mr Enemencio Matos Gmez, Mr Agustn del Carmen, Mr Vctor Guerrero Ogando, Ms Evelyn Geraldina Meja Meja and Mr Juan Manuel Mercedes Montao, as well as  other members. In retaliation for the trade union activities and the scope of the freedom of association for labour inspectors, the Minister of Labour therefore took actions which constitute a flagrant violation, not only of the national Constitution, but also of ratified ILO Conventions on freedom of association.
.In its communication of  July , the Government states that an analysis of the complaint filed by the CNUS highlights various aspects which warrant individual responses. Concerning the comment submitted by the CNUS implying that the Dominican authorities, and specifically the Ministry of Labour, have been ignoring ASITRAREDO, it is important to note that at no time has the Ministry of Labour undermined freedom of association of any Ministry of Labour employees in word or deed. On the contrary, since the founding of the Association, the Ministry has encouraged and supported every board which has headed the Association. It is worthwhile mentioning the support offered to the first board, chaired by the Inspector Supervisor Mr Dionicio Morel, followed by the board led by Mr Andrs Valentn Herrera (current Director-General of Labour), and also the boards chaired by Mr Daniel Jimnez, and currently Mr Enemencio Matos (current President of the Board). Mr Enemencio Matos has been received by the Minister individually and through the Association s commissions.
.With regard to the various requests which ASITRAREDO made to the Minister, the Minister appointed a commission as a viable response to the Association s various concerns. The Commission was headed by a deputy minister, the Director-General for Labour and the Inspection Coordinator and they held a number of follow-up meetings dedicated to each and every concern raised by the Association.
.In addition, with regard to the allegation that labour inspectors have been sent to remote areas as retaliation for the requests made, the Government points out that, given the fact that  per cent of inspectors live and have their families in the country s two main cities (Distrito Nacional and Santiago de los Caballeros), they can potentially be affected by routine relocations to other cities across the entire country, where the rest of the labour offices ( offices) are located. As proof that there is no malicious intent in the changes made in recent years, the President of ASITRAREDO, Mr Enemencio Matos, was sent to a representative office that brings him  miles closer to his house, while Mr Vctor Guerrero Ogando, the Association s External Relations Secretary, was brought  miles closer from where he had previously worked. The Government stresses that each of the labour inspectors, once employed, are informed of the need to be in jurisdictions which can potentially be far from their home, to which they agree. They therefore consent both to regular relocation and to moving to offices which are not in their place of residence. The Government attaches copies of these consent forms.
.With regard to the list of topics submitted by ASITRAREDO to the Ministry of Labour, the Government indicates that the Ministry has gradually been responding to each of the topics and sending numerous clarifications in that respect, including regarding the economic aspect of the working conditions and the competitions. In response to the request by ASITRAREDO for physical space on the premises of the Ministry of Labour, the Government states that the Ministry has always offered the facilities, as demonstrated by the office granted to ASITRAREDO and the spaces provided to the Association each time that it had requested. That matter should therefore not be a cause of concern for the Association.
.Regarding the allegation that a group of inspectors had been penalized ( warned'  for protesting about the failure of their claims to be met, the Government emphasizes that both the national Constitution and Act No. - on the Civil Service and its implementing regulations fully safeguard the right of civil servants to carry out any protests which they consider important. However, Act No. - itself governs how to file any kind of claim, and that procedure was not observed by various inspectors who caused work stoppages on  November , affecting the public service applications that citizens normally make to the Ministry of Labour. As a consequence, the work stoppages took the Ministry of Labour by surprise and it could not prepare a response for the users (Act No. -, art. ()). The Government reiterates that the country is open to receive any guidance from the International Labour Organization regarding the topics raised in this report and also stresses that it remains intent on ensuring effective compliance with legal standards, whether national or international, in order to guarantee industrial peace in the employer employee relationship.
.The Committee observes that in this complaint, the CNUS alleges: () the refusal of the Minister of Labour to meet and discuss with ASITRAREDO representatives in order to improve labour inspectors' inspection tasks and living and working conditions; copies of letters from the Association requesting an audience with the Minister of Labour were sent on  October ,  April  and  August ; () the sending of ten labour inspectors to remote areas in retaliation for the requests and trade union activities and thereby causing them economic harm and family difficulties; among those sent were the trade union officials Mr Enemencio Matos Gmez (President of the Association), Ms Evelyn Geraldina Meja Meja (Finance Secretary), Ms Elizabeth Batista (member of the Disciplinary Tribunal) and Mr Vctor Guerrero Ogando (External Relations Secretary); () the refusal of the Minister of Labour to have a meeting requested",0,2014,Dominican Republic
13,"by the Association with a list of topics to be discussed (which was received by the Minister s office on  November ); the topics include: the reinstatement to their previous posts of those who had been relocated; various economic demands; the provision of an area within the Ministry of Labour to be used as premises by the Association and bring together the inspectors, supervisors and local labour representatives; the requirement that vacancies for local representatives be filled through an internal competition in which all inspectors who enter take part on equal terms; () as no response was given to the communication received by the Minister s office, the Association implemented a plan of action which included a plan for a protest, that took place in front of the Ministry of Labour at  a.m. on  November  and unfolded peacefully, with support from the CNUS; () in retaliation for the protests, on  November , the Minister of Labour issued a warning to the trade union officials, Mr Enemencio Matos Gmez, Mr Agustn del Carmen, Mr Vctor Guerrero Ogando, Ms Evelyn Geraldina Meja Meja and Mr Juan Manuel Mercedes Montao, as well as  other members.
.The Committee takes note of the Government s statements that: () the President of the Association, as well as the previous presidents, had been received on numerous occasions by the Ministry of Labour both individually and through the Association s commissions which it headed; () in response to the Association s concerns, the Minister appointed a commission headed by the Deputy Minister, the Director-General for Labour and the Inspection Coordinator, and they held a number of follow-up meetings dedicated to each and every issue raised, as detailed in the Government s reply, regarding economic aspects and the granting of an office to the Association (which did take place) and, when requested, other spaces; () with regard to the alleged sending of inspectors to remote locations as retaliation for the Association s requests, there had been no malicious intent and the inspectors in question had given their written consent to regular changes of destination to jurisdictions that could be far from their homes, given that there were  labour offices spread across the entire country; the current President of the Association (Mr Enemencio Matos Gmez) and the External Relations Secretary (Mr Vctor Guerrero Ogando) had been sent to destinations which brought them respectively  and  miles closer to their homes; () with regard to the alleged warning issued to  inspectors, current legislation safeguards the rights of civil servants to carry out any protests which they consider important, but the inspectors who caused work stoppages on  November  did not observe the procedure of Act No. - on the Civil Service, which governs how to present any kind of claim and they affected the public service applications that citizens normally make to the Ministry of Labour. As a consequence, the work stoppages took the Ministry of Labour by surprise and it could not prepare a response to the users; () the Ministry of Labour at no time undermined the freedom of association.
.The Committee concludes that the Government denies that there had been no dialogue with the Association, claiming that it had sent sufficient proof in that respect. It denies that the relocations or warnings of the inspectors were anti-trade union measures and stresses that they were legal and that it had been taken by surprise by a protest in front of the Ministry which disrupted the services to which users are entitled.
.The Committee welcomes the Government s statement that it is open to receive any guidance from the ILO regarding the topics raised and, on account of the discrepancy between the versions of the complainant and the Government, wishes to draw the following conclusions: the main problem at the root of this complaint is the relocation of ten inspectors belonging to the Association, including five officials of the Association, one of which is its President, although they had given their written consent to regular relocations. Furthermore, one of the Association s claims filed by the complainant organization, as described in the attachments, consists in creating a framework regulation to re-establish the form, methods and reasons for the relocations. The Committee invites the Government to examine this proposal with the Association.
.With regard to the warning given to five trade union officials and  other members of the Association for holding a protest in front of the Ministry of Labour (a peaceful one according to the trade union) which the Government claims to have taken it by surprise and therefore to have been a violation of Act No. -, since it unduly disrupted user services, the Committee, taking into account the Government s statements that the Association s set of demands have been submitted to a high-level commission which has considered each of the problems raised, suggests that, in the interest of restoring harmonious relations between the parties, the Government and the Association jointly consider the possibility of re-examining the warnings given to the trade unionists in a constructive spirit.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) With regard to the alleged relocations of inspectors, the Committee invites the Government to examine, with ASITRADERO, the Association s proposal to create a framework regulation to re-establish the form, methods and reasons for the relocations.(b) With regard to the alleged warnings, in order to restore harmonious relations between the parties, the Committee suggests that the Government and the Association jointly consider the possibility of re-examining the warnings issued to trade unionists in a constructive spirit.",0,2014,Dominican Republic
14,".The Committee last examined this case at its October  meeting and presented an interim report to the Governing Body [see th Report, paras ' , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (October )].
.The Government sent new observations in communications dated  July and  November ,  January and  and  June , and  January and  February .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its previous examination of the case in October , the Committee made the following recommendations [see th Report, para. ]:(a)	While emphasizing the seriousness of the alleged facts, the Committee does not as yet have specific and detailed information concerning the different allegations or the proof that the present case ' as indicated by the Government ' has been settled by the courts. The Committee urges the Government to resend the communication dated  October , referred to in the Government s reply but not received by the Office.(b)	The Committee urges the Government to obtain, through the national employers' organization concerned, the observations of the firms TEGRA and Pollo Cibao on the allegations and to communicate those observations without delay.(c)	Pending receipt of said information, the Committee urges the Government to ensure the full exercise of trade union rights in the above firms.
.In communications dated  July and  November ,  January and  and  June , and  January and  February , the Government provides the following additional information.
.With regard to recommendation (a) from its previous examination of the case (referring to a communication dated  October  in which the Government indicated that the case had been settled by the courts), the Government clarifies that the evidence was sent in a communication dated  March  and contained information from the National Confederation of Trade Union Unity (CNUS) that had already been sent to the Committee. In the communication, the CNUS indicates that Case No.  relating to the Poultry and Livestock Corporation (Pollo Cibao) (hereinafter, the poultry enterprise) was settled by the national courts. In this regard, the Government points out that the court decisions referred to by the CNUS concern a request for authorization to dismiss a leader of the Pollo Cibao Poultry and Livestock Corporation Workers' Union (SITRACAGPC), which was filed by the corporation and resulted in Decision No. / of  November  of the Labour Court of the Judicial District of Santo Domingo, which authorized the dismissal after establishing that the grounds for the dismissal were misconduct, not union activity. (The Government adds that this Decision was appealed, but that the appeal was declared inadmissible in Judgment No.  of  June  of the Third Labour Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice.)
.As to the allegation that the firms brought legal action to have the trade union s registration annulled, the Government provides an extract from Judgment No. / of  October , which denied the action to annul the union registration of the complainant organization due to the total absence of evidence.
.With regard to the allegation that union members have been pressured to give up their union membership under threat of dismissal, the Government indicates that there is no evidence of any pressure placed on the union members or officials by the firms in question. The Government says that this statement is based on its monitoring of labour-related complaints and information that is disseminated through the country s various forms of media, as well as on the enforcement of labour standards by the labour inspectorate.
.With respect to the allegation that union leaders and members have been denied entry to ship unloading facilities, the Government emphasizes that, because it is an island, the Dominican Republic has many docks and dockworker unions and that these unions and their federations have concluded a large number of collective agreements with the port firms, regulating relations between them (for example, according to the Government, trade unions may carry out the checks of their members). Furthermore, the Government indicates that, in the light of the country s geographical location, access to dock loading and unloading zones is a matter of national security and therefore surveillance measures are in place which, under no circumstances, can be considered bans or restrictions on access for workers.
.As to the alleged failure to pay wages to union members protected by union immunity, the Government reports that there is no evidence of this type of violation either.
.With regard to the allegation of a violent suppression of a peaceful march on  March , the Government indicates that neither the Ministry of Labour nor state security agencies have any record of this event.
.On the other hand, in a general manner, the Government reports that the labour inspectorate detected  some practices that it considered contrary to freedom of association' in the poultry enterprise (without specifying whether they relate to the allegations contained in the complaint or providing any supporting documentation). The Government indicates that infringement reports were subsequently issued and sent to the Public Prosecutor s Office and that the corresponding penalty would be imposed by the national courts.
.The Government adds that it met with representatives of the poultry enterprise, who said that they were respectful of the establishment of trade unions and of the relevant provisions set forth in the Labour Code, stressing that they are open to dialogue aimed at addressing any issues raised by any of the firm s unions, within the limits of the law. As to collective bargaining with the poultry enterprise, the Government reports that the Ministry of Labour has organized several meetings in an effort to reconcile the parties, who have reached satisfactory agreements, although they have not concluded a collective agreement.
.Moreover, the Committee notes that in its communication dated  June , the Government reported that it envisaged the establishment, by the end of June , of a Dispute Settlement Board and therefore requested the Committee to allow the Board to hear the case before re-examining it. In response to a request from the Committee for information on the status of this case before the new national Board, in communications dated  January and  February , the Government provides a report from the Director of Mediation of the Ministry of Labour, indicating that: (i) in the light of a request dated  August  of the then applicant trade union, the Directorate of Mediation and Arbitration summoned the parties to a hearing on Thursday,  September ; (ii) on  September , the parties appeared before the Directorate of Mediation and Arbitration, and the firm s representative requested that the mediation be postponed, claiming that he was unaware of the documents that had been submitted by the union and requesting that the next meeting take place on  October ; (iii) the firm did not reappear and its absence was recorded; and (iv) since then, the union has not applied to either the General Directorate of Labour or the Directorate of Mediation and Arbitration.
.The Committee recalls that this case concerns allegations of pressure to give up trade union membership, suppression of a peaceful trade union march, legal action brought by the firms to have the complainant union s registration annulled, refusal of the firms to bargain collectively and other anti-union acts. The Committee notes that in early June , the Government requested that a national Dispute Settlement Board (which was to be established at the end of that month) be allowed to hear the case before it was re-examined by the Committee. Having requested the Government to provide information on any developments in this regard, the Committee observes that the Government s reply does not indicate whether the complaint has been heard by this Dispute Settlement Board. (The reply only provides information on the legal action to annul the union s registration and on the latest mediation attempts within the Ministry, due to a request for mediation submitted by the complainant union in .)
.The Committee notes that, based on the information provided by the Government, the court decisions to which the Government referred in its initial reply to the complaint in order to show that the case had been settled (with reference to a communication from a national union confederation which stated that the complaint had been settled by the courts) concern the dismissal of a leader of a different union from the complainant organization. The Committee notes that these judicial decisions do not relate to or prove the examination or any settlement of the allegations contained in this complaint.
.As to the allegation that the firms brought legal action to have the trade union s registration annulled, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, the action to annul the union registration of the complainant organization was denied in a judgment dated  October .
.With regard to the allegation that union members have been pressured to give up",0,2014,Dominican Republic
15,"their union membership under threat of dismissal, the Committee notes the Government s indication that it has no proof of such pressure. The Committee observes the Government s indication that this statement is based on its monitoring of labour-related complaints and information. In this respect, the Committee observes that, while the Government refers in a general manner to the functions of the labour inspectorate by stating that the allegations of pressure have not been substantiated, the Government does not indicate whether an inspection was conducted to investigate this allegation. The Committee further observes that the Government also fails to indicate whether other allegations of anti-union discrimination have been investigated (such as the allegation that union leaders and members have been denied entry to ship unloading facilities or the allegation that union members protected by union immunity have not been paid wages). Moreover, the Committee observes that the Government refers, in a general manner in relation to the poultry enterprise, to the conduct of inspections and the detection of  some practices that it considered contrary to freedom of association' and that infringement reports were subsequently issued and sent to the Public Prosecutor s Office so that the corresponding penalty would be imposed by the national courts. Noting that the Government does not specify the nature of the detected infringements (or whether they relate to the allegations contained in the complaint), the Committee expects that the Government will ensure that the necessary investigations are carried out to ascertain whether pressure has been exerted on union members to renounce their membership under threat of losing their jobs and, if such anti-union actions have taken place, that corresponding penalties will be imposed and the appropriate compensation will be awarded.
.With respect to the allegations that the firms refuse to engage in collective bargaining, the Committee welcomes the Government s efforts to organize meetings with the poultry enterprise in an attempt to reconcile the parties (as a result of which, satisfactory agreements are said to have been reached, although a collective agreement has not been concluded). The Committee encourages the Government to continue to promote collective bargaining between the complainant union and the enterprises concerned.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee expects that the Government will ensure that the necessary investigations are carried out to ascertain whether pressure has been exerted on union members to renounce their membership under threat of losing their jobs and, if such anti-union actions have taken place, that corresponding penalties will be imposed and the appropriate compensation will be awarded.(b)	The Committee encourages the Government to continue promoting collective bargaining between the complainant union and the enterprises concerned.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the Union of Freight Handling Workers of the firm Terminal Granelera del Caribe SA (TEGRA) and the Jarabacoa Poultry and Livestock Corporation (Pollo Cibao), dated  March .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  March .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communication of  March , the Union of Freight Handling Workers of the firm Terminal Granelera del Caribe SA (TEGRA) and the Jarabacoa Poultry and Livestock Corporation (Pollo Cibao), affiliated to the General Confederation of Workers of the Dominican Republic (CGTRD), allege that the workers of both firms have been the victims of very serious violations of labour laws (failure to pay wages and to enrol such workers in the social security scheme, inhuman transport, refusal of means to guarantee occupational health and safety with large numbers of accidents, etc.) and that since they set up the trade union in , the security forces have not allowed trade union leaders or members ' the majority of whom are Haitians ' to enter the premises where ships are unloaded, nor do they receive their wages, etc. The complainant union explains that the lists of workers are communicated by the firm to the Directorate General of Customs, the Dominican Port Authority and the Haina International Terminals company which are, after all, those which allow (or do not allow) workers to enter ships to unload goods. According to the allegations, the mediation meetings requested by the union with the Ministry of Labour in  were not attended by the representatives of the firms.
.The complainant union states that a peaceful march protesting against the alleged facts by members of the trade union in the Port of Ro Haina was put down with tear gas and gun cartridges.
.Furthermore, according to the allegations, the firms in question have refused to negotiate the preliminary draft collective agreement presented by the trade union since , as is made clear from the documents sent by the complainant union. The mediation undertaken by the representatives of the Ministry of Labour has not produced any results either.
.The complainant union states that it has reminded the firms in writing that the workers protected by trade union immunity must be paid their wages and allowed to continue performing their regular duties; an official request for such payment has been made by the trade union (which sent the corresponding document).
.Finally, the complaint states that the firms have submitted to the courts a request to annul the registration of the complainant union.
.In its communication of  March , the Government states that the case submitted by the complainant has been settled and refers to a communication dated  October , which, according to the Government, was sent to the International Labour Standards Department. The Government adds that the National Confederation of Trade Union Unity indicated, in a written submission of  July  (the Government encloses the submission), that the case in question was settled by the national courts in relation to the firm Pollo Cibao.
.The Committee notes the seriousness of the allegations presented by the claimant union, which refer to pressure placed on union members to give up their union membership, or lose their jobs, the refusal to allow them to enter or work in the ship unloading facilities (controlled by security guards), failure to pay wages to the union activists (protected by trade union immunity), refusal by the firms to bargain collectively and to attend the mediation hearings of the Ministry of Labour, violent suppression of a peaceful march on  March  and the bringing of legal action by the firms to have the trade union s registration annulled.
.The Committee observes that the Government and a national trade union confederation state that this case has been settled by the national courts in relation to the firm Pollo Cibao. The Committee observes that the Government refers to a communication dated  October , not received by the Office; the Committee is not therefore in possession of specific and detailed information on the different allegations or of proof of the Government s statement that this case has been settled by the courts (this refers to a ruling or a possible agreed settlement between the parties before the judge). The Committee urges the Government to send said information and the communication of  October , to which the Government refers in its reply. The Committee urges the Government to obtain the observations of the firms TEGRA and Pollo Cibao on the allegations through the national employers' organization concerned and to communicate them without delay so that the Committee may examine the case on the basis of sufficient information.
.Pending receipt of the information from the Government, the Committee urges it to ensure the full exercise of trade union rights in both firms.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	While emphasizing the seriousness of the alleged facts, the Committee does not as yet have specific and detailed information concerning the different allegations or the proof that the present case ' as indicated by the Government ' has been settled by the courts. The Committee urges the Government to resend the communication dated  October , referred to in the Government s reply but not received by the Office.(b)	The Committee urges the Government to obtain, through the national employers' organization concerned, the observations of the firms TEGRA and Pollo Cibao on the allegations and to communicate those observations without delay.(c)	Pending receipt of said information, the Committee urges the Government to ensure the full exercise of trade union rights in the above firms.",1,2014,Dominican Republic
16,".The complaint is contained in a communication of the National Confederation of Dominican Workers (CNTD) dated  October . The CNTD submitted new allegations in a communication of  March .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  October .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Workers' Representatives Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  October , the CNTD states that in its meeting of  January , the workers of the company Ciramar International Trading Ltd decided to establish the Union of Workers of Ciramar International (STECI), which was registered by the Ministry of Labour under No. /. The complainant organization alleges that on  January , the company Ciramar International Trading Ltd dismissed (termination of contract for no valid reason) all the founding members of the trade union, claiming that it was carrying out the orders of the Chief of Naval Staff, which did not acknowledge the trade union and denied the dismissed persons entry to the company s premises (according to the complainant these facts are recorded in Report No. - submitted under the investigation carried out on Ciramar International Trading Ltd).
.The company Ciramar International Trading Ltd manufactures and repairs ships and its main headquarters are located in the naval base of Las Calderas, in the municipality of Bani and province of Peravia, in the south of the country. Although the company is located inside the grounds of a naval military base, it is not attached to this military body and the workers that established the trade union are not part of the military. The fact that a company is located in areas controlled by military bodies does not mean that its workers cannot form a trade union and that they are excluded from the scope of ILO Convention No. .
.The complainant organization indicates that, following their dismissal for participating in the foundation of the trade union, the dismissed workers Sandy Soto Daz, Richard Candelario, Onasis R. Espinosa, Vctor Beltre G., Beato Brujan Arias, Gilberto de los Santos, Bodre Brujan, Porfirio Ramrez Guzmn, Jos del Carmen Guance, Samuel de Jess Franco, Daniel Ramrez Bez and Santos Reyes filed a complaint against Ciramar International Ltd, before the competent district court, the Civil, Commercial and Labour Panel of the Court of First Instance of the Judicial District of Peravia. In this complaint they requested the court to declare the dismissals null and void, order their reinstatement in their normal activities, the payment of wages foregone over the period that they were not in the company and compensation for damages caused.
.The complainant states that pursuant to the abovementioned complaint, the Civil, Commercial and Labour Panel of the Court of First Instance of the Judicial District of Peravia handed down Ruling No.  on  July  in which the presiding judge decided not to order the workers' reinstatement  since the current labour legislation in the Dominican Republic does not provide for the reinstatement of workers and workers dismissed under such conditions (protected by trade union immunity) are only entitled to compensation' 
.The complainants state that protection guaranteeing the exercise of a fundamental right, in this case the freedom of association, must include the restitution of the right once this has been breached. To exercise the right to organize, dismissed workers must be reinstated to their posts, since financial compensation does not guarantee the exercise of the right to organize, but only provides monetary compensation for the damages caused. Only the continued employment of the union founders, leaders and members guarantees the existence and effective operation of the workers' union. Therefore, their irregular and abusive dismissal should lead to their reinstatement in their posts. Accepting only financial compensation for the dismissal of union leaders and activists is tantamount giving up the right to organize, which contradicts the terms of Convention No. . According to the complainant, the position adopted by the company Ciramar International Trading Ltd by dismissing and denying entry to its premises to the union founders and leaders, on the grounds of the supposed opposition of the Navy of the Dominican Republic, constitutes a flagrant violation of Article  of Convention No. , and Articles  and  of Convention No. . At the same time, the decision of the Civil, Commercial and Labour Panel of the Court of First Instance of the Judicial District of Peravia, not to order the reinstatement of the workers dismissed in trade union reprisals and to attempt to settle the case through financial compensation alone, also constitutes a serious violation of freedom of association and of the terms of Conventions Nos  and .
.In its communication of  March , the CNTD states that on  July ,  workers of the company Elsamex International SL, who were working on the extension of the Las Amricas motorway, on the stretch for the province of San Pedro de Macors and La Romana, in the exercise of the right to form a trade union, enshrined in the Constitution of the Dominican Republic, the Labour Code and Conventions Nos  and , created the Union of Workers of Elsamex Internacional SL ' Concesionaria Dominicana de Autopistas y Carreteras (CODACSA) (STEEI CODACSA) to counter the company s recent treatment of workers. The CNTD alleges that, as soon as the company Elsamex International SL was notified of the creation of the trade union, it applied a whole series of serious anti-union practices.
.The complainant organization indicates that on  February , the STEEI CODACSA notified the company of a draft collective agreement to initiate a bargaining process in view of signing of a collective agreement. The interest and the actions taken by the union and the workers of Elsamex International SL to exercise the right to collective bargaining and improve living and working conditions through a collective agreement were thwarted. After various mediation sessions before the Ministry of Labour the mediation process was brought to an end on  April , when the company declared that:  the company currently has no interest in concluding a collective agreement with its employees and the trade union that they have created, and that for the time being, its relations with the workers' union will be regulated in accordance with the Dominican Labour Code' 
.The CNTD indicates that, following the failure of the mediation due to the company s refusal to bargain collectively, the trade union followed all the legal procedures to stage a strike. Under pressure from the strike, the Ministry of Labour offered further mediation. Following various rounds of meetings and the company s initial refusal to negotiate an agreement, proposals were discussed and agreed on, but the company did not sign the agreement. On  February , following on from its anti-union practices employed to obstruct the signing of the collective agreement and its workers' right to organize, Elsamex International SL proceeded to suspend (without pay) union leaders Pilar Castro Madrigal, Eliezer Jil, Carlos Julio Santos de la Cruz, Santo G. Michell, Juan Samuel F., Julio Berson Hernndez, Pablo Taveras and Ramn Orlando Santana Rijo.
.The CNTD adds that the companies Elsamex International SL and the CODACSA are interrelated, as Elsamex International SL is one of the founders of the latter. The workers would receive orders from representatives of both companies indistinctly, which indicates that they are the same company.
.The complainant organization indicates that, since the suspension of the union leaders, Elsamex International SL and CODACSA continue with their work on the extension of the Las Amricas motorway. The CNTD adds that, as a result of this barefaced illegal suspension, to prevent the signing of the collective agreement and further trade union action, such as another strike, the suspended workers Pilar Castro Madrigal, Eliezer Jil, Carlos Julio Santos de la Cruz, Santo G. Michell, Juan Samuel F., Julio Berson Hernndez, Pablo Taveras and Ramn Orlando Santana Rijo, filed a complaint before the Labour Court of San Pedro de Macors, requesting that it declare the suspensions illegal, order the workers' reinstatement to their usual posts, order the company to pay the wages foregone during the period of illegal suspension, and the payment of compensation for the damages caused by the company in its attempt to stop the workers' from organizing, bargaining collectively and striking .
.In response to this request, Panel No.  of the Labour Court of San Pedro de Macors handed down Ruling No. - on  October , ordering Elsamex International SL and CODACSA to pay the wages forgone for the months from  February  to the date of the final ruling or the defendant s termination of the work contracts. These companies were also ordered to pay compensation for the damages caused to the abovementioned workers as a result of the companies' violation of their right to organize.
.Ruling No. - handed down by the Labour Court of San Pedro de Macors (Panel No. ) was appealed by",0,2010,Dominican Republic
17,"the companies and also by the workers, who requested the Labour Court of San Pedro de Macors to uphold the decision and include a further article ordering the reinstatement of the workers to their usual position. As a result of this appeal, the Labour Court of San Pedro de Macors handed down appeal Labour Ruling No.  , revoking Ruling No. - handed down by the Labour Court, absolving CODACSA from any liability and rejecting the workers' trade union immunity protection. It also allowed the false closure and termination of the company s activities. In an attempt to please everyone, the Labour Court only ordered Elsamex International SL to pay , Dominican Republic pesos (DOP) in damages per worker (DOP, is the equivalent of US$.) to Pilar Castro Madrigal, Eliezer Jil, Carlos Julio Santos de la Cruz, Santo G. Michell, Juan Samuel F., Julio Berson Hernndez, Pablo Taveras and Ramn Orlando Santana Rijo for the violation of labour law standards and legislation established in the Constitution.
.During the actions brought before both courts, the complainant workers provided evidence of the companies' anti-union practices, firstly to dismantle the trade union and then to avoid signing the collective agreement and obstructing the right to strike, which explains the fictitious closure of the company. The interrelation and solidarity between the two companies was also demonstrated. According to the CNTD, Ruling No. - of the Labour Court of San Pedro de Macors, makes the Dominican Republic guilty of violating Conventions Nos  and  by not implementing the mechanisms to guarantee the exercise of the right to organize, to collective bargaining and to strike of the workers Pilar Castro Madrigal, Eliezer Jil, Carlos Julio Santos de la Cruz, Santo G. Michell, Juan Samuel F., Julio Berson Hernndez, Pablo Taveras and Ramn Orlando Santana Rijo, who were working for Elsamex International SL and CODACSA.
.In its communication dated  October , the Government declares that both the Constitution and the Labour Code fully guarantee the freedom of association and collective bargaining of workers, which is also enshrined in Conventions Nos  and  of the International Labour Organization, which have been ratified by the Dominican Republic. In view of guaranteeing this right, following the complaints filed by both the CNTD and the STEEI CODACSA, the Ministry of Labour initiated a series of investigations through the Labour Inspectorate, which in various instances found that the company in question was indeed adopting an anti-union attitude; in such cases, the labour inspectors reported the corresponding violations.
.With regard to collective bargaining, as a result of the interventions requested by the CNTD, the Ministry of Labour proceeded to organize meetings, which at first, were not attended by the company. However, at the Ministry of Labour s insistence the company attended the requested mediation sessions, sitting down with the trade union to initiate the collective bargaining procedure. The Government indicates that after various mediation sessions the parties managed to negotiate an agreement. However, when the agreement was about to be signed, Elsamex International SL and CODACSA declared that they no longer held the work licence that they had signed with the Ministry of Public Works in previous years. In view of the above, one of the companies proceeded to terminate its workers' contracts, requesting the definitive closure of the company before the Ministry of Labour. This closure was denied on the grounds that the Ministry considered that the arguments submitted in the request were unsubstantiated.
.The Government indicates that, as the CNTD states in its complaint, the union leaders proceeded to lodge an appeal before the relevant courts, as a result of which, according to information from the CNTD, the appeal is currently awaiting a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice.
.With regard to the allegations against the company Ciramar International Trading Ltd, the Government declares that since the workers of this company decided to form a trade union, the Ministry of Labour has provided them with all the support specified in the Labour Code and in ILO Conventions Nos  and . In this respect, the Government intervened in the whole process of the formation of the trade union in question. However, the company did not comply with the Government s observations that it should allow the establishment of the trade union, and on this basis, was charged with the violation of freedom of association and adoption of unfair practices in respect of freedom of association.
.The Government indicates that, in view of the position taken by the company Ciramar International Trading Ltd, the trade unionists filed a complaint requesting the annulment of the dismissals, the reinstatement of the workers and the payment of wages. In this respect, a decision was handed down in which, although the Court ordered the company to pay compensation, it failed to rule on the annulment of the dismissals and the reinstatement of the workers. In light of this, the workers filed an appeal which is currently pending the decision of the San Cristobal Court of Appeal.
.The Government adds that, on another front, the Ministry of Labour is pursuing actions and meeting with the navy with a view to it reasoning with the company to make it understand that the workers are free to establish a trade union and engage in collective bargaining. The Government reiterates that it is open to any guidance or observations from the ILO regarding the issues raised in this report, and it stresses that it remains intent on ensuring effective compliance with legal standards, whether these are national or international, in view of guaranteeing peace in the workplace with regard to the employer worker relationship.
.The Committee observes that in this case the CNTD alleges that days after having constituted the STECI, all its founding members were dismissed (named in the complaint). Moreover, the CNTD alleges that in the context of anti-union practices to prevent the signing of the collective agreement and the exercise of the right to organize, the company Elsamex International SL ' CODACSA suspended eight union leaders (named in the complaint).
.With respect to the dismissal of all the founding members of the STECI, the Committee notes that the Government states that: () the company workers received the Ministry of Labour s full support from the moment that they decided to establish a trade union; () the authorities intervened throughout the process of creating the trade union, but the company did not comply with the observations made that it should allow the establishment of the trade union and it was therefore charged with the violation of freedom of association and of adopting unfair practices in respect of the freedom of association; () in view of the attitude adopted by the company, the unionized workers filed a complaint requesting the annulment of the dismissals, the reinstatement of the workers, and the payment of wages foregone; () in this respect, a ruling was handed down, which while ordering the company to pay compensation, made no ruling regarding the annulment of the dismissals and the reinstatement of the workers; () in response, the workers filed an appeal, which is pending a decision by the Court of Appeal of San Cristobal; () the Ministry of Labour is pursuing actions and meeting with the navy with a view to it reasoning with the company to make it understand that the workers are free to form a trade union and engage in collective bargaining; and () it is open to any guidance or observations from the ILO regarding the issues raised in this complaint.
.The Committee observes that the complainant organization confirms that the complainants appealed to the courts requesting that the dismissals be declared null and void, ordering the workers' reinstatement, the payment of the wages foregone and compensation for damages caused. In this regard, the complainant organization submits a copy of the ruling, where the preamble indicates that: ()  regarding the first claim made by the complainants, it should be established whether the complainants were dismissed by the defendant, as they alleged; in this respect, article  of the Labour Code states that the dismissal of workers protected by trade union immunity must first be submitted to the Labour Court, to determine within no more than five days whether the grounds for dismissal refer to an offense, or to union leadership, duties or activities. Where the employer does not observe this formality, the dismissal is null and void or does not terminate the work contract'  ()  in this case, the defendant did not comply with the requirement established in the previous article and, as the report of the labour inspector states, limited itself to claiming that the navy denied the workers entry to the company, therefore entitling them to dismiss them'  ()  having established that the complainants were not allowed to enter the company on the grounds of their trade union activity and being unable to establish whether their dismissal was justified, the court must declare this null and void, thereby upholding the validity of the work contract'  ()  the complainants'",0,2010,Dominican Republic
18,"request their reinstatement but this must be rejected on the grounds that the current legislation does not provide for reinstatement and that the workers dismissed in those circumstances, will only be liable to compensation in the event of this being declared unjustified or null and void, all obligations and restrictions resulting in compensation but not in reinstatement'  ()  that by not having complied with the requirements established in the Labour Code the defendant violated the rights of these workers, whereby the company is obliged to compensate them' (the company is ordered to pay DOPmillion in compensation to the complainants). The complainant organization contests the court s decision against ordering the reinstatement of the workers and its attempt to settle the case through financial compensation only.
.In this respect, noting that the administrative authority and the judiciary confirm the anti-union nature of the dismissals and the violation of article  of the Labour Code on submitting the dismissal of a worker protected by trade union immunity to the Labour Court, the Committee stresses that  anti-union discrimination is one of the most serious violations of freedom of association, as it may jeopardize the very existence of trade unions' [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ]. Moreover, while taking note of the decision of the Labour Court and of the fact that the legislation does not provide for the possibility of reinstatement, the Committee recalls that no one should be subjected to anti-union discrimination because of legitimate trade union activities and that the remedy of reinstatement should be available to those who are victims of anti-union discrimination [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. Under these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to amend the legislation so as to bring it into conformity with this principle. The Committee requests the Government to continue to make every effort to bring the parties together with the objective of obtaining the reinstatement of the dismissed union founders. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.With regard to the allegations that, following on from anti-union practices to prevent the signing of a collective agreement and the exercise of the right to organize, the company Elsamex International SL ' CODACSA suspended eight union leaders (named in the complaint), the Committee notes that the Government states that: () the Constitution and the Labour Code fully guarantee freedom of association; () in view of guaranteeing this right and in response to the complaints submitted by the CNTD and STEEI CODACSA, the Ministry of Labour initiated a series of investigations through the Labour Inspectorate, which in various instances found that the company in question was adopting an anti-union attitude; in such cases, the labour inspectors reported the corresponding violations; () after the companies declared that they no longer held the work licence that they had signed with the Ministry of Public Works in previous years, they proceeded to terminate their workers' contracts and requested their definitive closure before the Ministry of Labour (which was rejected); and () the union leaders proceeded to lodge appeals before the corresponding courts and the appeal against this decision is currently pending at the Supreme Court of Justice. The Committee also observes that the complainant organization sends a copy of the first instance ruling handed down by the Labour Court of the Judicial District of Pedro de Macors regarding the claim of wages forgone due to illegal suspension and compensation for damages due to the violation of the freedom of association in which: () it is indicated that the  complainants' request the payment of DOP, in compensation for damages caused by the defendant violating its freedom of association and illegally withholding the complainants' wages, whereby it proceeds to uphold their request, but for the sum of DOP,,'  ()  it upholds, as regards the form, the request for wages foregone due to illegal suspension and compensation of damages due to the violation of the freedom of association and the illegal withholding of wages'  and ()  it orders, on the merits, the companies Elsamex International SL and CODACSA to pay the corresponding wages owed to the complainant workers for the months from  February  to the date of the final ruling or up to the defendant s termination of the work contracts' 
.The Committee also notes that the complainant organization submits the second instance ruling of the Labour Court of the Judicial District of San Pedro de Macors regarding the suspensions where it decided to: ()  revoke Ruling No. - of  October  handed down by the Labour Court of the Judicial District of San Pedro de Macors stating insufficient legal grounds, the distortion of events and documents'  ()  reject the complaint of the violation of freedom of association'  ()  order the company Elsamex International SL to pay DOP, per worker to Pilar Castro Madrigal, Eliezer Jil, Carlos Julio Santos de la Cruz, Santo G. Michell, Juan Samuel F., Julio Berson Hernndez, Pablo Taveras and Ramn Orlando Santana Rijo, in damages for the violation of labour law standards and legislation, for negligence in the management of working relationships and the social rights established in the Dominican Constitution'  and ()  absolve the company CODACSA of any liability' 
.In this respect, noting that the second instance court rejected the complaint of the violation of freedom of association and that, according to the Government, an appeal against this decision is currently pending before the Supreme Court of Justice, the Committee notes that ' according to the allegations ' the suspensions occurred during the process of bargaining a collective agreement, which failed, and following the staging of a strike and findings by the Labour Inspectorate that one of the companies was adopting an anti-union attitude. In these circumstances, the Committee recalls that in general  no person should be dismissed or prejudiced in employment by reason of trade union membership or legitimate trade union activities' [see Digest, op. cit., para. ], and requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the appeal of the ruling before the Supreme Court of Justice.
.Lastly, with regard to the alleged impossibility of concluding a collective agreement with the companies in question, the Committee notes that the Government states that: () as a result of the interventions requested by the CNTD, the Ministry of Labour proceeded to organize the corresponding sessions. At first, these were not attended by the companies, but at the Ministry of Labour s insistence they attended the requested mediation sessions, sitting down with the trade union to initiate the collective bargaining procedure; () following various mediation sessions, the parties were able to negotiate an agreement, but when this was going to be signed, the companies declared that they no longer held the work licence that they had previously signed with the Ministry of Public Works; and () only one of the companies (according to the Government s reply) applied to the Ministry of Labour for its definitive closure, and was rejected. In this respect, the Committee regrets to find that, despite its efforts, the trade union in question has not been able to conclude a collective agreement on working conditions with the company or companies concerned since . In these conditions, the Committee stresses that  measures should be taken to encourage and promote the full development and utilization of machinery for voluntary negotiation between employers or employers' organizations and workers' organizations, with a view to the regulation of terms and conditions of employment by means of collective agreements.' And  recalls the importance which it attaches to the obligation to negotiate in good faith for the maintenance of the harmonious development of labour relations' [see Digest, op. cit., paras  and ]. In these circumstances, the Committee urges the Government to take the necessary measures to promote collective bargaining between the STEEI CODACSA and the company or companies concerned. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee requests the Government to make every effort to bring the STECI and the company in question together, in view of achieving the reinstatement of the dismissed trade union founders. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard. Moreover, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to amend the legislation in accordance with the principle indicated in the conclusions in relation to the remedy of reinstatement in cases of anti-union dismissals.(b)	The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the appeal currently underway before the Supreme Court of Justice in relation to the suspension of eight union leaders of the STEEI CODACSA.(c)	The Committee urges the Government to take the necessary measures to promote collective bargaining between the STEEI CODACSA and the company or companies concerned.",1,2010,Dominican Republic

20,".The Committee last examined this case at its November  session [see th Report, paras ' ] and on that occasion: (i) as regards the alleged anti-union practices at the Frito Lay enterprise (hereinafter food company), the Committee urged the complainant and the Government to indicate whether or not administrative or judicial complaints had been filed and, if so, to keep it informed of their outcome; (ii) the Committee requested the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that  self-employed' workers fully enjoy freedom of association rights, and again drew this aspect of the case to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations; and (iii) the Committee requested the Government to keep it informed in respect of the allegations concerning flaws and a lack of impartiality in the functioning of the inspection system and recalled to the Government the availability of technical assistance from the ILO.
.In its communication dated  June , the Government submits a communication from the National Confederation of Trade Union Unity (CNUS) indicating that, in the context of the dispute between the food company and the National Union of Workers of Frito Lay Dominicana (Sintralaydo), it has been agreed that a joint committee on collective bargaining over working conditions will be established. Furthermore, according to the Government, the dispute in the Universal Aloe enterprise was submitted to the dispute settlement committee, which was expected to be set up at the end of June .
.In several communications sent between  October  and  March , the Government reports that, after it was established that Sintralaydo had the majority needed to engage in collective bargaining, a bargaining process was initiated which concluded on  March  with the signature of a collective agreement. The Government further indicates that the disputes between the food company and Sintralaydo are a thing of the past and that the relations between the enterprise and the trade union are very good.
.The Committee takes note of these various pieces of information. With regard to the food company, the Committee notes that neither the Government nor the complainant have informed it of any administrative or judicial complaints filed in respect of the alleged anti-union acts. The Committee notes with satisfaction that a collective bargaining process took place leading to the signature of a collective agreement between the abovementioned enterprise and Sintralaydo.
.The Committee notes that the Government has not provided information on the allegations concerning the flaws and a lack of impartiality in the functioning of the inspection system that might have arisen in various enterprises. The Committee recalls that the Government is responsible for preventing all acts of anti-union discrimination and it must ensure that complaints of anti-union discrimination are examined in the framework of national procedures which should be prompt, impartial and considered as such by the parties concerned [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ]. The Committee trusts that the Government will ensure full respect for this principle in the future and recalls to the Government the availability of technical assistance from the ILO in respect of labour inspection.
.Lastly, the Committee notes the Government s statement that the dispute in one of the enterprises concerned would be submitted to a dispute settlement committee that is being set up. In the absence of any particular request by the Committee for information with regard to that enterprise, the Committee trusts that the dialogue that takes place before the dispute settlement committee will have a positive impact. In the light of the various points that have previously been examined, the Committee will not continue its examination of this case.
.The Committee last examined this case at its May June  meeting, when it presented an interim report to the Governing Body [see th Report, paras ' , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (June )].
.Subsequently, the Government sent new observations in a communication dated  March .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.At its June  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendations on the matters still pending [see th Report, para. ]:(a)	The Committee regrets that the Government has not provided the information requested in March  on the matters still pending and requests the Government to be more cooperative in the future.(b)	The Committee once again urges the Government to indicate without delay whether self-employed workers and contract workers may bargain collectively, and draws this aspect of the case to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.(c)	As regards the alleged anti-union practices in the enterprises  Frito Lay Dominicana'   Universal Aloe' and  MERCASID'  the Committee urges the Government to provide additional information, in particular regarding the allegations of inspection flaws (absence of impartiality and failure to carry out inspections).
.With regard to recommendation (c), the conclusions and recommendations of the Committee from its March  meeting are reproduced below [see rd Report, para. ]:?Regarding the alleged anti-union practices in the Frito Lay Dominicana enterprise, the Universal Aloe enterprise and the MERCASID enterprise, the Committee notes that the Government indicates that:(a)	in the inspection report of  June , it is recorded that the Secretary-General of the Trade Union of Workers and Salespersons of Frito Lay Dominicana, Mr Ramn Mosquera, told the labour inspector that it was not in his interest for the complaint to be investigated but for it to be referred to the Ministry of Labour so that mediation with the enterprise could resume;(b)	the campaign of slander against Mr Pablo de la Rosa was an application by MERCASID for the lifting of trade union immunity, that the Labour Court of the National District, in its ruling of  August , rejected the application, and that the abovementioned enterprise complied with the ruling. Regarding the dismissal of workers for having joined a trade union, the Committee notes that the Government indicates that the Ministry of Labour has carried out various investigations into the alleged anti-union repression of trade union officers and found no evidence of practices contrary to freedom of association; and(c)	regarding the alleged threats against officers of the trade union of workers of the enterprise Universal Aloe, the Ministry of Labour found no signs of anti-union discrimination by the enterprise, nor were practices harmful to freedom of association uncovered.?The Committee requests the Government to provide additional information, in particular as regards the allegations of inspection flaws (absence of impartiality and failure to carry out inspections).
.In its communication of  March , the Government states that the case of the MERCASID enterprise has been resolved and that the trade union official ' who had obtained a second ruling from the Second Chamber of the Labour Court rejecting the enterprise s application to lift his trade union immunity so that he could be dismissed ' was not the victim of any retaliation by the enterprise. In a communication from the enterprise, attached by the Government, the enterprise explains that its application to the Court was made on account of an email with pornographic content that had been sent to a number of employees in the enterprise, as stated in the ruling. The Government adds that the complainant states, in a written communication accompanying its reply, that this case was already settled by the courts.
.As regards the allegation of anti-union practices at the Frito Lay Dominicana enterprise and the request for new mediation by the Ministry of Labour, the Government refers to the multiple instances of mediation aimed at the conclusion of a collective agreement between the trade union and the enterprise but does not send any information concerning the false accusations against the Secretary-General of the trade union, Mr Ramn Mosquera, designed to secure his dismissal, or concerning the anti-union dismissal of  union members in '  [see th Report, para. ].
.As regards the allegations concerning the Universal Aloe enterprise (threats against union officials), the Government states that in the course of the many inspections conducted in this enterprise no information or complaints relating to violations of freedom of association were received. However, the Government sent a communication from the complainant confederation dated July  stating that the complaint relating to this enterprise is still to be settled.
.The Committee notes the explanations from the Government and the MERCASID enterprise concerning the judicial proceedings for lifting the trade union immunity of the union s Secretary-General. Observing that the ruling went in favour of the union official and that consequently he was not dismissed, the Committee will not pursue its examination of this allegation.
.As regards the alleged anti-union practices at the Frito Lay Dominicana enterprise, the Committee observes that these relate to the '  period (allegations of the anti-union dismissal of  union members and false accusations against the union s Secretary-General, Mr Ramn Mosquera). The Committee notes that the",0,2010,Dominican Republic
21,"Government refers to the multiple instances of mediation aimed at the conclusion of a collective agreement between the enterprise and the union but not to the alleged anti-union practices. In view of the time that has elapsed since these allegations were made, the Committee urges the complainant and the Government to indicate whether or not administrative or judicial complaints have been filed and, if so, to keep it informed of their outcome.
.As regards the complainant s allegations in  concerning the Universal Aloe enterprise (threats against union officials), the Committee notes the Government s statement that in the course of the many inspections conducted at the enterprise no information or complaints relating to violations of freedom of association were received. In view of this, the Committee recalls in general terms that the exercise of trade union rights is incompatible with violence or threats of any kind and it is for the authorities to investigate without delay and, if necessary, penalize any act of this kind.
.Lastly, noting with regret that the Government has not responded to recommendation (b) made further to the previous examination of the case, the Committee observes that section  of the Labour Code links the concept of worker to the existence of an employment contract and that section  recognizes only enterprise, occupational or branch trade unions. The Committee requests the Government: (i) to ensure that  self-employed' workers fully enjoy freedom of association rights, in particular the right to join the organizations of their own choosing; (ii) to hold consultations to this end with all the parties involved with the aim of finding a mutually acceptable solution so as to ensure that workers who are self-employed could fully enjoy trade union rights for the purpose of furthering and defending their interest, including by the means of collective bargaining; and (iii) in consultation with the social partners concerned, to identify the particularities of self-employed workers that have a bearing on collective bargaining so as to develop specific collective bargaining mechanisms relevant to self-employed workers, if appropriate [see rd Report, Case No.  (Republic of Korea), para. ]. The Committee again draws this aspect of the case to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.
.As regards the allegations concerning flaws and a lack of impartiality in the functioning of the inspection system, the Committee, in view of the lack of specific observations from the Government on this matter, requests the Government to keep it informed of any developments in this respect and recalls to the Government the availability of technical assistance from the ILO.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	As regards the alleged anti-union practices at the Frito Lay Dominicana enterprise, the Committee urges the complainant and the Government to indicate whether or not administrative or judicial complaints have been filed and, if so, to keep it informed of their outcome.(b)	The Committee requests the Government: (i) to ensure that  self-employed' workers fully enjoy freedom of association rights, in particular the right to join the organizations of their own choosing; (ii) to hold consultations to this end with all the parties involved with the aim of finding a mutually acceptable solution so as to ensure that workers who are self-employed could fully enjoy trade union rights for the purpose of furthering and defending their interest, including by the means of collective bargaining; and (iii) in consultation with the social partners concerned, to identify the particularities of self-employed workers that have a bearing on collective bargaining so as to develop specific collective bargaining mechanisms relevant to self-employed workers, if appropriate. The Committee again draws this aspect of the case to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.(c)	Observing the allegations concerning flaws and a lack of impartiality in the functioning of the inspection system, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any developments in this respect and recalls to the Government the availability of technical assistance from the ILO.
.The Committee last examined this case at its March  meeting when it presented an interim report to the Governing Body [see rd Report, paras ' , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (March )].
.Since there has been no reply from the Government, the Committee has been obliged to postpone its examination of the case. At its March  meeting [see th Report, para. ], the Committee made an urgent appeal and drew the attention of the Government to the fact that, in accordance with the procedural rules set out in paragraph  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body, the Committee may present a report on the substance of this case even if the observations or information requested from the Government have not been received in due time. To date, the Government has not sent any information.
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.At its March  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendations [see rd Report, para. ]:(a)	the Committee requests the Government to indicate whether self-employed workers and contract workers may bargain collectively; and(b)	the Committee requests the Government to provide additional information as regards the allegations of inspection flaws (absence of impartiality and failure to carry out inspections).
.The Committee regrets that, despite the time that has elapsed since the previous examination of the case, the Government has not provided the requested information, even though it has been requested to do so several times, including through an urgent appeal. The Committee urges the Government to be more cooperative in the future.
.Under these circumstances and in accordance with the applicable procedure [see th Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session], the Committee finds itself obliged to present a report on the substance of the case without being able to take into account the information it had hoped to receive from the Government.
.The Committee reminds the Government that the purpose of the whole procedure is to ensure respect for trade union freedoms both in law and in practice; this Committee is therefore convinced that while this procedure protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments, on their side, must recognize the importance of formulating, for objective examination, detailed and accurate replies on the substance of the allegations made against them [see First Report of the Committee, para. ].
.Under these circumstances, the Committee reiterates its previous conclusions and recommendations, urges the Government to send the requested information and draws the legislative aspects of this case to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee regrets that the Government has not provided the information requested in March  on the matters still pending and requests the Government to be more cooperative in the future.(b)	The Committee once again urges the Government to indicate without delay whether self-employed workers and contract workers may bargain collectively, and draws this aspect of the case to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.(c)	As regards the alleged anti-union practices in the enterprises  Frito Lay Dominicana'   Universal Aloe' and  MERCASID'  the Committee urges the Government to provide additional information, in particular regarding the allegations of inspection flaws (absence of impartiality and failure to carry out inspections).
.The Committee last examined this case at its March  meeting, when it presented an interim report to the Governing Body [see th Report, paras ' , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (March )].
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  October .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.At its March  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendations [see th Report, paras ' ]:(a)	The Committee requests the Government, in consultation with the most representative workers' and employers' organizations, to take measures to amend the legislation in order to allow trade unions of self-employed workers or trade unions of contract workers to be founded and registered.(b)	Recalling that the Government freely ratified Convention No.  and that it is obliged to guarantee that the provisions of the Convention are respected, and assuming that all procedural requirements have been met, the Committee requests the Government to register SINAMITO (whose membership consists of self-employed workers), the Trade Union of Workers of the Enterprise Barrick Gold and the Trade Union of Electricity Generator and Convertor Building and Repair Workers and Related of Haina (whose members are contract workers).(c)	As to the National Trade Union of Workers of the Call Center Branch, the Committee requests the complainant organization to communicate its observations concerning the Government",1,2010,Dominican Republic
22,"s reply and expects that the Government and the trade union in question will together examine how the problems referred to by the Government might be resolved. The Committee also requests the Government to investigate claims of pressure being brought to bear on workers to get them to leave the trade union and if these allegations are proven to be true, to take the necessary measures to prevent any such acts from occurring in the future.(d)	As to SUTRAMICEMA and FUTRAMETAL, the Committee expects the Government and the trade union and the federation in question, to examine how the problems referred to by the Government might be solved. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.(e)	The Committee notes that the Government has not sent its observations regarding the allegations contained in the communication dated  July  concerning anti-union dismissals, threats and practices in certain enterprises, such as the Frito Lay Dominicana enterprise, the Universal Aloe enterprise and the MERCASID enterprise and requests the Government to send its observations without delay, together with the views of these enterprises obtained through the most representative employers' organization.
.Refusal to register the National Trade Union of Operators of Topographical Instruments (SINAMITO). In its communication dated  September , the Government states that, on  August , the trade union informed the Ministry of Labour that it had held an assembly on  July  at which the trade union had decided to amend its statutes and change its name to  Trade Union of Construction Workers and Operators of Topographical Instruments' (registration No. -). The Government states that, as a result of these arrangements, the application filed by the National Trade Union Confederation (CNUS) and SINAMITO is resolved.
.Constant harassment of the Trade Union of Workers and Salespersons of Frito Lay Dominicana. The Government states that the Ministry of Labour has responded appropriately to the various applications received from both the Trade Union of Workers of Frito Lay Dominicana and the CNUS and relating to alleged violations committed by that enterprise against both unionized and non-unionized workers, as reflected in the reports prepared by labour inspectors. In the inspection report of  June , it is recorded that the Secretary-General of the trade union, Mr Ramn Mosquea, told the labour inspector that it was not in his interest for the complaint to be investigated but for it to be referred to the Ministry of Labour so that mediation with the enterprise could resume.
.Refusal to register the United Trade Union of Workers of Minera Cerros de Maimn (SUTRAMICEMA). The Government states that the Ministry of Labour sent back the registration application on the grounds that it contained errors that made it impossible to proceed with registration in conformity with national legislation. The workers managing the trade union subsequently decided to join the Trade Union of Workers of Cerro de Maimn Mine (SITRACEMA), registered under No. / on  October . The issue of the trade union registration application by the workers of that enterprise was thus resolved.
.Refusal to register the Trade Union of Workers of the Enterprise Barrick Gold. The Government states that the Ministry of Labour, acting in accordance with labour legislation, sent back the application on the grounds that the CNUS itself had reported in a previous communication that workers listed in the Barrick Gold registration application worked for an enterprise known as  Graa y Montero' (G&M). The Government states that returning a registration application with observations does not mean that the application has been rejected. The General Labour Director attended a meeting with CNUS officers and lawyers to discuss and take note of their observations. As a result, the United Trade Union of Workers of the Enterprise Minera Pueblo Viejo Cotu (Barrick Gold) was registered under No. - by the Ministry of Labour on  June , and the representation was resolved.
.Refusal to register the Single Federation of Workers of the Mining, Metallurgy, Chemicals, Energy and Various Industries and Related (FUTRAMETAL). The Government reiterates that on  March , the registration application was returned to FUTRAMETAL together with various observations clearly based on the law and understood and recognized by the trade union confederations. The observations were accepted by the Secretary-General of the federation and FUTRAMETAL was registered on  November .
.Anti-union practices in the MERCASID enterprise. In the complaint filed by the CNUS regarding MERCASID, it is stated that workers have been dismissed from this enterprise for having joined an existing trade union, and that a campaign of slander was launched against Mr Pablo de la Rosa, a trade union officer, with the aim of damaging his image and forcing him to abandon his demand that the collective agreement in force be respected. Regarding the situation of Mr de la Rosa, the Government states that, according to investigations conducted by the Ministry of Labour, the real issue was the application by MERCASID for the lifting of trade union immunity because of alleged misconduct by Mr de la Rosa under the Labour Code. The Labour Court of the National District, in its ruling of  August , rejected the application by MERCASID, which complied with the ruling, and Mr de la Rosa kept his job and remained an officer of the trade union.
.Regarding the dismissal of workers who joined the trade union, the Government states that the Ministry of Labour has conducted various investigations, including those of  August and  September , in response to the complaint lodged by the SID Workers' Trade Union (SITRASID) concerning the alleged anti-union repression of trade union officers. Neither investigation found evidence to indicate to the labour inspectorate that there had been any practices contrary to freedom of association. The inspectors observed that there was some rivalry between various officers, apparently over the leadership of the trade union.
.Refusal to register the Trade Union of Electricity Generator and Converter Building and Repair Workers and Related of Haina. In the complaint, the CNUS stated that the application for the registration of the Trade Union of Electricity Generator and Converter Building and Repair Workers and Related of Haina was filed with the Ministry of Labour on  October . The application contained all of the required documentation, which referred to the enterprises in which the founders of the trade union provided their services, and thereby proved that they were wage earners in those enterprises. The CNUS stated that, through a ruling dated  November , the General Labour Director rejected the trade union s application for registration, claiming that the union was being established by self-employed workers who were not governed by the Labour Code. The workers were dismissed as a result.
.The Government states that the Labour Code was the product of consensus and discussions among the parties to labour relations, namely, employers, workers and the State. The Code stipulates that its provisions are applicable to wage-earning workers, meaning that in this instance, the persons applying for registration are workers who are not covered by the Labour Code. The State accordingly passed Act No. - of , whereby all associations or entities not governed by the Labour Code are entitled to organize and acquire a legal personality. Regarding the dismissal of the workers, the Government states that it never received a report of any alleged dismissals, and since the alleged enterprises are not known, there is no way an investigation can be conducted into the allegations.
.Anti-union practices in the Universal Aloe enterprise. The complainant organization stated that pregnant women had been dismissed from this enterprise, direct threats had been made against trade union officials and the interventions of the Ministry of Labour had not been sufficiently effective. The Government states that the Ministry of Labour keeps the enterprise under constant supervision through the labour inspectorate; over  investigations had been carried out in the previous year, mostly in response to complaints from the workers' trade union, and every application had been duly processed. Regarding the dismissal of pregnant workers, the Government states that the Ministry of Labour had recorded only one case in which a female worker had had a fight with a female colleague, apparently in a fit of jealousy thought to involve a trade union officer. No evidence of anti-union discrimination by the enterprise had been found. Likewise, no practices harmful to freedom of association had been uncovered by any of the various investigations.
.Refusal to register the Trade Union of Workers of the Call Center Branch. The Government reiterates that some of the workers mentioned in relation to the establishment of the trade union had informed the Ministry of Labour in writing that they had not consented to being part of the trade union, or that their names had been used without their knowledge. The Ministry of Labour had no choice but to take these reports into consideration when deciding whether or not to register the trade union, otherwise it would have exposed itself to a legal challenge by the workers in question. Similarly, given that enterprises are required to inform the Ministry",0,2010,Dominican Republic
23,"of Labour of contract terminations, it was discovered that some of the workers mentioned in the application had been dismissed before the time of the founding assembly. Consequently, the trade union did not have the number of members required for the establishment of trade unions under labour legislation. It should be noted that Rococo Investment, Inc. (the enterprise that employed nearly all of the workers) was sanctioned by the Ministry of Labour for attempting to ignore the trade union immunity of the workers at the time the composition of the management committee was announced. The Government states that Rococo Investment, Inc. ceased operations in the Dominican Republic in September .
.The Government points out that there are no impediments to workers to establish their organizations and that various trade unions have been registered in recent months in the call centre branch, namely, the Trade Union of Workers of the Enterprise ACS (SETA); the Trade Union of Workers of the Enterprise Nearshore Call Center Services SA, and the National Union of Call Center Employees (UNECA).
.The Committee recalls that this case relates to anti-union actions and dismissals in the enterprises  Frito Lay Dominicana'   Universal Aloe' and  MERCASID'  as well as the refusal to register various trade unions, namely, the Trade Union of Workers of the Call Center Branch (enterprises Rococo Investment, Inc., Stream International, Language Line and Git Prepaid); SINAMITO; the Trade Union of Workers of the Enterprise Barrick Gold (enterprise Minera Pueblo Viejo Barrick Gold); the SUTRAMICEMA and the Trade Union of Electricity Generator and Converter Building and Repair Workers and Related of Haina; and the FUTRAMETAL.
.Regarding the refusal to register the abovementioned trade unions, and recalling that it asked for them to be registered, the Committee notes with interest that most of them are already registered or have opted to merge with another trade union, namely; SINAMITO, the Trade Union of Workers of the Enterprise Minera Pueblo Viejo Cotu (Barrick Gold); the FUTRAMETAL; and SITRACEMA ' formerly the (incipient) SUTRAMICEMA.
.Regarding the allegations of dismissal and impediments to the establishment of trade unions of self-employed workers or contract workers (the Trade Union of Electricity Generator and Converter Building and Repair Workers and Related of Haina), the Committee takes due note of the Government s statement that it has never received a report of any alleged anti-union dismissals and that, given that the Labour Code is applicable only to wage-earning workers, the State adopted Act No. -, whereby all associations or entities not governed by the Labour Code are entitled to organize and acquire a legal personality. The Committee requests the Government to indicate whether self-employed workers and contract workers may bargain collectively.
.Regarding the National Trade Union of Workers of the Call Center Branch, the Committee recalls that in its previous recommendations it had requested the complainant organization to communicate its observations concerning the Government s reply, and requested the Government to contact the trade union in question with a view to examining how the problems referred to by the Government might be resolved. The Committee notes that the complainant organization has not provided the observations requested. It also notes that the Government states that: (a) Rococo Investment, Inc. (the enterprise that employed nearly all of the workers) was sanctioned by the Ministry of Labour for attempting to ignore the trade union immunity of the workers at the time the composition of the management committee was announced; (b) the enterprise ceased operations in the Dominican Republic in September ; and (c) various trade unions have been registered in recent months in the call centre branch, namely, SETA; the Trade Union of Workers of the Enterprise Nearshore Call Center Services SA, and UNECA.
.Regarding the alleged anti-union practices in the Frito Lay Dominicana enterprise, the Universal Aloe enterprise and the MERCASID enterprise, the Committee notes that the Government indicates that:(a)	in the inspection report of  June , it is recorded that the Secretary-General of the Trade Union of Workers and Salespersons of Frito Lay Dominicana, Mr Ramn Mosquea, told the labour inspector that it was not in his interest for the complaint to be investigated but for it to be referred to the Ministry of Labour so that mediation with the enterprise could resume;(b)	the campaign of slander against Mr Pablo de la Rosa was an application by MERCASID for the lifting of trade union immunity, that the Labour Court of the National District, in its ruling of  August , rejected the application, and that the abovementioned enterprise complied with the ruling. Regarding the dismissal of workers for having joined a trade union, the Committee notes that the Government indicates that the Ministry of Labour has carried out various investigations into the alleged anti-union repression of trade union officers and found no evidence of practices contrary to freedom of association; and(c)	regarding the alleged threats against officers of the trade union of workers of the enterprise Universal Aloe, the Ministry of Labour found no signs of anti-union discrimination by the enterprise, nor were practices harmful to freedom of association uncovered.The Committee requests the Government to provide additional information, in particular as regards the allegations of inspection flaws (absence of impartiality and failure to carry-out inspections).
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:
.The complaint is contained in a communication of the National Trade Union Confederation (CNUS) dated  May . The CNUS sent additional information in a communication dated  July .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  August .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  May , the CNUS states that it is lodging a formal complaint against the Government of the Dominican Republic for refusal to register various trade unions.
.Refusal to register the National Trade Union of Workers of the Call Center Branch. The complaint organization states that, on  September ,  workers employed at so-called  Call Centre' enterprises (Rococo Investment Inc., Stream International, Language Line and Git Prepaid) decided to form the National Trade Union of Workers of the Call Center Branch. The complainant organization adds that, when holding the constituent assembly, the founding members of the trade union fulfilled all the requirements as to substance and form set out under the Labour Code regarding the establishment of a trade union: () more than  workers (in this case ) from the Call Center enterprises gave their consent, participating voluntarily in the constituent assembly of the trade union and approving the statutes, which were recorded in the minutes that were, in turn, signed, along with the statutes, the list of founding members and the notification of the assembly, by all the founding members present and certified by the president and secretary of the assembly; and () this documentation was deposited with the Ministry of State for Labour on  September , in order that the trade union might be registered.
.The complainant organization also states that, on  October , the founder members of the trade union were informed by the enterprise that the Ministry of State for Labour had refused their application for trade union registration. The complainant organization highlights the fact that, in accordance with the provisions of section  of the Labour Code, procedure dictates that the documentation should be returned to the trade union in order to allow the latter to make good any omission in terms of the content of the application for registration and to resubmit the dossier. The complainant organization states that the decision by the General Labour Director to reject the application for registration made by the National Trade Union of Workers of the Call Center Branch was based on the following facts: () the trade union being formed did not have  workers, based on the communications deposited by the enterprise and alleged written by Andy Tejada, Boris F. Gil, Eliezer Ferreira, Jos A. Mordn Fras, Antonio Estvez Castro, William O. Egunjob and Ada Ho Snchez, in which those individuals state that they do not wish to be associated with the founding of the trade union, despite having participated in the constituent assembly and having signed the corresponding documents; () Luis Chapman and Loverly R. Montes de Oca ceased to work for the Rococ Investment enterprise as of  May and  June  respectively, but the fact that they were working for the enterprise at the moment when the trade union was founded was not taken into account.
.The complainant organization states that on  October it lodged a hierarchical appeal with the Ministry of State for Labour against the ruling issued by the General Labour Director in which the trade union requested the Ministry of State for Labour to revoke said ruling and to order that the trade union be registered. However, through a ruling dated  January , the Ministry of State for Labour",0,2010,Dominican Republic
24,"decided to uphold the decision not to register the trade union.
.In its communication dated  July , the complainant organization adds that the workers of the Call Center branch who dared to exercise their trade union rights were faced with a wave of repression which led to several workers being dismissed, and which involved threats, blackmail, bribes and the recruitment of external agents in order to pressure the workers into giving up their attempt to have the trade union registered.
.Refusal to register the National Trade Union of Operators of Topographical Instruments (SINAMITO). The complainant organization states that SINAMITO has existed as an organization since , but that, owing to the supposed deterioration of the records held at the Ministry of State for Labour, it was impossible to locate the document attesting to the trade union s registration. Furthermore, against the background of this lapse on the part of the State, the General Labour Director suggested that the workers should found a new trade union, something which the workers proceeded to do. On  January , Jorge de Frank and Juan Francisco Rodrguez y Compartes deposited the documentation required under the Labour Code for registration of the trade union they had founded with the Ministry of State for Labour. On  January , the General Labour Director returned the documentation deposited because the enterprises for which the founding members of the trade union provided their services were not registered with the Ministry of State for Labour.
.The complainant organization states that, on  February , it requested the General Labour Director to register the trade union, given that the workers cannot be prevented from exercising a fundamental right such as the right to organize based on the fact that the enterprises for which they work are not registered with the Ministry of State for Labour, in particular given that no more than half of the small enterprises in the Dominican Republic are registered with this Ministry. Despite the communication transmitted by the CNUS, the General Labour Director continued to refuse to proceed with registration.
.In its communication dated  July , the complainant organization adds that the General Labour Directorate requested the workers to provide the payrolls of the enterprises for which they worked. The Directorate proceeded to check the names of staff members and, on allegedly finding that not all of the workers were listed on the payroll, refused to register the trade union, ignoring the fact that the workers could not be penalized for what was a failure on the part of the enterprise with regard to its obligations.
.Refusal to register the Trade Union of Workers of the Enterprise Barrick Gold. The complainant organization states that on  April, Julio Antonio Rojas, Oscar Nina Arias, Derby E. Rodrguez Via, Efrain Febriel Figuereo, Sandy Urea Bautista, Roberto Sierra, Domingo A. Hernndez, Reyito Aquino Mariez, Adalberto Cruz, Luis R. Almonte Gonzlez, Rosendo Martnez Candelario, Jernimo Santiago, Juan Francisco Pineda, Ismael Mena Abreu, Joel Alexander Cruz Gmez, Luis Ramn Snchez Disla, Marcelino Snchez, Juan Reyes Martnez, Andy Rafael Snchez Disla, Heuiy Meja Jimnez and Juan B. Paredes founded the Trade Union of Workers of the Enterprise Barrick Gold and deposited the documentation required for trade union registration. The trade union was refused registration because, in the view of the General Labour Director (and following an investigation allegedly carried out by the latter into the payroll of the Minera Pueblo Viejo (Barrick Gold) enterprise), a number of the founding members of the trade union were not workers of the enterprise. The workers had work cards in which it was recorded that they were working for a subcontractor which was providing services for the Barrick Gold enterprise; therefore they worked in and for the enterprise, Barrick Gold.
.The complainant organization adds that the workers providing services for the Barrick Gold enterprise, Julio Antonio Rojas and Oscar Nina Arias y Compartes, founded the Trade Union of Workers of the Mining Sector of Snchez Ramrez Province and deposited the documentation required for its registration. The new trade union was not granted registration because, in the General Labour Director s opinion, the founders of the union had been recruited by enterprises which belonged to sectors other than the mining sector, including construction and metalwork. The complainant organization highlights that the founders of the trade union had been recruited by other enterprises to provide services for the Barrick Gold enterprise through subcontracting, a method used by a great many enterprises in order to avoid obligations and compliance with labour rights.
.In its communication of  July , the complainant organization adds that the enterprise contracted around  companies and that, in one of its verbal instructions, it urged those subcontractors not to allow trade union activities, stating that to do so would lead to immediate suspension of their contracts. The enterprise also filed a petition with the Ministry alleging that the workers were not included on its payroll and that therefore the name of the Barrick Gold enterprise could not be connected to the trade union s constituent assembly. Owing to the fact that the documents of the Ministry of Labour are in the public domain, an application was made for a certified copy of the petition. However, the General Labour Directorate never provided said document. The complainant organization states that Julio Rojas (Secretary-General of the trade union) was dismissed.
.Refusal to register the United Trade Union of Workers of Minera Cerros de Maimn (SUTRAMICEMA). The complainant organization states that, on  July , Virginio Encarnacin, Jos Antonio Prez y Prez and Epifanio Castro y Compartes founded SUTRAMICEMA and deposited the documentation required for trade union registration, which was returned to them through a communication of the General Labour Director, dated  August , based on the fact that: () those workers were listed on the permanent payroll of the Sococo de Costa Rica Dominicana, SA enterprise, a subcontractor which selects staff for the mining enterprise, without the fact that those workers provide their services under the instructions of Minera Cerro de Maimn and their respective work cards bore the names of both enterprises being taken into account; () the legal name of Minera Cerro de Maimn was  Corporacin Minera Domicincana, SA'  despite the fact that the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court of Justice of the Dominican Republic establishes that workers cannot be prevented from exercising their rights simply because they do not know the legal name of the enterprise for which they work.
.In its communication of  July , the complainant organization adds that Jos Antonio Prez y Prez, Secretary-General of the trade union, was falsely accused of having set fire to a company vehicle and that he is constantly harassed as trade union leader. Finally, the complainant organization states that another member of the trade union, Juan Bautista (the appeals and disputes secretary), was dismissed.
.Refusal to register the Trade Union of Electricity Generator and Convertor Building and Repair Workers and Related of Haina. The complainant organization states that the application for registration of the Trade Union of Electricity Generator and Convertor Building and Repair Workers and Related of Haina was deposited on  October  with the Ministry of State for Labour. The application contained all the necessary documentation listing the enterprises in which the founders of the trade union provided services, proving their status as employees and therefore, the Labour Code should be applied both with regard to their individual and collective rights.
.However, the complainant organization states that, through a ruling dated  November , the General Labour Director rejected the trade union s application for registration, claiming that the union was being established by independent workers who were not governed by the Labour Code. An appeal was lodged with the Ministry of State for Labour against the ruling. Through a ruling dated  March , the Ministry upheld the decision of the General Labour Director, stating that the members of the union being formed did not qualify as workers and that it was therefore impossible to grant their application for registration.
.In its communication dated  July , the complainant organization adds that the refusal to register the abovementioned trade unions has led to a situation whereby not only are these organizations being prevented from obtaining legal personality but also those workers who decided to exercise the right to organize are left without protection. Furthermore, once the enterprise learnt that the authorities had refused to register the trade union and that no trade union immunity had been granted, it broke the employment contracts and dismissed the founders of the trade unions without the Ministry of Labour even issuing a contravention notice concerning the freedom of association.
.Refusal to register the Single Federation of Workers of the Mining, Metalwork, Chemicals, Energy and Various Industries and Related (FUTRAMETAL). The complainant organization states that on  March , the General Labour Director was requested to register FUTRAMETAL, founded on  December . The documentation deposited contained details of the delegates representing the trade unions that made up the federation, their names, identity",0,2010,Dominican Republic
25,"card numbers and respective signatures, as well as information on each trade union (their numbers and registration numbers), and proof of the legal existence of eight trade unions (four more than the number required under the Labour Code). The complainant organization highlights that, with regard to the creation of federations, the only additional requirement established by the Labour Code is that their founding instruments must contain the names and addresses of the member trade unions and that the statutes of the federations must describe the form in which the trade unions are represented at the general assemblies of the federations.
.The complainant organization states that, more than two months after the application, the General Labour Directorate of the Ministry of Labour has still not registered the federation, alleging that each and every one of the founding trade unions must provide it with the minutes of their respective assemblies, in which the majority of their members have approved the participation of the trade union in the formation of this new federation. The complainant organization adds that these excessive requirements for registration of a trade union organization are not normal and entail restrictions because they subject trade union organizations to special administrative supervisory measures which limit the right to organize. In the light of the General Director of Labour s position, the complainant organization states that, in order that trade union organizations legitimately established by the workers might be registered, it expressed its concern to the Ministry of State for Labour, but received no reply from the Dominican authorities.
.In its communication dated  July , the complainant organization states that, as well as acting incorrectly regarding the registration of trade union organizations, the Government has also failed to monitor compliance with labour rights, as can be seen from the following cases.
.Frito Lay Dominicana enterprise. The complainant organization states that the trade union is under a constant state of siege within this enterprise, in the person of the secretary general, Ramn Mosquea, who was subjected to intimidation through the use of false accusations made with a view to his dismissal. During  and the first quarter of , more than  members of the trade union were dismissed for having carried out trade union activities. When the complainant organization presented formal complaints concerning the flagrant violations of the freedom of association in this enterprise, the Labour Inspectorate failed to carry out the investigations requested and consequently did not note the infringements. On other occasions, the actions of the investigators appointed to look into violations committed by the enterprise gave rise to serious suspicions that they were biased in favour of the employer sector. As a result of the ineffectiveness of the labour authorities with regard to the investigation and identification of violations of freedom of association, the judicial proceedings initiated for these violations conclude without the tribunals being able to sanction the enterprise, owing to a lack of evidence regarding the infringements committed.
.Universal Aloe enterprise. The complainant organization states that pregnant women have been dismissed from this enterprise, direct threats have been made against the trade union leaders and the interventions of the Ministry of Labour have not been sufficiently effective owing to the fact that a high level of complicity exists. Recently the enterprise has come to believe that it can destroy the organization founded by the workers owing to the fact that none of the measures taken have led to the enterprise being sanctioned for its anti-union behaviour.
.MERCASID enterprise. The complainant organization states that workers have been dismissed from this enterprise for having joined a trade union that had already been established. Furthermore, a campaign of slander was launched against Pablo de la Rosa with the aim of damaging his image and forcing him to abandon his demand that the collective agreement in force be respected and that the legally-constituted trade union be allowed the independence to run itself.
.In its communication of  August , the Government states that many initiatives and measures have been taken to promote trade union rights in the country, in accordance with the international Conventions. The Government also provides the following information regarding the trade unions referred to in the complaint presented by the complainant organization.
.The National Trade Union of Workers of the Call Center Branch. The Government states that, on  September , workers from various Call Center enterprises requested trade union registration from the Labour Administration. This request was not granted because: () Andy Marcel Tejeda, Boris F, Gil, Eliezer Ferreras, Jos A. Mordn Fras, Antonio Estvez, William O. Egunjobi and Sra Ada Ho Snchez, who were listed in the documentation presented to the Ministry of Labour as members of the management committee of the trade union, clearly informed both the Ministry of Labour and the committee managing the registry that they had not consented to their names being included on the list of participants for the constitution of the trade union in question. These workers took this step acting within their individual and constitutional rights as free individuals subject to law; () Luis Chapman and Loverly R. Montes de Oca, who were referred to in the request, were not workers at any of the Call Center enterprises at the time when the application for registration was made.
.The Government adds that, in the light of the workers' statements to the effect that they have no interest in belonging to the National Trade Union of Workers of the Call Center Branch, and given that some of the individuals referred to in the request were not workers of the enterprise and that the fundamental requirement of gathering at least  workers from enterprises belonging to the corresponding sector was not fulfilled, the General Labour Director issued a ruling rejecting the application for registration. The applicants lodged a hierarchical appeal with the Ministry of Labour, who upheld the decision taken by the General Labour Director.
.The National Trade Union of Operators of Topographical Instruments (SINAMITO). The Government states that, according to the complaint presented by the CNUS, this trade union has existed since , and that it does not appear on the register owing to the deterioration of the Ministry of Labour s records. However, the Government states that, in , work began to systematize the archives of the Trade Union Registry, with the support of the Spanish Cooperation. As a result of this process, a manual on procedures was drawn up, the paper archive of the Department of Trade Union Registry was reorganized and all the processes were systematized, in order to make it possible to offer a reliable, quality service to users. The Government highlights that on  March , the Ministry of Labour received an application for the registration of SINAMITO, which was refused through a ruling dated  March , owing to the fact that the trade union did not fulfil the basic requirement of representing dependent employees governed by the Labour Code.
.The Government highlights that the root of the disagreements between trade union bodies lies in a meeting held in November  at the Pension Fund for the Construction Sector. The National Single Federation of Trade Unions of Construction Workers (FENUSTRACON) requested a review of the registrations of the trade unions making up the Technical Council of the abovementioned Fund in order to check their legal status. The Technical Council of the Pension and Retirement Fund for Construction Sector Workers is made up of those trade union organizations of the construction sector with legal personality and is presided over by the Ministry of Labour. The corresponding review was carried out but no evidence was found in the archives of the Ministry of Labour of the registration of SINAMITO. It was found that this trade union, which had requested registration seven months beforehand, had been operating for a long time using the registration which corresponded to the Autonomous Trade Union of Knitting Manufacturers, a trade union organization that is completely separate from SINAMITO.
.The Government states that on looking closely at the situation it becomes apparent that a dispute exists between two trade union organizations, FENUSTRACON and SINAMITO, with regard to influence over the management of the Pension Fund for the Construction Sector. It was FENUSTRACON that objected to the participation of SINAMITO in the Pension Fund for the Construction Sector.
.The Government also states that, on  January  and  March , the leaders of this trade union organization made new applications for registration, which were returned (and not rejected) so that missing details could be added to the dossier, in particular, information regarding representation of dependent employees (an indispensable requirement). The Government highlights that the return of applications for registration with observations does not imply rejection, rather, the aim is to inform applicants, in accordance with the procedure set out under the Labour Code, so that documentation is completed in due and proper form.
.As to the Ministry of Labour s intervention in this case, the Government states that there is no trace of the registration or the founding documents (such as statutes, constituent assembly",0,2010,Dominican Republic
26,"and list of members) of the said trade union in the trade union file archives. That is the reason why the Ministry of Labour is not in a position to certify that the trade union actually exists. The Government also states that the Labour Code only applies to dependent employees, that is to say, those with a mandate from an employer, and therefore the provisions of the Code do not apply to self-employed persons, as is the case with the topographical instrument operators, who are neither dependent upon nor subordinate to an enterprise or employer.
.The Trade Union of Workers of the Enterprise Barrick Gold. The Government states that the legal name of the Barrick Gold enterprise is Pueblo Viejo Dominicano corporation (PVDC) and that: () it is a recently established mining enterprise which is currently constructing its installations, and to this aim, it has contracted various national and international construction firms; () one of the subcontractors is ISS Serviacero and in response to an application made by Franciso Rafael Abreu Polanco, dated  November , the United Trade Union of Workers of the Enterprise ISS Serviacero was registered through a ruling dated  December ; () on  April , the Ministry of Labour received an application for trade union registration from the workers of the Hermanos Yarull T enterprise, an enterprise which carries out work under contract within the PVDC mining complex. The Labour Administration responded to this application by granting trade union registration through a ruling dated  May ; () on  May , the Ministry of Labour received an application for registration from the United Trade Union of Workers of the Construction Sector and Related Activities, whose construction enterprises were contracted by PVDC, with the Ministry granting registration through a ruling dated  June ; and () on  June, workers of the PVDC enterprise applied for the registration of the United Trade Union of Workers of the Enterprise Minera Pueblo Viejo Cotu (Barrick Gold), with the Ministry of Labour granting registration through a ruling dated  June .
.The Government concludes by stating that the Labour Administration has granted a total of four trade union registrations to workers of PVDC and its related enterprises, and that therefore the claim that the Ministry of Labour is hindering trade union activity in this enterprise is untrue.
.The United Trade Union of Workers of Minera Cerros de Maimn (SUTRAMICEMA). The Government states that: () on  June , the Labour Administration received an application for the registration of the Trade Union of the Enterprise Corporacin Minera Cerro de Maimn, and granted that registration on  July ; () on  and  July  new applications for the registration of the Trade Union of Workers of Minera Cerros de Maimn were received, which were returned in light of the fact that they contained errors of substance and form which prevented registration under the provisions of the Labour Code; and () prior to these applications ( March ), an application for registration had already been received for the Autonomous Trade Union of Workers of the Enterprise Sococo de Costa Rica, Dominicana, SA, (SINTRASO), which was registered through a ruling dated  March .
.The Trade Union of Electricity Generator and Convertor Building and Repair Workers and Related of Haina. The Government states that, on  October , the Ministry of Labour received an application for registration of the Trade Union of Electricity Generator and Convertor Building and Repair Workers and Related of Haina, which was not registered owing to the fact that the applicants are self-employed and are not governed by the Labour Code (dependent employee status is one of the fundamental requirements enshrined in the Labour Code regarding the granting of trade union registration).
.The Single Federation of Workers of the Mining, Metalwork, Chemicals, Energy and Various Industries and Related (FUTRAMETAL). The Government states that on  April , it received an application for the registration of FUTRAMETAL. The Government highlights that the application was rejected based on the fact that: () the application in question did not fulfil the requirements set out in the Labour Code, given that the founding instrument, the notification of the assembly and the statutes had not been signed by the number of members required under labour legislation; and () one of the trade unions behind the application is not registered with the Ministry of Labour, and the registration of another was cancelled by the judiciary when it was noted that there were many errors that were not observed by the Ministry of Labour at the time that it was registered. In the light of these lapses, the constituent documentation was returned to this federation in order that it might take into account the points made in that regard by the General Labour Director.
.The Committee notes that in the present case the complainant organization alleges difficulties and delays in the registration of trade union organizations. These allegations refer to five trade union organizations and one federation.' The National Trade Union of Workers of the Call Center Branch. The Committee notes that, according to the complaint organization, the founding members of the trade union fulfilled all the requirements as to substance and form set out under the Labour Code regarding the establishment of a trade union. It also notes that, according to the Government, trade union registration was not granted because: () various workers, who were listed in the documentation presented to the Ministry of Labour as members of the management committee of the trade union, clearly informed both the Ministry of Labour and the committee managing the registry that they had not consented to their names being included on the list of participants for the constitution of the trade union in question; and () other individuals referred to in the application were not workers at any of the Call Center enterprises at the time when the application for registration was made and consequently the requirements set out under law were not fulfilled, namely, the need to gather  workers in order to found a trade union. Finally, the Committee notes that the applicants lodged a hierarchical appeal with the Ministry of Labour, who upheld the decision of the General Labour Director.' The National Trade Union of Operators of Topographical Instruments (SINAMITO). The Committee notes that, according to the complainant organization, the General Labour Director returned the documentation deposited because the enterprises in which the founder members of the trade union provided services were not registered with the Ministry of State for Labour. The Committee also notes that, according to the Government: () the trade union does not fulfil the fundamental requirement of representing dependent employees governed by the Labour Code: () it was found that this trade union, which had applied for registration seven months beforehand, had been operating for a long time using the registration which corresponded to the Autonomous Trade Union of Knitting Manufacturers, a trade union organization that is completely separate from SINAMITO; and () the leaders of this trade union organization made new applications for registration, which were returned (and not rejected) so that missing details could be added to the dossier, in particular, information regarding representation of dependent employees (an indispensable requirement).' The Trade Union of Workers of the Enterprise Barrick Gold. The Committee notes that, according to the complainant organization, the trade union was refused registration because, in the view of the General Labour Director, a number of the founding members of the trade union were not workers of the enterprise, despite the fact that all of those workers had work cards in which it was recorded that they were working for a subcontractor which was providing services for the Barrick Gold enterprise, that is to say, they were working in and for the Barrick Gold enterprise. The Committee also notes that the Barrick Gold enterprise (Pueblo Viejo Dominicano Corporation (PVDC)) is a recently established mining enterprise which is currently constructing its installations and to this aim it has contracted various national and international construction firms and that the Labour Administration has granted a total of four trade union registrations to workers of PVDC and its related enterprises.' The United Trade Union of Workers of Minera Cerros de Maimn (SUTRAMICEMA). The Committee notes that, according to the Government, new applications for the registration of the Trade Union of Workers of Minera Cerros de Maimn were received on  and  July , which were returned in light of the fact that they contained errors of substance and form which prevented registration under the provisions of the Labour Code.' The Trade Union of Electricity Generator and Convertor Building and Repair Workers and Related of Haina. The Committee notes that, according to the parties, the application for registration of the trade union was rejected because it was alleged that it was being formed by self-employed workers, not governed by the Labour Code. An appeal was lodged against this ruling with the Ministry of State for Labour, which, through a ruling dated  March",0,2010,Dominican Republic
27,", upheld the decision of the General Labour Director.' The Single Federation of Workers of the Mining, Metalwork, Chemicals, Energy and Various Industries and Related (FUTRAMETAL). The Committee notes that, according to the complainant organization, more than two months after the application, the General Labour Directorate of the Ministry of Labour has still not registered the federation, alleging that each and every one of the founding trade unions must provide it with the minutes of their respective assemblies, in which the majority of their members have approved the participation of the trade union in the formation of this new federation. The Committee also notes that the Government states that the founding documents of this federation were returned so that the points made in that regard by the General Labour Director might be taken into account.
.In general, the Committee wishes to highlight that Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), establishes that workers and employers, without distinction whatsoever, shall have the right to establish and, subject only to the rules of the organization concerned, to join organizations of their own choosing without previous authorization. The Convention guarantees this right for all workers, with the sole possible exception of the armed forces and the police. Therefore this right also applies to self-employed workers and subcontracted workers. The Committee notes that the Government states that dependent employee status is one of the fundamental requirements enshrined in the Labour Code regarding the granting of trade union registration. It can thus be concluded that the law only allows for the founding and registration of trade unions of dependent employees. The Committee recalls that by virtue of the principles of freedom of association, all workers ' with the sole exception of members of the armed forces and the police ' should have the right to establish and join organizations of their own choosing. The criterion for determining the persons covered by that right, therefore, is not based on the existence of an employment relationship, which is often non-existent, for example in the case of agricultural workers, self-employed workers in general or those who practise liberal professions, who should nevertheless enjoy the right to organize [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth edition, , para. ]. The Committee requests the Government to take measures to amend, in consultation with the most representative workers' and employers' organizations, the legislation in order to allow trade unions of self-employed workers or trade unions which bring together contract workers to be founded and registered.
.The Committee recalls that the Government freely ratified Convention No. , and that it is obliged to guarantee that the provisions of the Convention are respected. In light of the conclusions set out in the paragraphs above and if all procedural requirements have been met, the Committee requests the Government to register SINAMITO (whose membership consists of self-employed workers), the Trade Union of Workers of the Enterprise Barrick Gold and the Trade Union of Electricity Generator and Convertor Building and Repair Workers and Related of Haina (whose members are contract workers).
.As to the National Trade Union of Workers of the Call Center Branch, the Committee notes that, according to the Government: () various workers who were listed in the documentation presented to the Ministry of Labour as members of the management committee of the trade union clearly informed both the Ministry of Labour and the committee managing the registry that they had not consented to their names being included on the list of participants for the constitution of the trade union in question; and () other individuals referred to in the application were not workers at any of the Call Center enterprises at the time when the application for registration was made. The Committee requests the complainant organization to communicate its observations concerning the Government s reply and expects that the Government and the trade union in question will together examine how the problems referred to by the Government might be resolved. The Committee also requests the Government to investigate claims of pressure being brought to bear on workers to get them to leave the trade union and if these allegations prove to be true, to take the necessary measures to prevent such acts from occurring in the future.
.As to the United Trade Union of Workers of SUTRAMICEMA. The Committee regrets that the Government has not provided more details on the errors of substance and form to which it made a general reference. As to FUTRAMETAL, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, the founding documentation of this federation was returned so that the errors which prevented the trade union from being registered by the General Labour Director might be corrected. The Committee expects that the Government and the trade union and the federation in question will examine how the problems referred to by the Government might be solved. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.Finally, the Committee notes that the Government has not sent its observations regarding the allegations contained in the communication dated  July  concerning anti-union dismissals, threats and practices in certain enterprises, such as the Frito Lay Dominicana enterprise, the Universal Aloe enterprise and the MERCASID enterprise and requests the Government to send its observations without delay, together with the views of these enterprises obtained through the most representative employers' organization.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government, in consultation with the most representative workers' and employers' organizations, to take measures to amend the legislation in order to allow trade unions of self-employed workers or trade unions of contract workers to be founded and registered.(b) Recalling that the Government freely ratified Convention No.  and that it is obliged to guarantee that the provisions of the Convention are respected, and assuming that all procedural requirements have been met, the Committee requests the Government to register SINAMITO (whose membership consists of self-employed workers), the Trade Union of Workers of the Enterprise Barrick Gold and the Trade Union of Electricity Generator and Convertor Building and Repair Workers and Related of Haina (whose members are contract workers).(c) As to the National Trade Union of Workers of the Call Center Branch, the Committee requests the complainant organization to communicate its observations concerning the Government s reply and expects that the Government and the trade union in question will together examine how the problems referred to by the Government might be resolved. The Committee also requests the Government to investigate claims of pressure being brought to bear on workers to get them to leave the trade union and if these allegations are proven to be true, to take the necessary measures to prevent any such acts from occurring in the future.(d) As to SUTRAMICEMA and FUTRAMETAL, the Committee expects the Government and the trade union and the federation in question, to examine how the problems referred to by the Government might be solved. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.(e) The Committee notes that the Government has not sent its observations regarding the allegations contained in the communication dated  July  concerning anti-union dismissals, threats and practices in certain enterprises, such as the Frito Lay Dominicana enterprise, the Universal Aloe enterprise and the MERCASID enterprise and requests the Government to send its observations without delay, together with the views of these enterprises obtained through the most representative employers' organization.",0,2010,Dominican Republic
28,".The Committee last examined this case at its March  meeting [see th Report, paras ' ]. On that occasion it requested the Government, in relation to the dismissal of trade union leaders Mr Familia and Mr Novas from the Teachers' Health Insurance Company (SEMMA), to send it the text of ruling No. -, of  October  issued by the Fiscal and Administrative Disputes Tribunal, and to inform it of the outcome of the appeal against the ruling. The Committee also asked the Government to send the requested information relating to the allegations of interference by SEMMA in the activities of ASOESEMMA and the withholding of union membership dues for March, April and May .
.In a communication dated  March , the Government sent the text of ruling
.The Committee notes this information. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the outcome of the appeal which, according to the complainant s statement in the previous examination of the case, was filed against ruling No. - of  October , issued by the Fiscal and Administrative Disputes Tribunal in relation to the dismissal of trade union leaders Mr Familia and Mr Novas from SEMMA. Furthermore, the Committee urges the Government once again to send the requested information relating to the allegations of interference by SEMMA in the activities of ASOESEMMA and the withholding of union membership dues for March, April and May .
.The Committee last examined this case at its March  meeting [see the Committee s th Report, paras ' ] and on that occasion made the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to continue to promote the reinstatement of the union officials Csar Antonio Familia and Rabel Novas in their jobs with SEMMA. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any measures adopted in this respect, and of the outcome of the appeal against the dismissals lodged with the Higher Administrative Court.(b) With regard to the allegations concerning interference by SEMMA in the activities of ASOESEMMA and the non-remittance of the dues payable by the union members for March, April and May , the Committee urges the Government, if the judicial authorities are not seized with these issues, to take measures without delay to undertake an inquiry into this matter and, if the allegations are corroborated, to ensure that steps are taken to put an immediate end to the acts of interference and to transfer to ASOESEMMA all the union dues withheld during the period indicated in the allegations.
.In communications dated  May,  June,  October and  November , the Association of Teachers' Health Insurance Employees (ASOESEMMA) reports that the Government has not taken steps to implement the Committee s recommendations. The association states that on  November , it lodged an appeal with the Supreme Court against the substance of ruling No. - given on  October  by the Second Chamber of the Fiscal and Administrative Disputes Tribunal.
.In communications dated  August and  October , the Government states that the Ministry of Labour has taken steps to follow up the dispute. In an initial phase, this involved the participation of the National Department of Inspection which used all the means at its disposal to resolve the case; and subsequently the participation of the Minister of Labour through the intermediary of the Director-General for Labour. The Ministry of Labour, and in this case the Government of the Dominican Republic, cannot involve themselves in matters that are subject to litigation (section  of the Labour Code) or at least must refrain from expressing any opinion on cases that are the subject of litigation. The Government states that it is persisting in its efforts to find a consensual solution to the dispute that will comply with labour law, since in the Dominican Republic the principle of the separation of powers prevails. The Government adds that the General Labour Directorate received trade union representatives and communicated with representatives of the Ministry of Education in a concerted manner, and in a way that duly respected judicial procedure, in order to seek a settlement to the dispute, but must, in accordance with the law, await the Tribunal s decision. Lastly, the Government states that it regrets that this case has arisen and is closely monitoring the dispute.
.The Committee takes note of this information. It requests the Government and the ASOESEMMA to communicate the text of ruling No. - of  October  handed down by the Fiscal and Administrative Disputes Tribunal and to inform it of the outcome of the appeal lodged against that ruling. The Committee hopes that the court will hand down a ruling in the near future. Lastly, the Committee once again urges the Government to send it the information requested in its recommendation in paragraph (b) quoted above concerning allegations of interference by the SEMMA in the activities of the ASOESEMMA and the withholding of union membership dues in March, April and May . The new communication recently received from the Government will be examined at the Committee s next meeting.
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to continue to promote the reinstatement of the union officials Csar Antonio Familia and Rabel Novas in their jobs with SEMMA. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any measures adopted in this respect, and of the outcome of the appeal against the dismissals lodged with the Higher Administrative Court.(b) With regard to the allegations concerning interference by SEMMA in the activities of ASOESEMMA and the non-remittance of the dues payable by the union members for March, April and May , the Committee urges the Government, if the judicial authorities are not seized with these issues, to take measures without delay to undertake an inquiry into this matter and, if the allegations are corroborated, to ensure that steps are taken to put an immediate end to the acts of interference and to transfer to ASOESSMA all the union dues withheld during the period indicated in the allegations.",1,2006,Dominican Republic
29,".The complaint is contained in a communication of the International Union of Food, Agricultural, Hotel Restaurant, Catering, Tobacco and Allied Workers' Associations (IUF) dated  October , on behalf of its affiliated organization, the National Federation of Sugar, Agricultural and Allied Workers (FENAZUCAR). The Government replied in a communication dated  January .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The IUF alleges in its communication dated  October  that on  September  demonstrations were held in support of FENAZUCAR's demands in defence of , sugar workers who had been dismissed. During the demonstrations, Mr. Alexander Garca was killed by a shot fired at point-blank range by an armed patrol of the armed forces. In the same area of Ozama, the patrol attacked and kicked a young woman who suffered a miscarriage as a result of blows to her stomach.
.The complainant states that these violations of the human rights and fundamental trade union rights of unarmed civilians occurred during a demonstration organized by the trade union to present its demands and voice its concerns.
.The complainant further denounces the brutal treatment of  labourers from Haiti who were allegedly beaten and then thrown over a precipice by the armed forces and the rural polices in Montellanos. The labourers were not involved in any trial and were not formally charged with any illegal activities. Two of them died from the injuries they sustained and another  were seriously injured.
.In its communication dated  January  the Government first of all refutes the IUF's claim that , sugar workers were dismissed in September . The truth of the matter is that, at the start of the low season in the sugar industry, the State Sugar Council (CEA) took action to suspend , workers for two months and duly asked the Secretary of State for Labour, within the three days allowed under the law and after notifying the trade unions representing the workers concerned of the decision, for the relevant authorization. It was the decision of the State Sugar Council (CEA) that sparked off the demonstration of the trade unions and workers.
.The Government adds that, on receipt of the request to suspend the contracts of , labourers, the Secretary of State for Labour arranged for mediation between the enterprise and the trade union organizations, which led to a meeting at the National Palace between the President of the Republic, Joaqun Balaguer, and the general secretaries of the trade union organizations involved in the dispute. The outcome of this meeting was an agreement under which the Secretary of State for Labour agreed to the suspension for a period of one month, with the loss of one month's salary, while the central Government, given the insolvency of the enterprise, undertook to pay the , workers one month's salary, which meant charging , million Dominican pesos (US$ = . pesos) to the national budget.
.During the mediation and until the agreement was finally concluded, the sugar workers held protest movements and demonstrations. One of these demonstrations took place in the village of San Luis, Distrito Nacional, where the Ozama sugar mill is located near the San Isidro air base. The events in the village of San Luis, to which the IUF refers, involved workers, members of their families and virtually all the people living in the area. Barricades and obstacles were put up in the streets, tires were burnt, car windows were broken, etc. Given the situation, a contingent of the armed forces stationed in the near by base intervened in order to quell the disturbances. It was in the course of this operation that Mr. Alexander Garca was killed by Private Wagner Consuegra Rodrguez of the Dominican Armed Forces. It should be mentioned that the soldier received a stab wound in the right arm and that it was in response to this aggression that he fired the shot that cost Mr. Alexander Garca's life.
.The Government states that Private Consuegra Rodrguez was immediately arrested and is still in prison at the San Isidro air base. When the courts are convened in , he will be tried by court-martial, in accordance with article  of the Code of Military Justice, which states that offenses committed by military personnel in the exercise of their functions, wherever they are committed, are within the competence of the military jurisdictions.
.Finally, regarding the alleged brutal treatment of  Haitian workers who are said to have been beaten and then thrown over a precipice by the armed forces and rural police in Montellanos, this is purely the fruit of the IUF's imagination, since no one in the Dominican Republic has heard of  Haitian workers being thrown off a precipice and of two of them dying as a result of their injuries and another  being seriously wounded. On this point, it would advisable for the IUF to consult FENAZUCAR.
.Regarding the alleged assassination of Mr. Alexander Garca during the demonstration in Ozama and the assault on a woman who suffered a miscarriage as a result of the blows she received, the Committee notes the Government's declarations and, specifically, that the soldier who shot Mr. Alexander Garca did so in response to a stab wound in the right arm and that he was immediately arrested, is currently in prison and will be tried by court-martial. The Committee also notes the tripartite negotiations and the steps taken by the Government to remedy the causes of the conflict in the sugar sector, as well as its reference to various acts of violence by the demonstrators.
.The Committee deeply regrets the death of Mr. Alexander Garca, shot by a soldier who had been previously attacked, and the acts of violence that took place during the demonstration in Ozama. The Committee draws the Government's attention to the principle that in the event of demonstrations ""the intervention of the forces of law and order should be in due proportion to the danger to law and order that the authorities are attempting to control and the Government should take measures to ensure that the competent authorities receive adequate instructions so as to eliminate the danger entailed by the use of excessive violence when controlling demonstrations which might result in a disturbance of the peace"". (See Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. .) The Committee accordingly requests that in future the forces of law do not respond disproportionately to the actions of demonstrators. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the sentence handed down by the court-martial concerning the soldier who shot Mr. Alexander Garca. The Committee also requests that an inquiry be conducted into the alleged assault on a young woman during the demonstration of  September , as a result of which she suffered a miscarriage, and that it be kept informed of its findings.
.Finally, regarding the alleged aggression on  Haitian workers in Montellanos, two of which are said to have died and  to have been seriously injured, and noting that the Government absolutely refutes these allegations and suggest that they are the fruit of the imagination of the complainant organization, the Committee is not in a position to pursue its examination of these allegations further until the complainant reasserts them and provides further details (names of the victims, lodging of any complaints, participation of the victims in demonstrations, exact date and place of the events, etc.).
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) Deeply regretting the death during a demonstration of the worker Mr. Alexander Garca, shot by a soldier who had been previously attacked, the Committee requests that in future the forces of order will not respond disproportionately to the actions of demonstrators, and asks the Government to inform it of the sentence handed down by the court-martial concerning the soldier who shot Mr. Alexander Garca.(b) Regretting that the Government did not reply to the allegations concerning the assault on a young woman during the demonstration of  September , as a result of which she suffered a miscarriage, the Committee requests that an inquiry be conducted into this matter and that it be kept informed of its findings.(c) Finally, regarding the alleged aggression on  Haitian workers in Montellanos, two of which are said to have died and  to have been seriously injured, and noting that the Government absolutely refutes the allegations, the Committee will not pursue its examination of these allegations until the complainant reasserts them and provides further details (names of the victims, lodging of any complaints, participation of the victims in demonstrations, exact date and place of the events, etc.).",0,1995,Dominican Republic
30,".The complaint in this case is contained in a communication of the National Federation of Sugar, Agricultural and Allied Workers (FENAZUCAR) of  November . Later, in a communication dated  February , FENAZUCAR submitted additional information. The Government sent its observations in communications dated  and  May .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  November , FENAZUCAR states that in April  the workers of the Cristbal Coln Sugar Plantation established the United Agricultural and Industrial Trade Union and elected an executive committee, and that immediately afterward the enterprise dismissed the general secretary and all the members of the executive of the trade union. As soon as the union was created, the sugar plantation's management challenged its establishment. Notwithstanding this, the Department of Labour legally recognized the union on  May . The complainant organization further alleges that the enterprise is conducting a campaign to pressure workers to withdraw from membership in the union by threatening them with dismissal and expulsion from their homes.
.In its communication dated  February , the complainant organization adds that the sugar plantation has a security team which blocks trade union meetings, and that in December  the general secretary and claims secretary were prohibited from circulating in the ""bateyes"" (the places where residences and warehouses are located in a plantation); these trade union leaders were later detained for four hours at the police station.
.In its communications of  and  May , the Government states that since  there has been a trade union at the Cristbal Coln Sugar Plantation, called the Trade Union of Workers of the Sugar Industry (Wage and Salary Earners) of the Cristbal Coln Sugar Plantation and that in April  a group of workers of this plantation informed the Secretary of State for Labour of the establishment of another trade union, called the United Agricultural and Industrial Trade Union of the Cristbal Coln Sugar Plantation. The Government further states that the members of the previously established trade union first opposed the registration of the second trade union, alleging that its general secretary held a post in the management of the enterprise, but that despite their request the labour authorities authorized the registration of the union. The Government reports that when the registration was contested in court, the judicial authorities ordered the revocation of the resolution issued by the Secretary of State for Labour registering the trade union, as the union was not established in accordance with the provisions of the law. Specifically, the union did not comply with the provision of the labour code which prohibits workers holding managerial, security, monitoring or supervisory posts from being members of a trade union.
.Finally, as regards the dismissal of the leaders of the new trade union, the Government reports that the Secretary of Labour attempted without success to mediate, as the parties did not attend the meetings convened by the mediator.
.The Committee observes that the allegations refer to the dismissal of the general secretary and all the members of the executive committee of the United Agricultural and Industrial Trade Union of the Cristbal Coln Sugar Plantation following the establishment of the union, to a campaign of pressure from the enterprise to force workers to withdraw from membership in the union, to the blocking of the free movement of trade union leaders in the enterprise's premises, to the impossibility of holding trade union meetings and to the temporary detention by the police of the general secretary and the claims secretary of the union.
.As regards the dismissal of the general secretary and all the members of the executive committee of the new trade union following the establishment of the union, the Committee notes that the Government recognizes that these dismissals took place and that it states that it attempted without success to mediate, as the parties did not attend the meetings which were convened. The Committee deeply deplores these anti-union dismissals. It furthermore emphasizes that they are a very serious violation of freedom of association which affects all of the leadership of the trade union. It draws the Government's attention to the fact that ""no person should be dismissed or prejudiced in his employment by reason of his trade union membership or legitimate trade union activities"" (see nd Report, Case No.  (El Salvador), para. ). In these circumstances, the Committee urges the Government to take the measures necessary so that the dismissed trade union leaders are immediately reinstated in their posts.
.As regards the alleged campaign of pressure and threats of dismissal conducted by the enterprise so that the workers would withdraw from membership in the trade union, the Committee observes that the Government has not communicated its observations. However, given that the Government acknowledges that the entire executive committee of the trade union was dismissed for anti-trade union reasons, the Committee cannot but conclude that in this anti-trade union context there was anti-trade union persecution within the enterprise of the union's members. In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to ensure that the union's members can freely exercise their trade union activities and, if necessary, that the competent authorities apply the penalties provided by legislation.
.As regards the allegation concerning the blocking of the free movement of trade union leaders on the premises of the sugar plantation, the Committee observes that the Government has not communicated its observations. The Committee draws the attention of the Government to the principle according to which Governments must ""guarantee access of trade union representatives to workplaces, with due respect for the rights of property and management, so that trade unions can communicate with workers, in order to apprise them of the potential advantages of unionization"". (See th Report, Case No.  (United States), para. .) The Committee requests the Government to take the measures necessary to ensure that trade union representatives are given free access to workplaces and are able to move about within them.
.As regards the alleged impossibility to hold trade union meetings at the sugar plantation because a security team prevents them, the Committee observes that the Government has not communicated its observations. In these circumstances, the Committee refers to the conclusions it has formulated in the past as regards trade union activities at plantations, in which it stated that although it ""recognized that plantations are private property"", the Committee recalled that ""employers should remove existing hindrances, if any, in the way of the organization of free, independent and democratically controlled trade unions by plantation workers and they should provide such unions with facilities for the conduct of their normal activities, including ... freedom to hold meetings"". (See Digest of decisions and principles of the Committee on Freedom of Association, rd edition, , para. .) The Committee thus requests the Government to conduct an investigation into the allegations, and to ensure that the trade union in question may immediately hold freely the trade union meetings it considers necessary at the sugar plantation.
.As regards the detention for four hours of the general secretary and the claims secretary at the police station, the Committee deeply regrets that the Government has not communicated its observations in this respect as well, and given the anti-trade union context of this case must deplore the detention which reportedly occurred and draw the Government's attention to the principle according to which the arrest - even if only briefly - of trade union leaders and trade unionists who are exercising legitimate trade union activities constitutes a violation of the principles of freedom of association. (See Digest, op. cit., para. .) The Committee insists that such reprehensible acts should not reoccur in future.
.Finally, as regards the judicial challenge of the registration of the United Agricultural and Industrial Trade Union of the Cristbal Coln Sugar Plantation by another trade union which already existed at the enterprise, the Committee notes the Government's statement that it was the judicial authorities that requested revocation (despite the fact that the United Agricultural and Industrial Trade Union had been registered by the administrative authorities). As regards the grounds for the challenge of the registration, the Government points out that the trade union previously established at the sugar plantation challenged new trade union's registration, referring to the fact that the general secretary of the new union was a member of the enterprise's management. For its part, the court judgement refers to the fact that some members of the new trade union held ""administrative, security, monitoring or supervisory posts"" as grounds for the revocation of the registration.
.In this respect, as regards the accusation that the general secretary of the new trade union reportedly held a management post at the sugar plantation, or in other words that the trade union leader was not independent, the Committee observes that this accusation appears to be refuted by the fact that the general secretary in question was dismissed for his trade union activities, as",0,1993,Dominican Republic
31,"was the entire executive committee. Furthermore, the Committee observes that in this case the judicial authority revoked the registration based on the Labour Code (section ) which makes it possible to exclude workers who carry out ""administrative, inspection, security, monitoring or supervisory functions ..."" from the right of association. On this point, given that the text of the judgement does not give an accurate description of the tasks carried out by the members of the trade union in question, the Committee emphasizes that an excessively broad interpretation of the concept of ""worker of confidence"", which denies such workers of their right of association, may seriously limit trade union rights and even, in small enterprises, prevent the establishment of trade unions, which is contrary to the principle of freedom of association. In these circumstances, the Committee also emphasizes the principle under which the right of workers to constitute organizations of their choosing implies, in particular, the effective possibility to create - if the workers so choose - more than one workers' organization per enterprise. In the light of these principle, the Committee considers that all the workers of the Cristbal Coln Sugar Plantation should be allowed to establish and join trade unions of their choosing and that, consequently, the United Agricultural and Industrial Trade Union of the Cristbal Coln Sugar Plantation should be allowed to function and develop its activities. The Committee requests the Government to take measures to guarantee that this is the case, including by initiating judicial proceedings if necessary, and to keep it informed in this respect.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) Recalling that no person should be dismissed or prejudiced in his employment by reason of his trade union membership or legitimate trade union activities, the Committee urges the Government to take the measures necessary so that the trade union leaders of the United Agricultural and Industrial Trade Union of the Cristbal Coln Sugar Plantation who were dismissed are immediately reinstated in their posts.(b) The Committee requests the Government to conduct an investigation to determine whether the allegations concerning the campaign by the enterprise to pressure workers to withdraw from membership in the union are true and, if so, to take the necessary measures so that the union's members can freely exercise their trade union activities, and to apply the penalties provided by legislation.(c) The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that trade union representatives are given free access to workplaces and are able to move about within them.(d) The Committee requests the Government to conduct an investigation into the alleged impossibility to hold trade union meetings because of a security team which prevents them and to guarantee that the trade union in question may immediately hold freely the trade union meetings that it considers necessary.(e) Considering that all the workers of the Cristbal Coln Sugar Plantation should be able to establish and join the trade union of their choosing and that, consequently, the United Agricultural and Industrial Trade Union of the Cristbal Coln Sugar Plantation should be able to function and develop its activities, the Committee requests the Government to take measures to guarantee that this is the case, including by initiating judicial proceedings if necessary, and to keep it informed in this respect.",0,1993,Dominican Republic
32,".This complaint was lodged in a communication of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) dated  September . The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  May .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  September  the ICFTU states that, with the upsurge in trade union activity in the industrial free-zone areas, a National Federation of Free-Zone Workers was established in September , to which  trade unions throughout the country are currently affiliated. The complainant organization alleges that this trade union movement has encountered stiff opposition from employers, who have drawn up blacklists of dismissed trade union leaders so that they will not be recruited by other enterprises. The complainant organization states further that none of the  trade unions has been able to conclude a collective agreement since the members of their executive boards have been dismissed, along with any worker who expresses his or her desire to join a union.
.Specifically, the complainant organization alleges instances of anti-trade-union action in the following enterprises:- Woo-Chang and Bonaham Apparel (Bonao city): dismissed all the members of the executive boards were dismissed;- Big Bond Apparel (Bonao city): all the members of the executive board were dismissed in June ; the enterprise has been ordered by court to pay a fine and to compensate the union leaders;- Westinghouse (Itabo industrial estate): all the members of the executive board were dismissed;- Hotel Hamaca Beach Resort:  workers who joined a union were dismissed on  August ;- Empresa Attwoods Dominicana S.A.:  members of the union were dismissed, including the entire executive board; on a false accusation, the secretary-general was arrested by the police secret service for seven days and beaten during his detention.
.Regarding the alleged violations of freedom of association the free trade zone enterprises, the Government states that the administrative authorities have investigated all enterprises where such acts have occurred and brought criminal charges against the managers. In the specific enterprises cited by the complainant organization, the Government states: () that Big Bond Apparel has been ordered by court to pay the dismissed trade union leaders compensation, but that the enterprise has appealed against the sentence; meanwhile the Secretary of State for Labour has ordered that the enterprise's export licence be suspended until it agrees to respect trade union rights; () that in the case of Westinghouse only some of the members of the executive board were dismissed with the authorization of the labour court of San Cristobal, on the grounds that they organized an illegal strike at which acts of violence were perpetrated against the enterprise's assets (documents attached by the Government indicate that  workers were dismissed for ""dereliction of duty""); () that in the case of Woo-Chang Dominicana and Bonaham Apparel the sentences have been appealed and the cases are awaiting a ruling; () that Hamaca Beach Report and Attwoods Dominicana S.A. are not in the free trade zones, but that the Secretary of State for Labour has initiated legal proceedings against the former that have not yet come to court and has investigated the latter and brought penal charges against it (the dismissed workers have submitted their case to the labour court).
.Finally, the Government states that, in order to promote harmonious working relations between employers and workers in the free trade zones, a tripartite agreement has been reached between the Government, the Dominican Association of Free Trade Zones and five of the six trade union federations in the country, whereby the parties agree to submit collective labour disputes to the mediation of the Secretariat of State for Labour and, in the event that its mediation is unsuccessful, to take the matter before the National Council of Free Trade Zones, which is empowered to suspend or cancel the export licences of enterprises in those zones that do not comply with labour legislation.
.The Committee observes that the allegations refer to a series of dismissals of trade union leaders and members, to the introduction of blacklists in free trade zone enterprises, to the arrest of a union leader and to other instances of anti-union discrimination. The Committee notes the Government's observations and the various legal and administrative steps taken in connection with the alleged facts, as well as the tripartite agreement that has been reached in the free trade zones. Nevertheless, considering the many instances of anti-union discrimination, the Committee wishes in the first place to emphasize the importance it attaches to the principle that no-one should be dismissed or subjected to anti-union discrimination by reason of his or her legitimate trade union activities (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, rd edition, , para. ).
.With respect to the alleged dismissal of union members in a number of enterprises (Woo-Chang and Bonaham Apparel: dismissal of members of the executive boards; Hotel Hamaca Beach Resort: dismissal of  members of the union; Attwoods Dominicana S.A.: dismissal of  members of the union, including the entire executive board; and Big Bond Apparel: dismissal of members of the union's executive board), the Committee notes the Government's statement that these cases have been brought before the labour authorities and that, in the case of Big Bond Apparel, the Secretary of State for Labour has had the enterprise's export licence suspended until it undertakes to respect trade union rights. In these circumstances, the Committee invites the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the legal action taken. In addition, in view of the fact that the labour authorities have recognized the anti-union character of the dismissals by taking the cases to court, the Committee urges the Government immediately to take the necessary steps to ensure the reinstatement in their jobs of all the union leaders and members who have been dismissed by reason of their membership of a trade union or their union activities. The Committee would like to draw the Government's attention to the principle according to which it would not appear that sufficient protection against acts of anti-union discrimination, as set out in Convention No. , is accorded by legislation which enables employers in practice - on condition that they pay the compensation prescribed by law for cases of unjustified dismissal - to get rid of any worker, even if the true reason is his trade union membership or activities (see Digest, op. cit., para. ).
.Regarding the alleged dismissal of members of the executive board of the Westinghouse Union, the Committee observes the Government's statement that only some members were dismissed and that this was with the authorization of the San Cristobal labour court, on the grounds that they engaged in an illegal strike and committed acts of violence against the enterprise's assets. However, noting that according to documents submitted by the judicial authority (enclosed by the Government),  workers were dismissed for ""dereliction of duty"" and that in the report of the labour inspectorate (also enclosed by the Government) the parties concerned denied having engaged in sabotage, the Committee urges the Government to re-examine the situation of the dismissed union leaders and to keep it informed of developments.
.As regards the allegation that the secretary-general of the Attwoods Dominica S.A. union was falsely accused, arrested by the police secret service for seven days and beaten during his detention, the Committee regrets that the Government has not sent any observations on the subject. The Committee deplores the union leader's arrest and the ill-treatment he is said to have suffered. The Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that the arrest and detention of trade unionists without any charges being laid or court warrants being issued constitutes a serious violation of trade union rights (see th Report, Case No.  (Peru), para. ). As in similar cases, the Committee recalls that ""governments should give precise instructions and apply effective sanctions where cases of ill-treatment are found, so as to ensure that no detainee is subjected do such treatment,"" and emphasizes ""the importance that should be attached to the principle laid down in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights according to which all persons deprived of their liberty must be treated with humanity and with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person"" (see th Report, Case No.  (Peru), para. ).
.Concerning the drawing up of blacklists to ensure that dismissed trade union leaders are not subsequently recruited by any enterprise in the sector, the Committee regrets that the Government has not sent any specific observations on the subject and that it cannot therefore determine whether blacklisting is included among the points that the judicial authority will be called upon to examine in the context of the cases brought against various enterprises. The Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that ""all practices involving the `blacklisting' of trade union officials constitute a serious threat to the free exercise of trade union",0,1993,Dominican Republic
33,"rights"" and ""that governments should take stringent measures to combat such practices"" (see th Report, Case No.  (El Salvador), para. ). In these circumstances the Committee invites the Government to investigate the matter and, should the existence of such lists be confirmed, to take the necessary steps to punish those responsible and prevent the repetition of such practices.
.The Committee notes with interest the tripartite agreement that has been reached on labour relations in the free trade zones. It trusts that the agreement, together with the laws and regulations in force, will provide the necessary framework to put a stop to acts of anti-union discrimination in the free trade zones and to develop healthy labour relations through collective bargaining. The Committee urges the Government to take the necessary steps to ensure that this agreement is fully applied.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the legal action taken in connection with the dismissed union leaders and members of Woo-Chang and Bonaham Apparel, Hotel Hamaca Beach Resort, Attwoods Dominicana S.A. and Big Bond Apparel. In addition, in view of the fact that the labour authorities have recognized the anti-union character of the dismissals, the Committee urges the Government immediately to take the necessary steps to ensure the reinstatement in their jobs of all the union leaders and members who have been dismissed by reason of their membership of a trade union or their union activities.(b) Noting that blacklists are a serious threat to the free exercise of trade union rights, the Committee requests the Government to conduct an investigation into the enterprises cited in the allegations and, should the existence of such lists be confirmed, to take the necessary steps to punish those responsible and prevent the repetition of such practices.(c) The Committee urges the Government to re-examine the situation of the trade union leaders dismissed by Westinghouse and to keep it informed of developments.(d) The Committee notes with interest the tripartite agreement that has been reached on labour relations in the free trade zones. It trusts that the agreement, together with the laws and regulations in force, will provide the necessary framework to put a stop to acts of anti-union discrimination in the free trade zones and to develop healthy labour relations through collective bargaining. The Committee urges the Government to take the necessary steps to ensure that this agreement is fully applied.",0,1993,Dominican Republic
34,".The Committee examined this case at its meeting of February  when it presented an interim report to the Governing Body (see th Report of the Committee, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (March )). The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  May .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee observes that the allegations in question refer to the dismissal of trade union leaders and members (more than , according to the complainant organization) of various enterprises. The Committee takes note of the Government's comment that the legal basis of the dismissal of the trade union leaders and members was the former Labour Code which allowed employers to dismiss workers if they paid the indemnities provided for by law. Similarly, the Committee notes with interest that the new Labour Code recognizes trade union immunity but that it is not possible to institute legal proceedings in this case since the new legislation cannot be applied retroactively.
.The Committee observes that although the Government has not referred to the real reasons for the dismissal of the trade union members mentioned by the complainant, the allegations date from June  and were worded in very general terms. In particular, no indication was given in the allegations of the names of those dismissed nor of the circumstances surrounding the dismissals (see th Report, para. ). In these conditions, the Committee requests the complainant organization to furnish such information.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee requests the complainant organization to furnish precise information on the alleged dismissals, by indicating the names of the dismissed trade unionists and the circumstances surrounding their dismissals.
.The Single Confederation of Workers (CTU) lodged this complaint in a communication dated  July . The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  October .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  July , the CTU alleges that more than  trade union leaders and members were dismissed in June  from the following enterprises: Industrias del Mufler and Creaciones Exclusivas, both in the city of Santo Domingo; Jhin Own; Adoro; Cariflo Manufacturing; and Gualmana, all in the Romana export processing zone.
.The complainant organization also alleges that Importacon y Exportacon C.Vor A. (in the Santiago export processing zone) dismissed  trade union leaders (Damasa Ventura, Juan F. Tavarez, Mara Gonzlez, Magalis Gil, Felicia Figueroa, Eugenia Prez, Iris Moronta, Daniel Nuez, Miriam Prez, Germn Arias, Digna Martinez, Angela Lpez, Mara Salvador, Martina Inoa, Cayetano Morel, Leonardo Espinal, Mario Dominguez, Mara Almanzar, Mara A. Serrano, Dany Lora and Freddy Acosta). The CTU includes as an annex a ""blacklist"" which the enterprise's Personnel Department drew up and sent to the other enterprises in the export processing zone, with the names of the  trade union leaders and the numbers of their identity documents. The text of the ""blacklist"" accuses them of having established trade unions and warns the enterprises against hiring them.
.In its communication of  October  the Government states that all the dismissals mentioned by the complainant organization took place before  June , when the new Labour Code came into force. The Government explains that the new law establishes trade union immunity and sets up the machinery necessary to ensure the employment stability of trade union leaders. The former Code permitted the employer to dismiss employees without just cause.
.Finally, the Government reports that in the case of Importacin y Exportacin C.Vor A. (in the Santiago export processing zone), the Labour Inspectorate secured evidence of a violation of freedom of association, viz. the ""blacklist"" that was drawn up. As a consequence, the Ministry of Labour brought a case before the penal courts, which is now being heard. In the other cases, the exercise by the employers of the right to dismiss workers without just cause if they pay indemnities deprives these workers of the right to take legal action. The employers would invoke this right to cover any violation of the law.
.The Committee takes note of the allegations concerning the dismissal of  trade union leaders (whose names are mentioned by the complainant) from ""Importacin y Exportacin C.Vor A."" (in the Santiago export processing zone) and the drawing up by the company's Personnel Department of a ""blacklist"" (appended by the complainant organization) with the names of the  trade union leaders and the numbers of their identity papers, allegedly sent to the other enterprises in the Santiago export processing zone, accusing the employees of establishing trade unions, with the aim of ensuring that the other enterprises would not hire them. In this respect, the Committee takes note of the reaction of the Ministry of Labour which, having learnt of these facts through the Labour Inspectorate, brought before the criminal courts a case which is now being heard. The Committee deeply disapproves of this type of anti-union practice on the part of the company and requests the Government to make sure that it does not recur, and to send the text of the judgement which will be handed down in this respect. Moreover, since Importacin y Exportacin C.Vor A. in the text of the ""blacklist"" expressly reproached the dismissed trade union leaders with having established trade unions, the Committee calls on the Government to take all necessary measures to ensure that the enterprise reinstates in their jobs these trade union leaders who were unjustly dismissed for carrying out legitimate trade union activities, and to keep it informed.
.As regards the allegations concerning the dismissals from Industrias del Mufler and from Creaciones Exclusivas - both in the city of Santo Domingo; Jhin Own; Adoro; Cariflo Manufacturing; and Gualmana, all in the Romana export processing zone - the Committee notes that according to the complainant organization over  trade union leaders and members were dismissed. The Committee observes, however, that the complainant has not given the names of those dismissed, nor has it explained the circumstances of the dismissals, and that the Government for its part has simply argued that the acts denounced by the complainant organization took place under the former Labour Code, which permitted dismissals without just cause. In these circumstances, the Committee does not have sufficient elements to formulate an opinion regarding the anti-trade union nature of these dismissals. None the less, the high number of dismissals (over ) of trade union leaders and members mentioned in the allegations could be a serious indication that many may have been of an anti-trade union nature. The Committee therefore requests the Government to send detailed information on the cases of dismissals, indicating whether they took place in violation of trade union rights.
.The Committee expresses the hope that with the new Labour Code events such as those denounced in the present case will not recur.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee calls on the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that Importacin y Exportacin C.Vor A. (in the Santiago export processing zone) reinstates in their jobs the  dismissed trade union leaders, who were furthermore included on a ""blacklist"" drawn up by the Personnel Department of that company and distributed in the Santiago export processing zone.(b) As regards the ""blacklist"", the Committee deeply disapproves of this type of anti-union practice and requests the Government to make sure that it does not recur and to send the text of the judgement that will be handed down in this case.(c) The Committee requests the Government to send detailed information on the allegations of dismissals of trade union leaders and members from Industrias del Mufler and Creaciones Exclusivas, Jhin Own, Adoro, Cariflo Manufacturing and Gualmana, indicating whether they took place in violation of trade union rights.(d) The Committee expresses the hope that with the new Labour Code, events such as those denounced in the present case will not recur.",0,1992,Dominican Republic
35,".The Committee has examined this case on various occasions, most recently at its November  meeting, when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body (see th Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November )). The Government sent new observations in a communication of  December .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations pending from the November  Session refer to various acts of violence which occurred as a result of a labour dispute in August  in the Dominican Electricity Corporation (CDE), and which are described below:- physical assaults in November  and January  against the General Secretary of SITRACODE and the trade union activists, Flix Santana, Pascual Daz, Juan Serra, Pantalen Silva and Ramn Paulino;- physical assaults against  leaders and activists of SITRACODE (resulting in various injuries to Hilario Portalatn) on  March  during a protest march to the Governmental Palace calling for the dispute to be resolved;- physical assaults against  trade union leaders and activists on  March  (seriously wounding the trade union leaders, Germn Marte, Saturnino Guzmn, Miguel Linareas, Ernesto de Luna, Donar Saillant and Jos Apolince) when they were violently expelled from a church by the police and the army; and- physical assault against a worker, Miguel Mercedes.
.In this respect, at its November  Session, the Committee urged the Government in its recommendations to reply to the serious allegations concerning these instances of physical assaults on trade unionists, and requested the Government, in the cases mentioned by the complainants in which an offence certainly appears to have been committed, urgently to undertake judicial investigations to determine responsibilities and punish the guilty parties, and to keep it informed of the outcome of any such proceedings (see th Report, para. ).
.In its communication of  December , the Government states that the acts of violence against officials of the Dominican Electricity Corporation Workers' Trade Union (SITRACODE) took place on  and  August  as a consequence of clashes between the National Police and workers affiliated to SITRACODE, which took place as a result of street protests during the labour dispute.
.The Committee takes note of the Government's observations in this regard, to the effect that the acts of violence against officials of the Dominican Electricity Corporation Workers' Trade Union (SITRACODE) were a consequence of clashes between the National Police and workers affiliated to SITRACODE, which took place as a result of street protests during the above-mentioned labour dispute.
.The Committee wishes to remind the Government that ""in cases in which the dispersal of public meetings by the police for reasons of public order or other similar reasons has involved loss of life or serious injury, the Committee has attached special importance to the circumstances being fully investigated immediately through an independent inquiry and to a regular legal procedure being followed to determine the justification for the action taken by the Police and to determine responsibilities"" (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, , rd edition, para. ). In these circumstances, the Committee once again requests the Government to undertake judicial investigations urgently into the acts of violence committed during the collective dispute in question - including those which, according to the complainants, took place in November  and January and March , on which the Government has not sent observations - to determine responsibilities and punish the guilty parties, and to keep it informed of the outcome of these proceedings. The Committee further requests the Government to take the measures necessary to avoid a repetition of such acts by police forces.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee once again requests the Government urgently to undertake judicial investigations into all the alleged acts of violence which took place as part of the collective dispute between SITRACODE and the Dominican Electricity Corporation, so as to determine responsibilities and punish the guilty parties, and to keep it informed of the outcome of any such proceedings, and to take the measures necessary to avoid a repetition of such acts by police forces.
.The Committee has examined this case on three occasions, most recently at its May  meeting, when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body (see rd Report, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its rd Session (May-June )). Subsequently, the Dominican Electricity Corporation Workers' Trade Union (SITRACODE) sent additional information and new allegations in a communication dated  May . The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  May .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations pending from the May  meeting refer to the following matters: the reinstatement of trade union officials of SITRACODE who were dismissed as a result of the labour dispute which occurred in August  in the Dominican Electricity Corporation (CDE) and which involved strikes and acts of violence against activists and leaders of the trade union; the arrest of and physical assault against the General Secretary of SITRACODE as well as the trade union activists Flix Santana, Pascual Daz, Juan Serra, Pantalen Silva and Ramn Paulino in November  and January ; the dismissal of  workers (in addition to the dismissal of , workers which had originally led to this complaint) of the Dominican Electricity Corporation in February  and the detention of trade union officials and activists in the said Corporation in February and March ; the arrest of and physical assault against  officials and activists of SITRACODE (resulting in various injuries to Hilario Portalatn) on  March , during a protest march to the Governmental Palace calling for the dispute to be resolved; the arrest of and physical assault against trade union leaders and activists (seriously wounding the trade union leaders Germn Marte, Saturnino Guzmn, Miguel Linares, Ernesto de Luna, Donar Saillant and Jos Apolince) on  March  when they were violently expelled from a church by the police and the army; the obstruction by the police and the army, which surrounded the SITRACODE premises in November , of a march to the Governmental Palace to deliver a letter to the President of the Republic; and the arrest of trade union officials (Ignacio Soto, Germn Marte, Eliaser Batista, Ivan Reyes and Agustn Vargas Saillant) on  March  as they were distributing guidelines to the CDE's workers at the Herrera Operations Centre.
.At its meeting of May , the Committee made the following recommendations on the matters which remained pending (see rd Report of the Committee, para. ):- the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures so that the Corporation respects the principles contained in Convention No.  and that the trade union leaders involved are reinstated. It requests the Government to keep it informed in this connection;- the Committee requests the Government to reply to the rest of the serious allegations (dismissals, arrests, physical assaults and violation of freedom of assembly) listed in the previous paragraph.
.In its communication dated  May , SITRACODE states in connection with the numerous dismissals at the Dominican Electricity Corporation (CDE) that the dismissed trade union officials have still not been reinstated and that the agreements signed with the enterprise on the reinstatement of  per cent of workers (including some of the trade union leaders) and the granting of labour benefits to the remaining  per cent have not been honoured. Furthermore, the complainant points out that the management of the enterprise imposes as a condition for the reinstatement of workers their non-participation in trade union activities. In this respect, the complainant alleges in particular that the worker Gilberto Gelacio de la Cruz was reinstated and subsequently dismissed after being accused of selling vouchers on behalf of the trade union and maintaining relations with trade union officials.
.In its communication of  May , the Government states in relation to the dismissal of workers from the CDE that  workers have been reinstated, including  departmental delegates and substitute delegates of the trade union, that , have been paid labour benefits, that  were granted retirement pensions and that  were notified that their benefits could be collected, although they had not yet come to do so. Furthermore, the Government states that no SITRACODE officials were being detained and that the staff reductions made were due to the enterprise's economic recovery policy.
.As regards the allegations concerning the numerous dismissals in the Dominican Electricity Corporation (CDE) of workers and trade union officials of SITRACODE, the Committee notes the Government's statement that the dismissals were due to the enterprise's staff reduction and economic recovery policy. Likewise, the Committee notes with interest that, in",0,1990,Dominican Republic
36,"line with its previous conclusions on this case, the CDE has reinstated  departmental delegates and substitute delegates of the trade union. The Committee also notes that a further  workers have been reinstated, that  have been granted retirement pensions, that  have received payment of their benefits and that  have been notified that they can collect their benefits. The Committee asks the Government to continue endeavouring to reinstate in their jobs other trade union officials, in accordance with the agreement reached and based on the principles enshrined in the Workers' Representatives Recommendation,  (No. ).
.As regards the allegations concerning the arrest of trade union officials of SITRACODE, the Committee notes the information provided by the Government from which it can be concluded that these arrests lasted a short period of time and that at present no one is being detained. In this respect, given the absence of further details from the Government, the Committee draws its attention to the fact that the arrest by the authorities of trade unionists concerning whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found is, in particular, a serious restriction of trade union rights; governments should take steps to ensure that the authorities concerned have instructions appropriate to eliminate the danger which arrest for trade union activities implies (Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, rd edition, , para. ).
.The Committee regrets to observe that the Government has not responded to the rest of the pending allegations and to the new allegations concerning the following acts of violence and anti-union measures:- the physical assault in November  and January  against the General Secretary of SITRACODE and the trade union activists Flix Santana, Pascual Daz, Juan Serra, Pantalen Silva and Ramn Paulino;- the physical assault against  leaders and activists of SITRACODE (resulting in various injuries to Hilario Portalatn) on  March  during a protest march to the Governmental Palace calling for the current dispute to be resolved;- the physical assault against  trade union leaders and activists on  March  (seriously injuring the trade union leaders Germn Marte, Saturnino Guzmn, Miguel Linares, Ernesto de Luna, Donar Saillant and Jos Apolince) when they were violently expelled from a church by the police and the army;- the physical assault against the worker Miguel Mercedes;- the obstruction by the police and the army, which surrounded the SITRACODE's premises in November , of a march to the Governmental Palace to deliver a letter to the President of the Republic;- the imposition on workers by the CDE administration of non-participation in trade union activities as a condition for their reinstatement, with specific reference to the case of worker Gilberto Gelacio de la Cruz, who was reinstated and subsequently dismissed after being accused of selling vouchers on behalf of the trade union and maintaining relations with trade union officials.
.In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to send its observations on these serious allegations and, in the cases mentioned by the complainant in which it actually appears that an offence has been committed, to undertake judicial investigations urgently so as to determine responsibilities and punish the guilty parties, and to keep it informed of the outcome of any such proceedings.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee asks the Government to pursue its efforts with a view to obtaining the reinstatement in their jobs of other trade union officials of SITRACODE, in accordance with the agreement reached, and based on the principles enshrined in the Workers' Representatives Recommendation,  (No. ).(b) The Committee strongly urges the Government to reply to the serious allegations concerning the physical assault against trade unionists and anti-union measures listed in the previous paragraph; it requests the Government, in the cases mentioned by the complainant in which an offence actually appears to have been committed, to undertake judicial investigations urgently to determine responsibilities and punish the guilty parties, and to keep it informed of the outcome of any such proceedings. The Committee further requests the Government to take the measures necessary to avoid repetition of such acts in the future.
.The committee has examined this case on two occasions, most recently at its May  meeting when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body (see th Report of the Committee, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (May-June )). The Dominican Electricity Corporation Workers' Trade Union (SITRACODE) sent new allegations in communications of  June,  October and  November , and  January and  March . The Government sent its observations in communications of  January and  March .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.This case concerns a labour dispute which began in August  in the Dominican Electricity Corporation (CDE) and which involved strikes, acts of violence against activists and leaders of the Dominican Electricity Corporation Workers' Trade Union (SITRACODE), the dismissal of all the leaders and delegates of SITRACODE and more than , workers, the arrest of and physical assault against the general secretary of SITRACODE as well as the trade union activists Flix Santana, Pascual Daz, Juan Serra, Pantalen Silva and Ramn Paulino in November  and January , and other reprisals. Negotiations were later begun between the leaders of SITRACODE and the Dominican Electricity Corporation's management to find a solution to this dispute.
.At its May  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendations with regard to the questions pending (see th Report of the Committee, para. ):- The Committee takes due note of the fact that the SITRACODE trade union leaders and the Dominican Electricity Corporation management are engaged in a mediation procedure, at the initiative of the new Secretary of State for Labour, with a view to settling the collective dispute concerning conditions of employment of the workers in this enterprise, on the basis of the current collective agreement. The Committee invites the Government to supply information on the outcome of these negotiations.- The Committee repeats its request that the Government supply information on the situation of the striking workers arrested and/or dismissed during this dispute.- The Committee requests the Government to supply information concerning the new allegations presented by SITRACODE (the dismissal of  workers in February , the detention of the trade union delegate Manuel Reyes Beltre on  and  February  and of trade union activist Jess Mara Lpez on  March , and the physical assault committed against the worker Miguel Mercedes by a CDE employee).
.As regards the allegation pending with reference to the dispute between the Dominican Electricity Corporation and SITRACODE and to the payment of the money due to the dismissed workers, the Committee takes note of the Government's statement that it was able to obtain payment by the enterprise's management of the amounts due to , of the , dismissed workers, or  per cent of the total (the complainants had requested payment for  per cent). Instructions had been given (by March ) to pay  of the , workers mentioned, three of whom had been put on pensions,  of whom were going through the retirement procedures and  of whom (. per cent of all those dismissed) had already been reinstated (the complainants had requested the reinstatement of  per cent). The Committee would like to point out that it is not possible for it to determine whether the payment of the amounts due to over , dismissed workers was carried out properly. It invites all the parties involved to attempt in good faith to reach agreement on any contentious cases that might arise.
.As regards the reinstatement of SITRACODE's trade union leaders, the Committee observes that the Government states that the Secretary of State is continuing to make the necessary efforts to obtain their reinstatement. The Committee recalls that when trade unionists or union leaders are dismissed for having exercised the right to strike, it can only conclude that they have been punished for their trade union activities and have been discriminated against contrary to Article  of Convention No. . (Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, rd edition, , para. .) It also recalls the provisions of the Workers' Representatives Recommendation,  (No. ) concerning protection and facilities to be afforded to workers' representatives in the undertaking: ""Workers' representatives in the undertaking should enjoy effective protection against any act prejudicial to them, including dismissal, based on their status or activities as a workers' representative or on union membership or participation in union activities, in so far as they act in conformity with existing laws or collective agreements or other jointly agreed arrangements."" In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures so that the Corporation respects the principles contained in Convention No.  and that",1,1990,Dominican Republic
37,"the trade union leaders involved are reinstated. It requests the Government to keep it informed in this connection.
.Finally, the Committee regrets to observe that the Government has not responded to the rest of these serious allegations, including:- the detention of and physical assault against the general secretary of the SITRACODE and the trade union activists Felix Santana, Pascual Daz, Juan Serra, Pantalen Silva and Ramn Paulino in November  and January ;- the dismissal of  workers (subsequent to the dismissal of the original , referred to in this complaint) of the Dominican Electricity Corporation in February , and the arrest of trade union leaders and activists at the Corporation in February and March ;- the detention of and physical attacks on  leaders and activists of SITRACODE (resulting in various injuries to Hilario Portalatn) on  March  during a protest march to the Governmental Palace calling for the current dispute to be resolved;- the detention of and physical attacks on  trade union leaders and activists on  March  (seriously injuring the trade union leaders German Marte, Saturnino Guzmn, Miguel Linares, Ernesto de Luna, Donar Saillant and Jose Apolince), when they were violently expelled from a church by the police and the army;- the physical attack on the worker Miguel Mercedes;- the obstruction by the police and the army, which surrounded the SITRACODE's premises in November , of a march to the Governmental Palace to deliver a letter to the President of the Republic; and- the detention of trade union leaders (Ignacio Soto, German Marte, Eliaser Batista, Ivan Reyes and Agustn Vargas Saillant) on  March  as they were handing out guidelines to the CDE's workers at the Herrera Operations Centre.In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to send its observations on these questions, and to undertake the judicial investigations urgently so as to shed light on the physical attacks on trade union leaders and activists, determine responsibility and punish the guilty parties, and to keep it informed of the outcome of these proceedings.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) As regards the disputes relating to the payment of the money due to the workers dismissed from the Dominican Electricity Corporation, the Committee invites all the parties involved to attempt in good faith to reach agreement on any contentious cases that might arise.(b) The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures so that the Corporation respects the principles contained in Convention No.  and that the trade union leaders involved are reinstated. It requests the Government to keep it informed in this connection.(c) The Committee requests the Government to reply to the rest of the serious allegations (dismissals, arrests, physical assaults and violation of freedom of assembly) listed in the previous paragraph.
.The Committee examined this case at its February  meeting and presented interim conclusions on the alleged violations of freedom of association and trade union rights, which were approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (February-March ). (See th Report, paras. -.)
.The Government sent detailed information on this case in communications dated  and  March .
.The Dominican Electricity Corporation Workers' Trade Union (SITRACODE) presented new allegations relating to this case in a communication dated  March .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.With reference to its recommendations, and in the light of the recent information communicated by the Government, the Committee notes that the registration of the parallel trade union set up on  January  in the Dominican Electricity Corporation has been cancelled by Resolution No. / adopted by the new Secretary of State for Labour, and that the registration on  March  of the executive committee of the Dominican Electricity Corporation Workers' Trade Union (SITRACODE) has been confirmed.
.The Committee also notes that the proceedings instituted against several trade union confederations, with the aim of cancelling their legal personality for having held a solidarity strike in support of SITRACODE, have been withdrawn.
.As regards the settlement of the collective dispute in the Dominican Electricity Corporation, the Committee notes that the collective agreement signed between SITRACODE and the enterprise management, the validity of which had been challenged since the beginning of the dispute, is still in force, and that at the initiative of the new Secretary of State for Labour a mediation procedure is now under way between the leaders of SITRACODE and the enterprise management.
.The Committee also takes due note of the fact that the trade union premises are not surrounded by police forces. However, it notes that the Government has not supplied any information concerning the question of dismissals of striking workers referred to in paragraph (e) of its earlier recommendations.
.Regarding the legislation, the Committee notes that the right to strike is guaranteed by the Constitution and that it is to be exercised in accordance with provisions of the Labour Code. In this respect, the Committee welcomes the fact that a draft Labour Code is currently the subject of a debate between the social partners and that it will also be discussed at the seminar to be held on  to  May  under the auspices of the ILO. According to the Government, this draft limits the scope of restrictions on the right to strike, leaves out the prohibition on solidarity strikes, and should improve the possibilities for trade union organisations to engage in adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures.
.Lastly, the Committee notes that, owing to the late arrival of SITRACODE's most recent allegations, the Government has not yet replied to them.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee takes due note of the fact that the SITRACODE trade union leaders and the Dominican Electricity Corporation management are engaged in a mediation procedure, at the initiative of the new Secretary of State for Labour, with a view to settling the collective dispute concerning conditions of employment of the workers in this enterprise, on the basis of the current collective agreement. The Committee invites the Government to supply information on the outcome of these negotiations.(b) The Committee repeats its request that the Government supply information on the situation of the striking workers arrested and/or dismissed during this dispute.(c) As regards the legislation, the Committee notes that a draft Labour Code has been prepared. It hopes there will be consultations on this draft with the employers' and workers' organisations, and the ILO, and that this draft will bring the law into conformity with the ILO's principles on the right to strike. The Committee draws the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to the legislative aspect of this case.(d) The Committee requests the Government to supply information concerning the new allegations presented by SITRACODE.
.Initially, in a communication of  August , the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) requested the ILO's intervention in connection with an alleged violation of trade union rights in the electricity sector in the Dominican Republic. Subsequently, the Dominican Electricity Corporation Workers' Trade Union (SITRACODE) submitted a formal complaint in this matter in a communication of  September , and the Confederation of Independent Workers (CTI) sent certain documents in support of this complaint on  October . More recently, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and SITRACODE sent additional allegations in communications dated  and  January , respectively.
.The Government sent its comments and observations in communications of  September, , ,  and  November  and  January .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.According to the complainants, on  August  the Government of the Dominican Republic ordered the army to occupy the headquarters of the Dominican Electricity Corporation Workers' Trade Union (SITRACODE) and ordered the arrest of many trade unionists on the grounds that they had been responsible for several recent interruptions in the supply of electricity. In addition, the management of the enterprise threatened to dismiss ,-, of the corporation's workers in retaliation for their participation in a strike. This strike had taken place following the draconian economic measures which had been imposed by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and the general -hour strike which had been called by several trade union organisations on  and  August .
.More specifically, the complainants explain that on  August  the Government had appointed a new administrator for the Dominican Electricity Corporation who, upon his arrival in the enterprise, had dismissed all trade union leaders and delegates of the SITRACODE, as well as , workers who belonged to that organisation. This administrator claimed that the trade union's registration had been",0,1990,Dominican Republic
38,"cancelled, and that the collective agreement signed between the enterprise and the trade union was no longer in force, and thus, that the trade union had ceased to exist. The Government then had the trade union's headquarters in Santiago surrounded on  and  August, and ordered the arrest of  persons, including the principal leaders of the SITRACODE in Santiago.
.The Confederation of Independent Workers (CTI) supplied several press clippings in support of the complainants' allegation that the arbitrary actions taken by the public authorities violate Article  of Convention No. , Article  of Convention No. , and Article  of Convention No. .
.Subsequently, in a communication dated  January , the ICFTU expressed its concern at the fact that on  November  the Secretary of State for Labour filed a request with the Public Prosecutor of the District of Santo Domingo to cancel the legal personality of the following trade union confederations: the General Confederation of Workers (CGT), the Confederation of Independent Workers (CTI), the Confederation of Class Workers (CTC), the Confederation of Progressive Workers (CTP), the Majority Workers' Confederation (CTM) and the Single Confederation of Workers (CUT). According to the ICFTU, the Secretary of State attempts to justify this measure by claiming that these organisations engaged in subversive activities aimed at compelling the Government to resign during the general strike held in November . The ICFTU explains that on  November the Dominican trade union confederations called a work stoppage in protest against an increase in the prices of essential goods and called for an economic policy less unfavourable to workers and to the common people, that the strike had continued until  November but that its affiliate had assured it that no act of subversion had been committed by the trade union organisations during the strike in question. The ICFTU requests the Committee to urge the Government to restore legal personality to the above-mentioned trade union organisations.
.In a communication dated  January , SITRACODE reiterates its earlier allegations and adds further allegations of violations of freedom of association and collective bargaining, and of human rights committed by the Government: () detention of and physical assault on the general secretary and disputes secretary of SITRACODE on  November ; () detention and exhibition before the press of trade union activists Flix Santana on  November ; () persecution of and death threats against the general secretary for the Southern Zone of the country; () setting up of an executive committee of the parallel trade union by the management of the Dominican Electricity Corporation on  January ; () detention of trade union activists Pascual Diaz, Juan Serra, Pantaleon Silva and Ramon Paulino on  January  in the town of Bani; () unilateral increase of hours of work to ten hours per day and obligation to work until noon on Saturday; () prohibition on payment of overtime, irrespective of its duration; () prohibition on payment of per diem; () illegal withholding of paychecks for most of the corporation's employees throughout the period  August  to  January ; () unilateral and arbitrary suspension of acquired rights under the collective agreement, such as medical insurance, pension and retirement plan, death benefit and childbirth allowances, family allowances, etc., bonuses, paid leave and Christmas bonuses. SITRACODE deplores the reactionary attitude of the new administrator of the corporation. It explains that on  September  the trade union movement and the Government reached agreement on  points providing that the workers dismissed by the corporation would be considered as having been suspended and that the dispute would be settled within  days. It regrets, however, that this has not yet occurred. In support of these allegations, SITRACODE sends press cuttings reporting the surrounding of its premises by military police, the alleged assault on the general secretary, Ignacio Soto, the arrest of the education secretary, Eliaser Batista Matos, and the collective dismissals of trade union officers and activists. It also encloses a copy of the agreement of  September  concluded with the President of the Republic.
.In a first reply dated  September , the Government states that, as concerns what it refers to as the dispute which broke out between certain workers and the management of the Dominican Electricity Corporation, the workers in question forcefully opposed the appointment of a new general administrator. It adds, however, that with the participation of a representative of the Catholic Church, a social pact was signed on  September  between the Government and the major organisations of workers. This pact called for the establishment of a committee composed of a representative from the corporation in question, a government official, a representative of the trade union organisations, a representative of the SITRACODE, and a delegate of the Catholic Church, to review the situation and present a report to the President of the Republic.
.In a second communication of  November , with regard to this dispute, the invalidation of SITRACODE's executive committee and the dismissal of several workers and employees of this corporation, the Government adds that the Secretary of State for Labour received several complaints from both parties alleging different types of violations of working conditions specified in the collective agreement. According to the Government, he intervened as a mediator and conciliator between the parties, but he had not completed his investigations at the date of the Government's communication to the ILO, owing to the fact that the SITRACODE leaders refused to receive the group of labour inspectors which the Secretary of State had assigned to this case. The Government requests the ILO to use its influence with the trade unionists to obtain their full collaboration in the inquiry and its successful conclusion.
.Subsequently, in a letter of  November , the Secretary of State for Labour explains that the Dominican Electricity Corporation, the country's only electricity company, belonging entirely to the people and therefore a public service enterprise, has filed a complaint with his office. The complainant denounces the violation of the collective agreement signed by the enterprise and the leadership of the SITRACODE trade union, claiming, in particular, that the trade union sequestered vehicles belonging to the Dominican people, refused to accept the new general administrator and threatened to shut down all power plants unless the Government proceeded immediately to replace the general administrator. Moreover, according to the Secretary of State for Labour, the trade union's leadership launched an appeal to consumers requesting them not to pay their electricity bills, thus causing the Dominican Electricity Corporation the loss of millions.
.In his letter the Secretary of State also indicates that from  to  August  the leaders of SITRACODE caused much turmoil and, along with other trade unionists, violated article , paragraph (d), of the Constitution, which recognises the right of workers in private enterprises to strike within the framework of the law, but bars strikes in Government and in public services and corporations. Nevertheless, according to this letter, on  October  the General Directorate for Labour of the Dominican Republic sent five labour inspectors to obtain information from the leaders of the trade union in question. Although these inspectors insisted on meeting with this trade union's general secretary, Mr. Ignacio Soto, they were not able to do so, as the general secretary merely replied ""I see no reason for meeting with these gentlemen"".
.The Secretary of State for Labour adds in his letter that the Dominican Republic is currently experiencing economic difficulties, and that the current situation calls for work, not strikes. He deplores the international campaign, orchestrated by Dominican trade union leaders, which seeks to discredit his country.
.In a subsequent letter of  November , the Secretary of State for Labour states that on  October  the general secretary of SITRACODE, Mr. Soto, came to his ministry accompanied by  persons, who caused a great deal of turmoil and terrorised the ministry's employees. The general secretary of SITRACODE demanded that the Secretary of State accompany the group to the National Congress. When the Secretary of State refused, the general secretary of SITRACODE challenged him to call the police to have the workers removed.
.The general secretary of SITRACODE was accompanied by a member of the National Congress, the Vice-President of the Dominican Workers' Party, and by the general secretary of the CTI. The two trade union leaders used furniture belonging to the State to erect a make-shift podium, and spent the next hour insulting the Secretary of State for Labour and the President of the Republic.
.Lastly, in a third letter dated  November , the Secretary of State for Labour denounces the call for a general strike on  to  November , launched by the General Workers' Confederation (CGT), the Single Confederation of Workers (CUT), the Majority Workers' Confederation (CTM) and the Independent Workers' Confederation (CTI), to request the Government's resignation. The Secretary of State affirms that this was intended to be a solidarity strike with the SITRACODE. He goes on to say that none of these confederations complied",0,1990,Dominican Republic
39,"with legal requirements for calling a strike, and consequently, that in reality it was a call for a political demonstration which threatened to become a criminal assembly.
.Because these confederations did not comply with sections  and  of the Labour Code, the Secretary of State for Labour indicates that they are liable for prosecution for violation of Act No.  and for the sanctions provided for in section  of the Labour Code, which states that ""the registration of trade unions, federations and confederations may be cancelled by decision of courts of first instance: (a) if the organisation engages in activities extraneous to its legal purposes; (b) if its legal representatives, leaders or members provoke, incite, sponsor, support or otherwise call a strike without previously having observed the conditions required by the Labour Code. The cancellation of the registration of trade unions, federations and confederations automatically entails their dissolution.""
.The Secretary of State for Labour concludes that by calling the strike the Dominican trade unions placed themselves above the law.
.In a later communication which reached the ILO on  January , the Secretary of State for Labour again explains the reasons for which he instituted legal proceedings against the trade union confederations which, together with political parties, declared the general strike of  to  November  contrary to constitutional law. According to the Secretary, under international labour law the right to strike has absolutely no bearing on the case in question as these are public employees of an essential service and a public utility and the dispute was unsuccessfully submitted to conciliation procedures with the authorisation of  per cent of the workers in the enterprise. The Secretary of State adds that under section  of Act No.  strikes may be declared illegal if they are held for political purposes, which is the case here, as the confederations against which the Government has instituted proceedings publicly demanded the Government's resignation and backed SITRACODE's disorderly struggle. Under section  of Act No.  the applicable penalties are  days' to  months' imprisonment and a fine of , to , pesos or both, and they may be imposed on the trade union bodies in the case of fines, and on their officers in the case of prison terms. Moreover, under Act No.  of  March  to amend Act No. , the legal personality of trade unions, federations and confederations may be cancelled. The Secretary of State concludes that there is no ILO Convention dealing with the right to strike. Convention No.  guarantees freedom of association but contains no provisions on strikes. From this he concludes that the right to strike cannot come before the public interest and this has been the basis for the legal proceedings he has instituted against certain trade union confederations, such as the CTM, CUT, CTC, CTI and other organisations, for illegal activities and for supporting a strike for political purposes and as an act of trade union solidarity. The case will be heard by the first penal division of the court of the first instance of the national district at a public, oral hearing of all of the parties.
.On the basis of available information and, in particular, on the basis of press clippings sent by the complainants concerning the events of August , and the Government's observations, the Committee notes that the complaint concerns a wide-ranging labour dispute which began in the summer of  in the electricity sector and now involves all four trade union confederations in the country. This labour dispute was marked by strikes, the occupation of the headquarters of the Dominican Electricity Corporation Workers' Trade Union (SITRACODE), the surrounding of the said premises by law enforcement agents, the arrest, sometimes violent, of some  trade union leaders and activists, their detention over a period of five days, the invalidation of the trade union's executive committee, and the mass dismissal of some , workers. Efforts at conciliation, under the auspices of the Catholic Church, led to the signing of a social pact in early September, to examine the situation and submit a report to the President of the Republic. At the same time, complaints were submitted by SITRACODE leaders and the enterprise's management to the Secretary of State for Labour alleging violations of the collective agreement. An inquiry was instituted by the Government, but it was not completed owing to the refusal of trade union leaders to receive the labour inspectors responsible for the inquiry. New demonstrations and a solidarity strike were called for  to  November by several trade union confederations throughout the country in support of SITRACODE's demands.
.The Committee notes that the Government merely indicates that it has signed a social pact to examine the situation, but that it also states that the current situation calls for work, and not for strikes, and that strikes are forbidden in the civil service, public services and public utilities. The Government also threatens to have the courts cancel the registrations of the four trade union confederations for calling a solidarity strike in support of SITRACODE without abiding by legal procedures.
.The Committee has always regarded the right to strike as constituting a fundamental right of workers and of their organisations and as an essential means of defending their economic and social interests. (Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, rd edition, , para. .) Moreover, the Committee has on several occasions emphasised that the occupational and economic interests which workers defend through the exercise of the right to strike do not only concern better working conditions or collective claims of an occupational nature, but also the seeking of solutions to economic and social policy questions and problems facing the undertaking which are of direct concern to the workers (Digest, para. ).
.In this case, however, the strike had its origins in the electricity sector, and the Government has stated that in the Dominican Republic strikes are forbidden in public utilities, thus indicating that strikes are prohibited in the electricity sector.
.The Committee has acknowledged that the right to strike may be restricted, or even prohibited in the civil service or in essential services in the sense of services whose interruption may endanger the life, personal health or safety of all or part of the population, to the extent that the strike could cause serious hardship to the national community, and provided that any such limitations are accompanied by certain compensatory guarantees to protect workers who are thus deprived of an essential means for the defence of their occupational interests (Digest, para. ).
.In the Committee's opinion, although the electricity sector may be considered as an essential service where the right to strike may be limited, it would seem that, according to the information furnished by the complainants and by the Government, the workers in this sector have not, since the dispute began in August , enjoyed adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration proceedings, in which the parties concerned could take part at every stage and in which the awards, once made, would be fully and promptly implemented, as the Committee has suggested on several occasions (Digest, para. ). At any rate, the reference made by the Government to an inquiry carried out following the receipt of complaints from the enterprise's management as well as from trade union leaders, cannot be considered equivalent to the compensatory procedures of conciliation and arbitration to which reference was made above.
.The Committee notes with concern that the Government has instituted legal proceedings with the aim of cancelling the legal personality of several trade union federations in the country for having declared a strike which it describes as being political and in solidarity with SITRACODE. This strike lasted two days from  to  November and was not accompanied by acts of violence. None the less, according to the Government, the leaders of the confederations face fines or imprisonment or both. In this respect, the Committee endorses the opinion expressed by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations in its  General Survey on Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining, to the effect that ""trade union organisations ought to have the possibility of recourse to protest strikes, in particular where aimed at criticising a government's economic and social policies. However, strikes that are purely political in character do not fall within the scope of the principles of freedom of association"". The Committee of Experts points out further that: ""As for sympathy strikes, where workers come out in support of another strike already declared by other workers, they are recognised as lawful in certain countries. ... The Committee considers that a general prohibition of sympathy strikes could lead to abuse and that workers should be able to take such action provided the initial strike they are supporting is itself lawful."" Lastly, the Committee of Experts concludes that penal sanctions should only be imposed as regards strikes where there are violations of strike prohibitions which are in conformity with the principles of",0,1990,Dominican Republic
40,"freedom of association. In addition, in these cases, the sanctions should be proportionate to the offences committed, and penalties of imprisonment should not be imposed in the case of peaceful strikes, as the application of disproportionate penal sanctions does not favour the development of harmonious industrial relations (See General Survey, paras. ,  and .). The Committee reminds the Government that by membership of the ILO it committed itself to respecting freedom of association in law and in practice, and it requests the Government not to pursue the legal proceedings it has instituted against the confederations and against their officers.
.Moreover, the Committee notes that the Government has not furnished replies to the complainants' allegations concerning the dismissal of striking workers, the surrounding of the premises of SITRACODE, the arrest of trade union leaders and members, the invalidation of the trade union's executive committee, and the enterprise's contention that the collective agreement is null and void.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to ensure respect of the principle that the right to strike is an essential means available to workers and their organisations to defend their economic and social interests.(b) The Committee requests the Government to guarantee that when strikes are limited or prohibited in essential services, such as electricity services, the workers benefit from compensatory procedures for the settlement of disputes and the presentation of their demands.(c) Consequently, the Committee urges the Government to ensure that adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures, in which the parties concerned can take part at every stage, be instituted in order to resolve this dispute, and that the awards be implemented fully and promptly, and requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.(d) The Committee notes that for several years the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has addressed similar comments to the Government, and it draws the attention of said Committee to the legislative aspects of this case.(e) The Committee requests the Government to reply to the allegations to which it has not already done so concerning the dismissal of striking workers, the surrounding of trade union premises, the arrest of trade union leaders and activists, the invalidation of the trade union's executive committee and the enterprise's contention that the collective agreement is null and void.(f) In addition, the Committee notes with concern that the Government has instituted legal proceedings with the aim of cancelling the legal personality of several of the country's trade union confederations and sentencing the union leaders of these confederations for having declared a two-day strike; the Committee requests the Government not to pursue the proceedings it has instituted against the confederations and their officers.",1,1990,Dominican Republic
41,".The Committee examined this case at its February  meeting and presented an interim report to the Governing Body which is contained in paragraphs  to  of the Committee's th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (February-March ). Since then the Government sent further comments on the matter in a communication which reached the ILO on  January . Although the complainant has been asked to send its observations on the Government's reply, it has not yet done so.
.The Dominican Republic has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In this case the ICFTU alleges that although during the -hour strike called as from  June  by most of the trade union organisations of the country (including the National Confederation of Dominican Workers (CNTD), affiliated to the ICFTU) to protest against the Government's economic policy the workers demonstrated peacefully, the police and armed forces reacted with extreme violence. They fired on demonstrators, killing three, wounding dozens and arrested over , people throughout the country. The ICFTU called for an inquiry into the death of the workers and the unconditional release of all those under arrest.
.The Government had noted that this general strike was essentially a political protest aimed at destabilising the Government in which a number of trade union organisations, including the Unified Workers' Confederation (CUT), were set up as guinea-pigs. According to the Government, it had respected the decision to call a general strike as it believed that opposition groups of workers and of the people had a legitimate right to protest in a country that recognises their full democratic rights, provided they do not pose a threat to public law and order. However, instead of the strikers holding a peaceful demonstration, the general strike degenerated within  hours into street fighting, public disorder and the destruction of public and private property. The national police and the armed forces therefore found themselves obliged to intervene in order to restore law and order in some parts of the city of Santo Domingo and of other towns in the interior of the country. The persons who were caught disturbing the peace or breaking into private premises were arrested and handed over to the courts of justice. However by a decision of the President of the Republic, most of these people were released unconditionally just a few hours after the strike ended. Only a small number of persons were actually charged with committing acts of violence.
.Furthermore, the Government had confirmed that on  and  June, during the general strike, deaths had occurred; however, it had claimed that these deaths were totally unrelated to the strike. On the other hand, it did admit that several persons had been wounded while resisting arrest.
.At its February  meeting, the Committee recommended the Governing Body to approve the following interim conclusions:(a) The Committee deplores that the acts of violence of  June , the day of the general strike, resulted in three deaths and a considerable number of wounded.(b) So that it has sufficient information at its disposal to be able to reach conclusions on the allegations, the Committee requests the Government to inform it of developments and of the outcome in the criminal proceedings initiated in connected with the aforementioned deaths and against those persons who are still under arrest (including the text of the judgement handed down).
.In a communication dated  January , the Government pointed out that the three deaths which occurred during the general strike called on  and  June  were isolated incidents totally unrelated to the general strike, contrary to the statements made by the complainant in this respect. It appended to its communication evidence (inquiry and autopsy reports recording violent deaths which had occurred in bars following a heated discussion which led to a brawl) in corroboration of its statements.
.At its February-March  meeting, in view of the contradiction existing between the complainant's and the Government's descriptions of the three violent deaths in this case, the Committee asked the Office to request the complainant confederation to send its comments on the Government's reply (see th Report of the Committee, para. ).
.Since then, despite several requests, the complainant has furnished no comments on this matter.
.The Committee considers that in view of the contradiction existing between the versions of the complainant confederation and the Government concerning the violent deaths which occurred on  and  June  and since the complainant, although invited to do so, has not furnished its comments on the Government's reply, the case does not call for further examination on its part.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusion, the Committee invites the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.
.The complaint appears in a communication of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) dated  July . The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  January .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  July  the ICFTU alleges that, although during the -hour strike called for  June  by most of the trade union organisations of the country (including the CNTD, affiliated to the ICFTU) to protest against the Government's economic policy, the workers demonstrated peacefully, the police and armed forces reacted extremely violently. They fired on peaceful demonstrators, killing three, wounding dozens and arrested over , people throughout the country. The ICFTU calls for an inquiry into the death of the workers and the unconditional release of all those under arrest.
.In its communication of  January  the Government states that the -hour general strike from Monday  June , which was called by certain social groups and political parties opposed to the constitutional Government, failed as a protest against the current economic policy because of the incoherent and disorganised way in which it was run by the political groups behind it. As a result it collapsed of its own accord within less than  hours. It was a political protest aimed at destabilising the Government in which a number of trade union organisations, including the Unified Workers' Confederation (CUT), were set up as guinea pigs. The Government makes the point that the country's trade union organisations are openly and officially linked to the various political parties and that many of their officials are recognised political leaders.
.The Government adds that it respected the decision to call a general strike as it believes that opposition groups of workers and of the people have a legitimate right to protest in a country that recognises their full democratic rights, provided they do not pose a threat to public law and order.
.Instead of the strikers holding a peaceful demonstration however, states the Government, the general strike degenerated within  hours into street fighting, public disorder and the destruction of public and private property. The national police and the armed forces therefore found themselves obliged to intervene in order to restore law and order in certain parts of the city of Santo Domingo and of other towns in the interior of the country. In the process it proved necessary to arrest and hand over to the ordinary courts of law those people who were caught disturbing the peace or breaking into private premises. By decision of the President of the Republic, most of these people were released unconditionally just hours after the strike ended; others were formally charged with the offences stated above.
.The Government stresses that the deaths that occurred in the country on  and  June were totally unrelated to the general strike, and were isolated incidents taken advantage of by the groups backing the strike who attributed them to the police. Several people were wounded while resisting arrest.
.The Government concludes that while the strike was actually in progress no repressive measures whatsoever were taken against its backers and militants and that the arrests that were made were for the reasons given.
.The Committee observes that the allegations of the complainant organisation and the Government's reply contradict one another: on the one hand, according to the ICFTU, the police and armed forces reacted extremely violently during the general strike of  June , firing on peaceful demonstrators, killing three, wounding dozens and arresting over , people throughout the country; the Government, on the other hand, claims that the deaths were totally unrelated to the general strike but were taken advantage of by its backers, that the arrests during the strike effected persons caught fighting in the streets, causing public disorder and destroying property and that several people were wounded while resisting arrest by the police. The Committee notes that, according to the Government, most of those arrested were released when the strike ended and that others were formally charged with the offences",0,1989,Dominican Republic

.In view of the contradiction between the allegations and the Government's reply, the Committee can only deplore that these acts of violence resulted in three deaths and a considerable number of wounded, and request the Government to inform it of developments and of the outcome in the criminal proceedings initiated in connection with the aforementioned deaths and against those persons who are still under arrest (including the text of the judgements handed down), so that it has sufficient information at its disposal to be able to reach conclusions on the allegations.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee deplores that the acts of violence of  June , the day of the general strike, resulted in three deaths and a considerable number of wounded.(b) So that it has sufficient information at its disposal to be able to reach conclusions on the allegations, the Committee requests the Government to inform it of developments and of the outcome in the criminal proceedings initiated in connection with the aforementioned deaths and against those persons who are still under arrest (including the text of the judgement handed down).",0,1989,Dominican Republic
43,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) dated  February l. The ICFTU sent additional information in a letter dated  March l. The Government replied by letter of  December l.
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, l (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, l (No. ).
.In its letters of  February and  March l the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) alleges that on  February l groups of armed persons linked with the Government attacked the headquarters of the Sacks and Ropes Factory Union during a meeting being held by the Union to elect new officers; it also alleges that the Union's leaders were dismissed from their employment and threatened with death.
.The ICFTU adds that on  March l, while collective bargaining was in process, police forces violently displaced striking workers who belonged to the Union of Employees of the ""Santo Domingo South"" Hotel; that  workers were arbitrarily dismissed as well as the General Secretary and the Organising Secretary of the Union; and that a member of the Committee of the ""Hotel Hispaniola"" Employees' Union was also dismissed, merely because he had expressed his solidarity with the strikers.
.In its letter of  December l, the Government states that the Office of the Secretary of State for Labour had mediated in the dispute which had arisen in the Sacks and Rope Factory and that the undertaking - which had not been able to make the payments due from it because of the economic situation - reinstated the dismissed workers in accordance with the suggestion made by the Office of the Secretary of State.
.As regards the collective dispute in the ""Santo Domingo South"" and ""Hispaniola"" Hotels, the Government appends a letter from the unions of employees of the two hotels, addressed to the Secretary of State for Labour and thanking the authorities for the mediation which had led to full settlement of the dispute (reinstatement of the dismissed employees except for two who had been fired for unsatisfactory performance of their work and who had in any case the right to appeal to the courts). In the same letter the unions stressed their satisfaction with the compromise agreement reached with the two hotels.
.The Committee observes that the present case relates principally to the dismissal of workers and trade union officers in connection with collective disputes. It notes with interest that, following mediation by the Office of the Secretary of State for Labour, reinstatement of the dismissed workers was secured and the various disputes accordingly settled. However, the Committee wishes to emphasise that on previous occasions, when considering complaints of anti-union discrimination in the Dominican Republic, it has pointed out to the Government that legislation permitting an employer to dismiss a worker on condition that he pays the statutory compensation laid down for cases of unjustified dismissal, when the real reason for the dismissal is the worker's trade union membership or his trade union activity does not provide sufficient protection against acts of anti-union discrimination within the meaning of Convention No. . The Committee would again recall this principle, and draws this case to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.
.Lastly, the Committee observes that the Government has not replied specifically to the allegations regarding the violent disruption of the meeting of the Sacks and Ropes Factory Union and the similar action taken against the striking members of the union of employees of the ""San Domingo South"" Hotel. As the disputes in question have been settled, the Committee would merely refer to the principle laid down in Article  of Convention No. , according to which the public authorities must refrain from any interference which would restrict the right of workers' organisations to organise their activities or impede the lawful exercise of that right.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:a) Since the existing legislation does not provide sufficient protection against dismissals based on trade union membership or activity, the Committee requests the Government to take measures so as to ensure that the legislation guarantees such protection. It draws the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to this aspect of the case.b) The Committee draws the Government's attention to the principle contained in Article  of Convention No. , according to which the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict the right of workers' organisations to organise their activities.",0,1987,Dominican Republic
44,".The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) presented a complaint of infringement of trade union rights in a communication dated  January . The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  April .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The ICFTU alleges that, on  January , the police violently disrupted the general assembly of the Trade Union of Workers of the ""Catarey"" Sugar Plantation which had been called to discuss and decide on action to be taken so as to obtain wage increases.
.The ICFTU adds that the police intervention provoked clashes which resulted in  workers being injured and the death of one unionist, Mario Rosa Polanco, who was beaten by the police after being detained. The ICFTU states that  trade unionists were detained in connection with this incident.
.The Government states that during the period to which the complaint refers a series of strikes, marches, protests and mobilisations of workers, students and political militants were planned and carried out; they were controlled by the authorities responsible for preserving law and order and the safety of the State's citizens and property. It therefore considers that this case does not deal with an express and systematic violation of freedom of association, but with measures taken under the law, given the illegality of the strikes, marches, etc. because they were not covered by the relevant authorisation and did not satisfy the local requirements. These temporary measures were lifted as soon as the strikers' excitement gave way to common sense and no worker was deprived of his freedom.
.The Government also states that the complainant exaggerates when describing the action taken by the authorities as trade union repression, given the planning and orchestration of the strikes and the extent of their effect on public order in the  sugar plantations and divisions of the State Sugar Council (CEA) by the various unions of sugar workers affiliated to the National Federation of Cane Workers (FENATRACA). The unions' actions were aimed, according to the Government, at obtaining a bonus which the CEA was not in a position to grant because of the precarious economic situation it was experiencing and which was a result of the brutal drop in the price of its sugar on the preferential US market and on the world market.
.The Government adds that while it is true that the worker Mario Rosa Polanco was killed by a policeman during street clashes between workers and the police, his death could be considered as an isolated incident involving one individual policeman, named Dimas Nello Das, who has been dismissed from the police force and is facing trial before the courts.
.The Government concludes by pointing out that calm has returned to the CEA sugar plantations and that the Secretariat of State for Labour managed to establish direct dialogue between the officials of the CEA and the workers involved in the illegal strike. This dialogue enabled satisfactory agreements to be reached, including the payment of RD$. out of central government funds to each of the cane workers.
.The Committee notes that the present case refers to the disruption by the police of a meeting of the Trade Union of Workers of the ""Catarey"" Sugar Plantation which, according to the complainant, resulted in the detention of  workers, the injury of  persons and the death of the trade unionist, Mario Rosa Polanco. The Committee observes that the Government's justification for the action of the authorities lies in the planning of strikes on the various sugar plantations and the extent of their effect on public order with the aim of obtaining economic benefits which the employer was not in a position to grant.
.The Committee notes that the Government does not specifically refer to those persons whom the complainant claims were wounded, although it does refer to street clashes between the police and workers. The Committee also notes that the Government denies that there were any detentions.
.As regards the death of the trade unionist, Mario Rosa Polanco, the Committee takes note of the Government's acknowledgement that a policeman was involved and that he is facing trial in this connection. In these circumstances, it deplores the death of this trade unionist and requests the Government to transmit information on the outcome of the trial which is under way.
.Since there is no information leading to a clear conclusion that in fact the trade union meeting which was disturbed by the police was not peaceful or involved a threat to law and order, the Committee deplores the violence which took place during the said trade union meeting. It draws the Government's attention to the principle that the authorities should refrain from any interference which could restrict or impede the exercise of the right to hold union meetings (see, for example, th Report, Case No.  (Mauritania), para.).
.Finally, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, calm has returned to the sugar plantations and satisfactory agreements have been reached by the parties with the help of the authorities.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this report and, in particular, the following conclusions:(a) The Committee deplores the violence which took place on  January  during the meeting of the Trade Union of Workers of the ""Catarey"" Sugar Plantation and draws the Government's attention to the principle that the authorities should refrain from any interference which could restrict or impede the exercise of the right to hold union meetings.(b) As regards the death of the trade unionist Mario Rosa Polanco, the Committee observes that the Government acknowledges that a policeman was involved and that he is being tried in this connection. In these circumstances, the Committee deplores the death of this unionist and requests the Government to transmit information on the outcome of the trial which is under way.",0,1986,Dominican Republic
45,".The complaint presented by the General Central Organisation of Workers (CGT) is contained in a communication dated  May . The Government sent its observations in communications dated  September  and  June .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No.), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No.).
.The complainant alleges that on  May , three days after the workers of the Pasteurizadora Rica C. por A. undertaking had set up a trade union, the executives of the undertaking requested the occupation of the premises by the military and dismissed  members of the trade union, including five recently elected leaders (Antonio Surez, Jos A. Lagares, Francisco Snchez, Elvin Herrera and Jos Antonio Pimentel).
.The complainant adds that on  May , the Ministry of Labour ordered a so-called investigation into the events; however, the persons appointed to carry out this investigation never visited the premises of the undertaking, a situation which was exploited by the employers to replace the dismissed workers by active members of the military.
.The complainant adds that on  May , Gregorio Reyes, Secretary-General of the trade union and Marino del Carmen Meja, Secretary of Records and Correspondence, were forced to resign from the leadership of the trade union. On  May  the trade union assembly met and elected Juan Osorio, Dianor Beltr Amador and Dilon Reyes as substitutes for the dismissed leaders. On the following day they were also dismissed. There are thus serious grounds for suspecting collusion between middle-rank officials of the Ministry of Labour and the employers at the undertaking.
.Finally, the complainant states that the remaining trade union leaders (Pablo de Jess Rosario, Manuel de Jess, Pedro Bretn and Erasmo Vargas) were transferred to less well-paid workplaces with the express objective of forcing them to resign from the undertaking.
.In its communication of  September , the Government states that the complaint presented by the CGT does not correspond exactly to the events which occurred in the Pasteurizadora Rica C. por A. undertaking since no reference is made in the complaint to the serious circumstances which in fact led to a precarious economic situation which obliged this undertaking to make urgent readjustments and changes in its pace of production and which affected the level of employment.
.The documentation furnished by the Government in the annex contains information from the undertaking explaining the economic difficulties which it had been experiencing since , in particular following the increase in production costs and the freezing of milk prices by the Government. A communication from the undertaking dated  August  points out that as a result of the precarious economic situation of the undertaking  workers had been dismissed in recent months.
.In its communication dated  June , the Government states that although the dismissed workers included  members of the trade union, the dismissals were made without reference to their status as trade unionists and at all times in accordance with the right granted by the Labour Code to remove workers; that they were motivated only by the serious and precarious economic situation of the undertaking; and that the persons concerned were not replaced by active members of the military to whom remuneration would have had to be paid, which would have meant a persistence of the same economic deficit.
.With regard to the allegation concerning the transfer of trade union leaders to less well-paid workplaces, the Government states that this does not accord with the facts, since these workers are sales agents who are rotated on a temporary basis, irrespective of their trade union status, in various zones some of which prove more profitable than others. The Government adds that the allegation concerning the pressure brought to bear on two trade union leaders to resign from the trade union is unfounded.
.Finally, the Government states that the Secretariat of State for Labour, in the interests of preserving industrial peace and in its role as friendly mediator between the parties, reached a satisfactory settlement of this dispute which was already assuming major proportions and creating a shortage of a nutriment which is vital to children and old people, since the Pasteurizadora Rica C. por A. undertaking is the main supplier of pasturised milk in the country.
.The Committee notes that in the present complaint the complainant has alleged basically that acts of trade union discrimination were carried out in the Pasteurizadora Rica C. por A. undertaking following the establishment of a trade union. The complainant organisation has referred in particular to the dismissal of  trade unionists (including five trade union leaders and two substitutes) and the transfer of three trade union leaders to workplaces with poorer working conditions.
.The Committee notes that, according to the Government, although the  dismissed workers included  trade unionists, no account was taken of their status as trade union members and that their dismissal was the result of the economic crisis which the undertaking was experiencing. The Government also affirms that the allegation concerning the transfer of trade union leaders to less well-paid workplaces does not accord with the actual facts since as sales agents they are rotated temporarily in different zones irrespective of their status as trade union members.
.The Committee therefore concludes that the accounts of the complainant and the Government concerning the events are contradictory. The Committee would like to stress, nevertheless, that according to the allegations, the dismissals in question affected a large number of trade union leaders (at first five and subsequently two others) and trade unionists, and occurred days or weeks after the establishment of the trade union.
.In these circumstances, although it takes note that the undertaking was in a situation of economic crisis, the Committee would like to recall the principle contained in the Workers' Representatives Recommendation,  (No. ) that one of the specific measures of protection should be the ""recognition of a priority to be given to workers' representatives with regard to their retention in employment in case of reduction in the workforce"".
.The Committee notes furthermore that section  of the Labour Code of the Dominican Republic authorises dismissal ""without just cause"" on the condition that the employer pays the compensation prescribed by the law, and that section  imposes only small fines in the event of an infringement of the provisions which establish protection against acts of trade union discrimination. Therefore, on the basis of previous conclusions concerning the legislation of the Dominican Republic (see for example, th Report, Case No.  (Dominican Republic), paras.  to ), the Committee draws the attention of the Government to the fact that legislation which authorises the dismissal without just cause of trade union leaders and workers on condition that they are paid the compensation prescribed by law, does not give sufficient protection against anti-union discrimination, since it enables an employer, on condition that he pays the compensation prescribed by law, to dismiss any member of his staff, for trade union or other activities, the public authorities being powerless to prevent him from doing so. Protection is particularly desirable in the case of trade union officials because in order to be able to perform their trade union duties in full independence, they must have the guarantee that they will not be prejudiced on account of the mandate which they hold from the trade unions.
.Finally, the Committee draws the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to the legislative aspect of the case and requests the Government to consider the adoption of legislation to give effective protection to trade union leaders and workers against dismissals made on the basis of their trade union activities.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present report and, in particular, the following conclusions:a) The Committee recalls the principle contained in the Workers' Representatives Recommendation,  (No. ) that one of the specific measures of protection should be the ""recognition of a priority to be given to workers' representatives with regard to their retention in employment in case of reduction of the workforce"".b) On the basis of previous conclusions reached in relation with the legislation of the Dominican Republic, the Committee draws the attention of the Government to the fact that legislation which authorises the dismissal without just cause of trade union leaders and workers on condition that they are paid the compensation prescribed by law, does not give sufficient protection against acts of anti-union discrimination.c) The Committee draws the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Recommendations and Conventions to the legislative aspect of the case and requests the Government to consider the adoption of legislation to give effective protection to trade union leaders and workers against dismissals made on the basis of their trade union activities.",0,1985,Dominican Republic
46,".The Unified Workers' Confederation (CUT) presented a complaint of violations of trade union rights in communications dated  February,  March and  May . The General Confederation of Workers (CGT) presented further allegations in a communication dated  April . The Government sent replies in communications dated  and  May,  September,  October and  November .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No.) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No.).
.In its letter of  February , the CUT alleges that its activities have been disturbed by the Government's anti-union actions. For example, on  January  a meeting of the executive committee of the CUT had to be suspended because its national headquarters were being closely watched by members of the secret service of the National Police and its leaders were being closely followed by them. On  January  a work session of the National Directorate of the CUT was prevented for lack of a quorum because both in the capital and provincial cities CUT leaders and premises were inspected and searched by the state security forces. Again, on  February , the CUT Secrerary-General, Mr. Jos Cristbal Durn, was held by the police for almost three hours in the early morning at his home. On the following day, the CUT Correspondence Secretary and Secretary-General of the National Federation of Workers in the Food, Commerce, Hotel and Allied Industries (FENATRACOBA-CUT), Victor Rosario, was taken away by the police, and the CUT premises at Santiago were broken into by the National Police (breaking the padlocks) and office equipment was destroyed.
.According to the CUT, when a general strike was called for on  February , government repression reached such a level as to oblige CUT leaders to go underground and continue their activities clandestinely. On  February , the CUT Organisation Secretary, Mario Robles Fortuna, was arrested at Santiago de los Caballeros and to date is still imprisoned. Mr. Sigfredo Cabral, the Press and Propaganda Secretary of the Dominican Teachers' Association (ADP) was also allegedly beaten up by members of the army. Lastly, the CUT alleges generally that all of the trade union movement and its leaders are continuing to suffer persecution such as telephone tapping and violation of both incoming and outgoing correspondence.
.In its letter of  March , the CUT also alleges that the Government has not reacted to its and other trade unions' requests for dialogue to eliminate the suffering of workers and the unemployed, despite the Government's publication in the press to the effect that it was entering into negotiations with several workers' confederations including the CUT. Among the press cuttings attached to the CUT's letter is a report of the beating suffered by Mr. Sigfredo Cabral on  January  at the hands of members of the G- division of the army.
.In its letter of  May , the CUT alleges that the Chairman of Qumica Industrial C.A. (a subsidiary of Bayer International) has been using discriminatory methods and trying to destroy the workers' trade union of that company (SINTRAQUINDUS). It cites the following incidents:- on  March , the Chairman dismissed the Secrerary-General of the union, Mr. Clodomiro Tejada, contrary to the collective agreement in force and despite the fact that Mr. Tejada had not committed any errors in his work;- in January , Jos Carvajal and Santa Canela were dismissed;- on  April , Jos Miguel Martnez, Deyanira Carela, Rosario Ramrez and Angel Augusto were dismissed for being Black and Juana Camacho was dismissed because her husband is Asian. The CUT states that it has brought these facts to the attention of the President of the Republic, the National Congress, the media and the international and national trade union movement.
.The General Confederation of Workers, in its letter of  April , refers to three situations of alleged flagrant violations of freedom of association:- The Haitian labourers are prohibited, in practice, from forming or joining trade unions because of their temporary stays in the country and because they are constantly transferred from one sugar plantation to another; if they are discovered in meetings for this purpose they are arrested. The CGT annexes to its letter details of anti-union acts which took place at the ""Porvenir"" sugar plantations on  April . First, it states that  Haitian labourers approached the local police station to request the release of a fellow worker who was detained on suspension of holding secret meetings for political ends, but were themselves arrested and beaten by the chief of the police of that station. He also allegedly abused and threatened the unionists, and a labour inspector of the Haitian Embassy who had been acting as mediator was forced to defend himself from the police violence. Secondly, on the same day, during an illegal evening search of their house, Messrs. Francisco Prez, an executive member of the FENAZUCAR-CGT, and Sentil Sentiles were taken away by company officials using two cars of the eastern region secret service and one army vehicle.- On  April , according to the CGT, the following trade union leaders were arrested while distributing trade union leaflets concerning a campaign on wages: Pablo Castillo, Functions Secretary of the CGT of Puerto Plata, Jos Vasquez and Warner Carrasco Nin, Co-ordinators of the CGT Profederation Committee of Barahona, and Antonio Jimnez, a leader of the ticket vendors' trade union at Puerto Plata.- The Secretary-General of the CGT, Julio de Pea Valdez, is under surveillance with a permanent watch on his home.
.In its communication of  May , the Government denies the CUT's allegations of violations of freedom of association and states that, due to their limited training, so-called trade union leaders confound lack of respect for the authorities, government decisions and the legally established order with disorderliness. It adds that the allegations are not supported by the proof necessary for such a complaint. According to the Government, the ILO should not embark on actions directly related to political situations supported by various groups which previously had followed the line dictated by their particular interests using the climate of respect of citizens' freedoms, in particular freedom of the press, to try to give a distorted picture of the real situation to the national and international public. Lastly, the Government points out that in the country no trade unionists have been arrested for carrying out trade union activities; the Government supports and encourages the trade union movement as is shown by the creation of innumerable trade unions and new confederations.
.In its letter of  May , the Government adds that the Secretariat of State for Labour has carried out investigations into the allegations and has concluded that there have been no violations of Conventions Nos.  and . Measures for national security were taken when a strike was announced - which was illegal - because it is the custom of certain trade unionists to challenge the authorities openly, in line with extreme leftist parties, with a view to disrupting law and order. Despite this situation, the national authorities acted cautiously and wisely without physical abuse; no arrests were made for investigation purposes within the legal provisions and there are no trade unionists detained in the country for having carried out trade union activities. It adds that no trade union premises have been occupied by the forces of public order.
.The Government states in its communication of  September  that it has defused a large-scale political struggle against it by granting a substantial wage increase for all workers of the country through Resolution No. /; public employees' salaries and medical personnel salaries have also been increased. According to the Government, the struggle led by various trade union confederations never took place within the legal procedures provided for in the legislation of the country; the authorities, therefore, were forced to adopt security measures to preserve law and order.
.As regards the allegations concerning Qumica Industrial C.A., the Government states in its letter of  October  that the Secretariat of State for Labour undertook investigations and concluded that at no time had workers been dismissed on the grounds of colour or race, but for serious errors in carrying out their tasks. For example, Mr. Clodomiro Tejada was dismissed for violation of s. (), (), () and () of the Labour Code. Nevertheless, the appropriate tribunal of the Secretariat of State for Labour is empowered to hear dismissal cases and will decide accordingly.
.In its communication of  November , the Government states that the most recent allegations lack solid evidence and are no more than invectives made in conjunction with foreigners devoted to trade union-type work in the sugar plantations in open violation of the hospitality offered by the country with its civil liberties and jealously guarded peace. According to the Government, Haitian nationals who temporarily participate in cane-cutting for three or four months of the year have never shown any interest in occupational struggles, or in paying",0,1985,Dominican Republic
47,"union fees and yet continue to be besieged by politicised trade unionists. The Government considers that these allegations should be rejected as being contrary to law and without foundation.
.The Committee notes that the allegations in this case basically fall into four categories:
.As regards the alleged arrests of trade union leaders in February  (Jos Cristbal Durn held for three hours at his home; Victor Rosario, Mario Robles Fortuna still detained; Sigfredo Cabral beaten up by army officers) and April  (Pablo Castillo, Jos Vasquez, Warner Carrasco Nin, and Antonio Jimnez), the Committee notes the Government's general denial of any arrests and detentions for trade union activities. It also notes the Government's inference that political groups are trying to give a distorted picture of the real situation and its statement that security measures were taken when an illegal strike was called in February and that the forces of order acted with prudence and without any physical abuse.
.Given the detailed nature of the allegations, the Committee can only regret that the Government confines its reply to a general denial, mentioning ""security measures"" without specifying their nature or duration. It especially regrets this since past complaints against the Dominican Republic have referred to the brief arrest of Mario Robles in July  (see th Report, Case No. , paragraphs  to , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session, May-June ). Although the lack of sufficiently detailed information prevents it from reaching specific conclusions on the alleged arrests of early , the Committee nevertheless draws the Government's attention to the principle that the arrest and detention of trade unionists in connection with trade union activities constitutes serious interference with trade union rights unless attended by appropriate judicial safeguards and that the preventive detention of trade unionists on the ground that breaches of the law may take place in the course of a strike involves a serious danger of infringement of trade union rights (see, for example, th Report, Case No.  (Bolivia), para. ). It trusts that the Government will take account of these principles if called upon to take security measures in the future.
.As regards the alleged forced entry into union premises and destruction of union property in February  and surveillance of union correspondence, the Committee notes the Government's statement that no trade union premises have been occupied by forces of public order and that it has been supporting and encouraging the trade union movement, as evidenced by the creation of trade unions and new confederations. Once again, in view of the general nature of this reply, the Committee would draw the Government's attention to the Resolution on trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties, adopted by the International Labour Conference at its th Session (), which states that the right to adequate protection of trade union property is one of those civil liberties which are essential for the normal exercise of trade union rights (see also th Report, Case No.  (Mauritania), para. ).
.The Committee considers that it is not within its competence to comment on those dismissals at the Qumica Industrial C.A. allegedly based on race. On the other hand, the Committee notes that the dismissal of the Secretary-General of the factory union, Mr. Clodomiro Tejada, was based, according to the Government, on s.  of the Labour Code which permits the employer to dismiss an employee on the following grounds:
.As regards the various allegations of trade union repression at the ""Porvenir"" sugar plantations, the Committee takes note of the Government's assertions that the temporarily resident Haitian cane-cutters have never shown any interest in occupational struggles and that it considers these allegations to be contrary to law and without foundation. The Committee also notes that it has, in the past (see st Report, Case No. , paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its st Session, November ), been presented with allegations concerning this state sugar plantation and that the Commission of Inquiry appointed under article  of the ILO Constitution to examine the observance of, inter alia, the freedom of association Conventions ratified by the Dominican Republic recommended certain amendments to the Labour Code and the taking of measures to eliminate shortcomings in the application of Convention No.  on this very point (see Report of the Commission of Inquiry, ILO, Official Bulletin, Vol LXVI, , Series B, Special Supplement, pras.  to  and  to ). In view of the fact that the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations is pursuing the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry in its regular examination of the Dominican Republic's observance of Convention No. , the Committee considers that this aspect of the present case should be referred to the Committee of Experts, in particular the alleged police violence against Haitian labourers and unionists and the arrest of the Secretary-General of FENAZUCAR-CGT.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this report and, in particular, the following conclusions:a) As regards the alleged arrests in February and April  and continued detention of trade union officials, the Committee draws the Government's attention to the following principles: the arrest and detention of trade unionists in connection with trade union activities constitutes serious interference with trade union rights and that the preventive detention of trade unionists on the ground that breaches of the law may take place in the course of a strike involves a serious danger of infringement of trade union rights.b) The Committee trusts that the Government will take account of these principles if called upon to take security measures in the future.c) As regards the alleged forced entry into union premises, destruction of union property therein and surveillance of union correspondence, the Committee would recall generally that the right to adequate protection of trade union property is one of those civil liberties which are essential for the normal exercise of trade union rights.d) The Committee considers that the allegations concerning anti-union dismissals at the Qumica Industrial C.A. chemical factory do not call for further examination.e) As regards the various allegations of trade union repression at the ""Porvenir"" state sugar plantations, in particular police violence against Haitian labourers and unionists and the arrest of the Secretary-General of FENAZUCAR-CGT, the Committee refers this aspect of the present case to the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, within the framework of its examination of the effect given to the recommendations made by the Commission of Inquiry set up by virtue of Article  of the ILO Constitution.",0,1985,Dominican Republic
48,".The complaints are contained in communications from the Unified Workers' Confederation (CUT) and the General Confederation of Workers (CGT) dated respectively  July and  October . The CUT presented additional information in a communication dated  July , and the CGT in communications dated  and  November . The Government replied in communications dated  November  and  January and  May .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No.), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No.).
.The CUT alleges that the following persons were dismissed in connection with trade union activities: Marcelino Manuel Uribe (a trade unionist in the heavy equipment undertaking of the Dominican Cement Works, dismissed without reason on  June ), Elas Adames Boyer and Alfonso Snchez (both trade union leaders, dismissed on  June  from the Ro Haina state sugar plantation as part of an operation carried out against the CUT).
.The CGT alleges in its first communication that the management of the ""Porvenir"" state sugar plantation pressured trade union leaders to leave the trade union or give up their jobs; the management also stopped the check off deduction of trade union dues in violation of the current collective agreement in force. In its later communication, the CGT states that the trade union in question has reached a satisfactory agreement on these matters with the management of the plantation.
.The CGT adds that the National Office of Land Transportation (ONATRATE) unfairly dismissed a number of its employees, starting on  October . This occurred during trade union elections, which ended on  October. According to the CGT, four of the persons concerned featured on one of the two lists of candidates for nomination to the executive committee of the trade union.
.Referring to the dismissal of Marcelino Manuel Uribe, the Government forwarded a letter from the undertaking where he worked, stating that the reason for the dismissal was undisciplined behaviour in the undertaking, to the extent that ""as regards the incidents occurring in April and the would be strike of May , this person was one of the instigators of that strike ... the said person is not a member of any trade union organisation"". According to the Government, Mr. Uribe was dismissed under section  of the Labour Code.
.The Government also states that the management of the ""Porvenir"" sugar plantation and the CGT reached satisfactory agreements on the matters referred to in the complaints.
.The Government states in addition that Elas Adames Boyer and Alfonso Snchez were not dismissed due to trade union activities. The former was dismissed for failing to discharge satisfactorily the duties for which he had been engaged. The latter was reinstated when it was determined that the reason for his dismissal was not sufficiently valid.
.As regards the dismissals in the ONATRATE, the Government states that some dismissals did in fact take place owing to the change in management, as a result of the administrative reorganisation of the office, but in no case did they relate to trade union activities, as is proved by the fact that most of the persons dismissed did not belong to the trade union operating in ONATRATE.
.The Committee notes that the parties to the collective dispute which occurred in the ""Porvenir"" sugar plantation have reached an agreement which is satisfactory to both parties. The Committee also notes that trade union leader Alfonso Snchez has been reinstated in the Ro Haina sugar plantation. Lastly, the Committee takes note of the Government's explanations concerning the dismissals which took place in the ONATRATE.
.On the other hand, the Committee observes that, according to the Government, the trade union leader Elas Adames Boyer was dismissed for failing to discharge satisfactorily the duties for which he had been engaged. In this respect, the Committee regrets that the Government has not provided more precise information on the specific reasons why the work of this trade union leader was considered unsatisfactory. In addition, the Committee observes that, as regards the dismissal of Marcelino Manuel Uribe, the Government has forwarded a letter from the undertaking where this person worked, indicating that his dismissal was directly linked to ""the incidents occurring in April and the would-be strike of May "", of which he was ""one of the instigators"". The Committee also observes that Mr. Uribe was dismissed under section  of the Labour Code, that is, without a reason being given. In these circumstances, the Committee regrets that Mr. Uribe was dismissed for carrying out trade union activities, thereby infringing Article  of Convention No. . It draws the attention of the Government to the principle that it does not appear that sufficient protection against acts of anti-union discrimination - as set out in Convention No.  - is accorded by legislation which, in practice, enables employers, on condition that they pay the compensation prescribed by law in cases of unjustified dismissal, to get rid of any worker when the true reason for dismissal is his trade union membership or activities. (See, for example, th Report, Case No.  (Dominican Republic), para. .) The Committee draws the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to this case.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this report and, in particular, the following conclusions:a) The Committee notes that Marcelino Manuel Uribe was dismissed for carrying out trade union activities, thereby infringing Article  of Convention No. .b) The Committee draws the attention of the Government to the principle that it does not appear that sufficient protection against acts of anti-union discrimination is accorded by legislation which, in practice, enables employers, on condition that they pay the compensation prescribed by law in cases of unjustified dismissal, to get rid of any worker when the true reason for the dismissal is his trade union membership or activities.c) The Committee draws the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to this case.",0,1984,Dominican Republic
49,".The Committee examined these cases at its November  Session and submitted an interim report to the Governing Body (see th Report of the Committee, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November )). Later, the Government transmitted certain observations by a communication dated  May .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee takes note of the information provided by the Government concerning the dead and injured during the protest movements of ,  and  April . The Committee notes, in particular, that according to the Government, it is impossible to establish guilt, in particular that of the unknown instigators and ringleaders who took advantage of the discontent prevailing among the masses of the people at that moment, in an endeavour to capitalise on it in favour of their own political interests.
.In this connection, the Committee, notwithstanding that there may be difficulty in fixing responsibility for the deaths and physical attacks which occurred during the protest movements, wishes to point out that the Government has stated that several deaths and injuries occurred when the authorities responsible for keeping the peace, acting within the limits of the law, resisted flagrant acts of aggression and other criminal acts such as the sacking and burning of property. In these circumstances, the Committee considers that it would be possible to carry out a thorough and impartial inquiry into the nature of the demonstrations and the deaths and physical attacks which occurred, in order to determine responsibilities. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the results of any such inquiry.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present report and, in particular, the following conclusions:(a) The Committee observes the contradiction between the complainants' and the Government's statements as to the trade union status of the organisers of the protests which took place in April . It points out, however, that the national complainant organisations have stated that they themselves had organised these protests.(b) The Committee emphasises the importance it attaches to the Government carrying out a thorough and impartial inquiry into the nature of the demonstrations and the deaths and physical attacks which occurred during the protest movements in order to determine responsibilites.(c) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the results of any such inquiry.
.In Case No. , the following organisations submitted a complaint of infringement of trade union rights in the Dominican Republic: the Inter-American Regional Organisation of Workers (GRIT) (communications dated  April and  May ), the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) (communications dated  April and  August ), the World Federation of Trade Unions (communications dated  April and  May ), the World Confederation of Labour (communications dated ,  and  August ) and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (communications dated  May,  August and  September ).
.These communications were transmitted to the Government which first replied in a telegram dated  May  and subsequently sent certain observations in a letter dated  June .
.The complaint relating to Case No.  is contained in a communication dated  May  submitted by the five Dominican trade union central organisations mentioned in Case No. , namely the National Confederation of Dominican Workers (CNTD), the General Union of Dominican Workers (UGTD), the Unified Workers' Central (CUT), the Workers' Trade Union Autonomous Federation (CASC). Subsequently the Unified Workers' Central (CUT) and the General Confederation of Workers (CGT) and the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of Latin American Workers (CPUSTAL) sent additional information in support of their complaints and made new allegations in communications dated ,  and  June,  July and  September .
.The Government for its part sent a very partial reply in a communication dated  July  and reiterated the information which it had given in Case No.  in a communication of  September .
.In the light of the serious nature of the allegations, the Director-General immediately intervened and sent telegrams to the Government of the Dominican Republic on  May and  September .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainant organisations give a general outline of the serious acts of repression against the trade union movement during its protest against the tripling of the cost of living following an agreement reached between the Dominican Government and the International Monetary Fund at the end of April .
.In particular they express their deep concern at the news of the death and the injury of several workers, the massive arrests of militants and trade union leaders and the occupation of trade union premises.
.According to the GRIT and the ICFTU in their communications of  April and  May , during the days of protest organised by the Dominican Trade Union Council (which groups together the five workers' central organisations of the Dominican Republic) against the exorbitant increase in the price of essential products,  workers died,  were injured and , detained. The WCL, in its communication dated  May, puts the number of dead at , with  persons injured and , arrested. For its part the WFTU, in its communication dated  April , confirms the allegations of the other complainant organisations and stresses in particular the need for the ILO to take measures within the framework of the United Nations system to guarantee that the granting of loans by the International Monetary Fund does not entail conditions which may lead to such tragic events.
.The ICFTU, in its communication of  May , also adds that on  April  the armed forces occupied the headquarters of the National Federation of Dock Workers (POASI) and that on  May the trade union leaders Carlos Enriquez Arias, Mariano Negrn and Francisco Guerrerro of the National Confederation of Dominican Workers (CNTD) as well as the Secretary for Education of the General Union of Dominican Workers (UGTD) were arrested. The WFTU, in its communication dated  May , points out that the Secretary-General of the Unified Workers' Central (CUT), Cristbal Durn, and the leader of the Dominican Association of Teachers (ADP) and the General Confederation of Workers (CGT) were also arrested. It also confirms the arrest of Carlos Enriquez Arias and alleges that the CGT leader. Julio de Pea Valdes was subject to police persecution.
.The Secretaries-General of the five Dominican central trade union organisations, the CASC, CNTD, UGTD, CUT and the CGT, in their joint communications dated  May , provide detailed information on the events which occurred. They explain that in order to defend the Dominican workers from the disastrous consequences of the economic crisis affecting the country and which had led to a reduction in purchasing power and an increase in unemployment, their five central trade union organisations decided jointly on  January  to establish a unified plan of resistance. Peaceful marches were thus organised for  February  in Santo Domingo and Santiago as well as in the interior to demand that the Government should break off negotiations with the International Monetary Fund, freeze the prices of foodstuffs and medicines, fix a minimum monthly wage of  dollars and introduce a general wage increase, reform the social security system, carry out agrarian reform to provide for peasant ownership of land and guarantee the exercise of trade union activities.
.On  April , that is ten days after the five central organisations had held a national day of protest against hunger, the President of the Republic, Dr. Salvador Jorge Blanco, announced to the country that the Government had reached a preliminary agreement with the International Monetary Fund to obtain a loan which would lead to the transfer of imports, with the exception of petroleum and its by-products, to the parallel foreign currency market. The Secretaries-General of the five complainant organisations explain that these measures resulted in an increase of more than  per cent in the price of foodstuffs and an increase of more than  per cent in the cost of medicines.
.The organisations add that these increases unleashed a powerful popular protest movement throughout the country on ,  and  April . The movement was crushed in a criminal manner by the Government. The Secretaries-General of the five central complainant organisations confirm moreover that the armed forces and the police caused the death of  persons, men, women and children, and that  persons were injured and , persons were imprisoned.
.The specific infringements of freedom of association with which the Government is charged by the complainant Secretaries-General are the police occupation of the premises of the CGT, UGTD and the National Federation of Dock Workers of Arrimo (POASI) on  April , when trade union leaders and active members were",0,1984,Dominican Republic
50,"physically prevented from entering and leaving the premises, as well as the police occupation of the premises of the CGT, UGTD, CNTD and the CUT and the CASC on  April ; the occupation of the residence of the Secretary-General of the CGT on  April ; the refusal of the Secretary of the Interior and Police to authorise a worker's march on  May ; the detention for three days of the national leaders of the CNDT, UGTD, CGT and CUT, Messrs. Arias, Valdez, Guerrerro, Galval and de la Rosa and the trade unionists Rmon Ramrez and Dionisio de Leone, arrested by agents of the secret police on  May , after they had participated in a press conference at the headquarters of the National Union of Professional Journalists (SNPP); the arrest throughout the country of  trade unionists belonging to the five central organisations between  and  May, and the acts of persecution against Mario Vasquez, Jos Duran and Julio de Pea of the CASC, CUT and the CGT; the complainants allege that all these repressive measures were designed to prevent the holding of the national strike which had been called for  May . Furthermore, they point out that administrative circulars dated  May  were sent out to public employees threatening them with dismissal if they failed to report for work on  May during the national strike called by the five central organisations and by the Independent Peasant Movement (MCI). The five Secretaries-General also allege that, from January  onwards, attempts were made by the Government to dismantle the UGTD.
.In a subsequent communication dated  June , the CUT, which is affiliated to the WFTU, reports that  persons died during the tragic days of ,  and  April  and calls attention to the occupation of its premises and those of other central organisations and the arrest of the trade union leaders Messrs. de la Rosa and GaIvan. It adds that on  June its Santiago headquarters were occupied by the police and that Antonio Cruzy was arrested; in the same way the trade union leader Robles Fortuna was arrested at his home on  June ; the director of the Department of Working Women was also arrested on her return from Cuba where she had been participating in a trade union training course. Furthermore the CUT adds that the secret police spied on and persecuted trade union leaders of its organisation, a situation which forced it to terminate its workers' education activities from  June .
.In a communication dated  July , the CGT points out that on  June , agents of the secret service of the national police arrested hundreds of trade union leaders and militants, including Julio Pea Valdez and Carlos Enriquez Arias, Secretaries-General of the CGT and the CNDT, as well as Juan Jos Jerez, Secretary-General of the Federation of Workers of the North (affiliated to the CGTD). The persons against whom no charges were made were released on  June at  p.m. On the  June, agents of the secret police occupied the headquarters of the CGT and arrested the Secretary-General of the Dominican Association of Teachers (ADP), Raphal Santos, as well as the Secretary for Education of the ADP, Juan Pastro Minaya, the Secretary of the CGT Federation of Sugar Workers (FENAZUCAR) and Victor Rufino Alvarez, treasurer of the INDRHI trade union, Raphal Rodriguez, treasurer of the UGTD and Raphal Rondol, who were kept in custody until  June  when they were released without any charges having been made against them.
.Finally, the CUT, in a communication dated  September , reiterates its allegations concerning the occupation of its premises and the tapping of its telephone communications as well as the arrest of Jos Francisco Ramoz, of the CUT, Gabriel del Rio Doe, of the CASC, Carlos Enrique Arias, of the UGTD, Juan Pablo Reyes, of the UGTD, and Barbarin Mojica of POASI. The residences of Jos Cristbal Duran and Julio de Pella Valdez, Secretaries-General of the CUT and the CGT, were allegedly again searched. The complainants state that the arrests and detentions mentioned above lasted from  August to  September .
.Furthermore, in telegraphic communications dated  August , the ICFTU, WCL and CLAT denounce the arrest of the five Secretaries-General of the central organisations of the Trade Union Council when these leaders were holding a meeting during the night of  August to decide on a general strike if the Government authorised the increase in the price of fuel and essential services. On the morning of  August the five Secretaries-General of the central organisations in question were thus arrested.
.Subsequently in a telegram dated  September , the ICFTU reports that the five Secretaries-General arrested on  August were released on  and  September .
.In a telegram dated  May  the Government points out that no trade unionist is being held in detention and that those who were arrested under powers which enable the Government to deal with disturbances of the public peace were immediately released. The Government of the Dominican Republic also emphasises that it is respectful of civil liberties and trade union freedom.
.In subsequent communications dated  June and  September , the Government explains that, as a result of its negotiations with the International Monetary Fund, various economic measures had been implemented resulting in certain necessary adjustments to enable the country to have funds available to meet its commitments with the World Bank and to obtain the credits vital to the development of the country. However, the Government had taken protective measures to ensure that the most disadvantaged social classes did not support the entire burden of these structural changes in the economy.
.In the same way, the Government states that it recently promulgated an Act granting workers an increase of  per cent in the minimum wage. Furthermore, the prices of several essential goods have been frozen and other measures of a social nature have been taken including the setting up of more than  popular shops or pharmacies which will sell, at cost-price, more than  medicines classified by the international health bodies as being essential, as well as the establishment of popular markets to ensure that the essential goods can reach the public at reasonable prices.
.The Government however confirms that on  and  April  violent public demonstrations occurred both in the capital and the interior of the country; these included in particular the sacking and burning of public and private property and flagrant acts of aggression against the authorities responsible for keeping the peace. Acting within the limits of the law, the authorities resisted these attacks which unfortunately resulted in the death and injury of several persons. The Government states that the action of the armed forces and the police was not directed against any particular sector, whether trade unions, students or other citizens.
.On the other hand it adds that the trade union organisations took advantage of the dissatisfaction resulting from the necessary economic adjustments and presented the Government, as they themselves state in their complaint, with a series of demands which constituted a programme of government impossible to implement immediately because of a number of factors. This programme of an essentially demagogic nature went beyond social matters into the political sphere. Thus the Dominican Government could not allow trade union or political organisations or small groups of the population to disturb the public peace, responsibility for which rests on the Government within the framework of its constitutional mandate.
.The Government explains that as a consequence the Trade Union Council took advantage of the situation resulting from the disturbances fermented by the opposition forces and called for a strike on  April and  May to be accompanied by demonstrations which would have met with total failure since, according to the Government, the population would not have participated. The Government also states that strikes, demonstrations and work stoppages carried out without the authorisation of the legally constituted authorities are a flagrant infringement of the law and that these events become dangerous when they occur in an unfavourable climate such as that which it has described. According to the Government, the politisation of trade union organisations has done a great disservice to the trade union movement in the Dominican Republic.
.In conclusion, the Government states that no trade union headquarters is at present occupied, that the security measures adopted around the trade union premises were of a preventive nature designed to avoid the repetition of the serious incidents which had previously occurred following the call for a strike and demonstrations made by the complainant trade union organisations and it affirms once more that throughout the territory there is no trade unionist in prison as a result of the exercise of his trade union activities and that those who were detained were immediately released after questioning by the security services. According to the Government, the facts alleged by the complainants have been grossly exaggerated and some are",0,1984,Dominican Republic
51,"not even true. On the contrary, in the view of the Government, trade union activities in the country are completely normal and the Government guarantees their preservation and strengthening.
.These cases concern essentially the serious incidents which occurred during days of protest in April and May  which had been organised by the five Dominican trade union central organisations grouped together under the Trade Union Council against the very large increase in the cost of living following the agreement signed between the Dominican Government and the International Monetary Fund at the end of April . The protest movement resulted in the death of many persons and the injury of many others, the arrest of trade union leaders and the temporary occupation of trade union premises. The Committee must firstly express its deep concern at and censure of the particularly serious nature of these incidents, in particular the death of several persons.
.The Committee notes the Government's acknowledgement that the negotiations with the International Monetary Fund led to the adoption of economic measures and adjustments designed to enable the country to have sufficient funds available to meet its commitments with the World Bank and to obtain the credits vital to the country's economy. However, according to the Government, measures have been taken to ensure that the most disadvantaged social classes do not bear all the burden of these structural changes and it mentioned the increase of  per cent in the minimum wage and the freezing of the prices of essential goods as well as the establishment of  popular shops and pharmacies which will sell at cost price medicines which are essential to the health of the population, as well as popular markets which will sell essential products to the public at accessible prices.
.Nevertheless the Government confirms that during the disturbances of  to  April  the authorities were obliged to combat the acts of popular aggression. According to the Government, the call by the Trade Union Council for workers to strike on the  April and  May was of a demagogic and political nature and the Government was obliged to adopt security measures around trade union premises to prevent the repetition of the serious incidents which had already taken place. Furthermore, the Government maintains that the arrests lasted only a short time and that the persons concerned were immediately released after questioning by the security services.
.The Committee observes, however, that the complainants for their part allege that the actions in question were undertaken in support of social claims. As a result of the disastrous consequences of the economic crisis affecting the country which had led to a reduction in purchasing power and an increase in unemployment, demands were made on the Government to break off negotiations with the International Monetary Fund, freeze the prices of foodstuffs and medicine, establish a minimum monthly wage at a certain level and to increase wages.
.The Committee considers that the claims of the five Dominican central trade union organisations taken as a whole did have an essentially trade union character. The Committee therefore regrets deeply that the increase in the price of foodstuffs and medicine led to a social protest movement which resulted in deaths and injuries and many arrests and it recalls that in cases in which the breaking up of a demonstration so as to restore public order has resulted in injuries and the loss of human life, it attaches great importance to the fact that a thorough inquiry be carried out to determine responsibilities so as to avoid the repetition of such actions; it requests the Government to inform it of the outcome of such an inquiry.
.Furthermore, the Committee has always considered that the right to strike is a legitimate and even essential means available to workers to promote and defend their occupational interests. The Committee has added that this right should not be restricted solely to industrial disputes likely to be resolved through the signing of a collective agreement: workers and their organisations should be allowed to express in a broader context, if they so wish, any dissatisfaction they may feel as concerns economic and social matters affecting their members' occupational interests [see nd Report, Case No.  (Ecuador) para. ; st Report, Case No.  (Tunisia), para. ]. The Committee is conscious that the fact of exercising a trade union activity or holding a trade union mandate does not imply any immunity from the ordinary penal legislation but it recalls that it is the responsibility of the Committee to verify itself whether the persons concerned have been arrested for common law offences or for trade union activities. In the present case, since the trade union leaders were arrested on several occasions and released after a few days' detention without any charge having been brought against them, the Committee considers it useful to point out to the Government that it should ensure that the authorities concerned have appropriate instructions to eliminate the danger of detentions being based on trade union activities [see th Report, Case No.  (India), para. ; Case No.  (Uruguay), para. ].
.As regards the allegations concerning the prohibition of the demonstration of  May, the Committee recalls that the right to organise public meetings and processions on  May is, as it has pointed out on several occasions, an important aspect of trade union rights. However, the Committee has also stressed that it is the responsibility of the Government as the guardian of public order to determine, in the exercise of its security powers, whether, in any given circumstances, even trade union demonstrations may jeopardise public order and security and to take the necessary preventive measures to circumvent this danger. However if, in order to avoid disturbances, the authorities decide to prohibit a meeting, they should, in the Committee's view, strive to come to an agreement with the organisers of the meeting in order to allow it to be held in some other place (perhaps on private premises) where there would be no fear of disturbances [see, for example, th Report, Case No.  (Mauritania), para.  and th Report, Case No.  (Turkey), para. ].
.As concerns the temporary occupation of the premises of several trade unions, the Committee considers that such an occupation may constitute a serious interference by the authorities in trade union activities. In the present case the Government claims that these temporary occupations were of a preventive nature and states that the premises are no longer occupied by the forces of order. However, the Committee wishes to stress the great importance which it attaches to the inviolability of trade union premises to guarantee freedom of association and trusts that the Government will take measures to avoid the repetition of such actions without a search warrant.
.In the circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions.(a) The Committee expresses its deep concern at the scope and seriousness of the allegations made in these cases and which concern the death and injury of several persons during trade union protest demonstrations against major increases in the cost of living.(b) As regards the violent deaths and injury of a number of persons, the Committee recalls the importance of carrying out a thorough inquiry to determine responsibilities so as to prevent a repetition of such actions; it requests the Government to inform it of the outcome of such an inquiry.(c) As concerns the arrests of trade union leaders and their subsequent release without any charge being brought against them, the Committee recalls that the Government should ensure that the authorities concerned have appropriate instructions to eliminate the danger of detentions being based on trade union activities.(d) As regards the temporary occupation of trade union premises, the Committee stresses the importance which it attaches to the inviolability of trade union premises to guarantee freedom of association and trusts that the Government will take appropriate measures to prevent the repetition of such action without a search warrant.(e) As concerns the prohibition of the demonstration on  May, the Committee recalls that the right to organise meetings and processions on  May is an important aspect of trade union rights and that the authorities should strive to come to an agreement with the organisers so as to allow the meeting or demonstration to be held normally.",0,1984,Dominican Republic

.The specific infringements of freedom of association with which the Government is charged by the complainant Secretaries-General are the police occupation of the premises of the CGT, UGTD and the National Federation of Dock Workers of Arrimo (POASI) on  April , when trade union leaders and active members were",0,1984,Dominican Republic
53,"physically prevented from entering and leaving the premises, as well as the police occupation of the premises of the CGT, UGTD, CNTD and the CUT and the CASC on  April ; the occupation of the residence of the Secretary-General of the CGT on  April ; the refusal of the Secretary of the Interior and Police to authorise a worker's march on  May ; the detention for three days of the national leaders of the CNDT, UGTD, CGT and CUT, Messrs. Arias, Valdez, Guerrerro, Galval and de la Rosa and the trade unionists Rmon Ramrez and Dionisio de Leone, arrested by agents of the secret police on  May , after they had participated in a press conference at the headquarters of the National Union of Professional Journalists (SNPP); the arrest throughout the country of  trade unionists belonging to the five central organisations between  and  May, and the acts of persecution against Mario Vasquez, Jos Duran and Julio de Pea of the CASC, CUT and the CGT; the complainants allege that all these repressive measures were designed to prevent the holding of the national strike which had been called for  May . Furthermore, they point out that administrative circulars dated  May  were sent out to public employees threatening them with dismissal if they failed to report for work on  May during the national strike called by the five central organisations and by the Independent Peasant Movement (MCI). The five Secretaries-General also allege that, from January  onwards, attempts were made by the Government to dismantle the UGTD.
.In a subsequent communication dated  June , the CUT, which is affiliated to the WFTU, reports that  persons died during the tragic days of ,  and  April  and calls attention to the occupation of its premises and those of other central organisations and the arrest of the trade union leaders Messrs. de la Rosa and GaIvan. It adds that on  June its Santiago headquarters were occupied by the police and that Antonio Cruzy was arrested; in the same way the trade union leader Robles Fortuna was arrested at his home on  June ; the director of the Department of Working Women was also arrested on her return from Cuba where she had been participating in a trade union training course. Furthermore the CUT adds that the secret police spied on and persecuted trade union leaders of its organisation, a situation which forced it to terminate its workers' education activities from  June .
.In a communication dated  July , the CGT points out that on  June , agents of the secret service of the national police arrested hundreds of trade union leaders and militants, including Julio Pea Valdez and Carlos Enriquez Arias, Secretaries-General of the CGT and the CNDT, as well as Juan Jos Jerez, Secretary-General of the Federation of Workers of the North (affiliated to the CGTD). The persons against whom no charges were made were released on  June at  p.m. On the  June, agents of the secret police occupied the headquarters of the CGT and arrested the Secretary-General of the Dominican Association of Teachers (ADP), Raphal Santos, as well as the Secretary for Education of the ADP, Juan Pastro Minaya, the Secretary of the CGT Federation of Sugar Workers (FENAZUCAR) and Victor Rufino Alvarez, treasurer of the INDRHI trade union, Raphal Rodriguez, treasurer of the UGTD and Raphal Rondol, who were kept in custody until  June  when they were released without any charges having been made against them.
.Finally, the CUT, in a communication dated  September , reiterates its allegations concerning the occupation of its premises and the tapping of its telephone communications as well as the arrest of Jos Francisco Ramoz, of the CUT, Gabriel del Rio Doe, of the CASC, Carlos Enrique Arias, of the UGTD, Juan Pablo Reyes, of the UGTD, and Barbarin Mojica of POASI. The residences of Jos Cristbal Duran and Julio de Pella Valdez, Secretaries-General of the CUT and the CGT, were allegedly again searched. The complainants state that the arrests and detentions mentioned above lasted from  August to  September .
.Furthermore, in telegraphic communications dated  August , the ICFTU, WCL and CLAT denounce the arrest of the five Secretaries-General of the central organisations of the Trade Union Council when these leaders were holding a meeting during the night of  August to decide on a general strike if the Government authorised the increase in the price of fuel and essential services. On the morning of  August the five Secretaries-General of the central organisations in question were thus arrested.
.Subsequently in a telegram dated  September , the ICFTU reports that the five Secretaries-General arrested on  August were released on  and  September .
.In a telegram dated  May  the Government points out that no trade unionist is being held in detention and that those who were arrested under powers which enable the Government to deal with disturbances of the public peace were immediately released. The Government of the Dominican Republic also emphasises that it is respectful of civil liberties and trade union freedom.
.In subsequent communications dated  June and  September , the Government explains that, as a result of its negotiations with the International Monetary Fund, various economic measures had been implemented resulting in certain necessary adjustments to enable the country to have funds available to meet its commitments with the World Bank and to obtain the credits vital to the development of the country. However, the Government had taken protective measures to ensure that the most disadvantaged social classes did not support the entire burden of these structural changes in the economy.
.In the same way, the Government states that it recently promulgated an Act granting workers an increase of  per cent in the minimum wage. Furthermore, the prices of several essential goods have been frozen and other measures of a social nature have been taken including the setting up of more than  popular shops or pharmacies which will sell, at cost-price, more than  medicines classified by the international health bodies as being essential, as well as the establishment of popular markets to ensure that the essential goods can reach the public at reasonable prices.
.The Government however confirms that on  and  April  violent public demonstrations occurred both in the capital and the interior of the country; these included in particular the sacking and burning of public and private property and flagrant acts of aggression against the authorities responsible for keeping the peace. Acting within the limits of the law, the authorities resisted these attacks which unfortunately resulted in the death and injury of several persons. The Government states that the action of the armed forces and the police was not directed against any particular sector, whether trade unions, students or other citizens.
.On the other hand it adds that the trade union organisations took advantage of the dissatisfaction resulting from the necessary economic adjustments and presented the Government, as they themselves state in their complaint, with a series of demands which constituted a programme of government impossible to implement immediately because of a number of factors. This programme of an essentially demagogic nature went beyond social matters into the political sphere. Thus the Dominican Government could not allow trade union or political organisations or small groups of the population to disturb the public peace, responsibility for which rests on the Government within the framework of its constitutional mandate.
.The Government explains that as a consequence the Trade Union Council took advantage of the situation resulting from the disturbances fermented by the opposition forces and called for a strike on  April and  May to be accompanied by demonstrations which would have met with total failure since, according to the Government, the population would not have participated. The Government also states that strikes, demonstrations and work stoppages carried out without the authorisation of the legally constituted authorities are a flagrant infringement of the law and that these events become dangerous when they occur in an unfavourable climate such as that which it has described. According to the Government, the politisation of trade union organisations has done a great disservice to the trade union movement in the Dominican Republic.
.In conclusion, the Government states that no trade union headquarters is at present occupied, that the security measures adopted around the trade union premises were of a preventive nature designed to avoid the repetition of the serious incidents which had previously occurred following the call for a strike and demonstrations made by the complainant trade union organisations and it affirms once more that throughout the territory there is no trade unionist in prison as a result of the exercise of his trade union activities and that those who were detained were immediately released after questioning by the security services. According to the Government, the facts alleged by the complainants have been grossly exaggerated and some are",0,1984,Dominican Republic
54,"not even true. On the contrary, in the view of the Government, trade union activities in the country are completely normal and the Government guarantees their preservation and strengthening.
.These cases concern essentially the serious incidents which occurred during days of protest in April and May  which had been organised by the five Dominican trade union central organisations grouped together under the Trade Union Council against the very large increase in the cost of living following the agreement signed between the Dominican Government and the International Monetary Fund at the end of April . The protest movement resulted in the death of many persons and the injury of many others, the arrest of trade union leaders and the temporary occupation of trade union premises. The Committee must firstly express its deep concern at and censure of the particularly serious nature of these incidents, in particular the death of several persons.
.The Committee notes the Government's acknowledgement that the negotiations with the International Monetary Fund led to the adoption of economic measures and adjustments designed to enable the country to have sufficient funds available to meet its commitments with the World Bank and to obtain the credits vital to the country's economy. However, according to the Government, measures have been taken to ensure that the most disadvantaged social classes do not bear all the burden of these structural changes and it mentioned the increase of  per cent in the minimum wage and the freezing of the prices of essential goods as well as the establishment of  popular shops and pharmacies which will sell at cost price medicines which are essential to the health of the population, as well as popular markets which will sell essential products to the public at accessible prices.
.Nevertheless the Government confirms that during the disturbances of  to  April  the authorities were obliged to combat the acts of popular aggression. According to the Government, the call by the Trade Union Council for workers to strike on the  April and  May was of a demagogic and political nature and the Government was obliged to adopt security measures around trade union premises to prevent the repetition of the serious incidents which had already taken place. Furthermore, the Government maintains that the arrests lasted only a short time and that the persons concerned were immediately released after questioning by the security services.
.The Committee observes, however, that the complainants for their part allege that the actions in question were undertaken in support of social claims. As a result of the disastrous consequences of the economic crisis affecting the country which had led to a reduction in purchasing power and an increase in unemployment, demands were made on the Government to break off negotiations with the International Monetary Fund, freeze the prices of foodstuffs and medicine, establish a minimum monthly wage at a certain level and to increase wages.
.The Committee considers that the claims of the five Dominican central trade union organisations taken as a whole did have an essentially trade union character. The Committee therefore regrets deeply that the increase in the price of foodstuffs and medicine led to a social protest movement which resulted in deaths and injuries and many arrests and it recalls that in cases in which the breaking up of a demonstration so as to restore public order has resulted in injuries and the loss of human life, it attaches great importance to the fact that a thorough inquiry be carried out to determine responsibilities so as to avoid the repetition of such actions; it requests the Government to inform it of the outcome of such an inquiry.
.Furthermore, the Committee has always considered that the right to strike is a legitimate and even essential means available to workers to promote and defend their occupational interests. The Committee has added that this right should not be restricted solely to industrial disputes likely to be resolved through the signing of a collective agreement: workers and their organisations should be allowed to express in a broader context, if they so wish, any dissatisfaction they may feel as concerns economic and social matters affecting their members' occupational interests [see nd Report, Case No.  (Ecuador) para. ; st Report, Case No.  (Tunisia), para. ]. The Committee is conscious that the fact of exercising a trade union activity or holding a trade union mandate does not imply any immunity from the ordinary penal legislation but it recalls that it is the responsibility of the Committee to verify itself whether the persons concerned have been arrested for common law offences or for trade union activities. In the present case, since the trade union leaders were arrested on several occasions and released after a few days' detention without any charge having been brought against them, the Committee considers it useful to point out to the Government that it should ensure that the authorities concerned have appropriate instructions to eliminate the danger of detentions being based on trade union activities [see th Report, Case No.  (India), para. ; Case No.  (Uruguay), para. ].
.As regards the allegations concerning the prohibition of the demonstration of  May, the Committee recalls that the right to organise public meetings and processions on  May is, as it has pointed out on several occasions, an important aspect of trade union rights. However, the Committee has also stressed that it is the responsibility of the Government as the guardian of public order to determine, in the exercise of its security powers, whether, in any given circumstances, even trade union demonstrations may jeopardise public order and security and to take the necessary preventive measures to circumvent this danger. However if, in order to avoid disturbances, the authorities decide to prohibit a meeting, they should, in the Committee's view, strive to come to an agreement with the organisers of the meeting in order to allow it to be held in some other place (perhaps on private premises) where there would be no fear of disturbances [see, for example, th Report, Case No.  (Mauritania), para.  and th Report, Case No.  (Turkey), para. ].
.As concerns the temporary occupation of the premises of several trade unions, the Committee considers that such an occupation may constitute a serious interference by the authorities in trade union activities. In the present case the Government claims that these temporary occupations were of a preventive nature and states that the premises are no longer occupied by the forces of order. However, the Committee wishes to stress the great importance which it attaches to the inviolability of trade union premises to guarantee freedom of association and trusts that the Government will take measures to avoid the repetition of such actions without a search warrant.
.In the circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions.(a) The Committee expresses its deep concern at the scope and seriousness of the allegations made in these cases and which concern the death and injury of several persons during trade union protest demonstrations against major increases in the cost of living.(b) As regards the violent deaths and injury of a number of persons, the Committee recalls the importance of carrying out a thorough inquiry to determine responsibilities so as to prevent a repetition of such actions; it requests the Government to inform it of the outcome of such an inquiry.(c) As concerns the arrests of trade union leaders and their subsequent release without any charge being brought against them, the Committee recalls that the Government should ensure that the authorities concerned have appropriate instructions to eliminate the danger of detentions being based on trade union activities.(d) As regards the temporary occupation of trade union premises, the Committee stresses the importance which it attaches to the inviolability of trade union premises to guarantee freedom of association and trusts that the Government will take appropriate measures to prevent the repetition of such action without a search warrant.(e) As concerns the prohibition of the demonstration on  May, the Committee recalls that the right to organise meetings and processions on  May is an important aspect of trade union rights and that the authorities should strive to come to an agreement with the organisers so as to allow the meeting or demonstration to be held normally.",0,1984,Dominican Republic
55,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the Unitarian Central of Workers (CUT) dated  July . The CUT sent additional information in a communication dated  August . The Government replied in a communication dated  December .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainant alleges that on  July , the National Police arrested Mario Robles (Secretary of the CUT), Osvaldo Cruz. (leader of the CUT Provisional Council in Santiago) and Bernardo Fernndez (Complaints and Disputes Secretary of the CUT) in the city of Santiago de los Caballeros; these persons were arrested whilst distributing information on their trade union organisation, in particular a bulletin of the Trade Union Council of the Free Trade Zone (affiliated to the CUT), and pamphlets referring to the Second Congress of this organisation in the industrial free trade zone of Santiago.
.The Government states that according to investigations carried out, the trade unionist Mario Robles Fortuna and his companions travelled from the capital city of the Dominican Republic to the industrial free trade zone of the Province of Santiago de los Caballeros, entered this industrial area without having received prior authorisation from the management and urged the employees to bring their work to a standstill so as to hear their discourse and receive pamphlets. The Government adds that in view of the disturbances caused by this type of action, the police, informed of the matter, briefly detained Mario Robles for questioning.
.The Government concludes by pointing out that it respects the right of freedom of association and strives continually to ensure that it is upheld and fulfilled.
.The Committee notes the Government's statements and, in particular that the CUT leader, Mr. Robles, was briefly detained for questioning by the police authorities because of the disturbances the latter and his companions had caused in the industrial free trade zone in the Province of Santiago, in urging the employees to bring their work to a standstill so as to listen to their discourse and receive pamphlets. The Committee notes that the Government's statements do not make it clear whether the other CUT leaders to which the complainant refers (Mr. Fernndez and Mr. Cruz) were arrested or not. The Committee also notes that, according to the Government, the three trade union leaders entered the above-mentioned industrial zone without having received prior authorisation from the management.
.In these circumstances, bearing in mind that the three trade union leaders carried out their propaganda activities and, interrupted the normal running of the undertaking during working hours without having received authorisation from the management and taking' into account that, according to the Government, Mr. Robles was briefly detained for questioning, the Committee considers this allegation need not be pursued. Nevertheless, since the Government indicates that one of the reasons for the detention of Mr. Robles was that he had not requested permission from the management of the industrial zone to enter it, the Committee would draw the Government's attention to the principle that workers' representatives should enjoy such facilities as may be necessary for the proper exercise of their functions, including access to workplaces.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this report and, in particular, to draw the Government's attention to the principle that workers' representatives should enjoy such facilities as may be necessary for the proper exercise of their functions, including access to workplaces.",0,1983,Dominican Republic
56,".The complaint is contained in a communication of the Unified Workers' Central of  March . The Government replied in a communication of  June .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Unified Workers' Central alleges in its communication of  March  that the Textiles K company, in order to avoid discussing the draft collective agreement submitted by the works union, and in order to destroy the union, did not renew the contracts of eight union leaders (Messrs. Ramn del Socorro Garca, Sergio Tulio Medina Len, Emenegildo Polanco, Narciso Trinidad, Juan de Dios Garca, Pedro Angoms, Vctor Hugo Medina and Genaro Rosario), and nine active members of the union (Messrs. Vicente Devorah, Zacaras Prez, Luis Germn, Sambay Matos, Bienvenido Amado Prez, Juan Escobozo, Vctor Lara, Jorge Ramrez and Rafael Bez). Of the afore-mentioned union leaders, four were members of the negotiating committee for the draft collective agreement.
.The complainant adds that the anti-union aims of the company are further evidenced by the fact that the company had promised to renew the contracts of all the workers, and that on  January  the owners divided the company into  phantom companies, each having from four to  workers.
.The Government states in its communication of  June  that, since , it has been the practice of the Textiles K company to sign one-year contracts with its workers, reserving the right to extend the contracts of any who so merit and to provide the legally prescribed severance pay to the others. The right of the company to act in this manner is recognised in section  of the Labour Code.
.The Government adds that the collective agreement in force also contains a clause empowering the company to terminate all labour contracts by  December of each year, at the latest, regardless of whether the worker is a union leader, by payment of the appropriate labour benefits.
.The Government further states that under the provisions of section  of the Labour Code, union leaders and members automatically cease to belong to the union upon termination of their contracts, by virtue whereof, there being no legal representatives, the company is not required to bargain collectively with an organisation that de facto does not exist.
.The Government indicates that the  companies to which the complainant refers have been legally incorporated and registered in accordance with the legislation in force.
.The Government concludes by indicating that the mediation undertaken by the Director-General for Labour for purposes of achieving an agreement to resolve the conflict was unsuccessful, and that it considers that there has been no violation of freedom of association in this case since the owners of the Textiles K company have exercised a lawful right.
.The Committee observes that the present case refers to the refusal of the Textiles K company to renew the contracts of eight union leaders and nine union members active in the union of that company for the alleged purpose of not discussing the draft collective agreement submitted by the union and in order to destroy the union.
.The Committee takes note of the statements of the Government in this respect, and in particular that, since , it has been the practice of the company to sign one-year contracts, extending these for persons who so merit, and that this is in accordance with the laws and the collective agreement in force.
.The Committee considers that, while the system of fixed-term contracts is not in itself objectionable from the standpoint of the principles of freedom of association, the application of this system in practice, and more particularly the real motive behind a refusal to extend a labour contract, should not be the trade union office, affiliation or activity of a given individual. In this respect the Committee observes that in the particular circumstances of the case there are serious reasons for considering that the refusal to extend the contracts in question constituted an act of anti-trade union discrimination. At no time has the Government referred to any economic difficulties faced by the company, or to professional faults committed by the parties involved, whereas the complainant has indicated that the refusal to extend the labour contracts involved a large number of union leaders and members in a relatively small company, that prior to the company's refusal to extend the labour contracts, the union had submitted a draft collective agreement, and that shortly after the refusal to extend the contracts, the owners of the company divided it into  companies, each with from four to  workers. It is important to note here that section  of the Labour Code, which applies to works unions among others, establishes that associations of employees shall not have less than  members.
.The Committee further recalls that recently it has had occasion to examine allegations of anti-union discrimination in the Dominican Republic and has had to emphasise the need to adopt provisions giving effective protection against acts of anti-union discrimination.  The Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has also made a statement to this effect.
.In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to take measures to bring about the speedy reinstatement of the  trade union leaders and members mentioned by the complainant, and to keep the Committee informed on this matter.
.Finally, the Committee takes note that according to the Government, by virtue of section  of the Labour Code (""when the employee leaves the undertaking, for whatever reason, he shall cease to be a member of the union""), union leaders and members automatically cease to belong to the union upon termination of their contracts, and, there being no legal representatives, the company is not required to bargain collectively with an organisation that de facto does not exist. The Committee considers that this provision is not consistent with the right of workers to join organisations of their own choosing (Article  of Convention No. ) and can give rise to acts of anti-union interference by the employer in a manner contrary to the provisions of Article  of Convention No. , especially in circumstances in which the company is empowered to terminate all labour contracts at the end of each year. The Committee emphasises the need for the Government to adopt provisions giving effective protection against acts of anti-union discrimination and interference, and draws the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to the legislative implications of the case.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present report and, in particular, the following conclusions:(a) The Committee requests the Government to take measures to bring about the speedy reinstatement of the  union leaders and members mentioned by the complainant, and to keep the Committee informed on the matter.(b) The Committee emphasises the need for the Government to adopt provisions giving effective protection against acts of anti-union discrimination and interference, and draws the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to the legislative implications of the case.",0,1983,Dominican Republic
57,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the General Workers' Federation dated  January . The Government replied in a communication dated  February .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainant alleges that the National Union of Workers in the National Institute for Water Resources (SINATRAINDRHI) and the National Institute for Water Resources (INDRHI) signed a collective agreement on  January , the clauses of which were not complied with months later by the new Director-General of the INDRHI appointed after the change of government. Faced with such a situation the trade union tried to find a solution by direct agreement and then through the mediation of the Secretary of State for Labour, which resulted in an agreement capable of putting an end to the dispute. However, the Director of the INDRHI withdrew his agents' authority and refused to sign the agreement, with the result that the trade union called a -hour work stoppage, without closure of the sluices, in the month of October , which did not affect the flow of water in the irrigation channels.
.The complainant states that the Government reacted to this stoppage in the following manner: the INDRHI was taken over by military forces; the trade union's activities were banned and the Secretary of State for Labour obtained the cancellation of its registration; the trade union was falsely accused of sabotage and of having carried out a strike with closure of the sluices; the check-off of trade union dues was stopped; the accumulated dues, the property of the trade union, were withheld; the members of the National Executive Committee and the Executive Boards of the  branches of the trade union as well as more than , union members were dismissed and workers were required to resign in writing from the union as a condition for working in the INDRHI.
.The complainant alleges, moreover, that since May  hundreds of workers in the Dominican Agrarian Institute (IAD) have been organised in the National Union of IAD workers (SIANTRIAD), which currently has  branches throughout the country. The complainant points out that the Secretary of State for Labour, in an official document dated  June  (which the complainant encloses), confirmed the ruling that workers in the IAD do not have the right to join a trade union.
.The Government states that basically the dispute between the National Union of Workers in the National Institute for Water Resources (SINATRAINDRHI) and the National Institute for Water Resources (INDRHI) had its origin in disagreements over the application of the collective agreement on working conditions existing between the parties.
.The Government adds that the SINATRAINDRHI committed a flagrant violation of the law (sections  and  of the Labour Code) in declaring an illegal strike in a public service of permanent utility such as provided by the INDRHI, whose principal function is to supply water to the whole country. Section  of the Code provides that no strike shall be permitted in public services of permanent utility and section  lists services for the supply of water as being one of these.
.The Government also states that as a consequence of the illegal strike declared by the SINATRAINDRHI acts of sabotage were detected in the water supply installations which led to orders being given for the intervention of the public forces in all the branches of the INDRHI with the view to safeguarding the installations and the supply of water. This intervention was of a transitory nature and has totally ceased.
.The Government points out that despite the serious situation indicated above, some of the most prominent trade union leaders have been reinstated in their jobs in the INDRHI as a result of talks held between the parties. The vast majority of the workers who had been dismissed by reason of the declaration of an illegal strike have also been reinstated.
.As regards the right of workers in the Dominican Agrarian Institute (IAD) to join a trade union, the Government declares that at no time has it refused to register the trade union actually functioning in the IAD and that the Secretary of State for Labour hopes that all the documents relating to the formation of the said trade union will be submitted so that he can proceed with the corresponding registration, as indicated to the trade union in an official communication dated  December  (which the Government encloses).
.As regards the measures taken by the authorities as a result of the -hour strike organised in October  by the SINATRAINDRHI in the National Institute for Water Resources, tile Committee notes that, according to the Government, strikes are not permitted in public services of permanent utility such as the services for the supply of water provided by tile aforementioned institute, that the intervention of the public forces in the branches of tile Institute was due to the discovery of acts of sabotage in the water supply installations, and that some of tile trade union leaders and the majority of the workers dismissed have been reinstated.
.While recognising that services for tile supply of water constitute an essential service in the strict sense of tile term (that is to say, a service whose interruption could endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population) in respect of which strike action may therefore be prohibited [see, for example, rd Report, Case No.  (Brazil), para ], the Committee wishes to point out that the measures taken by tile authorities to ensure the performance of essential services should not be out of proportion to the end pursued or lead to excesses and, in particular, acts of interference on the part of the authorities which would restrict the right of trade union organisations to organise their administration and activities in full freedom (Article  of Convention No. ).
.In tile light of this, tile Committee points out that the measures cited by the complainant, on which tile Government has not sent observations, are not justified from tile point of tile view of the principle expounded; these measures include, in particular, the prohibition of tile trade union's activities, tile cessation of tile check-off of trade union dues, tile withholding of dues accumulated by the trade union and the requirement that workers renounce their trade union membership in order to work in tile INDRHI. In view of tile fact that the allegations date back to , the Committee can only express regret at the measures adopted and hope that in the future similar measures will not be taken.
.The Committee also wishes to point out that the mass dismissal of strikers involves serious dangers of abuse and places freedom of association in grave jeopardy [see, for example, th Report, Case No.  (India), paragraph ].
.As regards the allegation that the Secretary of State for Labour considered that workers in tile Dominican Agrarian Institute (IAD) do not have the right to join a trade union, the Committee observes that according to what can be inferred from tile communication of  December  from the Secretary of State for Labour to the representatives of the trade union (in the process of formation) of tile IAD, the authorities have changed their attitude regarding the right of the aforementioned workers to join a trade union, and that tile Secretary of State for Labour is awaiting receipt of the documents necessary for the formation of tile trade union. The Committee expresses the hope that the said trade union will shortly be set up and requests the Government to keep it informed on this matter.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this report and in particular the following conclusions:(a) While recognising that services for the supply of water constitute an essential service in the strict sense of the term, in respect of which strike action may be prohibited, the Committee considers that some of the temporary measures taken by the authorities as a result of the strike called by the SINATRAINDRHI in October  (prohibition of the trade union's activities, cessation of the check-off of trade union dues, etc.) are contrary to the guarantees provided for in Article  of Convention No. . The Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that the measures taken by the authorities to ensure the performance of essential services should not be out of proportion to the end pursued or lead to excesses. The Committee therefore regrets that the measures were taken and hopes that similar measures will not be taken in the future.(b) The Committee draws the Government's attention to the principle that mass dismissal of strikers involves serious dangers of abuse and places freedom of association in grave jeopardy.(c) The Committee expresses the hope that, in view of the assurances given by the Government, the Union of Workers in the Dominican Agrarian Institute will shortly be able to be formed and requests the Government to",0,1983,Dominican Republic

.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainant alleges that, by virtue of resolution No. /, the Secretariat of State for Labour is interfering in the: internal activities of the unions to the advantage of the companies or the Government. A case of this kind has occurred with a view to imposing an ""accommodating"" executive on the Union of Hotels, Bars and Restaurants in La Romans (SIHOBARES) and the Sindicato de Costasur Dominicana S.A. In both cases, the electoral meetings (held respectively on  and  December ) took place in the presence of contingents of national police who impeded the holding of the elections on trade union premises, which took place within the companies' premises in violation of trade union rules. Section  (""All delegates to the general meetings must be members of the association"") and section  of the Labour Code (""No resolution adopted by the general meeting shall be valid unless the general meeting has been convened in the form and with the notice prescribed in the rules"") were also violated. Furthermore, no list was read out with the membership register and one or more of those elected to hold offices in the association were not members. The CUT points out that in the specific case of the elections in SIHOBARES no convening notice:. was issued and voters were prevented from participating on list No. .
.The complainant also alleges that the Secretariat of State for Labour refuses to give legal recognition to the Pan-American Trade Union of Security Guards, and the right to form a trade union is prohibited in the Free Trade Zones in the country.
.In addition, the complainant alleges the military occupation of the following companies: Fbrica Dominicana de Cemento, Rosario Dominicana, Naco Polyclinic, Corporacin Dominicana de Empresas Estatales, Fbrica de Aceites Vegetales Ambar, Hotel Jaragua, and the Guineero La Cruz-Manzanillo Project.
.Lastly, the complainant indicates that the industrial tribunals have still not been set up despite the fact that they are envisaged in the Labour Code.
.The Government states that the Pan-American Union of Security Guards was recognised by the Secretariat of State for Labour on  February  and that the Free Trade Zones are covered by special laws governing the conditions of their establishment and operations, which include production exclusively for export in order to challenge the existing competition in Latin America and the Caribbean.
.As regards the Naco Polyclinic, the National Medical Centre and the Hotel Jaragua (which, the complainant had alleged, had been occupied by the military), the Government states that this is not a matter concerning workers and management and even less trade unions. The medical centres referred to were subject to sequestration owing to debts running into millions contracted with the Reserve Bank of the Dominican Republic, which they were unable to settle despite having been given a number of years of grace to facilitate the payments concerned. In the case of the Hotel Jaragua there were flagrant violations of a contract with the Dominican State.
.The Government further states that the Rosario Dominicans undertaking is not nor ever has been occupied by the military and that at the La Cruz-Manzanillo Project, the presence of police was motivated solely by the setting up of check-points at the various exits to avoid the disappearance of fruit; moreover, as soon as it was able to do so, the undertaking replaced the police with its own employees.
.With respect to the Fbrica Dominicans de Cemento, the Government explains that measures were taken with a view to re-establishing normal production since, according to a technical study, only  workers were required, whereas the undertaking was employing over , workers and was losing millions annually. In view of this situation, armed groups formed in the undertaking opposing any changes aimed at improving its financial situation.
.Furthermore, the Government attaches a letter signed by the Secretary-General and the minutes writer of SIHOBARES, in which they indicate that the complainant organisation (the Unified Workers' Central) has no right to contest the elections held at SIHOBARES, and that the exclusion of the elements from list No.  in the elections was decided by the Electoral Committee, taking account of the fact' that a number of articles in the electoral regulations of the trade union rules had been infringed. The Government also attaches a letter signed by the management of the company concerned, explaining that the elections held at the Sindicato de Costasur Dominicana S.A., did not take place on premises belonging to the undertaking but at the place indicated by the Electoral Committee, and that the Secretary-General of the CUT seized the membership register of the Costasur Dominicans S.A. trade union to prevent workers from electing the new Executive Committee, because the members of the previous Executive Committee had drawn up a new list of members.
.Lastly, the Government indicates that it has placed a Bill before the Legislative Chambers, aimed at facilitating the operation of the industrial tribunals envisaged in the Labour Code.
.As regards the denial by the authorities of the right to organise to workers in certain undertakings, the Committee notes that the Secretariat of State for Labour recognised the Pan-American Trade Union of Security Guards on  February . The Committee nevertheless notes that the Government has not provided detailed information as regards recognition of the right to organise of workers in the Free Trade Zones, stating only that the latter are governed by special laws. In view of the lack of detail provided by the Government on this allegation, the Committee recalls that Convention No.  guarantees workers the right to establish organisations of their own choosing (Article ) and that only the armed forces and the police may be excluded from the right to organise (Article , paragraph ), which means that all the workers in the Free Trade Zones should have the right to establish and join trade union organisations. The Committee draws this aspect of the case to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.
.With respect to the allegation concerning the military occupation of undertakings, the Committee notes that the complainant organisation has not indicated the circumstances in which such military occupation occurred and has at no time stated that such measures were a result of trade union activities or had anti-union aims. In these circumstances, having regard to the explanations provided by the Government which reject the fact that the occasional presence of police in one undertaking or another is linked to trade union activities, the Committee considers that this allegation does not call for further examination.
.As regards the allegation concerning the intervention of the administrative authorities to impose an ""accommodating"" executive on SIHOBARES and Sindicato de Costasur Dominicana, the Committee notes that the complainant organisation has not provided any details concerning the nature of the alleged intervention by the administrative authorities, restricting itself to indicating the violation of the legal and statutory norms in the holding of the elections in the trade unions concerned in December . The Committee notes, furthermore, that the version given by the complainant organisation of the above-mentioned trade union elections conflicts on many points with the information contained in the letters and documents communicated by the Government. In these circumstances, the Committee is not in a position to come to any conclusions on the matter and, in particular, to determine whether this is, or is not, a purely inter-union matter. However, the Committee notes that the Government recognises that the industrial tribunals are still not functioning despite the fact that they are envisaged in the Labour Code. Accordingly, the Committee draws the Government's attention to the importance of the availability of legal procedures to the trade union organisations and their members, to which they may have recourse in cases of violation of trade union standards, and expresses the hope that the Bill on industrial tribunals will be adopted in the near future.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this report, in particular the following conclusions:(a) the Committee notes that the Government has not provided precise information on the recognition of the right of workers in the Free Trade Zones to organise. The Committee recalls that Convention No.  guarantees workers the right to establish organisations of their own choosing (Article ) and that only the armed forces and the police may be excluded from the right to organise (Article , paragraph ) so that all the workers in the Free Trade Zones should be able to establish and join trade union organisations. The Committee draws this aspect of the case to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations;(b)",0,1983,Dominican Republic

61,".The Committee examined this case at its November  meeting, when it reached a number of interim conclusions.
.The National Trade Union of Telephone Workers (SNTT) subsequently submitted new allegations in a communication dated  January . The Government replied in a communication dated  March .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.After examining the case at its November  meeting, the Committee requested the Government to supply further information as to the way in which the reduction of staff came about in the Dominican Telephone Company (CODETEL), which the undertaking claims was due to the installation of a direct dialling system, and drew its attention to the fact that the five dismissed trade union delegates, Carlos Luis Asuncin, Angely Toro, Dominga Lara, Bienvenido Michel and Daysi de Jimnez, ought to enjoy priority for reinstatement, as is provided for in the Workers' Representatives Recommendation,  (No. ).
.The Committee also requested the Government to send its observations on the allegations to which it had not replied, namely: the dismissal of the trade union leader Luis Polanco on the pretext of low production, the threats of dismissal against the SNTT executive committee, the ban on trade union leaders entering the so-called ""restricted areas"", the frequent refusal of time off for trade union matters, the transfer or moving of the trade union leaders Jos Luis Lara, Luis Gernimo and Donar Augusto Saillant on the pretext of poor performance, to gain experience, etc., the denial of access to CODETEL installations and property for one week to the trade union leader Jos Pichardo for organising a work stoppage of  minutes (subsequently denied by the workers) and the loss by full-time trade union leaders of the benefits granted by the Dominican Social Security Institute.
.In its communication dated  January , the SNTT alleges that CODETEL unlawfully withheld a week's wages as a result of the change from a weekly to a two-weekly system of payment (i.e., every other Friday) and dismissed over  workers, including the members of the union's executive committee and a number of union delegates, for refusing to allow the undertaking to steal their money. CODETEL accuses the union of calling a strike but, in fact, the undertaking itself closed its plants to prevent the workers from entering, as has been established by the Secretariat of State for Labour itself through a public notary.
.The complainant encloses a document issued by the Secretariat of State for Labour stating that the withholding of wages by CODETEL is contrary to article  of the Labour Code.
.With respect to the allegations still pending when the Committee examined the case at its November  meeting, the Government has submitted a communication from CODETEL drawing attention to the following points:- at the request of the trade union, the undertaking replaced employees who had indicated a desire to terminate their individual contracts by others who were keen to return to their jobs and who were in the group of  workers whose contracts had been terminated because of staff cuts following the introduction of a direct dialling system;- none of the dismissed union delegates who were offered the opportunity to take advantage of this exchange showed any interest in returning to the undertaking, indicating that they were satisfied with the compensation they had received;- at no time was in the undertaking's intention to eliminate the trade union;- the undertaking has created restricted areas that are off limits to all members of the staff who have no official business there; if union leaders wish to contact employees in those areas, they may do so through the procedures laid down in the collective agreement currently in force and in other provisions;- the dismissal of Luis Polanco was for low output and lack of dedication to his work in spite of the opportunities he was given to improve his performance, as documents signed by him in his file show; his dismissal was in no way connected with his trade union activities;- the transfers of unions leaders Lara, Gernimo and Saillant were carried out in accordance with the collective agreement currently in force, in which the union recognises that the undertaking ""retains and will retain in future exclusive control over all matters connected with the management, operation and administration of its business"";- the undertaking suspended the union leader Pichardo from entering its premises for a week for having conducted himself on the day prior to his suspension in a manner totally incompatible with elementary standards of politeness and decent upbringing and for having used provocative and aggressive language against the undertaking and his supervisors which could have been grounds for justifiable dismissal;- with regard to the exclusion of full-time trade union leaders from the Dominican Social Security Institute, the situation does not concern the undertaking but is the automatic result of the application of Social Security Act No. .
.With regard to the new allegations, the Government states that the dispute between the SNTT and CODETEL which originally gave rise to the allegations has been satisfactorily resolved, thanks to the untiring mediation of the Secretariat of State for Labour, in an agreement signed on  February .
.Under this agreement,  of the workers dismissed on  and  January  will not be reinstated in their jobs but will receive compensation in accordance with the law and the collective agreement currently in force. The remaining workers are to return to work on  March . The undertaking agrees specifically to reemploy  union leaders and delegates.
.As to the union leaders who will not be reinstated (Pichardo, Torres, Lara, Saillant, Gonzlez, Hernndez, Olivo, Terrero and Rodriguez), the agreement stipulates that, in addition to legal compensation, the undertaking will pay compensation for the period of their trade union immunity.
.The Committee notes the statements and explanations given by the Government regarding the various acts of anti-union discrimination alleged by the complainant. The Committee observes, in particular, that CODETEL offered the union delegates dismissed as a result of the introduction of a direct dialling system the opportunity to return to their jobs, that union leaders can contact employees working in the ""restricted areas"" although they must use the established procedures, and that union leader Luis Polanco was dismissed for reasons connected with his work.
.With regard to the allegations contained in the SNTT's communication of  January , the Committee notes with interest that the dispute between the SNTT and CODETEI over the charge in the system of payment of the workers and the mass dismissal of over  workers following their protests has been settled through the mediation of the Secretariat of State for Labour, in an agreement signed on  February . The Committee observes that the agreement provides for the reinstatement of all the dismissed workers except . The reinstated workers include  union leaders and delegates, but  union leaders have not been reinstated. However, the situation appears to have been accepted by the union since its agreement with CODETEL provides that the said union leaders will receive, in addition to legal compensation, compensation for the period of their trade union immunity.
.The Committee feels obliged to recall in this connection that it has on previous occasions considered cases of dismissal of union leaders in the Dominican Republic, and specifically involving CODETEL, from which it would appear that the legislation does not grant sufficient protection against acts of anti-union discrimination. As in its examination of Case No. , the Committee urges the Government to consider the adoption of legislation to give effective protection to trade union leaders and workers against dismissals made on the basis of their trade union activities.
.Finally, regarding, the allegations concerning the transfer of trade union leaders, the denial of access to the undertaking's premises for a week to union leader Jose Pichardo and the loss by full-time trade union leaders of certain unspecified benefits, the Committee observes that the information submitted by the complainant and by the Government does not provide it with sufficient facts to judge the situation. Nevertheless, the Committee recalls in general terms that no person should suffer any prejudice because of his trade union functions or for having exercised legitimate trade union activities.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this report and, in particular, to recall in general terms that no person should suffer any prejudice because of his trade union functions or for having exercised legitimate trade union activities and to urge the Government to consider the adoption of legislation to give effective protection to trade union leaders and workers against dismissals made on the basis of their trade union activities.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the National Trade Union of Telephone Workers (SNTT) of  February . The Government replied in a communication of  May . The SNTT sent further information in a communication of  July .
.The Dominican. Republic has ratified the Freedom",0,1982,Dominican Republic
62,"of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No.  ).
.The SNTT alleges in its communication of  February  that, on the twelfth of that month, the Dominican Telephone Company (CODETEL) carried out a mass dismissal of  operators in the Long Distance Calls Department, including the trade union delegates Carlos Luis Asuncin, Angely Toro, Dominga Lara, Bienvenido Michel and Daysi de Jimnez. According to the complainant, although the Company justifies these dismissals by referring to the economic crisis and the need to reduce labour costs, what it is really seeking is the destruction of the Union, as witnessed by the fact that, in contravention of article  of the collective agreement in force, it did not make the slightest effort to relocate the staff concerned in another department, that the list of persons dismissed did not take into account a large number of workers who had allegedly agreed to leave their jobs, accepting the benefits offered by the Company, and that  new supervisors had been appointed to the Department. The SNTT adds that the management of the CODETEL undertaking has stated publicly that it would dismiss the entire Union executive if a campaign were undertaken to obtain the reinstatement of the dismissed workers.
.In its communication of  July , the SNTT alleges that, in breach of the trade union immunity established in article  of the collective agreement, the trade union leader Luis Polanco, President of the Disciplinary Tribunal, was dismissed on the pretext of low production.
.The complainant adds that CODETEL forbids trade union leaders to enter so-called ""restricted areas"" and makes ""disciplinary reports"" on those who contravene this bar, and that it frequently refuses to grant time off for trade union matters.
.The SNTT points out, further, that on the pretext of poor performance, to gain experience, etc., Jos Luis Lara, Education Secretary, was transferred to the Administration Department, and Luis Gernimo, deputy member of the Union Committee, to the Stores Department, and also that Donar Augusto Saillant, International Affairs Secretary, was transferred to another work centre.
.The complainant also alleges that the undertaking denied Jos Pichardo, General Secretary of the union, access to CODETEL installations and property for a period of a week, arguing that he had organised a work stoppage of  minutes in the Department of Cable Construction; this, however, has been denied by the workers in the Department.
.Finally, the SNTT points out that, with the object of reducing the Union's activities to the minimum, CODETEL has arbitrarily and illegally made it impossible for full-time Union leaders to receive the benefits granted by the Dominican Social Security Institute by excluding them from the payroll on the basis of a supposed suspension of those leaders' contracts.
.The Government states in its communication of  May  that, because of the introduction of the direct dialling system, electronic exchanges need to be tended by only a minimum staff, and that this was why the Dominican Telephone Company (CODETEL) dispensed with the services of the workers it considered unnecessary, paying them the appropriate social benefits. The Government adds that, according to the CODETEL undertaking, because of the economic crisis it is experiencing, it has applied the second paragraph of article  of the collective agreement in force, whereby, if the relocation of the dismissed persons in another department of the Company is not practicable, it will pay the appropriate compensation. Moreover, the collective agreement in force has not been infringed as regards trade union immunity since this only covers trade union leaders.
.Finally, the Government states that the Union and the undertaking have the possibility of applying to the courts to settle disputes which arise in relation to the interpretation or application of the labour laws and collective labour agreements.
.The present complaint refers to various acts of antiunion discrimination or the placing of obstacles in the way of trade union activities which are alleged to have taken place at the CODETEL undertaking.
.With regard to the dismissal of  operators of the Long Distance Calls Department, including the trade union delegates Carlos Luis Asuncin, Angely Toro, Dominga Lara, Bienvenido Michel and Daysi de Jimnez, the Committee takes note that, according to the Government, the CODETEL undertaking dismissed workers because of the installation of the direct dialling system, which needs only a minimum staff to tend the electronic exchanges. The Committee also notes that the Government's statements indicate that it was not possible to relocate the dismissed persons in ether departments of the company and that those affected by this staff reduction will receive the appropriate compensation.
.The Committee notes, however, that the complainant asserts that not the slightest effort was made to relocate the dismissed persons in another department and places the dismissals in a context of anti-union discrimination, indicating in support of its assertion that the dismissals have fallen on five union delegates and that  new supervisors have been appointed in the department concerned. Since the Government has not sent its observations on the new appointments, the Committee does not rule out the possibility that the trade union status or activities of the five trade union delegates may have played a decisive role in the selection of the workers to be dismissed. In this respect, the Committee must recall that on previous occasions it has pointed out that while it does not fall within its competence to decide on the desirability of resorting to dismissals for economic or administrative reasons, acts of anti-union discrimination should not take place under the pretext of such circumstances, and also that protection against acts of anti-union discrimination is particularly necessary in the case of workers representatives. In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to supply further information as to the way in which the reduction of staff came about and calls the Government's attention to the fact that the five trade union leaders in question ought to enjoy priority for reinstatement, as provided for in the Workers Representatives Recommendation,  (No. ).
.Finally, the Committee notes that the Government has not replied to the allegations dating from February  relating to the dismissal of the trade union leader Luis Polanco, to the threats of dismissal to which the SNTT executive was subjected, the ban on trade union leaders entering so-called ""restricted areas"", the frequent refusal of time off for trade union matters, the transfer or moving of the trade union leaders Jos Luis Lara, Luis Gernimo and Donar Augusto Saillant, the denial of access to CODETEL installations and property for one week to the trade union leader Jos Pichardo and the loss by full-time trade union leaders of the benefits granted by the Dominican Social Security Institute. The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on these matters.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present interim report and, in, particular, the following conclusions;(a) With regard to the dismissal of operators of the Long Distance Call Department at the CODETEL company, including the trade union delegates Carlos Luis Asuncin, Angely Toro, Dominga Lara, Bienvenido Michel and Daysi de Jimnez, the Committee recalls that, while it does not fall within its competence to decide on the desirability of resorting to dismissals for economic or administrative reasons, acts of anti-union discrimination should not take place under the pretext of such circumstances, and that protection against acts of anti-union discrimination is particularly necessary in the case of workers representatives. The Committee requests the Government to supply further information as to the way in which the reduction of staff came about and draws the Government's attention to the fact that the five trade union leaders in question ought to enjoy priority for reinstatement, as is provided for in the Workers Representatives Recommendation,  (No. ).(b) With regard to the remaining allegations, the Committee notes that the Government has not replied to them and therefore requests it to send its observations on the dismissal of the trade union leader Luis Polanco, the threats of dismissal against the SNTT executive, the ban on trade union leaders entering the so-called ""restricted areas"", the frequent refusal of time off for trade union matters, the transfer or moving of the trade union leaders Jos Luis Lara, Luis Gernimo and Donar Augusto Saillant, the denial of access to CODETEL installations and property for one week to the trade union leader Jos Pichardo and the loss by full-time trade union leaders of the benefits granted by the Dominican Social Security Institute.",0,1982,Dominican Republic
63,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of Latin American Workers dated  January . The Government replied in a communication dated  March .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  January  the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of Latin American Workers (CPUSTAL) alleges that several representatives of central trade union organisations of Latin American countries, including Roberto Prieto, a member of the Executive Secretariat of CPUSTAL, were unable to attend the II Congress of the Central Organisation of workers which took place from  to  November  in Santo Domingo, because they had not been granted the necessary visas.
.The CPUSTAL further alleges that the Government prevented the trade union leader Maximiliano Moreno, who had been appointed by the Trade Unions international of Food, Tobacco, Hotel and Allied Industries (TUI) as reporter of the first Seminar on Trade Union Training for workers in the Hotel Industry of the Dominican Republic held from  to  December , from entering the country.
.In its communication dated  March , the Government states that there is no record of any application for a visa for the trade unionists Maximiliano Moreno and Roberto Prieto to attend the trade union meetings to which the complainant has referred. The Government adds that the standard it observes in this matter is to allow any citizen who meets the prescribed requirements to enter the country. Finally, the Government describes the complaint as unjust, defamatory and frivolous.
.The Committee notes that, according to the complainant, Maximiliano Moreno, Roberto Prieto and other representatives of central trade union organisations who were to participate in trade union meetings held in the Dominican Republic in November and December , were refused entry or denied an entry visa to that country.
.The Committee further notes that, according to the Government, there is no record of any application for a visa by the two trade unionists mentioned by the complainant, and that the standard observed by the Government is to allow any citizen who meets the prescribed requirements to enter the country.
.In these circumstances, in view of the discrepancy between the complainant's and the Government's versions regarding the alleged facts, and in view also of the fact that refusal to grant a visa or in general to deny entry to aliens wishing to enter its territory is the sovereign right of a State, the Committee cannot but recall the principle whereby the right of trade union organisations to become affiliated to international workers' organisations necessarily involves the right for both freely to maintain normal contact, the corollary of which is that the formalities to which trade union leaders and trade unionists are subject in seeking entry into the territory of a State should be based on objective criteria and in any case be free of any antitrade union discriminations
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this report and, in particular, the following conclusions regarding the allegations relating to the denial of entry or the refusal to grant a visa to representatives of central trade union organisations who were to participate in trade union meetings.The Committee, while recognising that the refusal to grant a visa or in general to deny entry to aliens wishing to enter its territory is the sovereign right of a State, recalls that the formalities to which trade union leaders and trade unionists are subject in seeking entry into the territory of a State should be based on objective criteria and in any case be free of any antitrade union discrimination.",0,1982,Dominican Republic
64,".The complaint is contained in a communication of the Workers' Trade Union Autonomous Federation (CASC) dated  June . The Government furnished its reply in a letter dated  August .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Workers' Trade Union Autonomous Federation alleges that workers of the Los Minas textile undertaking are confronted with a serious situation infringing freedom of association:  workers have not received their wages for the last six weeks and several workers have been imprisoned and beaten.
.The Government points out that the Secretariat of State for Labour is determined to find a solution to the problem of the payment of wages overdue and that discussions are continuing with the management of the undertaking with a view to resolving this problem as soon as possible.
.The Government also states that persons were taken into protective custody as a result of clashes which occurred in the public thoroughfare between workers and persons from outside the undertaking on the one hand and officers of the National Police on the other. Furthermore, the Government adds that no worker is currently being held in prison as a result of these clashes and that according to investigations which have been carried out, no one has been beaten.
.The Committee notes that the present complaint does not refer to precise cases involving the infringement of trade union rights, but simply to allegations of a generic nature concerning the infringement of freedom of association. The Committee also notes that the complainant has not made use of the procedural right to present additional information.",0,1981,Dominican Republic
65,".The complaint is contained in a communication dated  June  from the Sole Confederation of Workers. The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  August .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Sole Confederation of Workers alleges that Nelson Rafael Minaya was dismissed from his job as a result of his recent election as executive member of this trade union Confederation and for having requested a wage increase of  per cent, in accordance with the terms of the preliminary draft of the collective agreement which will shortly be discussed between the Cartonera Dominicana Corporation and the trade union of this undertaking, of which Mr. Minaya is Secretary-General. The complainant adds that the undertaking has thus violated the provisions of sections  and  of the Labour Code and Conventions Nos.  and .
.The Government states that the dismissal of Nelson Rafael Minaya constitutes an infringement of the collective agreement concluded between the undertaking and the trade union, but should not be confused with an infringement of freedom of association. The Government adds that in the event of an infringement of the clauses of a collective agreement it is for the courts to assess the scope and consequences of such infringements and to determine whether any guilt can be assigned.
.As the Committee has already pointed out in other cases, national legislation which enables employers' on condition that they pay the compensation prescribed by law for cases of unjustified dismissal to dismiss a worker does not give sufficient protection against anti-trade union discrimination, since it enables an employer on condition that he pays the compensation prescribed by law, to dismiss any member of his staff, for trade union or other activities, the public authorities being powerless to prevent him from doing so. Protection is particularly desirable in the case of trade union officials because in order to be able to perform their trade union duties in full independence they must have the guarantee that they will not be prejudiced on account of the mandate which they hold from their trade unions. This guarantee is also necessary to secure respect for the principle that workers' organisations have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom,
.In the present case, the Committee notes that the Government has at no time referred to any serious misconduct on the part of the trade union leader, Mr. Minaya, nor has it raised any objections to the allegation that Mr. Minaya was dismissed on the grounds of his trade union activities; on the contrary the Government has in its references to Mr. Minaya described his dismissal as an infringement of the collective agreement in force. The Committee also notes that section  of the Labour Code of the Dominican Republic authorises dismissal without just cause on condition that the employer pays the compensation prescribed by the law and that section  imposes only small fines in the event of an infringement of the provisions which establish protection against acts of trade union discrimination. The Committee therefore draws the attention of the Government to the principles set forth in the preceding paragraph and requests it to consider the adoption of legislation to give effective protection to trade union leaders and workers against dismissals made on the basis of their trade union activities, and more specifically to take steps with a view to reinstating the trade union leader Nelson Rafael Minaya, in his workplace. In addition it would draw the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to this aspect of the case.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present report and, in particular, the following conclusions:The Committee draws the attention of the Government to the fact that legislation which authorises the dismissal without just cause of trade union leaders and workers on condition that they are paid the compensation prescribed by law, does not give sufficient protection against acts of anti-union discrimination. It accordingly draws this aspect of the case to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.The Committee requests the Government to consider the adoption of legislation to give effective protection to trade union leaders and workers against dismissals made on the basis of their trade union activities and more specifically, to take steps with a view to the reinstatement of the trade union leader, Nelson Rafael Minaya, in his workplace.",0,1981,Dominican Republic
66,".The Committee examined this case at its meeting in November , when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body.
.The Government subsequently submitted its observations in a communication dated  March .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations which remained pending concern the strike by workers in the National District Municipal Council, during which, according to the complainant, dozens were injured and hundreds of persons were arrested. The complainant added that hundreds of workers had been dismissed for having exercised their legitimate right to strike.
.The Government replied that the strike was undertaken in disregard of the requisite procedure established by the legislation and that the authorities took no repressive action against the workers. The Government also stated that the strikers were involved in violent street clashes and that they obtained the allocation of a state subsidy, which had been the principal claim on which the strike was based. Referring to various strikes, including that of the municipal workers, the Government added that the resolute and unequivocal intervention of the labour authorities prevented the undertakings from proceeding to dismiss hundreds of workers on the basis of their illegal acts.
.The Committee noted the information supplied by the Government and requested it to send more detailed observations on these allegations.
.In its communication dated  March , the Government states that the persons referred to by the complainant as having been wounded and arrested during the strike carried cut by workers of the National District Municipal council are not in fact municipal employees, but are persons who have infiltrated the workers in order to provoke disorders with the obvious intention of seriously disrupting public order. The Government adds that, in spite of this, the persons arrested were later released.
.The Government further states that, notwithstanding the illegal nature of the strike of the workers of the National District Municipal Council, they were all reinstated in their jobs.
.The Committee notes the information supplied by the Government and, in particular, the fact that the persons referred to by the complainant as being wounded and arrested during the strike carried out by the workers of the National District Municipal Council did not belong to that institution, but that they were persons who had infiltrated the workers in order to provoke disturbances and disrupt public order. The Committee notes with interest that the persons arrested were later released and that, notwithstanding the illegal nature of the strike, all the workers dismissed were reinstated in their jobs. The Committee therefore considers that the case does not call for further examination.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that the case does not call for further examination.
.The complaint is contained in a communication dated  May  from the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of Latin American Workers (CPUSTAL). The Government sent its observations in communications dated  and  August .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.CPUSTAL alleges that in the last months of  and the first quarter of  industrial action, work stoppages and strikes by workers demanding wage increases and protesting against the high cost of living occurred in the State and free trade area undertakings, the multinational undertaking Falconbridge, the Metaldom undertaking, Ingenios Porvenir, Santa Fe, Quisquea and Esperanza, AGROMAN, CODAL and in the Tabaqueros de TAMBORIL undertaking.
.The complainant adds that the strike by the municipal workers, the doctors' strike and the strike by workers of the National District City Council were harshly suppressed and that the last-mentioned strike resulted in four deaths, with dozens of injured persons and hundreds of arrests.
.The complainant adds that hundreds of workers have been dismissed for having exercised their legitimate right to strike.
.Finally, CPUSTAL alleges that although a request had been made more than six weeks in advance, Concepcin de Oliveira was refused an entry visa into the country to represent CPUSTAL at the Congress of the Sole Confederation of Workers (CUT), affiliated to CPUSTAL, which was held on  and  April  and that a list is maintained at the Santo Domingo airport including  trade union leaders of several American countries who are to be refused entry into the Dominican Republic, including Rodolfo Prieto, a member of the Executive Secretariat of CPUSTAL, who has never been in this country.
.The Government states that the industrial action to which CPUSTAL refers was undertaken in disregard of the requisite procedure established by the legislation and that the authorities took no repressive action against the workers involved in these incidents. The Government adds that in many cases the resolute and unequivocal intervention of the labour authorities was beneficial to the workers and resulted in the signature of collective agreements in some of the undertakings mentioned by CPUSTAL, in particular in the state sugar production sector, and thereby prevented the undertakings from proceeding to dismiss hundreds of workers on the basis of their illegal acts.
.With regard to the strike in the National District Municipal Council, the Government states that the workers were involved in violent street clashes and that they obtained the allocation of a state subsidy, which was the principal motive of the strike. As regards the deaths which allegedly took place, the Government denies that four persons lost their lives and states that what in fact happened was that Sergeant Hilario Mrquez Miliano of the National Police, who was a member of the patrol sent to maintain public order and protect private property, disobeyed the instructions of his superiors and fired on the workers, causing injuries which resulted in the death of Marcelino Vega Peguero, a Journalist, and Manuel de Jess Ciprin Valdez, a paper boy. The Government adds that Hilario Mrquez Miliano - the policeman - was found guilty of murder and sentenced to  years of hard labour by the judicial authorities on  May .
.Finally, the Government states that an application for a visa was received from an alien who is prohibited from entering the country and that insufficient information is at its disposal to determine if Roberto Prieto fulfils the necessary conditions under legislation currently in force to be able to enter the country.
.The Committee notes the statement by the Government that the strike by the workers of the National District Municipal Council led to the death of the journalist and a newspaper boy and that the person responsible for these deaths - a policeman - was found guilty of murder by the judicial authorities and sentenced to  years' hard labour.
.The Committee also notes that according to the Government, the authorities have not taken any repressive action against the workers and that in most of the conflicts to which the complainant refers, benefits have accrued to the workers as a result of the intervention of the labour authorities which led to the signature of collective agreements in several undertakings and prevented the undertakings from proceeding to dismiss hundreds of workers on the basis of their illegal acts.
.As regards the list of  foreign trade union leaders who are allegedly prohibited from entering the country and the refusal to grant an entry visa to a trade union leader of CPUSTAL who was to represent this organisation at a trade union congress in the Dominican Republic, the Committee, although recognising that the refusal to grant a visa or, in general, to deny entry to aliens wishing to enter its territory is the sovereign right of a State, must recall the principle that the right of trade unions to affiliate with international workers' organisations necessarily involves the right of national trade union organisations freely to maintain normal contact with the international organisations of workers to which they are affiliated, the corollary of which is that the formalities to which trade union leaders and trade unionists are subject in seeking entry into the territory of a State should be based on objective criteria and in any case be free of any anti-trade union discrimination.
.Finally, the Committee notes that the Government has not yet replied to all the questions raised by the allegation concerning the suppression of the strike by workers in the National District Municipal Council - during which, it was alleged, dozens were injured and hundreds taken prisoner -, nor to the allegation concerning the dismissal of hundreds of workers for having exercised the right to strike. The Committee requests the Government to transmit its observations on the matter.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:The Committee notes that the policeman responsible for the death of two persons during the strike by workers of the National District Municipal Council has been sentenced to  years' imprisonment.Although the Committee recognises that the refusal to grant a visa or in",0,1981,Dominican Republic
67,"general to deny entry to aliens wishing to enter its territory are matters concerning the sovereign right of a State, it must recall the principle whereby the right of trade unions to affiliate with international workers' organisations necessarily involves the right of national trade union organisations freely to maintain normal contacts with the international organisations of workers to which they are affiliated.The Committee requests the Government to send detailed observations on the allegations concerning the dismissal of hundreds of workers for having exercised the right to strike and the suppression of the strike by workers in the National District Municipal Council, during which, according to the complainant, dozens were injured and hundreds of persons were arrested.",1,1981,Dominican Republic
68,".The Committee examined this case at its meeting in November  and submitted an interim report to the Governing Body.
.The Government subsequently submitted its observations in a communication dated  March .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.When the case was examined by the Committee at its meeting in November , the allegation concerning the dismissal of Mr. Jess Fernndez, press and propaganda officer of the National Trade Union of Telephonic Workers (SNTT), remained pending.
.The complainant had alleged that the Dominican Telephone Company (CODETEL), in violation of the provisions on trade union immunity, dismissed Jess Fernndez on  November  for having ""discredited"" the company. The Government replied that, according to CODETEL, Jess Fernndez was dismissed for statements which he had made to the press claiming that the company was electronically recording users' calls and for having used insulting language against various of the company's managers in violation of the Labour Code. This allegation had been denied by the union and the case was before the courts to determine whether or not the dismissal was justified. In view of the conflicting versions of events contained in the allegations and in the Government's reply, the Committee requested the latter to send it the text of the judgement handed down.
.In its communication dated  March  the Government states that the proceedings brought by Jess Fernndez against CODETEL for unjustified dismissal were dropped. The Government adds that the company and the person concerned reached a settlement under which, inter alia, the latter was paid the relevant benefits under the labour law.
.The Committee notes the Government's statement concerning the allegation of dismissal of Jess Fernndez, press and propaganda official of the SNTT. The Committee notes that CODETEL and Jess Fernndez have been able to reach a settlement under which, inter alia, the latter was-paid the relevant benefits under the labour law. In view of the fact that the parties have reached a settlement the Committee considers that the allegations made on this aspect of the case do not call for further examination.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that the case does not call for further examination.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the National Trade Union of Telephonic Workers (SNTT) dated  November . The Government replied in a communication dated  February .
.At its May  Session, the Committee decided to transmit the main points of the Government's reply to the complainant for its comments. The SNTT supplied its comments in a communication dated  July , which was forwarded to the Government. The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  October .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The SNTT alleges that on  October , on the eve of negotiating a new collective agreement between the Dominican Telephone Company (CODETEL) and the SNTT, the company published a statement in the press to the effect that action would be taken against a small group of persons illegally using telephone equipment for long-distance calls. The complainant adds that the denunciation contained an indirect allusion to the workers dismissed on  October and that the purpose behind the company's action was to refuse to discuss the new collective agreement and to create circumstances propitious for breaking up the union.
.The complainant also adds that on  November , when union members had gathered to hear their leaders' reports on the negotiations for reinstating the dismissed workers, the police appeared and without warning assaulted the workers, beating . The police also arrested  workers, including various trade union officers. One of them, Jests Fernndez, the union's press and propaganda officer, was, in violation of the provisions on trade union immunity, dismissed on  November  for having ""discredited"" the company.
.Lastly, the complainant states that the company has no intention of continuing to pay union leaves and wishes to compel the union to sign new terms much inferior to those contained in previous collective agreements.
.The Government states that, according to the company, Mr. Jess Fernndez was dismissed for statements he had made to the press claiming that CODETEL was electronically recording users' calls and for having used insulting language against various of the company's managers in violation of the Labour Code. This allegation has been denied by the union and the case is before the courts to determine whether or not the dismissal was justified.
.Regarding the dismissal of other workers for reasons of service, the Government states that, according to the Department of Traffic, the persons dismissed were involved in illegal traffic of long-distance calls, an allegation which has also been denied by the union.
.Concerning the alleged assaults by the National Police, the Government states that it has no precise information on such events and that the intervention of the police was preventive action intended to maintain public order. The Government had succeeded in advancing the negotiations for concluding a new collective agreement prior to the date provided for in the existing agreement and for reinstating a number of the dismissed workers, as the company had been requested to do by the union, and the police, without disregarding the principles established by the Constitution, proceeded to disperse the pickets only in order to prevent unfortunate clashes. The Government adds that no person is being held in custody in connection with this case.
.In its last communication, the Government states that CODETEL and the SNTT have already approved most of the provisions of the new collective agreement, including a clause providing for unpaid full-time leave for two to three years for trade union leaders to allow them to attend to union business.
.The Committee notes that on  October  the company CODETEL published a statement in the press to the effect that action would be taken against a group of workers for illegally using telephone equipment for long-distance calls and that on the same day it dismissed various workers. The Committee considers, however, that the complainant, by mentioning such facts without giving further particulars, has failed to bring out any relation between those facts and the aims allegedly pursued by the company (to refuse to discuss the collective agreement and create circumstances propitious for breaking up the union), especially as the dismissed workers, according to the Department of Traffic, were involved in illegal traffic of long-distance calls. In these circumstances, the Committee considers that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.
.In connection with the dismissal of the trade union leader Jests Fernndez, the Committee notes that a case is pending before the courts to determine whether the dismissal was justified or not. In view of the contradiction between the complainant's allegations and the Government's reply on this matter, the Committee requests the Government to send it the text of the judgement handed down in this respect so that it can examine this allegation in full knowledge of the facts.
.With respect to the allegation concerning police intervention during the trade union meeting held on  November  for purposes of information, which allegedly resulted in the beating of  persons and the arrest of , including various union leaders, the Committee notes that the Government, while not expressly denying that persons were beaten or arrested, has stated that no one is being held in custody in connection with this case, that it has no precise information on the assaults, that the police intervention was preventive action, and that the police dispersed the pickets in order to avoid unfortunate clashes.
.In view of the fact that the complainant's and the Government's versions of the circumstances surrounding the police intervention differ and that the information available is insufficient to determine with certitude whether that intervention was warranted by a real danger to public order and not merely a hypothetical one, the Committee can only recall that freedom from government interference in the holding and proceedings of trade union meetings constitutes an essential element of trade union rights and that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede its exercise, unless public order is disturbed thereby or its maintenance seriously and imminently endangered.
.Lastly, the Committee notes that CODETEL and the SNTT have already approved most of the provisions of the new collective agreement, including a clause providing for unpaid full-time union leave for the union's leaders.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report, in particular the following conclusions:The Committee recalls that freedom from government interference in the holding and proceedings of trade union meetings constitutes an essential element of trade union rights and that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which may restrict this right or impede its exercise, unless public order is disturbed thereby or its",0,1980,Dominican Republic

70,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the General Central of Workers dated  July . The Government has replied in a communication dated  September .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The General Central of workers alleges that mass dismissals of state-employed teachers have taken place and that those affected include more than  officials and active members of the Dominican Teachers' Association.
.The Government states that the Secretariat of State for Education has not ordered mass dismissals, but that as a result of a ration-wide reorganisation of the public education system it has suspended from their duties a total of  members of the teaching staff whose files attest to their having committed serious misdemeanours in the performance of their functions.
.The Government states that it is the executive's responsibility to decide whether to terminate the contracts of employment of suspended employees after examining their files and the recommendations of the Secretary of State for Education in this connection. With this end in view, continues the Government, the suspended employees have been invited to discuss in a personal interview the accusations made in their files. As a result, some of the persons whose contracts had been suspended have already been reinstated in their posts, while the review of the remaining cases continues.
.The Committee has expressed the opinion on earlier occasions, within the context of Article  of Convention No. , ratified by the Dominican Republic, that it is not incumbent upon it to comment on the problem of breach of employment contract by dismissal, except in cases of dismissal as an act of anti-union discrimination. In this connection the Committee notes that the complainant has referred to mass dismissals of State-employed teachers, including more than  trade union officials, without furnishing any details as to the circumstances of these dismissals or specifying the names and trade union functions of the persons whose employment contracts are said to have been suspended. The Committee also notes that the Government states that there have been no mass suspensions of employment contracts, but that, under a plan for the reorganisation of the education system, the contracts of persons with a record of serious misdemeanours have been suspended. The Committee further observes that each of the cases of suspension is being reviewed individually, some of the persons concerned having already been reinstated while the review of the remaining cases is continuing.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further consideration.",0,1980,Dominican Republic
71,".The complaint is contained in two communications from the United Workers Trade Union Movement (MOSUO) dated  June and  July  respectively. The Government sent in its observations in a letter dated  August .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), as well as the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No.  ).
.In its communications MOSUO refers to acts of violence occurring during a drivers' strike, which began on  May and lasted for a week, to protest against what the complainant considered to be an excessive increase in the price of petrol. The complainant alleges that several trade union leaders including Hilario Henriquez and Mario Robles Fortuna, Secretary-General and Organising Secretary respectively of their trade union federation, were arrested; that the trade union headquarters were occupied by the military forces; that the suppression of the strike led to the death of three persons and the injury of  others (at least  of them by gunfire) and that the number of persons arrested exceeded ,, many of whom were brutalised by the military and police forces.
.In its reply the Government indicates that the strike was declared without undertaking any form of dialogue with the competent authorities and that it was widely exploited by anarchists and terrorist groups, who proceeded to burn vehicles, throw stones, and exchange gunfire, etc.; this resulted in the killing of one policeman and ore civilian.
.With regard to the arrests of Hilario Henriquez and Mario Robles Fortuna, the Government states that the arrests were made when the persons in question were engaged in non-union activities and that the police were at the time unaware of their trade union status. In any case they were released immediately after questioning. All those arrested have likewise been released. Furthermore, financial compensation has been granted to the workers to cover the cost of the increase in the price of petrel. The Government also asserts that the trade union headquarters were not occupied by the military forces and that the drivers went back to work.
.The Government points out that the deaths of civilians and soldiers which were reported by MOSUO occurred either during isolated actions which resulted from skirmishes between armed civilians and the forces of law and order or as a result of actions brought about by the same groups of vandals referred to above.
.The Committee notes the statement of the Government that the two trade union leaders, Hilario Henriquez and Mario Robles Fortuna, as well as all those who were arrested during the drivers' strike of May , have been released. It also notes that the drivers returned to work and received financial compensation from the Government.
.The Committee observes that the information supplied by the Government confirms the gravity of the events which took place during the above-mentioned drivers' strike, which resulted in armed skirmishes in which several persons lost their lives and others were injured. In similar cases of disturbances which have involved the loss of human lives, the Committee has emphasised that the institution by the Government concerned of an independent inquiry is a particularly appropriate method of elucidating the facts and determining responsibilities. In the present case, the Committee considers it necessary for the Government to indicate whether such an inquiry has been initiated and, if so, to inform the Committee of its results.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note that the trade union leaders, Hilario Henriquez and Mario Robles Fortuna, as well as all other persons arrested during the drivers' strike which began on  May, were subsequently released;(b) to deplore the seriousness of the incidents which occurred during the above-mentioned drivers' strike and to request the Government to indicate whether an inquiry has been initiated to determine responsibilities in respect of these deaths and, if so, to inform the Committee of its findings.",0,1980,Dominican Republic
72,".The complaint of the General Central of Workers (CGT) of the Dominican, Republic is contained in telegrams dated ,  and  January . The Government furnished a reply by a communication dated  March .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.It its communication the CGT alleges that the Government refuses to pay the sugar workers the bonuses due to them or accede to their demands, that it has dismissed over , workers and that it runs workplaces along military lines. The CGT also alleges that its General Secretary, Francisco Antonio Santos, has been arrested.
.The Government observes that bonuses are awarded to the employees of an undertaking when that undertaking shows a profit at the end of its financial year, and that this has not been the case with the State Sugar Board, under whose authority the state sugar workers operate, since it has suffered losses of more than  million Dominican pesos, thus it is released from its obligation to pay bonuses. The Government adds that nevertheless the State Sugar Board, under an agreement signed by the majority of the union leaders in the sugar industry, who had formed a Co-ordinating Committee for the Sugar Trade Unions, agreed to pay the workers  days' wages as an advance on future bonuses. According to the Government this agreement was violated by the employees of three of the state sugar works when they called a strike which was ruled to be illegal by the Court of Appeal of San Pedro de Maccris. As a result, the managements of the sugar works in question, exercising the powers vested in them by the Labour Code to meet such circumstances, terminated the contracts of hundreds of sugar workers. Subsequently, by order of the President of the Republic, all these workers were reinstated in their posts with the exception of a minority whose reinstatement has been left in abeyance while their cases are examined by the officials of the State Sugar Board. As concerns the arrest of Francisco Antonio Santos, the Government states that he was taken into preventive custody for the purpose of interrogation, but was released immediately by order of the President of the Republic himself, at the request of the labour authorities.
.The Committee notes the Government's observations concerning the sugar workers' dispute and the fact that the majority of the dismissed workers have been reinstated in their posts. The Committee recalls that in previous cases where it has examined allegations of dismissals arising out of strikes it has considered that such measures involve serious risks of abuse and serious threats to freedom of association. It has also expressed the view on such occasions that the development of labour relations could be impaired as the result of an inflexible attitude being adopted in the application of excessively severe sanctions to workers who participate in strike action. In view of these considerations the Committee is of the opinion that it would be particularly desirable for the Government to take steps to facilitate the reinstatement of the workers who have not been re-established in their jobs, and would like to be kept informed of the action taken to deal with their cases.
.The Committee notes the information supplied by the Government to the effect that the arrest of the trade unionist Francisco Antonio Santos was a preventive measure for the purpose of interrogation and that he was released immediately by order of the President of the Republic himself.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:",0,1980,Dominican Republic
73,".The complaint of the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) appears in a communication of  August . The Government replied by a letter of  October .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.WCL states that a ""Drivers' Combat Unit"", consisting of transport workers, requested the Government to countermand the increase in petrol prices, which rose from $. to $. on  July . On  August, after all conciliation procedures had been exhausted, a strike was called, paralysing the transport system in the major towns of the country. The strikers were supported, continues the complainant, by thousands of workers at a solidarity demonstration in Santo Domingo, but the police and groups of armed civilians opened fire on the workers, killing  persons and injuring ;  persons are said to have been arrested.
.The Government replies that, owing to the increases in the price of petroleum, which have affected the economies of all non-producer countries, particularly developing countries like the Dominican Republic, it was forced to raise the price of petrol and petroleum derivatives, as has been done in all countries. These price increases were unpopular with the national drivers' organisations, it adds, and provoked reactions which showed little understanding of the economic situation of the country. The Government had nevertheless adopted compensation measures in favour of the drivers, including social security measures, a monthly wage of  pesos, and housing plans, etc.
.The Drivers' Combat Unity Committee, continues the Government, unexpectedly called a strike of public transport workers, demanding that the Government take a series of measures, most of which were unconnected with trade union objectives; on the contrary, they represented the programme of a political party. The Government also states that strikes of this kind are expressly forbidden by sections  and  of the Labour Code, and that the transport of passengers and goods is regarded as a public service which must remain uninterrupted.
.At no time, continues the Government, was there a demonstration of the kind described it the complaint, but the strike which had been so unexpectedly called was characterised by organised violence, particularly in Santo Domingo. There were also lightning commando strikes by groups unconnected with the transport sector, who overturned and burned vehicles and disappeared into the suburbs of the towns when the forces of order appeared. It may therefore be presumed, considers the Government, that the protest against the increase in the price of petrol was merely a cover-up for activities to destabilise the present regime and upset the process for granting broad guarantees in the field of human rights.
.According to the Government, the civilian groups were responsible for the shootings, which resulted in three deaths and a number of injuries; these were, however, isolated incidents in which the forces of order and the public authorities did not participate in any way. The Government suspects that these acts were part of the above-mentioned destabilisation plan. Nobody from the transport sector in general was being held in the prisons of the country, adds the Government, and nobody from the Drivers' Combat Unity Committee; although the forces of order apprehended certain persons as they were committing acts of vandalism, these persons were not connected with any occupational organisation.
.The Committee has already pointed out, in examining earlier cases concerning the Dominican Republic, that the right to strike is ore of the essential means by which workers and their organisations may promote and defend their occupational interests. This consideration applies, however, only in so far as strikes are conducted peaceably, without violence or attacks on persons or property and, above all, without degenerating into riots. In the present case, the strike was accompanied by serious incidents, ending in the deaths of a number of persons. According to the Government, groups of civilians were responsible for the killings. The Committee can only express its concern at these incidents. In many cases involving the loss of lives of trade unionists the Committee has stressed the reed to carry out a full and impartial inquiry in order to elucidate the facts and determine responsibilities. In the present case, however, no details have been supplied of the identity or the trade union membership of the victims.
.The Committee also notes the Government's statement that no transport worker, in particular no member of the Drivers' Combat Unity Committee or an occupational organisation, was among the persons apprehended while committing acts of vandalism.
.Finally, the Committee notes that section  of the Labour Code includes transport among the sectors in which strikes are forbidden. In the cases relating to the Dominican Republic mentioned earlier, the Committee stressed that restrictions or prohibitions on the right to strike were compatible with the principles of freedom of association only under certain conditions (in particular the existence of adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures) and provided that the services were essential in the strict sense of the term. The Committee considers that transport does not generally fall within this category, namely services whose interruption would endanger the existence or well-being of the whole or part of the population.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to deplore the seriousness of the incidents (especially the loss of human lives) which occurred on the occasion of the strike of transport workers and to stress the importance of conducting a full and impartial inquiry in such cases;(b) to take note of the Government's statement that no transport worker and no member of an occupational organisation was among those arrested;(c) generally to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that restrictions or prohibitions on the right to strike in essential services are not compatible with the principles of freedom of association, save in the case of services which are essential in the strict sense of the term and only under certain conditions and guarantees.",0,1979,Dominican Republic
74,".Since  the Committee has had before it numerous complaints of violation of freedom of association in the Dominican Republic. These complaints come from the following workers' organisations: World Confederation of Labour (WCL), World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), International Metalworkers' Federation (IMF), World Federation of Teachers' Unions, General Workers' Federation, National Federation of Dockworkers, Stevedores' Union (POASI), National Union of Heavy Machinery Operators (SINOMAPE), and National Union of Telephone Workers (SNTT). They are dealt with in Cases Nos. , , , ,  and .
.The Committee examined Case No.  in May and November  and at each of these sessions presented conclusions to the Governing Body. The Committee submitted further conclusions to the Governing Body (on Cases Nos. , , ,  and ) in May . Finally, it examined all the outstanding cases relating to the Dominican Republic in November  and May .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In May  the Committee considered that the information at its disposal seemed insufficient to enable it to reach conclusions regarding the substance of the various issues raised. It had already examined, on several occasions, cases concerning the Dominican Republic which contained allegations similar to those made in the cases under examination. In these circumstances it considered that it would be very useful to apply the direct contacts procedure. The Governing Body accordingly requested the Government to consider the possibility of giving its consent to the carrying out of a study in the Dominican Republic of the facts surrounding the complaints by a representative of the Director-General.
.This request was repeated on a number of occasions. In addition, new complaints were presented which, like the earlier ones, contained a variety of serious allegations. Since no detailed reply had been received by May , the Committee had been obliged to formulate its conclusions on the cases in its th Report. However, the new Dominican Government constituted after the elections in May  accepted direct contacts by letter of  September .
.The Director-General appointed Mr. Jean-Michel Servais, an official of the Freedom of Association Branch of the International Labour Standards Department, to represent him during this mission. The visit to the country took place from  to  November , and a report on the mission was submitted to the Committee. During his visit, the representative of the Director-General had conversations with the Secretary of State for Labour and the Secretary of State for the Interior and the Police, with the Under-Secretaries of State for Labour and the Under-Secretaries o?State for the Interior and for the Police, and with the Public Prosecutor of the Republic. He was also received by the President of the Supreme Court of Justice. He met the leaders of a number of trade union organisations - including those of two of the complainant organisations, CGT and POASI - on their trade union premises. Finally, he had discussions at the headquarters of the Employers' Confederation of the Dominican Republic with the officials of this organisation, and with those of the Association of Industries of the Dominican Republic.
.The Committee notes with satisfaction that the representative of the Director-General enjoyed the co-operation of all concerned. He was able to carry out all his tasks in full freedom and independence and the Dominican Government afforded him the necessary facilities to perform his mission in the best possible circumstances.
.The representative of the Director-General collected information on the various issues raised in the complaints and on the measures taken or envisaged to solve the problems encountered. At the invitation of the Government he also discussed the comments made by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations during its periodic examination of the application of Conventions Nos.  and  under article  of the ILO Constitution. All these points are examined in the paragraphs which follow.
.First of all, however, it should be pointed out that, according to the representative of the Director-General, a number of Confederations are at present contending for the allegiance of the workers and the control of the works unions. ""Thus"", he writes, ""at the time of my visit antagonism had taken a very serious turn in the Central Romana Corporations and Central Romana By-Products enterprise, a situation which seems likely to continue, if not to deteriorate further, in the coming months."" Trade union Confederations often maintain close political relations with political parties. The General Union of Dominican Workers (UGTD), which was set up very recently, is in sympathy with the Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD). As will be seen later on the Government has been accused of favouring this new organisation to a certain extent. A similar preoccupation is revealed in a telegram of  December  from the General Workers' Federation (CGT), in which this organisation protests against the administrative order allegedly given by the Government to close down the programme of the ""Rutas"" radio station at La Romana and its alleged prevention of the reorganisation of the local union. This communication has been transmitted to the Government for its observations. The employers' representatives, the report continues, have expressed the view that this situation has created a tense atmosphere in industrial relations on the other hand, it appears that large numbers of unions are now being formed in the present social circumstances.
.Allegations concerning the death, arrest or banishment of trade unionists
.As the mission report states, an amnesty law was passed on  September . All the trade unionists who were mentioned as having been under arrest have now been released. In addition, the banished trade unionists have recently returned to the country under the amnesty law and after the removal of administrative obstacles to their return.
.Finally, it appears from the information gathered that under the Code of Penal Procedure any person who is detained must be brought before a judge within  hours of his arrest. In addition, an old habeas corpus Act protects individuals against arbitrary arrest. In the past, according to the Public Prosecutor of the Republic, the practice was to refer pleas of this nature to the Public Ministry ""which sometimes took rather arbitrary decisions""; this has now been changed and the pleas come before a judge of first instance. Moreover, a Hill to amend the habeas corpus Act is in preparation which stipulates explicitly that the plea must be referred to a judge and prescribes an appeals procedure. As regards banishment, the Public Prosecutor stated that, legally, such a measure could only be taken against foreigners (under the Immigration Law). No law permits the expulsion of nationals, and the measures taken by the previous Government were, in his opinion, arbitrary. There had been no more expulsions since  August .
.Legal proceedings have been instituted in respect of the two cases of murder mentioned in the complaints of the peasants' trade union leaders (Florinda Muoz Soriano in November , and Dionisio Frias in June ). The Secretary and the Under-Secretary of State for Labour said that they would send detailed information regarding the judicial investigations undertaken. It was, they admitted, true that peasant leaders had in the past met their deaths in abnormal circumstances. The new Government, they added, had stated that it would pursue a policy of respect for civil liberties and human rights, including freedom of association. The Undersecretary of State further emphasised the determination of the authorities to abide strictly by the law. The representative of the Director-General also learned from the officials of the Autonomous Confederation of Christian Trade Unions (CASC) that legal proceedings were still pending in the case of the murder of Dionisio Frias; as regards the death of Florinda Muoz Soriano the court had considered that the accused had acted in self-defence.
.The Committee notes these various items of information, in particular the release or the return from exile of the trade unionists mentioned in the complaints. The facts surrounding the deaths of two peasant leaders in  and  have been the subject of trials before the courts one of these cases, moreover, appears to have ended in an acquittal. The Government, while admitting that trade unionists in the rural sector had in the past met their deaths in abnormal circumstances, has stated its will to secure respect for the law and for civil liberties. In these circumstances the Committee is of the opinion that these different points call for no further consideration, provided that it is kept informed of the results of the trials in the cases of the deaths of Dioniso Frias and Florinda Muoz Soriano.
.Allegations concerning the dismissal of trade unionists
.Many allegations referred to the dismissal of trade union leaders and militants. According to the complainants the chief target of these dismissals were the executive Committees of the unions, but certain allegations also referred to the dissolution, or attempted dissolution, of workers' organisations. The representative of the Director-General points out in his report that this issue appeared",0,1976,Dominican Republic
75,"to be a fundamental problem which was still disrupting industrial relations in the country. Although section  of the Labour Code prohibits anti-union practices, the penal sanctions imposed are fines ranging from  to  pesos ( peso  US dollar). According to the report, the Government appears willing to do everything in its power to find a solution:The Secretary and Under-Secretary of State recognise that there have been numerous dismissals and that some cases had apparently involved trade union officials. It was also possible that, in order to get rid of certain leaders, employers had dismissed a whole group of workers. The Government had tried to solve matters through conciliation and mediation and had sometimes succeeded. As it stood, however, the existing legislation did not provide it with the means to do more. Quite apart from the fact that it was difficult to find proof - a problem which is not unique to the Dominican Republic, of course - the Labour Code (section ) allows the employer to terminate a contract for an indefinite period, without giving any reason. Consequently, an employer can dismiss a worker if he finds it convenient provided he pays his employee the amounts to which he is legally entitled (corresponding to the period of notice, the leaving grant and days of leave). This applies even when a collective agreement contains a special clause providing for the protection of union officials. According to existing case law, an employer who fails to respect this provision and dismisses trade union leaders is only required to pay the special indemnity which is provided for in the event of a violation of this clause.
.The report mentions that there are at present proposals to amend the Labour Code, in particular section . The representative of the Director-General mentions the various drafts which have been prepared and adds:The President of the Republic has made a public appeal for a social truce. The representatives of the workers and employers are therefore in the process of negotiating an agreement through the Secretariat of State for Labour. One meeting was held during our mission, and the various inter-occupational Confederations whose officials I met took part in it along with the employers' associations. One of the items for discussion had to do with genuine respect for the freedom of association of workers: the employers' organisations are apparently prepared to guarantee that no trade union leader and no leader of any trade union in the process of being set up will be dismissed from their enterprises except by authorisation of an arbitration Committee. In practice, this amounts to an amendment by agreement of section  of the Labour Code. ... Moreover, it is quite feasible that, following the agreement, the matter will be brought before the Congress in the form of a Bill. The Secretary of State informed me that, even if no agreement is reached, a draft amendment to the law will be submitted on this point. Such an amendment could therefore be adopted without it being necessary to wait for the adoption of a new Labour code.
.As the Committee has already pointed out in other cases, legislation which merely prescribes that any worker dismissed without just cause is entitled in certain cases to compensation and damages in addition to the wage corresponding to the period of notice, does not give sufficient protection against acts of anti-union discrimination, since it enables an employer, on condition that he pays the compensation prescribed by law, to dismiss any member of his staff, whether a member of a trade union or not, for trade union or other activities, the public authorities being powerless to prevent him from doing so. Protection is particularly desirable in the case of trade union officials because, in order to be able to perform their trade union duties in full independence, they must have the guarantee that they will not be prejudiced on account of the mandate which they hold from their trade unions. This guarantee is also necessary to secure respect for the principle that workers' organisations have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom.
.The Dominican Government stated that it was keenly aware of the gaps in its legislation in this respect, and that it was trying to obtain a broad consensus as regards the solution to these difficulties. The Committee considers it essential that this question should be settled in the near future, given the problems which have arisen in the country.
.Allegations concerning unfair practices in the public sector
.The allegations referred to the setting up by the Government of a parallel union in Puerto de Andrs at Boca Chica (communication of August ) and a manoeuvre in the Dominican Telephone Company (CODETEL) to make the National Union of Telephone Workers (SNTT) lose its legal representative character (communication of June ).
.As regards the latter point, the representative of the Director-General wanted to assure himself that the SNTT was exercising its trade union activities fully and that it had recently concluded a collective agreement with the enterprise for the period -. The agreement contains a special clause concerning the protection of trade union officials. Except in the case of a former leader who had been suspended, this provision had been respected. However, the report mentions other cases than that referred to in the previous paragraph in which parallel unions had been set up under the former Government. In this respect the Committee had earlier recalled (in May ) the provision of Article  of Convention No. . Under this provision - as under Article  of the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ), not ratified by the Dominican Republic - workers' organisations must enjoy adequate protection against any act of interference by employers in their establishment, functioning or administration. Article  specifies that acts which are designed to promote the establishment of workers' organisations under the domination of employers or employers' organisations, or to support workers' organisations by financial or other means with the object of placing such organisations under the control of employers or employers' organisations, shall be deemed to constitute acts of interference.
.The Secretary and Under-Secretary of State for Labour declared that the present Government would not endorse or tolerate such practices as the previous Cabinet had done, specifically in the transport sector and the sugar industry. The representative of the Director-General adds the following:In a more general vein, I raised the matter of attempts by employers to interfere in the activities of workers' organisations, and not only in the public sector. On this point the Secretary and Under-Secretary of State said that the current provisions of the Labour Code did not give the Government sufficient scope to combat such practices but that it was nevertheless its policy to try to take action on the basis of the complaints received. They added that it was the Government's attention to introduce proper provisions to put a stop to such acts of interference.The Committee notes these statements and considers it desirable, even if the Government is resolved to tolerate such practices no longer, that legal protection should be strengthened and that the Labour Code should, for example, prescribe more dissuasive sanctions for contraventions of section , the provisions of which are reproduced in the footnote.
.According to the information gathered, several union Confederations also expressed concern at the creation of the General Union of Dominican Workers (UGTD) allied to the political party currently in power (PRD) because they were afraid that the new organisation would receive more favourable treatment, especially in the public sector (the State is the principal employer in certain branches of activity, such as agriculture). Dismissals had already allegedly taken place in the health sector and the sugar-cane industry. This had given rise to a fear that the dismissed workers would be replaced by others who supported the new Government. In some cases this was said to have already begun. The representative of the Director-General explains that, according to the governmental authorities he spoke to, most of the Dominican trade unions were independent of the traditional Confederations and close to the PRD; they were now able to organise themselves and were doing so within the UGTD. The report continues:The Government spokesman went on to say that the dismissals that had taken place in the public sector had not been on trade union grounds. Two points in particular should be borne in mind: in the first place, it was customary in the country to give posts in the public sector to members of the party in power (spoils system); secondly, from the economic standpoint it was necessary to cut down in personnel as the number of employees had sometimes grown far too great. They insisted that the Government would respect the right of freedom of association and ideological pluralism. In any case, legal proceedings could be undertaken against the administration if it was suspected of misuse of power.
.On more than one occasion the Committee has examined cases in which allegations were made that the public authorities had by their",0,1976,Dominican Republic
76,"attitude favoured or discriminated against one or more trade union organisations: examples of such allegations are pressure exerted on workers by means of public statements made by the authorities, unequal distribution of subsidies among unions or the granting to one union, rather than to the other, of premises for holding its meetings or carrying on its activities, and refusal to recognise the leaders of certain organisations in their legitimate activities.& Discrimination by these means or others may be an informal way of influencing the trade union membership of workers. They are therefore sometimes difficult to prove. The fact nevertheless remains, as the Committee has recalled in each of the foregoing cases, that any discrimination of this kind jeopardises the right of workers to set up and join organisations of their own choosing, a right which is explicitly recognised in Article  of Convention No. .
.The Committee also wishes to lay stress on the principles set forth in the resolution concerning the independence of the trade union movement, adopted by the International Labour Conference at its th Session (). The fundamental and permanent mission of the trade union movement, states the resolution, is the economic and social advancement of the workers. When trade unions in accordance with the national law and practice of their respective countries and at the decision of their members decide to establish relations with a political party or to undertake Constitutional political action as a means towards the advancement of their economic and social objectives, such political relations or actions should not be of such a nature as to compromise the continuance of a trade union movement or its social or economic functions irrespective of political changes in the country. The resolution also stresses that governments should not attempt to transform the trade union movement into an instrument for the pursuance of political aims, nor should they attempt to interfere with the normal functions of a trade union movement because of its freely established relationship with a political party.
.Allegations concerning the registration and cancellation of registration of trade unions
.The representative of the Director-General explained that a resolution, No. / of  October , repealed resolutions of  which, by administrative decision, cancelled the registration of numerous trade unions, including the single union of workers of the Central Romana Corporations and Central Romana By Products mentioned in the complaints. Such registration was necessary to enable the trade unions to function. In the preamble to this new resolution it is stated, among other things, that the previous Government was guilty of actions ultra vires by assuming powers that legally belonged to the courts of first instance by virtue of section  of the Labour Code. The preamble also refers to Article  of Convention no. , which prohibits the dissolution or suspension of workers' and employers' organisations by administrative authority. In these circumstances the Committee considers that this aspect of the case calls for no further examination.
.In this connection, the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has observed that according to section  of the Labour Code the registration of a trade union could be refused by the Ministry of Labour. It had asked the Government whether it was possible to appeal to the courts against a refusal to register a trade union. The Under-Secretary of State told the representative of the Director-General that it was possible to appeal against a refusal to register a trade union, as it was to appeal against any administrative act.
.Allegations concerning intervention by the public authorities in the internal affairs of trade unions and occupation of trade union premises
.The problems raised in this connection were of two kinds. The first related to an administrative resolution, No. / of  October , issued by the Secretariat of State for Labour, according to which general assemblies organised with a view to setting up a trade union, federation or Confederation, electing its executive Committee, amending its statutes, merging with other trade unions or affiliating with a federation or Confederation, had to be ""certified"" by a labour inspector. After examining the file on the case and hearing the administration's opinion, the Secretary of state decided whether the trade union can be registered, whether its executive Committee can be recognised, and whether a merger or affiliation can take place, after having previously verified that the legal requirements have been fulfilled. The Committee expressed the view in its th Report that the obligation to accept the presence of a representative of the authorities at general assemblies constituted a restriction upon the free activity of trade unions.
.The representative of the Director-General received the assurance that the resolution would shortly be repealed. The officials he talked with added that, pending the repeal, the authorities would abide by the limitations placed on this text by two rulings of the Supreme Court of Justice. According to the rulings, the powers of the Secretariat of State for Labour in trade union affairs should be interpreted restrictively and the purpose of the presence of an inspector at union assemblies could only be to provide the Secretariat with a report on the circumstances in which the assembly took place and on the decisions adopted. The Court stressed that contesting union elections was a matter for the labour tribunal and not the administrative authorities. According to officials of the CGT, says the report, while the previous Government had used this resolution to commit excesses, the present Government was not applying it in the same spirit.
.The second set of problems raised relates to factual situations: intervention by the authorities in the elections of the Stevedores' Union (POASI); manoeuvres in other undertakings, with the assistance of the authorities, to remove trade union leaders from office; confiscation and misappropriation of the funds of POASI; and occupation of its premises and those- of the National Union of Independent Drivers (UNACHOSIN). In this connection the representative of the Director-General makes the following statement in his report:With regard to the election of trade union leaders, the Secretary and Under-Secretary of State declared that the Supreme Court ruling in the POASI case was a clear case of the infringement of the law by the Government of that period. They confirmed that the POASI had organised elections on  October  and was now operating normally. They also confirmed that the premises of the POASI and UNACHOSIN had been occupied but that a stop had now been put to these measures. The Under-Secretary of State for Labour said that in occupying union premises the previous Government had not respected existing legal provisions. Forcible entry is prohibited by law and misuse of power by public servants is a punishable offence under the Penal Code. As to the allegations concerning POASI funds, he said that this was now past history and that the POASI was currently verifying its financial records. If any misappropriation of funds was brought to light, the matter would be brought before the competent authorities.
.The representative of the Director-General continues:In more general terms, the Secretary of State for the Interior and for the Police informed me that meetings organised on union premises were allowed to take place unhindered and that no authorisation was required open-air meetings were another matter and did require authorisation, and the appropriate decisions were taken in the light of all relevant factors: importance of the date for the union ( May, for example), traffic problems, proximity of an important building (hospital, for example), etc.
.The Committee notes that a solution has now been found to the factual problems raised in the complaints. It also notes the intention of the Government to repeal Resolution No. / mentioned above and trusts that this measure will be taken in the near future.
.Allegations concerning interference with the right to strike
.Complaints were also made with reference to the exercise of the right to strike. In this connection, the representative of the Director-General points out, the labour authorities have recognised that it was virtually impossible to engage in strike action in the present state of the legislation. Such action could only last for a few days because judges were empowered to order a return to work. The report adds:It is significant that the Labour Code only authorises strike action within very strict limits (see sections ,  and ): for example, more than  per cent of the employees concerned must have voted in favour of the strike; a strike cannot take place if one of the parties decides to submit the dispute to arbitration; and it must come to an end upon the expiry of the legal time limit for the resumption of work ordered by the judge. The right to strike is restricted even further by the provisions governing arbitration procedure: the presiding judge can appoint the arbitrators ex officio or at the request of the Secretary of State for Labour (section ) and may order the resumption of work (section ; see also sections  to  and ). The arbitration award has the effect of a collective agreement (section",0,1976,Dominican Republic
77,"). The Secretary of State adds that the judge orders the resumption of work but that, moreover, arbitrators were not appointed. The Under-Secretary told me that he knew of hardly any case where a strike had been recognised as legal. In the past the police had often intervened and an appeal to the tribunal was barely conceivable under these conditions. Nowadays, whenever a collective labour dispute arose, the Government tried to reconcile the parties; often the employers accepted to reinstate at least some of the strikers, and the police no longer intervened. However, he added that in the current period of transition he would not hesitate to apply the sections of the Labour code that empowered him to prevent a strike if he felt that public order was threatened - although this situation had not arisen.
.The representative of the Director-General referred to information according to which the party in power, the PRD, had undertaken to revise the Labour Code so as to make it more liberal; the debate on the subject had already begun in the legislative chambers. The question of the right to strike had not yet been taken up, but the Secretary of State for Labour said that he intended to propose the adoption of liberal provisions in this respect as he wanted to bring Dominican legislation fully into line with the ILO's standards and principles respecting freedom of association.
.The Committee has always considered the right to strike as one of the essential means by which workers and their organisations may promote and defend their occupational interests it has held that restrictions or prohibitions on the right to strike are admissible only under certain conditions, in particular in the public service and in essential services (in the strict sense of the term). In the latter cases, it has added, such restrictions should be accompanied by adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures in which the parties can take part at every stage, and at which the awards are binding on both parties in all cases. Such awards should be executed rapidly and completely.
.The Committee notes the Government's intention to revise its legislation on this important question. It has also noted that the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has made certain observations on the present strike legislation. It would be desirable that the envisaged amendments should be adopted at an early date.
.Allegations concerning the trade union rights of agricultural workers
.This aspect of the case was the subject both of a complaint and of observations by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, which considered that the exclusion of certain rural workers from the field of application of the provisions of the Labour Code which guaranteed the right of association was incompatible with Convention No. . In this connection the representative of the Director-General states the following:When asked about this, the Secretary and Under-Secretary of State for Labour explained that under the previous regime there had in practice been a certain amount of opposition to unionisation. On the other hand, the present Government was trying to meet and encourage the participation of peasants' representatives. Under the Labour Code agricultural workers were entitled to set up trade unions. According to section , the provisions of the Code do not apply to any agricultural undertaking, agricultural undertaking of an industrial type or stock raising or forestry undertaking which does not continuously and permanently employ more than ten persons, but this refers to the undertakings themselves and not to the workers. As the Secretary of State pointed out, this means that the workers cannot set up a works union and, in fact, section  of the Code stipulates that associations of employees must have not less than  members. However, nothing prevents them from setting up an occupational ""class"" union. The government authorities I spoke to actually cited two federations that were registered with the Secretariat of State for Labour (and therefore possess juridical personality)
.The information gathered by the representative of the Director-General refers both to the de facto situation and to certain legal difficulties. From the latter point of view the authorities have provided the necessary explanations, even though it would be desirable for the Labour Code to be more explicit in recognising the right of all rural workers to form unions. It would also appear that the de facto situation has improved, and the Committee takes note of this development.
.Allegations concerning the trade union rights of teachers and public servants
.The complainants mention the specific case of a teachers' union, the Dominican Teachers' Association (ADP), which the public authorities refused to recognise. In its th Report the Committee referred to the comments of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations and expressed concern at the position of public officials and public servants in general, who are excluded from the Labour Code and thereby deprived of the trade union rights proclaimed by the Code.
.The ADP, reports the representative of the Director-General, was granted legal personality in January . Another union - the National Union of Educators (UNE) - was registered at the Secretariat of State for Labour in accordance with the provisions of the Labour Code. These two organisations were theoretically for teachers from the private sector; however, according to their by-laws and, with the tacit assent of the public authorities, teachers from the public sector were also allowed to join.
.Generally speaking, public servants and other persons employed by the public authorities are excluded, with certain exceptions, from labour legislation (section  of the Labour Code, Act No.  of  July ] and are therefore deprived of the guarantees provided for therein with respect to freedom of association. Furthermore, the representative of the Director-General refers to an Act, No.  of  November , which prohibits any propaganda activity or attempt to encourage people to join trade unions within public and municipal administrations or autonomous state institutions (section ). ""According to government officials"", he writes, ""this latter provision means in effect that all trade union activity in the public sector is prohibited. Outside the public service in the strict sense, however, individual statutes do provide for the right to organise.""
.The report continues:The Secretary of State for Labour said that, although the right for public servants to join trade unions was not recognised, their right of association on the basis of Act No.  on non-profit-making associations was fully guaranteed. As early as  the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations had, however, made a number of comments on this Act, which contains provisions (for example, section  which refers to the dissolution of an association by the executive authority) whose application could constitute an infringement of Convention No. . The trade union organisations with which I had discussions were highly critical of this legislation: Act No.  permits the creation of cultural or mutual assistance associations but, according to them, not of real workers' organisations entitled, for instance, to submit claims and to negotiate collectively. Moreover, it is the Government which is responsible for registering and recognising these associations, which are not governed by the Labour Code. However, according to the UGTD, although trade union legislation would be preferable these associations do nevertheless permit workers to organise themselves and to defend their interests and they are also able to take legal action. According to the Under-Secretary of State for Labour, the Government accepts the activities of organisations set up to defend the interests of public servants. Thus, for instance, a Dominican Public Service Federation (FEDOMEPIA) has been created. The Secretary of State added that he intended to propose a new public service status which would sanction the right to organise in this sector.
.The Committee has often stressed, and particularly in two recent cases, that the standards on freedom of association embodied in Convention No.  apply to all workers ""without distinction whatsoever"", and are therefore applicable to employees of the State. It was indeed considered inequitable to draw any distinction in trade union matters between workers in the private sector and public servants, since persons in either category are permitted to become organised for the defence of their interests. It was also made clear during the preparatory work on Convention No.  that recognition of the right of association of public servants in no way prejudges the question of the right of such officials to strike. Their special situation has, as mentioned earlier, led the Committee to admit that this right could be restricted for public servants.
.The Committee takes note of the information gathered regarding the present opportunities for state personnel to join associations for the defence of their occupational interests, and on the reforms envisaged. It nevertheless considers it essential that the right of all public servants to organise should be fully recognised in the near future, and in this connection notes that the question is the subject of an examination and observations by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions",0,1976,Dominican Republic
78,"and Recommendations.
.The right to form federations and Confederations
.During the direct contacts mission discussions were also held with the authorities on a restriction imposed by legislation on the right to form federations and Confederations. In this connection the representative of the Director-General writes:Finally, the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations noted that Resolution No. / of the Secretariat of State for Labour requires a minimum of seven trade unions to form a federation and four federations - or three federations of craft unions - to form a Confederation. The Committee considered that these provisions restricted the right of organisations to establish federations and Confederations as provided in Article  of the Convention. The Secretary of State informed me that the purpose of this text was to avoid the proliferation of trade union federations and Confederations. However, when I explained to him the point of view of the ILO supervisory bodies on the matter as a whole, he informed me that the resolution would very shortly be repealed.
.Although this matter has not been the subject of complaints, the Committee takes note of this information, to which it draws the attention of the Committee of Experts.
.Generally speaking, the Committee notes that due to the recent change in Government there has been a favourable development in the trade union situation in the country since the complaints were presented. Although certain matters remain to be settled - in particular the question of dismissals of trade unionists and certain alleged discriminatory practices in the public sector - a solution has now been found to the other points raised by the complainants and amendments to the trade union legislation on the points raised by the Committee and the Committee of Experts are under examination.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the death, arrest or banishment of trade unionists:
.Since  the Committee has been called upon to examine numerous complaints of infringement of freedom of association in the Dominican Republic, presented by the following organisations: world Confederation of Labour (WCL), world Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), International Metalworkers' Federation (IMF), World Federation of Teachers' Unions, General Workers' Federation (CGT), National Federation of Dockworkers, Stevedores' Union (POASI), National Union of Heavy Machinery Operators (SINOMAPE), National Union of Telephone Workers (SNTT). These complaints have been examined as Cases Nos. , , , ,  and .
.In these complaints allegations were made relating, inter alia, to the death, arrest and banishment of trade unionists, dismissals on account of trade union activities, the dismantling of trade union organisations, intervention by the public authorities in the internal affairs of trade unions (meetings, elections, trade union funds), the occupation of trade union premises, interference with the right to strike and the trade union rights of teachers and agricultural workers.
.The subject-matter of these complaints was brought to the attention of the Government as the complaints were received. The Government provided comments on several of the allegations.
.The Committee examined Case No.  at its sessions in May and November , when it submitted interim reports to the Governing Body, A further interim report was submitted by the Committee to the Governing Body with respect to Case No.  and Cases Nos. , ,  and  in May . The Committee again examined all the cases pending with regard to the Dominican Republic at its November  session 
.At its may  session the Committee observed that although the Government had submitted comments and information on several of the allegations made, the Committee possessed insufficient information to enable it to reach conclusions at that stage regarding the substance of the various issues raised. The Committee recalled, moreover, that it had already examined, on several occasions, cases concerning the Dominican Republic which involved allegations similar to those made in the present cases. In these circumstances, the Committee considered that it would be very useful to apply the direct contacts procedure. The Governing Body, accordingly, requested the Government to consider the possibility of giving its consent to the carrying out of a study in the Dominican Republic of the facts surrounding the complaints by a representative of the Director-General, who would report to the Committee thereon.
.No reply having been received from the Government in November  and February  the Committee invited it to give its early consideration to the request for direct contacts and to communicate its decision in this connection as soon as possible.
.In May , in the continued absence of any communication from the Government in this connection, the Committee decided to apply the special procedure provided for in paragraphs  and  of its th Report. Under this procedure, the Government was immediately informed that the Chairman of the Committee would, on behalf of the Committee, make contact with its representatives attending the rd Session of the International Labour Conference, draw their attention to the particular cases involved and discuss with them the reasons for the delay in transmitting the observations requested. The Chairman was then to report to the Committee on the results of such contacts. However, since the Government did not designate any representative to the rd Session of the Conference, the said procedure could not be applied.
.In a letter dated  August , the Government stated that it was considering the request it had received to accept the visit of a representative of the Director-General, and added that a final reply would be given when it was in the interests of the country to do so.
.At its November  session the Committee expressed its regret at the Government's delay in acceding to the request made of it to give its consent to the visit of a representative of the Director-General. In this connection, the Committee emphasised that the purpose of the whole procedure was to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and expressed its confidence that, if this procedure protected governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their part would recognise the importance for the protection of their own good name of co-operating with the Committee in every way so that it could examine the allegations fully and seek possible solutions to the problems involved. The Committee moreover laid particular stress on the importance it attached to the direct contacts procedure.
.In these circumstances, the Governing Body, on the Committee's recommendation,(a) urged the Government to give its consent without delay to an inquiry into the trade union situation being carried out in the Dominican Republic by a representative of the Director-General;(b) requested the Director-General to contact the Government at the highest possible level so as to express the concern of the Committee and to insist that the Government should give a favourable response to the request for direct contacts.
.In February , the Committee noted that in spite of the reminders sent to the Government on this question the Government had not replied. The Committee deplored the fact that the Government of the Dominican Republic had shown no desire to cooperate with the procedures available in the field of trade union rights. In these circumstances, the Governing Body decided that, in the event of no reply being received from the Government before its next session, wider publicity should be given to the allegations, to the replies of the Government, to the recommendations of the Committee and to the obstructive attitude of the Government's.
.Since then, no reply has been received from the Government.
.The Dominican Republic has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee must first of all deplore the fact that, notwithstanding the insistent and repeated requests addressed to the Government at the highest level, the Government has failed to reply to the proposal made by the Committee and the Governing Body that recourse be had to direct contacts. In view of the importance and seriousness of the matters raised in the complaints and the inadequacy of the information at its disposal, the Committee remains convinced that a visit to the Dominican Republic by a representative of the Director-General would have afforded an opportunity to gain a greater insight into the trade union situation and give fruitful consideration to possible solutions to the problems involved.
.Before taking up each of the matters raised by the complainants, the Committee wishes to emphasise the importance of the cases under consideration, which raise serious issues pertaining to freedom of association and human rights in relation to trade union rights. In this connection the Committee expresses its deep concern at the acuteness and diversity of the problems faced by a substantial part of the Dominican trade union movement in a wide variety of branches of activity.
.The Committee notes in particular that, according to the allegations, certain trade union organisations, in many cases of nation-wide importance, have for many years been having great difficulty in carrying on their activities owing to the multiple obstacles that have been put in their path: arrest and dismissal of",0,1976,Dominican Republic
79,"their leaders, occupation of their premises, interference in their internal affairs. Such an atmosphere cannot be conducive to the development of a truly free and independent trade union movement, nor to the promotion of normal industrial relations. The Committee wishes to emphasise before proceeding any further that, as stated in the resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties adopted by the International Labour Conference in , the absence of civil liberties removes all meaning from the concept of trade union rights, and the rights conferred upon workers' and employers' organisations must be based on respect for those civil liberties.
.The allegations refer to a considerable number of murders of officials of workers' organisations, especially in the agricultural sector, committed in most cases by employers or overseers. In the absence of any detailed information on these cases from the Government, the Committee feels bound to observe that the Government has not established that these deaths occurred for reasons unconnected with the status or activities of the officials in question. The Committee considers that, in any event, the circumstances of these cases should have prompted the authorities to take effective steps to establish the facts, punish the culprits and restore the situation to normal, this being an essential prerequisite for the free exercise of trade union rights.
.Many of the complaints mention the arrest and detention of officials of various trade union organisations. Contradictory explanations as to the reasons for these measures have been given by the complainants and by the Government. According to the former they were due to trade union activities, while the latter has claimed in general terms that the officials in question were arrested for breaches of laws in respect of public order or for common-law offences.
.Be this as it may, the Committee must observe that the Government has not supplied detailed information as to the acts of which the persons arrested were accused, thus preventing the Committee from examining the allegations with all the facts before it. The Committee considers that the onus was on the Government to show that the measures it had taken were not prompted by the trade union activities of the persons concerned.
.While most of the trade unionists mentioned in the complaints appear to have now recovered their freedom, it has none the less been clearly established that some of them were kept in custody for relatively lengthy periods of time, in some cases at repeated intervals. It is impossible to determine from the Government's replies whether the persons concerned were brought before the courts. Only in a few cases does it appear from the information supplied by the complainants that legal proceedings were initiated against the trade union officials concerned. One of them was moreover kept in prison even though he had been found not guilty by a court of first instance.
.The Committee must recall in this connection that it is one of the fundamental rights of the individual that a detained person should be brought without delay before the appropriate judge, this right being recognised in such instruments as the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man. In the case of persons engaged in trade union activities, this is one of the civil liberties which should be ensured by the authorities in order to guarantee the full effectiveness of the exercise of trade union rights. The Committee further wishes to point out that the detention by the authorities of trade unionists concerning whom no grounds for prosecution are subsequently found is liable to involve restrictions on trade union rights, and governments should take steps to ensure that the authorities concerned have instructions appropriate to eliminate the danger of detention for trade union activities.
.According to the complainants, the authorities have also ordered the expulsion from the country of certain trade union officials. One of them was refused entry into the Dominican Republic on his return from an international trade union conference. In the Committee's opinion, a measure exiling trade unionists, which is in violation of human rights, is of particular gravity since it deprives the persons concerned of the possibility of working in their country and of contacts with their families. It is also in violation of freedom of association in that it undermines the trade union organisations which are thereby deprived of their leaders.
.According to the information supplied by the complainants, many trade union officials and members have been dismissed from their jobs in a large number of undertakings covering a wide range of activities. In most of these cases it has been alleged that the sole ground for the action in question was the trade union activities of the persons concerned. In some cases the underlying intention was stated to be the dismantling of trade unions, though this has been denied by the Government. The Government has however admitted that some undertakings engage in practices hardly conducive to the development of sound industrial relations which it cannot combat effectively under the legislation in force.
.The Committee considers that no person should be discriminated against on account of his trade union membership or activities, and that governments should take measures to ensure that workers are protected against acts, including dismissal, which are likely to provoke or have as their object anti-union discrimination in respect of employment. Legislation enabling employers in practice - on condition that they pay the compensation prescribed by law for cases of unjustified dismissal - to get rid of any worker, even if the true reason is his trade union membership or activities, does not give sufficient protection against acts of anti-union discrimination.
.Protection against acts of anti-union discrimination is particularly desirable in the case of trade union officials, because, in order to carry out their trade union functions in full independence, they must have the assurance that they will not be victimised by virtue of their trade union office. Such an assurance is also necessary to ensure that effect is given to the principle that workers' organisations should have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom .
.A large number of trade union organisations appear to have been dismantled over the past few years, either through the withdrawal of their legal personality or through the setting up of parallel unions or through their destruction by employers. In answer to these allegations the Government has merely stated that the great majority of the organisations in question are still in existence but their leaders have been removed from office by decision of their members. The Committee does not have sufficient information to enable it to express an opinion on these matters in full knowledge of the facts. In particular, it has not been specified whether the legal personality of the trade union mentioned by the complainants was withdrawn by order of the administrative authorities or as a result of court proceedings. The Committee notes, however, that under the terms of section  of the Labour Code, the registration of a trade union may be cancelled by a decision of the courts if the trade union pursues activities not connected with its lawful objectives.
.As concerns the setting up of parallel unions and the destruction of trade unions by employers, the Committee wishes to recall that under the terms of Article  of Convention No. , ratified by the Dominican Republic, workers' and employers' organisations must enjoy adequate protection against any acts of interference by each other or each other's agents or members in their establishment, functioning or administration. Article  specifies that acts which are designed to promote the establishment of workers' organisations under the domination of employers or employers' organisations, or to support workers' organisations by financial or other means with the object of placing such organisations under the control of employers or employers' organisations, shall be deemed to constitute acts of interference.
.The allegations of interference by public authorities in the internal affairs of trade unions are mainly concerned with the right of assembly, the right to elect officials in full freedom and trade union funds. The Committee considers that freedom of assembly for trade union purposes constitutes one of the fundamental elements of trade union rights, and that the authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof. The obligation to accept the presence of a representative of the authorities at general assemblies constitutes a restriction upon the free activity of trade unions.
.With regard to trade union elections, the complainants stated that rigged elections had been held in the POASI union and that the Supreme Court had ruled them to be illegal. According to more recent information supplied by the Government, properly conducted elections were subsequently held in this union. In this connection the Committee wishes once again to emphasise the importance it attaches to the principle that workers and their organisations should have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom.
.The POASI is also alleged by the complainants to have had its assets confiscated.",1,1976,Dominican Republic
80,"According to the Government these allegations are false. In view of the contradictory nature of these statements, the Committee can only recall the importance of the principle that trade union funds should be adequately protected.
.It appears from the allegations made that the headquarters of certain trade union organisations have been occupied by the police, in some cases several times. The latest intervention of this kind - involving the POASI - seems to have been quite recent. In this connection the Committee wishes to draw the Government's attention to the fact that, in the resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties, the International Labour Conference, expressed the view that the right to protection of the property of trade union organisations was one of the civil liberties which were essential for the normal exercise of trade union rights. While trade unions cannot claim immunity from a search of their premises, such a search should only be made following the issue of a warrant by the ordinary judicial authority after that authority has been satisfied that reasonable grounds exist for supposing that evidence exists on the said premises material to a prosecution for an offence under the ordinary law and provided that such search is restricted to the purposes in respect of which the warrant was issued.
.With regard to the allegations relating to interference with the right to strike, the Committee recalls that the right to strike is one of the essential means through which workers and their organisations may promote and defend their occupational interests. The Committee points out in this connection that on several occasions the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has made comments with respect to sections  to  of the Labour Code, which allow all cases of collective labour disputes to be referred to arbitration, culminating in a binding award, which might severely restrict the right to strike and thus infringe the right of trade unions to organise their activities. As concerns the calling in of the police to obstruct, according to the complainants, the exercise of the right to strike, the Committee considers that intervention by security forces in the event of strikes should be limited to the maintenance of public order.
.As concerns the Government's refusal to recognise the legal existence of the Dominican Teachers' Association, the Committee refers to the comments of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations with respect to the position of public servants in the Dominican Republic, who are excluded from the Labour code and thereby deprived of the trade union rights proclaimed by the Code. The Committee recalls that public servants, including teachers, are entitled to enjoy the right to organise, just as other workers are.
.A number of complaints were partly concerned with the trade union situation in the agricultural sector. This branch of activity does indeed seem to have been particularly affected by extremely serious incidents, sometimes involving the death of trade union officials. In addition, according to the complainants, the Government has prevented agricultural workers from organising themselves freely, even though their trade union rights are recognised by law. The Committee wishes in this connection to emphasise the particular importance the International Labour Conference attached to the trade union rights of rural workers in adopting the Rural Workers' Organisations Convention (No. ) in . Article  of this Convention provides that it shall be an objective of national policy concerning rural development to facilitate the establishment and growth, on a voluntary basis, of strong and independent organisations of rural workers as an effective means of ensuring the participation of rural workers, without discrimination, in economic and social development and in the benefits resulting therefrom.
.In these circumstances, as concerns the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the Government's attention to the considerations and principles set forth in paragraphs  to  concerning the death, arrest, banishment and dismissal of trade unionists, the dismantling of trade union organisations, intervention by public authorities in the internal affairs of trade unions, the occupation of trade union premises, the right to strike and the trade union rights of teachers and agricultural workers;(b) to deplore the obstructive attitude and lack of co-operation shown by the Government, which, by not consenting to a mission on the spot, and by not transmitting its replies on the questions before the Committee has made it impossible to obtain all the information on the serious allegations made and to decide what measures could be taken as regards the problems involved;(c) to decide to give wider publicity to the present report, in particular during the next session of the International Labour Conference.Geneva,  May . (Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.
.The Committee has already examined several complaints of infringements of trade union rights in the Dominican Republic, presented by the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), the International Metalworkers' Federation (IMF), the National Union of Heavy Machinery Operators (SINOMAPE), the National Federation of Dockworkers, the Stevedores' Union (POASI) and the General Workers' Federation (CGT). These complaints were dealt with under Cases Nos. , , ,  and . With regard to Case No. , the Committee submitted a number of conclusions to the Governing Body that appear in paragraphs  to  of its st Report and in paragraphs  to  of its rd Report. The Committee also examined Case No.  and Cases Nos. , ,  and  in its th Report (paragraphs  to ) in which it also submitted certain conclusions to the Governing Body.
.Since then, further allegations have been received in connection with these cases. They have been made by the WFTU (communication of  July ), the National Union of Telephone Workers (communications of  July  and  September ), the POASI and the CGT (joint communication of  April ) and the CGT (communication of  June ).
.The World Federation of Teachers' Unions also submitted allegations in a letter of  May  (Case No. ).
.The Government submitted certain information in a letter of  August .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee notes the information communicated by the Government which recognises, in particular, that, in certain undertakings, practices exist that are not conducive to the development of healthy labour management relations and to which it cannot effectively put a stop under the legislation currently in force. New complaints have been received containing allegations that are as serious and as varied as those previously examined. It should be borne in mind, moreover, that the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has for several years been making observations on the application by the Dominican Republic of Conventions Nos.  and , which it has ratified.
.The Committee regrets the Government's delay in acceding to the request made of it to give its consent to the visit of a representative of the Director-General. In this connection, the Committee wishes to emphasise that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and the Committee is confident that, if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their part will recognise the importance for the protection of their own good name of co-operating with the Committee in every way so that it can examine the allegations fully and seek possible solutions to the problems involved. In paragraphs  to  of its th Report, the Committee has laid particular stress on the importance it attaches in this connection to the direct contacts procedure.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to urge the Government to give its consent without delay to an inquiry into the trade union situation being carried out in the Dominican Republic by a representative of the Director General;(b) to request the Director-General to contact the Government at the highest possible level so as to express the concern of the Committee and to insist that the Government should give a favourable response to the request made above;(c) to take note of this interim report.",1,1976,Dominican Republic
81,".Since  the Committee has had before it numerous complaints of violation of freedom of association in the Dominican Republic. These complaints come from the following workers' organisations: World Confederation of Labour (WCL), World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), International Metalworkers' Federation (IMF), World Federation of Teachers' Unions, General Workers' Federation, National Federation of Dockworkers, Stevedores' Union (POASI), National Union of Heavy Machinery Operators (SINOMAPE), and National Union of Telephone Workers (SNTT). They are dealt with in Cases Nos. , , , ,  and .
.The Committee examined Case No.  in May and November  and at each of these sessions presented conclusions to the Governing Body. The Committee submitted further conclusions to the Governing Body (on Cases Nos. , , ,  and ) in May . Finally, it examined all the outstanding cases relating to the Dominican Republic in November  and May .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In May  the Committee considered that the information at its disposal seemed insufficient to enable it to reach conclusions regarding the substance of the various issues raised. It had already examined, on several occasions, cases concerning the Dominican Republic which contained allegations similar to those made in the cases under examination. In these circumstances it considered that it would be very useful to apply the direct contacts procedure. The Governing Body accordingly requested the Government to consider the possibility of giving its consent to the carrying out of a study in the Dominican Republic of the facts surrounding the complaints by a representative of the Director-General.
.This request was repeated on a number of occasions. In addition, new complaints were presented which, like the earlier ones, contained a variety of serious allegations. Since no detailed reply had been received by May , the Committee had been obliged to formulate its conclusions on the cases in its th Report. However, the new Dominican Government constituted after the elections in May  accepted direct contacts by letter of  September .
.The Director-General appointed Mr. Jean-Michel Servais, an official of the Freedom of Association Branch of the International Labour Standards Department, to represent him during this mission. The visit to the country took place from  to  November , and a report on the mission was submitted to the Committee. During his visit, the representative of the Director-General had conversations with the Secretary of State for Labour and the Secretary of State for the Interior and the Police, with the Under-Secretaries of State for Labour and the Under-Secretaries o?State for the Interior and for the Police, and with the Public Prosecutor of the Republic. He was also received by the President of the Supreme Court of Justice. He met the leaders of a number of trade union organisations - including those of two of the complainant organisations, CGT and POASI - on their trade union premises. Finally, he had discussions at the headquarters of the Employers' Confederation of the Dominican Republic with the officials of this organisation, and with those of the Association of Industries of the Dominican Republic.
.The Committee notes with satisfaction that the representative of the Director-General enjoyed the co-operation of all concerned. He was able to carry out all his tasks in full freedom and independence and the Dominican Government afforded him the necessary facilities to perform his mission in the best possible circumstances.
.The representative of the Director-General collected information on the various issues raised in the complaints and on the measures taken or envisaged to solve the problems encountered. At the invitation of the Government he also discussed the comments made by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations during its periodic examination of the application of Conventions Nos.  and  under article  of the ILO Constitution. All these points are examined in the paragraphs which follow.
.First of all, however, it should be pointed out that, according to the representative of the Director-General, a number of Confederations are at present contending for the allegiance of the workers and the control of the works unions. ""Thus"", he writes, ""at the time of my visit antagonism had taken a very serious turn in the Central Romana Corporations and Central Romana By-Products enterprise, a situation which seems likely to continue, if not to deteriorate further, in the coming months."" Trade union Confederations often maintain close political relations with political parties. The General Union of Dominican Workers (UGTD), which was set up very recently, is in sympathy with the Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD). As will be seen later on the Government has been accused of favouring this new organisation to a certain extent. A similar preoccupation is revealed in a telegram of  December  from the General Workers' Federation (CGT), in which this organisation protests against the administrative order allegedly given by the Government to close down the programme of the ""Rutas"" radio station at La Romana and its alleged prevention of the reorganisation of the local union. This communication has been transmitted to the Government for its observations. The employers' representatives, the report continues, have expressed the view that this situation has created a tense atmosphere in industrial relations on the other hand, it appears that large numbers of unions are now being formed in the present social circumstances.
.Allegations concerning the death, arrest or banishment of trade unionists
.As the mission report states, an amnesty law was passed on  September . All the trade unionists who were mentioned as having been under arrest have now been released. In addition, the banished trade unionists have recently returned to the country under the amnesty law and after the removal of administrative obstacles to their return.
.Finally, it appears from the information gathered that under the Code of Penal Procedure any person who is detained must be brought before a judge within  hours of his arrest. In addition, an old habeas corpus Act protects individuals against arbitrary arrest. In the past, according to the Public Prosecutor of the Republic, the practice was to refer pleas of this nature to the Public Ministry ""which sometimes took rather arbitrary decisions""; this has now been changed and the pleas come before a judge of first instance. Moreover, a Hill to amend the habeas corpus Act is in preparation which stipulates explicitly that the plea must be referred to a judge and prescribes an appeals procedure. As regards banishment, the Public Prosecutor stated that, legally, such a measure could only be taken against foreigners (under the Immigration Law). No law permits the expulsion of nationals, and the measures taken by the previous Government were, in his opinion, arbitrary. There had been no more expulsions since  August .
.Legal proceedings have been instituted in respect of the two cases of murder mentioned in the complaints of the peasants' trade union leaders (Florinda Muoz Soriano in November , and Dionisio Frias in June ). The Secretary and the Under-Secretary of State for Labour said that they would send detailed information regarding the judicial investigations undertaken. It was, they admitted, true that peasant leaders had in the past met their deaths in abnormal circumstances. The new Government, they added, had stated that it would pursue a policy of respect for civil liberties and human rights, including freedom of association. The Undersecretary of State further emphasised the determination of the authorities to abide strictly by the law. The representative of the Director-General also learned from the officials of the Autonomous Confederation of Christian Trade Unions (CASC) that legal proceedings were still pending in the case of the murder of Dionisio Frias; as regards the death of Florinda Muoz Soriano the court had considered that the accused had acted in self-defence.
.The Committee notes these various items of information, in particular the release or the return from exile of the trade unionists mentioned in the complaints. The facts surrounding the deaths of two peasant leaders in  and  have been the subject of trials before the courts one of these cases, moreover, appears to have ended in an acquittal. The Government, while admitting that trade unionists in the rural sector had in the past met their deaths in abnormal circumstances, has stated its will to secure respect for the law and for civil liberties. In these circumstances the Committee is of the opinion that these different points call for no further consideration, provided that it is kept informed of the results of the trials in the cases of the deaths of Dioniso Frias and Florinda Muoz Soriano.
.Allegations concerning the dismissal of trade unionists
.Many allegations referred to the dismissal of trade union leaders and militants. According to the complainants the chief target of these dismissals were the executive Committees of the unions, but certain allegations also referred to the dissolution, or attempted dissolution, of workers' organisations. The representative of the Director-General points out in his report that this issue appeared",0,1974,Dominican Republic
82,"to be a fundamental problem which was still disrupting industrial relations in the country. Although section  of the Labour Code prohibits anti-union practices, the penal sanctions imposed are fines ranging from  to  pesos ( peso  US dollar). According to the report, the Government appears willing to do everything in its power to find a solution:The Secretary and Under-Secretary of State recognise that there have been numerous dismissals and that some cases had apparently involved trade union officials. It was also possible that, in order to get rid of certain leaders, employers had dismissed a whole group of workers. The Government had tried to solve matters through conciliation and mediation and had sometimes succeeded. As it stood, however, the existing legislation did not provide it with the means to do more. Quite apart from the fact that it was difficult to find proof - a problem which is not unique to the Dominican Republic, of course - the Labour Code (section ) allows the employer to terminate a contract for an indefinite period, without giving any reason. Consequently, an employer can dismiss a worker if he finds it convenient provided he pays his employee the amounts to which he is legally entitled (corresponding to the period of notice, the leaving grant and days of leave). This applies even when a collective agreement contains a special clause providing for the protection of union officials. According to existing case law, an employer who fails to respect this provision and dismisses trade union leaders is only required to pay the special indemnity which is provided for in the event of a violation of this clause.
.The report mentions that there are at present proposals to amend the Labour Code, in particular section . The representative of the Director-General mentions the various drafts which have been prepared and adds:The President of the Republic has made a public appeal for a social truce. The representatives of the workers and employers are therefore in the process of negotiating an agreement through the Secretariat of State for Labour. One meeting was held during our mission, and the various inter-occupational Confederations whose officials I met took part in it along with the employers' associations. One of the items for discussion had to do with genuine respect for the freedom of association of workers: the employers' organisations are apparently prepared to guarantee that no trade union leader and no leader of any trade union in the process of being set up will be dismissed from their enterprises except by authorisation of an arbitration Committee. In practice, this amounts to an amendment by agreement of section  of the Labour Code. ... Moreover, it is quite feasible that, following the agreement, the matter will be brought before the Congress in the form of a Bill. The Secretary of State informed me that, even if no agreement is reached, a draft amendment to the law will be submitted on this point. Such an amendment could therefore be adopted without it being necessary to wait for the adoption of a new Labour code.
.As the Committee has already pointed out in other cases, legislation which merely prescribes that any worker dismissed without just cause is entitled in certain cases to compensation and damages in addition to the wage corresponding to the period of notice, does not give sufficient protection against acts of anti-union discrimination, since it enables an employer, on condition that he pays the compensation prescribed by law, to dismiss any member of his staff, whether a member of a trade union or not, for trade union or other activities, the public authorities being powerless to prevent him from doing so. Protection is particularly desirable in the case of trade union officials because, in order to be able to perform their trade union duties in full independence, they must have the guarantee that they will not be prejudiced on account of the mandate which they hold from their trade unions. This guarantee is also necessary to secure respect for the principle that workers' organisations have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom.
.The Dominican Government stated that it was keenly aware of the gaps in its legislation in this respect, and that it was trying to obtain a broad consensus as regards the solution to these difficulties. The Committee considers it essential that this question should be settled in the near future, given the problems which have arisen in the country.
.Allegations concerning unfair practices in the public sector
.The allegations referred to the setting up by the Government of a parallel union in Puerto de Andrs at Boca Chica (communication of August ) and a manoeuvre in the Dominican Telephone Company (CODETEL) to make the National Union of Telephone Workers (SNTT) lose its legal representative character (communication of June ).
.As regards the latter point, the representative of the Director-General wanted to assure himself that the SNTT was exercising its trade union activities fully and that it had recently concluded a collective agreement with the enterprise for the period -. The agreement contains a special clause concerning the protection of trade union officials. Except in the case of a former leader who had been suspended, this provision had been respected. However, the report mentions other cases than that referred to in the previous paragraph in which parallel unions had been set up under the former Government. In this respect the Committee had earlier recalled (in May ) the provision of Article  of Convention No. . Under this provision - as under Article  of the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ), not ratified by the Dominican Republic - workers' organisations must enjoy adequate protection against any act of interference by employers in their establishment, functioning or administration. Article  specifies that acts which are designed to promote the establishment of workers' organisations under the domination of employers or employers' organisations, or to support workers' organisations by financial or other means with the object of placing such organisations under the control of employers or employers' organisations, shall be deemed to constitute acts of interference.
.The Secretary and Under-Secretary of State for Labour declared that the present Government would not endorse or tolerate such practices as the previous Cabinet had done, specifically in the transport sector and the sugar industry. The representative of the Director-General adds the following:In a more general vein, I raised the matter of attempts by employers to interfere in the activities of workers' organisations, and not only in the public sector. On this point the Secretary and Under-Secretary of State said that the current provisions of the Labour Code did not give the Government sufficient scope to combat such practices but that it was nevertheless its policy to try to take action on the basis of the complaints received. They added that it was the Government's attention to introduce proper provisions to put a stop to such acts of interference.The Committee notes these statements and considers it desirable, even if the Government is resolved to tolerate such practices no longer, that legal protection should be strengthened and that the Labour Code should, for example, prescribe more dissuasive sanctions for contraventions of section , the provisions of which are reproduced in the footnote.
.According to the information gathered, several union Confederations also expressed concern at the creation of the General Union of Dominican Workers (UGTD) allied to the political party currently in power (PRD) because they were afraid that the new organisation would receive more favourable treatment, especially in the public sector (the State is the principal employer in certain branches of activity, such as agriculture). Dismissals had already allegedly taken place in the health sector and the sugar-cane industry. This had given rise to a fear that the dismissed workers would be replaced by others who supported the new Government. In some cases this was said to have already begun. The representative of the Director-General explains that, according to the governmental authorities he spoke to, most of the Dominican trade unions were independent of the traditional Confederations and close to the PRD; they were now able to organise themselves and were doing so within the UGTD. The report continues:The Government spokesman went on to say that the dismissals that had taken place in the public sector had not been on trade union grounds. Two points in particular should be borne in mind: in the first place, it was customary in the country to give posts in the public sector to members of the party in power (spoils system); secondly, from the economic standpoint it was necessary to cut down in personnel as the number of employees had sometimes grown far too great. They insisted that the Government would respect the right of freedom of association and ideological pluralism. In any case, legal proceedings could be undertaken against the administration if it was suspected of misuse of power.
.On more than one occasion the Committee has examined cases in which allegations were made that the public authorities had by their",0,1974,Dominican Republic
83,"attitude favoured or discriminated against one or more trade union organisations: examples of such allegations are pressure exerted on workers by means of public statements made by the authorities, unequal distribution of subsidies among unions or the granting to one union, rather than to the other, of premises for holding its meetings or carrying on its activities, and refusal to recognise the leaders of certain organisations in their legitimate activities.& Discrimination by these means or others may be an informal way of influencing the trade union membership of workers. They are therefore sometimes difficult to prove. The fact nevertheless remains, as the Committee has recalled in each of the foregoing cases, that any discrimination of this kind jeopardises the right of workers to set up and join organisations of their own choosing, a right which is explicitly recognised in Article  of Convention No. .
.The Committee also wishes to lay stress on the principles set forth in the resolution concerning the independence of the trade union movement, adopted by the International Labour Conference at its th Session (). The fundamental and permanent mission of the trade union movement, states the resolution, is the economic and social advancement of the workers. When trade unions in accordance with the national law and practice of their respective countries and at the decision of their members decide to establish relations with a political party or to undertake Constitutional political action as a means towards the advancement of their economic and social objectives, such political relations or actions should not be of such a nature as to compromise the continuance of a trade union movement or its social or economic functions irrespective of political changes in the country. The resolution also stresses that governments should not attempt to transform the trade union movement into an instrument for the pursuance of political aims, nor should they attempt to interfere with the normal functions of a trade union movement because of its freely established relationship with a political party.
.Allegations concerning the registration and cancellation of registration of trade unions
.The representative of the Director-General explained that a resolution, No. / of  October , repealed resolutions of  which, by administrative decision, cancelled the registration of numerous trade unions, including the single union of workers of the Central Romana Corporations and Central Romana By Products mentioned in the complaints. Such registration was necessary to enable the trade unions to function. In the preamble to this new resolution it is stated, among other things, that the previous Government was guilty of actions ultra vires by assuming powers that legally belonged to the courts of first instance by virtue of section  of the Labour Code. The preamble also refers to Article  of Convention no. , which prohibits the dissolution or suspension of workers' and employers' organisations by administrative authority. In these circumstances the Committee considers that this aspect of the case calls for no further examination.
.In this connection, the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has observed that according to section  of the Labour Code the registration of a trade union could be refused by the Ministry of Labour. It had asked the Government whether it was possible to appeal to the courts against a refusal to register a trade union. The Under-Secretary of State told the representative of the Director-General that it was possible to appeal against a refusal to register a trade union, as it was to appeal against any administrative act.
.Allegations concerning intervention by the public authorities in the internal affairs of trade unions and occupation of trade union premises
.The problems raised in this connection were of two kinds. The first related to an administrative resolution, No. / of  October , issued by the Secretariat of State for Labour, according to which general assemblies organised with a view to setting up a trade union, federation or Confederation, electing its executive Committee, amending its statutes, merging with other trade unions or affiliating with a federation or Confederation, had to be ""certified"" by a labour inspector. After examining the file on the case and hearing the administration's opinion, the Secretary of state decided whether the trade union can be registered, whether its executive Committee can be recognised, and whether a merger or affiliation can take place, after having previously verified that the legal requirements have been fulfilled. The Committee expressed the view in its th Report that the obligation to accept the presence of a representative of the authorities at general assemblies constituted a restriction upon the free activity of trade unions.
.The representative of the Director-General received the assurance that the resolution would shortly be repealed. The officials he talked with added that, pending the repeal, the authorities would abide by the limitations placed on this text by two rulings of the Supreme Court of Justice. According to the rulings, the powers of the Secretariat of State for Labour in trade union affairs should be interpreted restrictively and the purpose of the presence of an inspector at union assemblies could only be to provide the Secretariat with a report on the circumstances in which the assembly took place and on the decisions adopted. The Court stressed that contesting union elections was a matter for the labour tribunal and not the administrative authorities. According to officials of the CGT, says the report, while the previous Government had used this resolution to commit excesses, the present Government was not applying it in the same spirit.
.The second set of problems raised relates to factual situations: intervention by the authorities in the elections of the Stevedores' Union (POASI); manoeuvres in other undertakings, with the assistance of the authorities, to remove trade union leaders from office; confiscation and misappropriation of the funds of POASI; and occupation of its premises and those- of the National Union of Independent Drivers (UNACHOSIN). In this connection the representative of the Director-General makes the following statement in his report:With regard to the election of trade union leaders, the Secretary and Under-Secretary of State declared that the Supreme Court ruling in the POASI case was a clear case of the infringement of the law by the Government of that period. They confirmed that the POASI had organised elections on  October  and was now operating normally. They also confirmed that the premises of the POASI and UNACHOSIN had been occupied but that a stop had now been put to these measures. The Under-Secretary of State for Labour said that in occupying union premises the previous Government had not respected existing legal provisions. Forcible entry is prohibited by law and misuse of power by public servants is a punishable offence under the Penal Code. As to the allegations concerning POASI funds, he said that this was now past history and that the POASI was currently verifying its financial records. If any misappropriation of funds was brought to light, the matter would be brought before the competent authorities.
.The representative of the Director-General continues:In more general terms, the Secretary of State for the Interior and for the Police informed me that meetings organised on union premises were allowed to take place unhindered and that no authorisation was required open-air meetings were another matter and did require authorisation, and the appropriate decisions were taken in the light of all relevant factors: importance of the date for the union ( May, for example), traffic problems, proximity of an important building (hospital, for example), etc.
.The Committee notes that a solution has now been found to the factual problems raised in the complaints. It also notes the intention of the Government to repeal Resolution No. / mentioned above and trusts that this measure will be taken in the near future.
.Allegations concerning interference with the right to strike
.Complaints were also made with reference to the exercise of the right to strike. In this connection, the representative of the Director-General points out, the labour authorities have recognised that it was virtually impossible to engage in strike action in the present state of the legislation. Such action could only last for a few days because judges were empowered to order a return to work. The report adds:It is significant that the Labour Code only authorises strike action within very strict limits (see sections ,  and ): for example, more than  per cent of the employees concerned must have voted in favour of the strike; a strike cannot take place if one of the parties decides to submit the dispute to arbitration; and it must come to an end upon the expiry of the legal time limit for the resumption of work ordered by the judge. The right to strike is restricted even further by the provisions governing arbitration procedure: the presiding judge can appoint the arbitrators ex officio or at the request of the Secretary of State for Labour (section ) and may order the resumption of work (section ; see also sections  to  and ). The arbitration award has the effect of a collective agreement (section",0,1974,Dominican Republic
84,"). The Secretary of State adds that the judge orders the resumption of work but that, moreover, arbitrators were not appointed. The Under-Secretary told me that he knew of hardly any case where a strike had been recognised as legal. In the past the police had often intervened and an appeal to the tribunal was barely conceivable under these conditions. Nowadays, whenever a collective labour dispute arose, the Government tried to reconcile the parties; often the employers accepted to reinstate at least some of the strikers, and the police no longer intervened. However, he added that in the current period of transition he would not hesitate to apply the sections of the Labour code that empowered him to prevent a strike if he felt that public order was threatened - although this situation had not arisen.
.The representative of the Director-General referred to information according to which the party in power, the PRD, had undertaken to revise the Labour Code so as to make it more liberal; the debate on the subject had already begun in the legislative chambers. The question of the right to strike had not yet been taken up, but the Secretary of State for Labour said that he intended to propose the adoption of liberal provisions in this respect as he wanted to bring Dominican legislation fully into line with the ILO's standards and principles respecting freedom of association.
.The Committee has always considered the right to strike as one of the essential means by which workers and their organisations may promote and defend their occupational interests it has held that restrictions or prohibitions on the right to strike are admissible only under certain conditions, in particular in the public service and in essential services (in the strict sense of the term). In the latter cases, it has added, such restrictions should be accompanied by adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures in which the parties can take part at every stage, and at which the awards are binding on both parties in all cases. Such awards should be executed rapidly and completely.
.The Committee notes the Government's intention to revise its legislation on this important question. It has also noted that the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has made certain observations on the present strike legislation. It would be desirable that the envisaged amendments should be adopted at an early date.
.Allegations concerning the trade union rights of agricultural workers
.This aspect of the case was the subject both of a complaint and of observations by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, which considered that the exclusion of certain rural workers from the field of application of the provisions of the Labour Code which guaranteed the right of association was incompatible with Convention No. . In this connection the representative of the Director-General states the following:When asked about this, the Secretary and Under-Secretary of State for Labour explained that under the previous regime there had in practice been a certain amount of opposition to unionisation. On the other hand, the present Government was trying to meet and encourage the participation of peasants' representatives. Under the Labour Code agricultural workers were entitled to set up trade unions. According to section , the provisions of the Code do not apply to any agricultural undertaking, agricultural undertaking of an industrial type or stock raising or forestry undertaking which does not continuously and permanently employ more than ten persons, but this refers to the undertakings themselves and not to the workers. As the Secretary of State pointed out, this means that the workers cannot set up a works union and, in fact, section  of the Code stipulates that associations of employees must have not less than  members. However, nothing prevents them from setting up an occupational ""class"" union. The government authorities I spoke to actually cited two federations that were registered with the Secretariat of State for Labour (and therefore possess juridical personality)
.The information gathered by the representative of the Director-General refers both to the de facto situation and to certain legal difficulties. From the latter point of view the authorities have provided the necessary explanations, even though it would be desirable for the Labour Code to be more explicit in recognising the right of all rural workers to form unions. It would also appear that the de facto situation has improved, and the Committee takes note of this development.
.Allegations concerning the trade union rights of teachers and public servants
.The complainants mention the specific case of a teachers' union, the Dominican Teachers' Association (ADP), which the public authorities refused to recognise. In its th Report the Committee referred to the comments of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations and expressed concern at the position of public officials and public servants in general, who are excluded from the Labour Code and thereby deprived of the trade union rights proclaimed by the Code.
.The ADP, reports the representative of the Director-General, was granted legal personality in January . Another union - the National Union of Educators (UNE) - was registered at the Secretariat of State for Labour in accordance with the provisions of the Labour Code. These two organisations were theoretically for teachers from the private sector; however, according to their by-laws and, with the tacit assent of the public authorities, teachers from the public sector were also allowed to join.
.Generally speaking, public servants and other persons employed by the public authorities are excluded, with certain exceptions, from labour legislation (section  of the Labour Code, Act No.  of  July ] and are therefore deprived of the guarantees provided for therein with respect to freedom of association. Furthermore, the representative of the Director-General refers to an Act, No.  of  November , which prohibits any propaganda activity or attempt to encourage people to join trade unions within public and municipal administrations or autonomous state institutions (section ). ""According to government officials"", he writes, ""this latter provision means in effect that all trade union activity in the public sector is prohibited. Outside the public service in the strict sense, however, individual statutes do provide for the right to organise.""
.The report continues:The Secretary of State for Labour said that, although the right for public servants to join trade unions was not recognised, their right of association on the basis of Act No.  on non-profit-making associations was fully guaranteed. As early as  the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations had, however, made a number of comments on this Act, which contains provisions (for example, section  which refers to the dissolution of an association by the executive authority) whose application could constitute an infringement of Convention No. . The trade union organisations with which I had discussions were highly critical of this legislation: Act No.  permits the creation of cultural or mutual assistance associations but, according to them, not of real workers' organisations entitled, for instance, to submit claims and to negotiate collectively. Moreover, it is the Government which is responsible for registering and recognising these associations, which are not governed by the Labour Code. However, according to the UGTD, although trade union legislation would be preferable these associations do nevertheless permit workers to organise themselves and to defend their interests and they are also able to take legal action. According to the Under-Secretary of State for Labour, the Government accepts the activities of organisations set up to defend the interests of public servants. Thus, for instance, a Dominican Public Service Federation (FEDOMEPIA) has been created. The Secretary of State added that he intended to propose a new public service status which would sanction the right to organise in this sector.
.The Committee has often stressed, and particularly in two recent cases, that the standards on freedom of association embodied in Convention No.  apply to all workers ""without distinction whatsoever"", and are therefore applicable to employees of the State. It was indeed considered inequitable to draw any distinction in trade union matters between workers in the private sector and public servants, since persons in either category are permitted to become organised for the defence of their interests. It was also made clear during the preparatory work on Convention No.  that recognition of the right of association of public servants in no way prejudges the question of the right of such officials to strike. Their special situation has, as mentioned earlier, led the Committee to admit that this right could be restricted for public servants.
.The Committee takes note of the information gathered regarding the present opportunities for state personnel to join associations for the defence of their occupational interests, and on the reforms envisaged. It nevertheless considers it essential that the right of all public servants to organise should be fully recognised in the near future, and in this connection notes that the question is the subject of an examination and observations by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions",0,1974,Dominican Republic
85,"and Recommendations.
.The right to form federations and Confederations
.During the direct contacts mission discussions were also held with the authorities on a restriction imposed by legislation on the right to form federations and Confederations. In this connection the representative of the Director-General writes:Finally, the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations noted that Resolution No. / of the Secretariat of State for Labour requires a minimum of seven trade unions to form a federation and four federations - or three federations of craft unions - to form a Confederation. The Committee considered that these provisions restricted the right of organisations to establish federations and Confederations as provided in Article  of the Convention. The Secretary of State informed me that the purpose of this text was to avoid the proliferation of trade union federations and Confederations. However, when I explained to him the point of view of the ILO supervisory bodies on the matter as a whole, he informed me that the resolution would very shortly be repealed.
.Although this matter has not been the subject of complaints, the Committee takes note of this information, to which it draws the attention of the Committee of Experts.
.Generally speaking, the Committee notes that due to the recent change in Government there has been a favourable development in the trade union situation in the country since the complaints were presented. Although certain matters remain to be settled - in particular the question of dismissals of trade unionists and certain alleged discriminatory practices in the public sector - a solution has now been found to the other points raised by the complainants and amendments to the trade union legislation on the points raised by the Committee and the Committee of Experts are under examination.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the death, arrest or banishment of trade unionists:
.Since  the Committee has been called upon to examine numerous complaints of infringement of freedom of association in the Dominican Republic, presented by the following organisations: world Confederation of Labour (WCL), world Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), International Metalworkers' Federation (IMF), World Federation of Teachers' Unions, General Workers' Federation (CGT), National Federation of Dockworkers, Stevedores' Union (POASI), National Union of Heavy Machinery Operators (SINOMAPE), National Union of Telephone Workers (SNTT). These complaints have been examined as Cases Nos. , , , ,  and .
.In these complaints allegations were made relating, inter alia, to the death, arrest and banishment of trade unionists, dismissals on account of trade union activities, the dismantling of trade union organisations, intervention by the public authorities in the internal affairs of trade unions (meetings, elections, trade union funds), the occupation of trade union premises, interference with the right to strike and the trade union rights of teachers and agricultural workers.
.The subject-matter of these complaints was brought to the attention of the Government as the complaints were received. The Government provided comments on several of the allegations.
.The Committee examined Case No.  at its sessions in May and November , when it submitted interim reports to the Governing Body, A further interim report was submitted by the Committee to the Governing Body with respect to Case No.  and Cases Nos. , ,  and  in May . The Committee again examined all the cases pending with regard to the Dominican Republic at its November  session 
.At its may  session the Committee observed that although the Government had submitted comments and information on several of the allegations made, the Committee possessed insufficient information to enable it to reach conclusions at that stage regarding the substance of the various issues raised. The Committee recalled, moreover, that it had already examined, on several occasions, cases concerning the Dominican Republic which involved allegations similar to those made in the present cases. In these circumstances, the Committee considered that it would be very useful to apply the direct contacts procedure. The Governing Body, accordingly, requested the Government to consider the possibility of giving its consent to the carrying out of a study in the Dominican Republic of the facts surrounding the complaints by a representative of the Director-General, who would report to the Committee thereon.
.No reply having been received from the Government in November  and February  the Committee invited it to give its early consideration to the request for direct contacts and to communicate its decision in this connection as soon as possible.
.In May , in the continued absence of any communication from the Government in this connection, the Committee decided to apply the special procedure provided for in paragraphs  and  of its th Report. Under this procedure, the Government was immediately informed that the Chairman of the Committee would, on behalf of the Committee, make contact with its representatives attending the rd Session of the International Labour Conference, draw their attention to the particular cases involved and discuss with them the reasons for the delay in transmitting the observations requested. The Chairman was then to report to the Committee on the results of such contacts. However, since the Government did not designate any representative to the rd Session of the Conference, the said procedure could not be applied.
.In a letter dated  August , the Government stated that it was considering the request it had received to accept the visit of a representative of the Director-General, and added that a final reply would be given when it was in the interests of the country to do so.
.At its November  session the Committee expressed its regret at the Government's delay in acceding to the request made of it to give its consent to the visit of a representative of the Director-General. In this connection, the Committee emphasised that the purpose of the whole procedure was to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and expressed its confidence that, if this procedure protected governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their part would recognise the importance for the protection of their own good name of co-operating with the Committee in every way so that it could examine the allegations fully and seek possible solutions to the problems involved. The Committee moreover laid particular stress on the importance it attached to the direct contacts procedure.
.In these circumstances, the Governing Body, on the Committee's recommendation,(a) urged the Government to give its consent without delay to an inquiry into the trade union situation being carried out in the Dominican Republic by a representative of the Director-General;(b) requested the Director-General to contact the Government at the highest possible level so as to express the concern of the Committee and to insist that the Government should give a favourable response to the request for direct contacts.
.In February , the Committee noted that in spite of the reminders sent to the Government on this question the Government had not replied. The Committee deplored the fact that the Government of the Dominican Republic had shown no desire to cooperate with the procedures available in the field of trade union rights. In these circumstances, the Governing Body decided that, in the event of no reply being received from the Government before its next session, wider publicity should be given to the allegations, to the replies of the Government, to the recommendations of the Committee and to the obstructive attitude of the Government's.
.Since then, no reply has been received from the Government.
.The Dominican Republic has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee must first of all deplore the fact that, notwithstanding the insistent and repeated requests addressed to the Government at the highest level, the Government has failed to reply to the proposal made by the Committee and the Governing Body that recourse be had to direct contacts. In view of the importance and seriousness of the matters raised in the complaints and the inadequacy of the information at its disposal, the Committee remains convinced that a visit to the Dominican Republic by a representative of the Director-General would have afforded an opportunity to gain a greater insight into the trade union situation and give fruitful consideration to possible solutions to the problems involved.
.Before taking up each of the matters raised by the complainants, the Committee wishes to emphasise the importance of the cases under consideration, which raise serious issues pertaining to freedom of association and human rights in relation to trade union rights. In this connection the Committee expresses its deep concern at the acuteness and diversity of the problems faced by a substantial part of the Dominican trade union movement in a wide variety of branches of activity.
.The Committee notes in particular that, according to the allegations, certain trade union organisations, in many cases of nation-wide importance, have for many years been having great difficulty in carrying on their activities owing to the multiple obstacles that have been put in their path: arrest and dismissal of",0,1974,Dominican Republic
86,"their leaders, occupation of their premises, interference in their internal affairs. Such an atmosphere cannot be conducive to the development of a truly free and independent trade union movement, nor to the promotion of normal industrial relations. The Committee wishes to emphasise before proceeding any further that, as stated in the resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties adopted by the International Labour Conference in , the absence of civil liberties removes all meaning from the concept of trade union rights, and the rights conferred upon workers' and employers' organisations must be based on respect for those civil liberties.
.The allegations refer to a considerable number of murders of officials of workers' organisations, especially in the agricultural sector, committed in most cases by employers or overseers. In the absence of any detailed information on these cases from the Government, the Committee feels bound to observe that the Government has not established that these deaths occurred for reasons unconnected with the status or activities of the officials in question. The Committee considers that, in any event, the circumstances of these cases should have prompted the authorities to take effective steps to establish the facts, punish the culprits and restore the situation to normal, this being an essential prerequisite for the free exercise of trade union rights.
.Many of the complaints mention the arrest and detention of officials of various trade union organisations. Contradictory explanations as to the reasons for these measures have been given by the complainants and by the Government. According to the former they were due to trade union activities, while the latter has claimed in general terms that the officials in question were arrested for breaches of laws in respect of public order or for common-law offences.
.Be this as it may, the Committee must observe that the Government has not supplied detailed information as to the acts of which the persons arrested were accused, thus preventing the Committee from examining the allegations with all the facts before it. The Committee considers that the onus was on the Government to show that the measures it had taken were not prompted by the trade union activities of the persons concerned.
.While most of the trade unionists mentioned in the complaints appear to have now recovered their freedom, it has none the less been clearly established that some of them were kept in custody for relatively lengthy periods of time, in some cases at repeated intervals. It is impossible to determine from the Government's replies whether the persons concerned were brought before the courts. Only in a few cases does it appear from the information supplied by the complainants that legal proceedings were initiated against the trade union officials concerned. One of them was moreover kept in prison even though he had been found not guilty by a court of first instance.
.The Committee must recall in this connection that it is one of the fundamental rights of the individual that a detained person should be brought without delay before the appropriate judge, this right being recognised in such instruments as the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man. In the case of persons engaged in trade union activities, this is one of the civil liberties which should be ensured by the authorities in order to guarantee the full effectiveness of the exercise of trade union rights. The Committee further wishes to point out that the detention by the authorities of trade unionists concerning whom no grounds for prosecution are subsequently found is liable to involve restrictions on trade union rights, and governments should take steps to ensure that the authorities concerned have instructions appropriate to eliminate the danger of detention for trade union activities.
.According to the complainants, the authorities have also ordered the expulsion from the country of certain trade union officials. One of them was refused entry into the Dominican Republic on his return from an international trade union conference. In the Committee's opinion, a measure exiling trade unionists, which is in violation of human rights, is of particular gravity since it deprives the persons concerned of the possibility of working in their country and of contacts with their families. It is also in violation of freedom of association in that it undermines the trade union organisations which are thereby deprived of their leaders.
.According to the information supplied by the complainants, many trade union officials and members have been dismissed from their jobs in a large number of undertakings covering a wide range of activities. In most of these cases it has been alleged that the sole ground for the action in question was the trade union activities of the persons concerned. In some cases the underlying intention was stated to be the dismantling of trade unions, though this has been denied by the Government. The Government has however admitted that some undertakings engage in practices hardly conducive to the development of sound industrial relations which it cannot combat effectively under the legislation in force.
.The Committee considers that no person should be discriminated against on account of his trade union membership or activities, and that governments should take measures to ensure that workers are protected against acts, including dismissal, which are likely to provoke or have as their object anti-union discrimination in respect of employment. Legislation enabling employers in practice - on condition that they pay the compensation prescribed by law for cases of unjustified dismissal - to get rid of any worker, even if the true reason is his trade union membership or activities, does not give sufficient protection against acts of anti-union discrimination.
.Protection against acts of anti-union discrimination is particularly desirable in the case of trade union officials, because, in order to carry out their trade union functions in full independence, they must have the assurance that they will not be victimised by virtue of their trade union office. Such an assurance is also necessary to ensure that effect is given to the principle that workers' organisations should have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom .
.A large number of trade union organisations appear to have been dismantled over the past few years, either through the withdrawal of their legal personality or through the setting up of parallel unions or through their destruction by employers. In answer to these allegations the Government has merely stated that the great majority of the organisations in question are still in existence but their leaders have been removed from office by decision of their members. The Committee does not have sufficient information to enable it to express an opinion on these matters in full knowledge of the facts. In particular, it has not been specified whether the legal personality of the trade union mentioned by the complainants was withdrawn by order of the administrative authorities or as a result of court proceedings. The Committee notes, however, that under the terms of section  of the Labour Code, the registration of a trade union may be cancelled by a decision of the courts if the trade union pursues activities not connected with its lawful objectives.
.As concerns the setting up of parallel unions and the destruction of trade unions by employers, the Committee wishes to recall that under the terms of Article  of Convention No. , ratified by the Dominican Republic, workers' and employers' organisations must enjoy adequate protection against any acts of interference by each other or each other's agents or members in their establishment, functioning or administration. Article  specifies that acts which are designed to promote the establishment of workers' organisations under the domination of employers or employers' organisations, or to support workers' organisations by financial or other means with the object of placing such organisations under the control of employers or employers' organisations, shall be deemed to constitute acts of interference.
.The allegations of interference by public authorities in the internal affairs of trade unions are mainly concerned with the right of assembly, the right to elect officials in full freedom and trade union funds. The Committee considers that freedom of assembly for trade union purposes constitutes one of the fundamental elements of trade union rights, and that the authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof. The obligation to accept the presence of a representative of the authorities at general assemblies constitutes a restriction upon the free activity of trade unions.
.With regard to trade union elections, the complainants stated that rigged elections had been held in the POASI union and that the Supreme Court had ruled them to be illegal. According to more recent information supplied by the Government, properly conducted elections were subsequently held in this union. In this connection the Committee wishes once again to emphasise the importance it attaches to the principle that workers and their organisations should have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom.
.The POASI is also alleged by the complainants to have had its assets confiscated.",1,1974,Dominican Republic
87,"According to the Government these allegations are false. In view of the contradictory nature of these statements, the Committee can only recall the importance of the principle that trade union funds should be adequately protected.
.It appears from the allegations made that the headquarters of certain trade union organisations have been occupied by the police, in some cases several times. The latest intervention of this kind - involving the POASI - seems to have been quite recent. In this connection the Committee wishes to draw the Government's attention to the fact that, in the resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties, the International Labour Conference, expressed the view that the right to protection of the property of trade union organisations was one of the civil liberties which were essential for the normal exercise of trade union rights. While trade unions cannot claim immunity from a search of their premises, such a search should only be made following the issue of a warrant by the ordinary judicial authority after that authority has been satisfied that reasonable grounds exist for supposing that evidence exists on the said premises material to a prosecution for an offence under the ordinary law and provided that such search is restricted to the purposes in respect of which the warrant was issued.
.With regard to the allegations relating to interference with the right to strike, the Committee recalls that the right to strike is one of the essential means through which workers and their organisations may promote and defend their occupational interests. The Committee points out in this connection that on several occasions the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has made comments with respect to sections  to  of the Labour Code, which allow all cases of collective labour disputes to be referred to arbitration, culminating in a binding award, which might severely restrict the right to strike and thus infringe the right of trade unions to organise their activities. As concerns the calling in of the police to obstruct, according to the complainants, the exercise of the right to strike, the Committee considers that intervention by security forces in the event of strikes should be limited to the maintenance of public order.
.As concerns the Government's refusal to recognise the legal existence of the Dominican Teachers' Association, the Committee refers to the comments of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations with respect to the position of public servants in the Dominican Republic, who are excluded from the Labour code and thereby deprived of the trade union rights proclaimed by the Code. The Committee recalls that public servants, including teachers, are entitled to enjoy the right to organise, just as other workers are.
.A number of complaints were partly concerned with the trade union situation in the agricultural sector. This branch of activity does indeed seem to have been particularly affected by extremely serious incidents, sometimes involving the death of trade union officials. In addition, according to the complainants, the Government has prevented agricultural workers from organising themselves freely, even though their trade union rights are recognised by law. The Committee wishes in this connection to emphasise the particular importance the International Labour Conference attached to the trade union rights of rural workers in adopting the Rural Workers' Organisations Convention (No. ) in . Article  of this Convention provides that it shall be an objective of national policy concerning rural development to facilitate the establishment and growth, on a voluntary basis, of strong and independent organisations of rural workers as an effective means of ensuring the participation of rural workers, without discrimination, in economic and social development and in the benefits resulting therefrom.
.In these circumstances, as concerns the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the Government's attention to the considerations and principles set forth in paragraphs  to  concerning the death, arrest, banishment and dismissal of trade unionists, the dismantling of trade union organisations, intervention by public authorities in the internal affairs of trade unions, the occupation of trade union premises, the right to strike and the trade union rights of teachers and agricultural workers;(b) to deplore the obstructive attitude and lack of co-operation shown by the Government, which, by not consenting to a mission on the spot, and by not transmitting its replies on the questions before the Committee has made it impossible to obtain all the information on the serious allegations made and to decide what measures could be taken as regards the problems involved;(c) to decide to give wider publicity to the present report, in particular during the next session of the International Labour Conference.Geneva,  May . (Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.
.The Committee has already examined several complaints of infringements of trade union rights in the Dominican Republic, presented by the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), the International Metalworkers' Federation (IMF), the National Union of Heavy Machinery Operators (SINOMAPE), the National Federation of Dockworkers, the Stevedores' Union (POASI) and the General Workers' Federation (CGT). These complaints were dealt with under Cases Nos. , , ,  and . With regard to Case No. , the Committee submitted a number of conclusions to the Governing Body that appear in paragraphs  to  of its st Report and in paragraphs  to  of its rd Report. The Committee also examined Case No.  and Cases Nos. , ,  and  in its th Report (paragraphs  to ) in which it also submitted certain conclusions to the Governing Body.
.Since then, further allegations have been received in connection with these cases. They have been made by the WFTU (communication of  July ), the National Union of Telephone Workers (communications of  July  and  September ), the POASI and the CGT (joint communication of  April ) and the CGT (communication of  June ).
.The World Federation of Teachers' Unions also submitted allegations in a letter of  May  (Case No. ).
.The Government submitted certain information in a letter of  August .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee notes the information communicated by the Government which recognises, in particular, that, in certain undertakings, practices exist that are not conducive to the development of healthy labour management relations and to which it cannot effectively put a stop under the legislation currently in force. New complaints have been received containing allegations that are as serious and as varied as those previously examined. It should be borne in mind, moreover, that the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has for several years been making observations on the application by the Dominican Republic of Conventions Nos.  and , which it has ratified.
.The Committee regrets the Government's delay in acceding to the request made of it to give its consent to the visit of a representative of the Director-General. In this connection, the Committee wishes to emphasise that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and the Committee is confident that, if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their part will recognise the importance for the protection of their own good name of co-operating with the Committee in every way so that it can examine the allegations fully and seek possible solutions to the problems involved. In paragraphs  to  of its th Report, the Committee has laid particular stress on the importance it attaches in this connection to the direct contacts procedure.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to urge the Government to give its consent without delay to an inquiry into the trade union situation being carried out in the Dominican Republic by a representative of the Director General;(b) to request the Director-General to contact the Government at the highest possible level so as to express the concern of the Committee and to insist that the Government should give a favourable response to the request made above;(c) to take note of this interim report.
.The Committee already examined Case No.  in May and November  and on each occasion it submitted a report to the Governing Body. These reports appear in paragraphs  to  of the Committee's st report and paragraphs  to  of its rd report.
.In its rd Report, the Committee recommended that the Governing Body request the Government to provide additional information on one aspect of the matter. Despite repeated requests, this information was not received. The Committee, therefore, addressed urgent appeals to the Government in November  and February and May  that it supply the information requested. In November  and February , the Committee noted with regret that despite its appeals the requested information still had not been received. In May ",1,1974,Dominican Republic
88,"it again made an urgent appeal to the Government to supply the information.
.Regarding Cases Nos. , ,  and , the complaints and additional information submitted by the complainants appear in the following communications: three communications, of  October ,  September  and  June , from the National Union of Heavy Machinery Operators (SINOMAPE), a communication of  November , from the National Federation of Dockworkers, two communications, of  May  and  November , from the Stevedores' Union (POASI), a communication of  August , from the General Workers' Federation (CGT), two communications, of  September  and  July , from the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), three communications, of  November ,  July and  October , from the World Confederation of Labour (WCL).
.These complaints were transmitted to the Government as they were received, with requests for observations. Apart from some very general replies sent by communications of  January and  July , and despite the time which had elapsed since the presentation of the first complaints (Case No. ), the Committee received no information from the Government on the various allegations. In November  and May , the Committee sent urgent requests to the Government to submit the information requested (Case No. ).
.As the information requested on all these cases was not received, the Committee asked the Director-General in November  to communicate with the highest level of the Government, on behalf of the Committee, expressing the Committee's concern and urgently requesting the Government to provide the observations requested from it (Cases Nos. , ,  and ). The Government finally submitted information by communications of ,  and  February .

89,".Since  the Committee has had before it numerous complaints of violation of freedom of association in the Dominican Republic. These complaints come from the following workers' organisations: World Confederation of Labour (WCL), World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), International Metalworkers' Federation (IMF), World Federation of Teachers' Unions, General Workers' Federation, National Federation of Dockworkers, Stevedores' Union (POASI), National Union of Heavy Machinery Operators (SINOMAPE), and National Union of Telephone Workers (SNTT). They are dealt with in Cases Nos. , , , ,  and .
.The Committee examined Case No.  in May and November  and at each of these sessions presented conclusions to the Governing Body. The Committee submitted further conclusions to the Governing Body (on Cases Nos. , , ,  and ) in May . Finally, it examined all the outstanding cases relating to the Dominican Republic in November  and May .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In May  the Committee considered that the information at its disposal seemed insufficient to enable it to reach conclusions regarding the substance of the various issues raised. It had already examined, on several occasions, cases concerning the Dominican Republic which contained allegations similar to those made in the cases under examination. In these circumstances it considered that it would be very useful to apply the direct contacts procedure. The Governing Body accordingly requested the Government to consider the possibility of giving its consent to the carrying out of a study in the Dominican Republic of the facts surrounding the complaints by a representative of the Director-General.
.This request was repeated on a number of occasions. In addition, new complaints were presented which, like the earlier ones, contained a variety of serious allegations. Since no detailed reply had been received by May , the Committee had been obliged to formulate its conclusions on the cases in its th Report. However, the new Dominican Government constituted after the elections in May  accepted direct contacts by letter of  September .
.The Director-General appointed Mr. Jean-Michel Servais, an official of the Freedom of Association Branch of the International Labour Standards Department, to represent him during this mission. The visit to the country took place from  to  November , and a report on the mission was submitted to the Committee. During his visit, the representative of the Director-General had conversations with the Secretary of State for Labour and the Secretary of State for the Interior and the Police, with the Under-Secretaries of State for Labour and the Under-Secretaries o?State for the Interior and for the Police, and with the Public Prosecutor of the Republic. He was also received by the President of the Supreme Court of Justice. He met the leaders of a number of trade union organisations - including those of two of the complainant organisations, CGT and POASI - on their trade union premises. Finally, he had discussions at the headquarters of the Employers' Confederation of the Dominican Republic with the officials of this organisation, and with those of the Association of Industries of the Dominican Republic.
.The Committee notes with satisfaction that the representative of the Director-General enjoyed the co-operation of all concerned. He was able to carry out all his tasks in full freedom and independence and the Dominican Government afforded him the necessary facilities to perform his mission in the best possible circumstances.
.The representative of the Director-General collected information on the various issues raised in the complaints and on the measures taken or envisaged to solve the problems encountered. At the invitation of the Government he also discussed the comments made by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations during its periodic examination of the application of Conventions Nos.  and  under article  of the ILO Constitution. All these points are examined in the paragraphs which follow.
.First of all, however, it should be pointed out that, according to the representative of the Director-General, a number of Confederations are at present contending for the allegiance of the workers and the control of the works unions. ""Thus"", he writes, ""at the time of my visit antagonism had taken a very serious turn in the Central Romana Corporations and Central Romana By-Products enterprise, a situation which seems likely to continue, if not to deteriorate further, in the coming months."" Trade union Confederations often maintain close political relations with political parties. The General Union of Dominican Workers (UGTD), which was set up very recently, is in sympathy with the Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD). As will be seen later on the Government has been accused of favouring this new organisation to a certain extent. A similar preoccupation is revealed in a telegram of  December  from the General Workers' Federation (CGT), in which this organisation protests against the administrative order allegedly given by the Government to close down the programme of the ""Rutas"" radio station at La Romana and its alleged prevention of the reorganisation of the local union. This communication has been transmitted to the Government for its observations. The employers' representatives, the report continues, have expressed the view that this situation has created a tense atmosphere in industrial relations on the other hand, it appears that large numbers of unions are now being formed in the present social circumstances.
.Allegations concerning the death, arrest or banishment of trade unionists
.As the mission report states, an amnesty law was passed on  September . All the trade unionists who were mentioned as having been under arrest have now been released. In addition, the banished trade unionists have recently returned to the country under the amnesty law and after the removal of administrative obstacles to their return.
.Finally, it appears from the information gathered that under the Code of Penal Procedure any person who is detained must be brought before a judge within  hours of his arrest. In addition, an old habeas corpus Act protects individuals against arbitrary arrest. In the past, according to the Public Prosecutor of the Republic, the practice was to refer pleas of this nature to the Public Ministry ""which sometimes took rather arbitrary decisions""; this has now been changed and the pleas come before a judge of first instance. Moreover, a Hill to amend the habeas corpus Act is in preparation which stipulates explicitly that the plea must be referred to a judge and prescribes an appeals procedure. As regards banishment, the Public Prosecutor stated that, legally, such a measure could only be taken against foreigners (under the Immigration Law). No law permits the expulsion of nationals, and the measures taken by the previous Government were, in his opinion, arbitrary. There had been no more expulsions since  August .
.Legal proceedings have been instituted in respect of the two cases of murder mentioned in the complaints of the peasants' trade union leaders (Florinda Muoz Soriano in November , and Dionisio Frias in June ). The Secretary and the Under-Secretary of State for Labour said that they would send detailed information regarding the judicial investigations undertaken. It was, they admitted, true that peasant leaders had in the past met their deaths in abnormal circumstances. The new Government, they added, had stated that it would pursue a policy of respect for civil liberties and human rights, including freedom of association. The Undersecretary of State further emphasised the determination of the authorities to abide strictly by the law. The representative of the Director-General also learned from the officials of the Autonomous Confederation of Christian Trade Unions (CASC) that legal proceedings were still pending in the case of the murder of Dionisio Frias; as regards the death of Florinda Muoz Soriano the court had considered that the accused had acted in self-defence.
.The Committee notes these various items of information, in particular the release or the return from exile of the trade unionists mentioned in the complaints. The facts surrounding the deaths of two peasant leaders in  and  have been the subject of trials before the courts one of these cases, moreover, appears to have ended in an acquittal. The Government, while admitting that trade unionists in the rural sector had in the past met their deaths in abnormal circumstances, has stated its will to secure respect for the law and for civil liberties. In these circumstances the Committee is of the opinion that these different points call for no further consideration, provided that it is kept informed of the results of the trials in the cases of the deaths of Dioniso Frias and Florinda Muoz Soriano.
.Allegations concerning the dismissal of trade unionists
.Many allegations referred to the dismissal of trade union leaders and militants. According to the complainants the chief target of these dismissals were the executive Committees of the unions, but certain allegations also referred to the dissolution, or attempted dissolution, of workers' organisations. The representative of the Director-General points out in his report that this issue appeared",0,1975,Dominican Republic
90,"to be a fundamental problem which was still disrupting industrial relations in the country. Although section  of the Labour Code prohibits anti-union practices, the penal sanctions imposed are fines ranging from  to  pesos ( peso  US dollar). According to the report, the Government appears willing to do everything in its power to find a solution:The Secretary and Under-Secretary of State recognise that there have been numerous dismissals and that some cases had apparently involved trade union officials. It was also possible that, in order to get rid of certain leaders, employers had dismissed a whole group of workers. The Government had tried to solve matters through conciliation and mediation and had sometimes succeeded. As it stood, however, the existing legislation did not provide it with the means to do more. Quite apart from the fact that it was difficult to find proof - a problem which is not unique to the Dominican Republic, of course - the Labour Code (section ) allows the employer to terminate a contract for an indefinite period, without giving any reason. Consequently, an employer can dismiss a worker if he finds it convenient provided he pays his employee the amounts to which he is legally entitled (corresponding to the period of notice, the leaving grant and days of leave). This applies even when a collective agreement contains a special clause providing for the protection of union officials. According to existing case law, an employer who fails to respect this provision and dismisses trade union leaders is only required to pay the special indemnity which is provided for in the event of a violation of this clause.
.The report mentions that there are at present proposals to amend the Labour Code, in particular section . The representative of the Director-General mentions the various drafts which have been prepared and adds:The President of the Republic has made a public appeal for a social truce. The representatives of the workers and employers are therefore in the process of negotiating an agreement through the Secretariat of State for Labour. One meeting was held during our mission, and the various inter-occupational Confederations whose officials I met took part in it along with the employers' associations. One of the items for discussion had to do with genuine respect for the freedom of association of workers: the employers' organisations are apparently prepared to guarantee that no trade union leader and no leader of any trade union in the process of being set up will be dismissed from their enterprises except by authorisation of an arbitration Committee. In practice, this amounts to an amendment by agreement of section  of the Labour Code. ... Moreover, it is quite feasible that, following the agreement, the matter will be brought before the Congress in the form of a Bill. The Secretary of State informed me that, even if no agreement is reached, a draft amendment to the law will be submitted on this point. Such an amendment could therefore be adopted without it being necessary to wait for the adoption of a new Labour code.
.As the Committee has already pointed out in other cases, legislation which merely prescribes that any worker dismissed without just cause is entitled in certain cases to compensation and damages in addition to the wage corresponding to the period of notice, does not give sufficient protection against acts of anti-union discrimination, since it enables an employer, on condition that he pays the compensation prescribed by law, to dismiss any member of his staff, whether a member of a trade union or not, for trade union or other activities, the public authorities being powerless to prevent him from doing so. Protection is particularly desirable in the case of trade union officials because, in order to be able to perform their trade union duties in full independence, they must have the guarantee that they will not be prejudiced on account of the mandate which they hold from their trade unions. This guarantee is also necessary to secure respect for the principle that workers' organisations have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom.
.The Dominican Government stated that it was keenly aware of the gaps in its legislation in this respect, and that it was trying to obtain a broad consensus as regards the solution to these difficulties. The Committee considers it essential that this question should be settled in the near future, given the problems which have arisen in the country.
.Allegations concerning unfair practices in the public sector
.The allegations referred to the setting up by the Government of a parallel union in Puerto de Andrs at Boca Chica (communication of August ) and a manoeuvre in the Dominican Telephone Company (CODETEL) to make the National Union of Telephone Workers (SNTT) lose its legal representative character (communication of June ).
.As regards the latter point, the representative of the Director-General wanted to assure himself that the SNTT was exercising its trade union activities fully and that it had recently concluded a collective agreement with the enterprise for the period -. The agreement contains a special clause concerning the protection of trade union officials. Except in the case of a former leader who had been suspended, this provision had been respected. However, the report mentions other cases than that referred to in the previous paragraph in which parallel unions had been set up under the former Government. In this respect the Committee had earlier recalled (in May ) the provision of Article  of Convention No. . Under this provision - as under Article  of the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ), not ratified by the Dominican Republic - workers' organisations must enjoy adequate protection against any act of interference by employers in their establishment, functioning or administration. Article  specifies that acts which are designed to promote the establishment of workers' organisations under the domination of employers or employers' organisations, or to support workers' organisations by financial or other means with the object of placing such organisations under the control of employers or employers' organisations, shall be deemed to constitute acts of interference.
.The Secretary and Under-Secretary of State for Labour declared that the present Government would not endorse or tolerate such practices as the previous Cabinet had done, specifically in the transport sector and the sugar industry. The representative of the Director-General adds the following:In a more general vein, I raised the matter of attempts by employers to interfere in the activities of workers' organisations, and not only in the public sector. On this point the Secretary and Under-Secretary of State said that the current provisions of the Labour Code did not give the Government sufficient scope to combat such practices but that it was nevertheless its policy to try to take action on the basis of the complaints received. They added that it was the Government's attention to introduce proper provisions to put a stop to such acts of interference.The Committee notes these statements and considers it desirable, even if the Government is resolved to tolerate such practices no longer, that legal protection should be strengthened and that the Labour Code should, for example, prescribe more dissuasive sanctions for contraventions of section , the provisions of which are reproduced in the footnote.
.According to the information gathered, several union Confederations also expressed concern at the creation of the General Union of Dominican Workers (UGTD) allied to the political party currently in power (PRD) because they were afraid that the new organisation would receive more favourable treatment, especially in the public sector (the State is the principal employer in certain branches of activity, such as agriculture). Dismissals had already allegedly taken place in the health sector and the sugar-cane industry. This had given rise to a fear that the dismissed workers would be replaced by others who supported the new Government. In some cases this was said to have already begun. The representative of the Director-General explains that, according to the governmental authorities he spoke to, most of the Dominican trade unions were independent of the traditional Confederations and close to the PRD; they were now able to organise themselves and were doing so within the UGTD. The report continues:The Government spokesman went on to say that the dismissals that had taken place in the public sector had not been on trade union grounds. Two points in particular should be borne in mind: in the first place, it was customary in the country to give posts in the public sector to members of the party in power (spoils system); secondly, from the economic standpoint it was necessary to cut down in personnel as the number of employees had sometimes grown far too great. They insisted that the Government would respect the right of freedom of association and ideological pluralism. In any case, legal proceedings could be undertaken against the administration if it was suspected of misuse of power.
.On more than one occasion the Committee has examined cases in which allegations were made that the public authorities had by their",0,1975,Dominican Republic
91,"attitude favoured or discriminated against one or more trade union organisations: examples of such allegations are pressure exerted on workers by means of public statements made by the authorities, unequal distribution of subsidies among unions or the granting to one union, rather than to the other, of premises for holding its meetings or carrying on its activities, and refusal to recognise the leaders of certain organisations in their legitimate activities.& Discrimination by these means or others may be an informal way of influencing the trade union membership of workers. They are therefore sometimes difficult to prove. The fact nevertheless remains, as the Committee has recalled in each of the foregoing cases, that any discrimination of this kind jeopardises the right of workers to set up and join organisations of their own choosing, a right which is explicitly recognised in Article  of Convention No. .
.The Committee also wishes to lay stress on the principles set forth in the resolution concerning the independence of the trade union movement, adopted by the International Labour Conference at its th Session (). The fundamental and permanent mission of the trade union movement, states the resolution, is the economic and social advancement of the workers. When trade unions in accordance with the national law and practice of their respective countries and at the decision of their members decide to establish relations with a political party or to undertake Constitutional political action as a means towards the advancement of their economic and social objectives, such political relations or actions should not be of such a nature as to compromise the continuance of a trade union movement or its social or economic functions irrespective of political changes in the country. The resolution also stresses that governments should not attempt to transform the trade union movement into an instrument for the pursuance of political aims, nor should they attempt to interfere with the normal functions of a trade union movement because of its freely established relationship with a political party.
.Allegations concerning the registration and cancellation of registration of trade unions
.The representative of the Director-General explained that a resolution, No. / of  October , repealed resolutions of  which, by administrative decision, cancelled the registration of numerous trade unions, including the single union of workers of the Central Romana Corporations and Central Romana By Products mentioned in the complaints. Such registration was necessary to enable the trade unions to function. In the preamble to this new resolution it is stated, among other things, that the previous Government was guilty of actions ultra vires by assuming powers that legally belonged to the courts of first instance by virtue of section  of the Labour Code. The preamble also refers to Article  of Convention no. , which prohibits the dissolution or suspension of workers' and employers' organisations by administrative authority. In these circumstances the Committee considers that this aspect of the case calls for no further examination.
.In this connection, the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has observed that according to section  of the Labour Code the registration of a trade union could be refused by the Ministry of Labour. It had asked the Government whether it was possible to appeal to the courts against a refusal to register a trade union. The Under-Secretary of State told the representative of the Director-General that it was possible to appeal against a refusal to register a trade union, as it was to appeal against any administrative act.
.Allegations concerning intervention by the public authorities in the internal affairs of trade unions and occupation of trade union premises
.The problems raised in this connection were of two kinds. The first related to an administrative resolution, No. / of  October , issued by the Secretariat of State for Labour, according to which general assemblies organised with a view to setting up a trade union, federation or Confederation, electing its executive Committee, amending its statutes, merging with other trade unions or affiliating with a federation or Confederation, had to be ""certified"" by a labour inspector. After examining the file on the case and hearing the administration's opinion, the Secretary of state decided whether the trade union can be registered, whether its executive Committee can be recognised, and whether a merger or affiliation can take place, after having previously verified that the legal requirements have been fulfilled. The Committee expressed the view in its th Report that the obligation to accept the presence of a representative of the authorities at general assemblies constituted a restriction upon the free activity of trade unions.
.The representative of the Director-General received the assurance that the resolution would shortly be repealed. The officials he talked with added that, pending the repeal, the authorities would abide by the limitations placed on this text by two rulings of the Supreme Court of Justice. According to the rulings, the powers of the Secretariat of State for Labour in trade union affairs should be interpreted restrictively and the purpose of the presence of an inspector at union assemblies could only be to provide the Secretariat with a report on the circumstances in which the assembly took place and on the decisions adopted. The Court stressed that contesting union elections was a matter for the labour tribunal and not the administrative authorities. According to officials of the CGT, says the report, while the previous Government had used this resolution to commit excesses, the present Government was not applying it in the same spirit.
.The second set of problems raised relates to factual situations: intervention by the authorities in the elections of the Stevedores' Union (POASI); manoeuvres in other undertakings, with the assistance of the authorities, to remove trade union leaders from office; confiscation and misappropriation of the funds of POASI; and occupation of its premises and those- of the National Union of Independent Drivers (UNACHOSIN). In this connection the representative of the Director-General makes the following statement in his report:With regard to the election of trade union leaders, the Secretary and Under-Secretary of State declared that the Supreme Court ruling in the POASI case was a clear case of the infringement of the law by the Government of that period. They confirmed that the POASI had organised elections on  October  and was now operating normally. They also confirmed that the premises of the POASI and UNACHOSIN had been occupied but that a stop had now been put to these measures. The Under-Secretary of State for Labour said that in occupying union premises the previous Government had not respected existing legal provisions. Forcible entry is prohibited by law and misuse of power by public servants is a punishable offence under the Penal Code. As to the allegations concerning POASI funds, he said that this was now past history and that the POASI was currently verifying its financial records. If any misappropriation of funds was brought to light, the matter would be brought before the competent authorities.
.The representative of the Director-General continues:In more general terms, the Secretary of State for the Interior and for the Police informed me that meetings organised on union premises were allowed to take place unhindered and that no authorisation was required open-air meetings were another matter and did require authorisation, and the appropriate decisions were taken in the light of all relevant factors: importance of the date for the union ( May, for example), traffic problems, proximity of an important building (hospital, for example), etc.
.The Committee notes that a solution has now been found to the factual problems raised in the complaints. It also notes the intention of the Government to repeal Resolution No. / mentioned above and trusts that this measure will be taken in the near future.
.Allegations concerning interference with the right to strike
.Complaints were also made with reference to the exercise of the right to strike. In this connection, the representative of the Director-General points out, the labour authorities have recognised that it was virtually impossible to engage in strike action in the present state of the legislation. Such action could only last for a few days because judges were empowered to order a return to work. The report adds:It is significant that the Labour Code only authorises strike action within very strict limits (see sections ,  and ): for example, more than  per cent of the employees concerned must have voted in favour of the strike; a strike cannot take place if one of the parties decides to submit the dispute to arbitration; and it must come to an end upon the expiry of the legal time limit for the resumption of work ordered by the judge. The right to strike is restricted even further by the provisions governing arbitration procedure: the presiding judge can appoint the arbitrators ex officio or at the request of the Secretary of State for Labour (section ) and may order the resumption of work (section ; see also sections  to  and ). The arbitration award has the effect of a collective agreement (section",0,1975,Dominican Republic
92,"). The Secretary of State adds that the judge orders the resumption of work but that, moreover, arbitrators were not appointed. The Under-Secretary told me that he knew of hardly any case where a strike had been recognised as legal. In the past the police had often intervened and an appeal to the tribunal was barely conceivable under these conditions. Nowadays, whenever a collective labour dispute arose, the Government tried to reconcile the parties; often the employers accepted to reinstate at least some of the strikers, and the police no longer intervened. However, he added that in the current period of transition he would not hesitate to apply the sections of the Labour code that empowered him to prevent a strike if he felt that public order was threatened - although this situation had not arisen.
.The representative of the Director-General referred to information according to which the party in power, the PRD, had undertaken to revise the Labour Code so as to make it more liberal; the debate on the subject had already begun in the legislative chambers. The question of the right to strike had not yet been taken up, but the Secretary of State for Labour said that he intended to propose the adoption of liberal provisions in this respect as he wanted to bring Dominican legislation fully into line with the ILO's standards and principles respecting freedom of association.
.The Committee has always considered the right to strike as one of the essential means by which workers and their organisations may promote and defend their occupational interests it has held that restrictions or prohibitions on the right to strike are admissible only under certain conditions, in particular in the public service and in essential services (in the strict sense of the term). In the latter cases, it has added, such restrictions should be accompanied by adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures in which the parties can take part at every stage, and at which the awards are binding on both parties in all cases. Such awards should be executed rapidly and completely.
.The Committee notes the Government's intention to revise its legislation on this important question. It has also noted that the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has made certain observations on the present strike legislation. It would be desirable that the envisaged amendments should be adopted at an early date.
.Allegations concerning the trade union rights of agricultural workers
.This aspect of the case was the subject both of a complaint and of observations by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, which considered that the exclusion of certain rural workers from the field of application of the provisions of the Labour Code which guaranteed the right of association was incompatible with Convention No. . In this connection the representative of the Director-General states the following:When asked about this, the Secretary and Under-Secretary of State for Labour explained that under the previous regime there had in practice been a certain amount of opposition to unionisation. On the other hand, the present Government was trying to meet and encourage the participation of peasants' representatives. Under the Labour Code agricultural workers were entitled to set up trade unions. According to section , the provisions of the Code do not apply to any agricultural undertaking, agricultural undertaking of an industrial type or stock raising or forestry undertaking which does not continuously and permanently employ more than ten persons, but this refers to the undertakings themselves and not to the workers. As the Secretary of State pointed out, this means that the workers cannot set up a works union and, in fact, section  of the Code stipulates that associations of employees must have not less than  members. However, nothing prevents them from setting up an occupational ""class"" union. The government authorities I spoke to actually cited two federations that were registered with the Secretariat of State for Labour (and therefore possess juridical personality)
.The information gathered by the representative of the Director-General refers both to the de facto situation and to certain legal difficulties. From the latter point of view the authorities have provided the necessary explanations, even though it would be desirable for the Labour Code to be more explicit in recognising the right of all rural workers to form unions. It would also appear that the de facto situation has improved, and the Committee takes note of this development.
.Allegations concerning the trade union rights of teachers and public servants
.The complainants mention the specific case of a teachers' union, the Dominican Teachers' Association (ADP), which the public authorities refused to recognise. In its th Report the Committee referred to the comments of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations and expressed concern at the position of public officials and public servants in general, who are excluded from the Labour Code and thereby deprived of the trade union rights proclaimed by the Code.
.The ADP, reports the representative of the Director-General, was granted legal personality in January . Another union - the National Union of Educators (UNE) - was registered at the Secretariat of State for Labour in accordance with the provisions of the Labour Code. These two organisations were theoretically for teachers from the private sector; however, according to their by-laws and, with the tacit assent of the public authorities, teachers from the public sector were also allowed to join.
.Generally speaking, public servants and other persons employed by the public authorities are excluded, with certain exceptions, from labour legislation (section  of the Labour Code, Act No.  of  July ] and are therefore deprived of the guarantees provided for therein with respect to freedom of association. Furthermore, the representative of the Director-General refers to an Act, No.  of  November , which prohibits any propaganda activity or attempt to encourage people to join trade unions within public and municipal administrations or autonomous state institutions (section ). ""According to government officials"", he writes, ""this latter provision means in effect that all trade union activity in the public sector is prohibited. Outside the public service in the strict sense, however, individual statutes do provide for the right to organise.""
.The report continues:The Secretary of State for Labour said that, although the right for public servants to join trade unions was not recognised, their right of association on the basis of Act No.  on non-profit-making associations was fully guaranteed. As early as  the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations had, however, made a number of comments on this Act, which contains provisions (for example, section  which refers to the dissolution of an association by the executive authority) whose application could constitute an infringement of Convention No. . The trade union organisations with which I had discussions were highly critical of this legislation: Act No.  permits the creation of cultural or mutual assistance associations but, according to them, not of real workers' organisations entitled, for instance, to submit claims and to negotiate collectively. Moreover, it is the Government which is responsible for registering and recognising these associations, which are not governed by the Labour Code. However, according to the UGTD, although trade union legislation would be preferable these associations do nevertheless permit workers to organise themselves and to defend their interests and they are also able to take legal action. According to the Under-Secretary of State for Labour, the Government accepts the activities of organisations set up to defend the interests of public servants. Thus, for instance, a Dominican Public Service Federation (FEDOMEPIA) has been created. The Secretary of State added that he intended to propose a new public service status which would sanction the right to organise in this sector.
.The Committee has often stressed, and particularly in two recent cases, that the standards on freedom of association embodied in Convention No.  apply to all workers ""without distinction whatsoever"", and are therefore applicable to employees of the State. It was indeed considered inequitable to draw any distinction in trade union matters between workers in the private sector and public servants, since persons in either category are permitted to become organised for the defence of their interests. It was also made clear during the preparatory work on Convention No.  that recognition of the right of association of public servants in no way prejudges the question of the right of such officials to strike. Their special situation has, as mentioned earlier, led the Committee to admit that this right could be restricted for public servants.
.The Committee takes note of the information gathered regarding the present opportunities for state personnel to join associations for the defence of their occupational interests, and on the reforms envisaged. It nevertheless considers it essential that the right of all public servants to organise should be fully recognised in the near future, and in this connection notes that the question is the subject of an examination and observations by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions",0,1975,Dominican Republic
93,"and Recommendations.
.The right to form federations and Confederations
.During the direct contacts mission discussions were also held with the authorities on a restriction imposed by legislation on the right to form federations and Confederations. In this connection the representative of the Director-General writes:Finally, the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations noted that Resolution No. / of the Secretariat of State for Labour requires a minimum of seven trade unions to form a federation and four federations - or three federations of craft unions - to form a Confederation. The Committee considered that these provisions restricted the right of organisations to establish federations and Confederations as provided in Article  of the Convention. The Secretary of State informed me that the purpose of this text was to avoid the proliferation of trade union federations and Confederations. However, when I explained to him the point of view of the ILO supervisory bodies on the matter as a whole, he informed me that the resolution would very shortly be repealed.
.Although this matter has not been the subject of complaints, the Committee takes note of this information, to which it draws the attention of the Committee of Experts.
.Generally speaking, the Committee notes that due to the recent change in Government there has been a favourable development in the trade union situation in the country since the complaints were presented. Although certain matters remain to be settled - in particular the question of dismissals of trade unionists and certain alleged discriminatory practices in the public sector - a solution has now been found to the other points raised by the complainants and amendments to the trade union legislation on the points raised by the Committee and the Committee of Experts are under examination.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the death, arrest or banishment of trade unionists:
.Since  the Committee has been called upon to examine numerous complaints of infringement of freedom of association in the Dominican Republic, presented by the following organisations: world Confederation of Labour (WCL), world Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), International Metalworkers' Federation (IMF), World Federation of Teachers' Unions, General Workers' Federation (CGT), National Federation of Dockworkers, Stevedores' Union (POASI), National Union of Heavy Machinery Operators (SINOMAPE), National Union of Telephone Workers (SNTT). These complaints have been examined as Cases Nos. , , , ,  and .
.In these complaints allegations were made relating, inter alia, to the death, arrest and banishment of trade unionists, dismissals on account of trade union activities, the dismantling of trade union organisations, intervention by the public authorities in the internal affairs of trade unions (meetings, elections, trade union funds), the occupation of trade union premises, interference with the right to strike and the trade union rights of teachers and agricultural workers.
.The subject-matter of these complaints was brought to the attention of the Government as the complaints were received. The Government provided comments on several of the allegations.
.The Committee examined Case No.  at its sessions in May and November , when it submitted interim reports to the Governing Body, A further interim report was submitted by the Committee to the Governing Body with respect to Case No.  and Cases Nos. , ,  and  in May . The Committee again examined all the cases pending with regard to the Dominican Republic at its November  session 
.At its may  session the Committee observed that although the Government had submitted comments and information on several of the allegations made, the Committee possessed insufficient information to enable it to reach conclusions at that stage regarding the substance of the various issues raised. The Committee recalled, moreover, that it had already examined, on several occasions, cases concerning the Dominican Republic which involved allegations similar to those made in the present cases. In these circumstances, the Committee considered that it would be very useful to apply the direct contacts procedure. The Governing Body, accordingly, requested the Government to consider the possibility of giving its consent to the carrying out of a study in the Dominican Republic of the facts surrounding the complaints by a representative of the Director-General, who would report to the Committee thereon.
.No reply having been received from the Government in November  and February  the Committee invited it to give its early consideration to the request for direct contacts and to communicate its decision in this connection as soon as possible.
.In May , in the continued absence of any communication from the Government in this connection, the Committee decided to apply the special procedure provided for in paragraphs  and  of its th Report. Under this procedure, the Government was immediately informed that the Chairman of the Committee would, on behalf of the Committee, make contact with its representatives attending the rd Session of the International Labour Conference, draw their attention to the particular cases involved and discuss with them the reasons for the delay in transmitting the observations requested. The Chairman was then to report to the Committee on the results of such contacts. However, since the Government did not designate any representative to the rd Session of the Conference, the said procedure could not be applied.
.In a letter dated  August , the Government stated that it was considering the request it had received to accept the visit of a representative of the Director-General, and added that a final reply would be given when it was in the interests of the country to do so.
.At its November  session the Committee expressed its regret at the Government's delay in acceding to the request made of it to give its consent to the visit of a representative of the Director-General. In this connection, the Committee emphasised that the purpose of the whole procedure was to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and expressed its confidence that, if this procedure protected governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their part would recognise the importance for the protection of their own good name of co-operating with the Committee in every way so that it could examine the allegations fully and seek possible solutions to the problems involved. The Committee moreover laid particular stress on the importance it attached to the direct contacts procedure.
.In these circumstances, the Governing Body, on the Committee's recommendation,(a) urged the Government to give its consent without delay to an inquiry into the trade union situation being carried out in the Dominican Republic by a representative of the Director-General;(b) requested the Director-General to contact the Government at the highest possible level so as to express the concern of the Committee and to insist that the Government should give a favourable response to the request for direct contacts.
.In February , the Committee noted that in spite of the reminders sent to the Government on this question the Government had not replied. The Committee deplored the fact that the Government of the Dominican Republic had shown no desire to cooperate with the procedures available in the field of trade union rights. In these circumstances, the Governing Body decided that, in the event of no reply being received from the Government before its next session, wider publicity should be given to the allegations, to the replies of the Government, to the recommendations of the Committee and to the obstructive attitude of the Government's.
.Since then, no reply has been received from the Government.
.The Dominican Republic has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee must first of all deplore the fact that, notwithstanding the insistent and repeated requests addressed to the Government at the highest level, the Government has failed to reply to the proposal made by the Committee and the Governing Body that recourse be had to direct contacts. In view of the importance and seriousness of the matters raised in the complaints and the inadequacy of the information at its disposal, the Committee remains convinced that a visit to the Dominican Republic by a representative of the Director-General would have afforded an opportunity to gain a greater insight into the trade union situation and give fruitful consideration to possible solutions to the problems involved.
.Before taking up each of the matters raised by the complainants, the Committee wishes to emphasise the importance of the cases under consideration, which raise serious issues pertaining to freedom of association and human rights in relation to trade union rights. In this connection the Committee expresses its deep concern at the acuteness and diversity of the problems faced by a substantial part of the Dominican trade union movement in a wide variety of branches of activity.
.The Committee notes in particular that, according to the allegations, certain trade union organisations, in many cases of nation-wide importance, have for many years been having great difficulty in carrying on their activities owing to the multiple obstacles that have been put in their path: arrest and dismissal of",0,1975,Dominican Republic
94,"their leaders, occupation of their premises, interference in their internal affairs. Such an atmosphere cannot be conducive to the development of a truly free and independent trade union movement, nor to the promotion of normal industrial relations. The Committee wishes to emphasise before proceeding any further that, as stated in the resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties adopted by the International Labour Conference in , the absence of civil liberties removes all meaning from the concept of trade union rights, and the rights conferred upon workers' and employers' organisations must be based on respect for those civil liberties.
.The allegations refer to a considerable number of murders of officials of workers' organisations, especially in the agricultural sector, committed in most cases by employers or overseers. In the absence of any detailed information on these cases from the Government, the Committee feels bound to observe that the Government has not established that these deaths occurred for reasons unconnected with the status or activities of the officials in question. The Committee considers that, in any event, the circumstances of these cases should have prompted the authorities to take effective steps to establish the facts, punish the culprits and restore the situation to normal, this being an essential prerequisite for the free exercise of trade union rights.
.Many of the complaints mention the arrest and detention of officials of various trade union organisations. Contradictory explanations as to the reasons for these measures have been given by the complainants and by the Government. According to the former they were due to trade union activities, while the latter has claimed in general terms that the officials in question were arrested for breaches of laws in respect of public order or for common-law offences.
.Be this as it may, the Committee must observe that the Government has not supplied detailed information as to the acts of which the persons arrested were accused, thus preventing the Committee from examining the allegations with all the facts before it. The Committee considers that the onus was on the Government to show that the measures it had taken were not prompted by the trade union activities of the persons concerned.
.While most of the trade unionists mentioned in the complaints appear to have now recovered their freedom, it has none the less been clearly established that some of them were kept in custody for relatively lengthy periods of time, in some cases at repeated intervals. It is impossible to determine from the Government's replies whether the persons concerned were brought before the courts. Only in a few cases does it appear from the information supplied by the complainants that legal proceedings were initiated against the trade union officials concerned. One of them was moreover kept in prison even though he had been found not guilty by a court of first instance.
.The Committee must recall in this connection that it is one of the fundamental rights of the individual that a detained person should be brought without delay before the appropriate judge, this right being recognised in such instruments as the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man. In the case of persons engaged in trade union activities, this is one of the civil liberties which should be ensured by the authorities in order to guarantee the full effectiveness of the exercise of trade union rights. The Committee further wishes to point out that the detention by the authorities of trade unionists concerning whom no grounds for prosecution are subsequently found is liable to involve restrictions on trade union rights, and governments should take steps to ensure that the authorities concerned have instructions appropriate to eliminate the danger of detention for trade union activities.
.According to the complainants, the authorities have also ordered the expulsion from the country of certain trade union officials. One of them was refused entry into the Dominican Republic on his return from an international trade union conference. In the Committee's opinion, a measure exiling trade unionists, which is in violation of human rights, is of particular gravity since it deprives the persons concerned of the possibility of working in their country and of contacts with their families. It is also in violation of freedom of association in that it undermines the trade union organisations which are thereby deprived of their leaders.
.According to the information supplied by the complainants, many trade union officials and members have been dismissed from their jobs in a large number of undertakings covering a wide range of activities. In most of these cases it has been alleged that the sole ground for the action in question was the trade union activities of the persons concerned. In some cases the underlying intention was stated to be the dismantling of trade unions, though this has been denied by the Government. The Government has however admitted that some undertakings engage in practices hardly conducive to the development of sound industrial relations which it cannot combat effectively under the legislation in force.
.The Committee considers that no person should be discriminated against on account of his trade union membership or activities, and that governments should take measures to ensure that workers are protected against acts, including dismissal, which are likely to provoke or have as their object anti-union discrimination in respect of employment. Legislation enabling employers in practice - on condition that they pay the compensation prescribed by law for cases of unjustified dismissal - to get rid of any worker, even if the true reason is his trade union membership or activities, does not give sufficient protection against acts of anti-union discrimination.
.Protection against acts of anti-union discrimination is particularly desirable in the case of trade union officials, because, in order to carry out their trade union functions in full independence, they must have the assurance that they will not be victimised by virtue of their trade union office. Such an assurance is also necessary to ensure that effect is given to the principle that workers' organisations should have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom .
.A large number of trade union organisations appear to have been dismantled over the past few years, either through the withdrawal of their legal personality or through the setting up of parallel unions or through their destruction by employers. In answer to these allegations the Government has merely stated that the great majority of the organisations in question are still in existence but their leaders have been removed from office by decision of their members. The Committee does not have sufficient information to enable it to express an opinion on these matters in full knowledge of the facts. In particular, it has not been specified whether the legal personality of the trade union mentioned by the complainants was withdrawn by order of the administrative authorities or as a result of court proceedings. The Committee notes, however, that under the terms of section  of the Labour Code, the registration of a trade union may be cancelled by a decision of the courts if the trade union pursues activities not connected with its lawful objectives.
.As concerns the setting up of parallel unions and the destruction of trade unions by employers, the Committee wishes to recall that under the terms of Article  of Convention No. , ratified by the Dominican Republic, workers' and employers' organisations must enjoy adequate protection against any acts of interference by each other or each other's agents or members in their establishment, functioning or administration. Article  specifies that acts which are designed to promote the establishment of workers' organisations under the domination of employers or employers' organisations, or to support workers' organisations by financial or other means with the object of placing such organisations under the control of employers or employers' organisations, shall be deemed to constitute acts of interference.
.The allegations of interference by public authorities in the internal affairs of trade unions are mainly concerned with the right of assembly, the right to elect officials in full freedom and trade union funds. The Committee considers that freedom of assembly for trade union purposes constitutes one of the fundamental elements of trade union rights, and that the authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof. The obligation to accept the presence of a representative of the authorities at general assemblies constitutes a restriction upon the free activity of trade unions.
.With regard to trade union elections, the complainants stated that rigged elections had been held in the POASI union and that the Supreme Court had ruled them to be illegal. According to more recent information supplied by the Government, properly conducted elections were subsequently held in this union. In this connection the Committee wishes once again to emphasise the importance it attaches to the principle that workers and their organisations should have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom.
.The POASI is also alleged by the complainants to have had its assets confiscated.",1,1975,Dominican Republic
95,"According to the Government these allegations are false. In view of the contradictory nature of these statements, the Committee can only recall the importance of the principle that trade union funds should be adequately protected.
.It appears from the allegations made that the headquarters of certain trade union organisations have been occupied by the police, in some cases several times. The latest intervention of this kind - involving the POASI - seems to have been quite recent. In this connection the Committee wishes to draw the Government's attention to the fact that, in the resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties, the International Labour Conference, expressed the view that the right to protection of the property of trade union organisations was one of the civil liberties which were essential for the normal exercise of trade union rights. While trade unions cannot claim immunity from a search of their premises, such a search should only be made following the issue of a warrant by the ordinary judicial authority after that authority has been satisfied that reasonable grounds exist for supposing that evidence exists on the said premises material to a prosecution for an offence under the ordinary law and provided that such search is restricted to the purposes in respect of which the warrant was issued.
.With regard to the allegations relating to interference with the right to strike, the Committee recalls that the right to strike is one of the essential means through which workers and their organisations may promote and defend their occupational interests. The Committee points out in this connection that on several occasions the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has made comments with respect to sections  to  of the Labour Code, which allow all cases of collective labour disputes to be referred to arbitration, culminating in a binding award, which might severely restrict the right to strike and thus infringe the right of trade unions to organise their activities. As concerns the calling in of the police to obstruct, according to the complainants, the exercise of the right to strike, the Committee considers that intervention by security forces in the event of strikes should be limited to the maintenance of public order.
.As concerns the Government's refusal to recognise the legal existence of the Dominican Teachers' Association, the Committee refers to the comments of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations with respect to the position of public servants in the Dominican Republic, who are excluded from the Labour code and thereby deprived of the trade union rights proclaimed by the Code. The Committee recalls that public servants, including teachers, are entitled to enjoy the right to organise, just as other workers are.
.A number of complaints were partly concerned with the trade union situation in the agricultural sector. This branch of activity does indeed seem to have been particularly affected by extremely serious incidents, sometimes involving the death of trade union officials. In addition, according to the complainants, the Government has prevented agricultural workers from organising themselves freely, even though their trade union rights are recognised by law. The Committee wishes in this connection to emphasise the particular importance the International Labour Conference attached to the trade union rights of rural workers in adopting the Rural Workers' Organisations Convention (No. ) in . Article  of this Convention provides that it shall be an objective of national policy concerning rural development to facilitate the establishment and growth, on a voluntary basis, of strong and independent organisations of rural workers as an effective means of ensuring the participation of rural workers, without discrimination, in economic and social development and in the benefits resulting therefrom.
.In these circumstances, as concerns the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the Government's attention to the considerations and principles set forth in paragraphs  to  concerning the death, arrest, banishment and dismissal of trade unionists, the dismantling of trade union organisations, intervention by public authorities in the internal affairs of trade unions, the occupation of trade union premises, the right to strike and the trade union rights of teachers and agricultural workers;(b) to deplore the obstructive attitude and lack of co-operation shown by the Government, which, by not consenting to a mission on the spot, and by not transmitting its replies on the questions before the Committee has made it impossible to obtain all the information on the serious allegations made and to decide what measures could be taken as regards the problems involved;(c) to decide to give wider publicity to the present report, in particular during the next session of the International Labour Conference.Geneva,  May . (Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.
.The Committee has already examined several complaints of infringements of trade union rights in the Dominican Republic, presented by the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), the International Metalworkers' Federation (IMF), the National Union of Heavy Machinery Operators (SINOMAPE), the National Federation of Dockworkers, the Stevedores' Union (POASI) and the General Workers' Federation (CGT). These complaints were dealt with under Cases Nos. , , ,  and . With regard to Case No. , the Committee submitted a number of conclusions to the Governing Body that appear in paragraphs  to  of its st Report and in paragraphs  to  of its rd Report. The Committee also examined Case No.  and Cases Nos. , ,  and  in its th Report (paragraphs  to ) in which it also submitted certain conclusions to the Governing Body.
.Since then, further allegations have been received in connection with these cases. They have been made by the WFTU (communication of  July ), the National Union of Telephone Workers (communications of  July  and  September ), the POASI and the CGT (joint communication of  April ) and the CGT (communication of  June ).
.The World Federation of Teachers' Unions also submitted allegations in a letter of  May  (Case No. ).
.The Government submitted certain information in a letter of  August .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee notes the information communicated by the Government which recognises, in particular, that, in certain undertakings, practices exist that are not conducive to the development of healthy labour management relations and to which it cannot effectively put a stop under the legislation currently in force. New complaints have been received containing allegations that are as serious and as varied as those previously examined. It should be borne in mind, moreover, that the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has for several years been making observations on the application by the Dominican Republic of Conventions Nos.  and , which it has ratified.
.The Committee regrets the Government's delay in acceding to the request made of it to give its consent to the visit of a representative of the Director-General. In this connection, the Committee wishes to emphasise that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and the Committee is confident that, if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their part will recognise the importance for the protection of their own good name of co-operating with the Committee in every way so that it can examine the allegations fully and seek possible solutions to the problems involved. In paragraphs  to  of its th Report, the Committee has laid particular stress on the importance it attaches in this connection to the direct contacts procedure.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to urge the Government to give its consent without delay to an inquiry into the trade union situation being carried out in the Dominican Republic by a representative of the Director General;(b) to request the Director-General to contact the Government at the highest possible level so as to express the concern of the Committee and to insist that the Government should give a favourable response to the request made above;(c) to take note of this interim report.
.The Committee already examined Case No.  in May and November  and on each occasion it submitted a report to the Governing Body. These reports appear in paragraphs  to  of the Committee's st report and paragraphs  to  of its rd report.
.In its rd Report, the Committee recommended that the Governing Body request the Government to provide additional information on one aspect of the matter. Despite repeated requests, this information was not received. The Committee, therefore, addressed urgent appeals to the Government in November  and February and May  that it supply the information requested. In November  and February , the Committee noted with regret that despite its appeals the requested information still had not been received. In May ",1,1975,Dominican Republic
96,"it again made an urgent appeal to the Government to supply the information.
.Regarding Cases Nos. , ,  and , the complaints and additional information submitted by the complainants appear in the following communications: three communications, of  October ,  September  and  June , from the National Union of Heavy Machinery Operators (SINOMAPE), a communication of  November , from the National Federation of Dockworkers, two communications, of  May  and  November , from the Stevedores' Union (POASI), a communication of  August , from the General Workers' Federation (CGT), two communications, of  September  and  July , from the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), three communications, of  November ,  July and  October , from the World Confederation of Labour (WCL).
.These complaints were transmitted to the Government as they were received, with requests for observations. Apart from some very general replies sent by communications of  January and  July , and despite the time which had elapsed since the presentation of the first complaints (Case No. ), the Committee received no information from the Government on the various allegations. In November  and May , the Committee sent urgent requests to the Government to submit the information requested (Case No. ).
.As the information requested on all these cases was not received, the Committee asked the Director-General in November  to communicate with the highest level of the Government, on behalf of the Committee, expressing the Committee's concern and urgently requesting the Government to provide the observations requested from it (Cases Nos. , ,  and ). The Government finally submitted information by communications of ,  and  February .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).",1,1975,Dominican Republic
97,".Since  the Committee has had before it numerous complaints of violation of freedom of association in the Dominican Republic. These complaints come from the following workers' organisations: World Confederation of Labour (WCL), World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), International Metalworkers' Federation (IMF), World Federation of Teachers' Unions, General Workers' Federation, National Federation of Dockworkers, Stevedores' Union (POASI), National Union of Heavy Machinery Operators (SINOMAPE), and National Union of Telephone Workers (SNTT). They are dealt with in Cases Nos. , , , ,  and .
.The Committee examined Case No.  in May and November  and at each of these sessions presented conclusions to the Governing Body. The Committee submitted further conclusions to the Governing Body (on Cases Nos. , , ,  and ) in May . Finally, it examined all the outstanding cases relating to the Dominican Republic in November  and May .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In May  the Committee considered that the information at its disposal seemed insufficient to enable it to reach conclusions regarding the substance of the various issues raised. It had already examined, on several occasions, cases concerning the Dominican Republic which contained allegations similar to those made in the cases under examination. In these circumstances it considered that it would be very useful to apply the direct contacts procedure. The Governing Body accordingly requested the Government to consider the possibility of giving its consent to the carrying out of a study in the Dominican Republic of the facts surrounding the complaints by a representative of the Director-General.
.This request was repeated on a number of occasions. In addition, new complaints were presented which, like the earlier ones, contained a variety of serious allegations. Since no detailed reply had been received by May , the Committee had been obliged to formulate its conclusions on the cases in its th Report. However, the new Dominican Government constituted after the elections in May  accepted direct contacts by letter of  September .
.The Director-General appointed Mr. Jean-Michel Servais, an official of the Freedom of Association Branch of the International Labour Standards Department, to represent him during this mission. The visit to the country took place from  to  November , and a report on the mission was submitted to the Committee. During his visit, the representative of the Director-General had conversations with the Secretary of State for Labour and the Secretary of State for the Interior and the Police, with the Under-Secretaries of State for Labour and the Under-Secretaries o?State for the Interior and for the Police, and with the Public Prosecutor of the Republic. He was also received by the President of the Supreme Court of Justice. He met the leaders of a number of trade union organisations - including those of two of the complainant organisations, CGT and POASI - on their trade union premises. Finally, he had discussions at the headquarters of the Employers' Confederation of the Dominican Republic with the officials of this organisation, and with those of the Association of Industries of the Dominican Republic.
.The Committee notes with satisfaction that the representative of the Director-General enjoyed the co-operation of all concerned. He was able to carry out all his tasks in full freedom and independence and the Dominican Government afforded him the necessary facilities to perform his mission in the best possible circumstances.
.The representative of the Director-General collected information on the various issues raised in the complaints and on the measures taken or envisaged to solve the problems encountered. At the invitation of the Government he also discussed the comments made by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations during its periodic examination of the application of Conventions Nos.  and  under article  of the ILO Constitution. All these points are examined in the paragraphs which follow.
.First of all, however, it should be pointed out that, according to the representative of the Director-General, a number of Confederations are at present contending for the allegiance of the workers and the control of the works unions. ""Thus"", he writes, ""at the time of my visit antagonism had taken a very serious turn in the Central Romana Corporations and Central Romana By-Products enterprise, a situation which seems likely to continue, if not to deteriorate further, in the coming months."" Trade union Confederations often maintain close political relations with political parties. The General Union of Dominican Workers (UGTD), which was set up very recently, is in sympathy with the Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD). As will be seen later on the Government has been accused of favouring this new organisation to a certain extent. A similar preoccupation is revealed in a telegram of  December  from the General Workers' Federation (CGT), in which this organisation protests against the administrative order allegedly given by the Government to close down the programme of the ""Rutas"" radio station at La Romana and its alleged prevention of the reorganisation of the local union. This communication has been transmitted to the Government for its observations. The employers' representatives, the report continues, have expressed the view that this situation has created a tense atmosphere in industrial relations on the other hand, it appears that large numbers of unions are now being formed in the present social circumstances.
.Allegations concerning the death, arrest or banishment of trade unionists
.As the mission report states, an amnesty law was passed on  September . All the trade unionists who were mentioned as having been under arrest have now been released. In addition, the banished trade unionists have recently returned to the country under the amnesty law and after the removal of administrative obstacles to their return.
.Finally, it appears from the information gathered that under the Code of Penal Procedure any person who is detained must be brought before a judge within  hours of his arrest. In addition, an old habeas corpus Act protects individuals against arbitrary arrest. In the past, according to the Public Prosecutor of the Republic, the practice was to refer pleas of this nature to the Public Ministry ""which sometimes took rather arbitrary decisions""; this has now been changed and the pleas come before a judge of first instance. Moreover, a Hill to amend the habeas corpus Act is in preparation which stipulates explicitly that the plea must be referred to a judge and prescribes an appeals procedure. As regards banishment, the Public Prosecutor stated that, legally, such a measure could only be taken against foreigners (under the Immigration Law). No law permits the expulsion of nationals, and the measures taken by the previous Government were, in his opinion, arbitrary. There had been no more expulsions since  August .
.Legal proceedings have been instituted in respect of the two cases of murder mentioned in the complaints of the peasants' trade union leaders (Florinda Muoz Soriano in November , and Dionisio Frias in June ). The Secretary and the Under-Secretary of State for Labour said that they would send detailed information regarding the judicial investigations undertaken. It was, they admitted, true that peasant leaders had in the past met their deaths in abnormal circumstances. The new Government, they added, had stated that it would pursue a policy of respect for civil liberties and human rights, including freedom of association. The Undersecretary of State further emphasised the determination of the authorities to abide strictly by the law. The representative of the Director-General also learned from the officials of the Autonomous Confederation of Christian Trade Unions (CASC) that legal proceedings were still pending in the case of the murder of Dionisio Frias; as regards the death of Florinda Muoz Soriano the court had considered that the accused had acted in self-defence.
.The Committee notes these various items of information, in particular the release or the return from exile of the trade unionists mentioned in the complaints. The facts surrounding the deaths of two peasant leaders in  and  have been the subject of trials before the courts one of these cases, moreover, appears to have ended in an acquittal. The Government, while admitting that trade unionists in the rural sector had in the past met their deaths in abnormal circumstances, has stated its will to secure respect for the law and for civil liberties. In these circumstances the Committee is of the opinion that these different points call for no further consideration, provided that it is kept informed of the results of the trials in the cases of the deaths of Dioniso Frias and Florinda Muoz Soriano.
.Allegations concerning the dismissal of trade unionists
.Many allegations referred to the dismissal of trade union leaders and militants. According to the complainants the chief target of these dismissals were the executive Committees of the unions, but certain allegations also referred to the dissolution, or attempted dissolution, of workers' organisations. The representative of the Director-General points out in his report that this issue appeared",0,1974,Dominican Republic
98,"to be a fundamental problem which was still disrupting industrial relations in the country. Although section  of the Labour Code prohibits anti-union practices, the penal sanctions imposed are fines ranging from  to  pesos ( peso  US dollar). According to the report, the Government appears willing to do everything in its power to find a solution:The Secretary and Under-Secretary of State recognise that there have been numerous dismissals and that some cases had apparently involved trade union officials. It was also possible that, in order to get rid of certain leaders, employers had dismissed a whole group of workers. The Government had tried to solve matters through conciliation and mediation and had sometimes succeeded. As it stood, however, the existing legislation did not provide it with the means to do more. Quite apart from the fact that it was difficult to find proof - a problem which is not unique to the Dominican Republic, of course - the Labour Code (section ) allows the employer to terminate a contract for an indefinite period, without giving any reason. Consequently, an employer can dismiss a worker if he finds it convenient provided he pays his employee the amounts to which he is legally entitled (corresponding to the period of notice, the leaving grant and days of leave). This applies even when a collective agreement contains a special clause providing for the protection of union officials. According to existing case law, an employer who fails to respect this provision and dismisses trade union leaders is only required to pay the special indemnity which is provided for in the event of a violation of this clause.
.The report mentions that there are at present proposals to amend the Labour Code, in particular section . The representative of the Director-General mentions the various drafts which have been prepared and adds:The President of the Republic has made a public appeal for a social truce. The representatives of the workers and employers are therefore in the process of negotiating an agreement through the Secretariat of State for Labour. One meeting was held during our mission, and the various inter-occupational Confederations whose officials I met took part in it along with the employers' associations. One of the items for discussion had to do with genuine respect for the freedom of association of workers: the employers' organisations are apparently prepared to guarantee that no trade union leader and no leader of any trade union in the process of being set up will be dismissed from their enterprises except by authorisation of an arbitration Committee. In practice, this amounts to an amendment by agreement of section  of the Labour Code. ... Moreover, it is quite feasible that, following the agreement, the matter will be brought before the Congress in the form of a Bill. The Secretary of State informed me that, even if no agreement is reached, a draft amendment to the law will be submitted on this point. Such an amendment could therefore be adopted without it being necessary to wait for the adoption of a new Labour code.
.As the Committee has already pointed out in other cases, legislation which merely prescribes that any worker dismissed without just cause is entitled in certain cases to compensation and damages in addition to the wage corresponding to the period of notice, does not give sufficient protection against acts of anti-union discrimination, since it enables an employer, on condition that he pays the compensation prescribed by law, to dismiss any member of his staff, whether a member of a trade union or not, for trade union or other activities, the public authorities being powerless to prevent him from doing so. Protection is particularly desirable in the case of trade union officials because, in order to be able to perform their trade union duties in full independence, they must have the guarantee that they will not be prejudiced on account of the mandate which they hold from their trade unions. This guarantee is also necessary to secure respect for the principle that workers' organisations have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom.
.The Dominican Government stated that it was keenly aware of the gaps in its legislation in this respect, and that it was trying to obtain a broad consensus as regards the solution to these difficulties. The Committee considers it essential that this question should be settled in the near future, given the problems which have arisen in the country.
.Allegations concerning unfair practices in the public sector
.The allegations referred to the setting up by the Government of a parallel union in Puerto de Andrs at Boca Chica (communication of August ) and a manoeuvre in the Dominican Telephone Company (CODETEL) to make the National Union of Telephone Workers (SNTT) lose its legal representative character (communication of June ).
.As regards the latter point, the representative of the Director-General wanted to assure himself that the SNTT was exercising its trade union activities fully and that it had recently concluded a collective agreement with the enterprise for the period -. The agreement contains a special clause concerning the protection of trade union officials. Except in the case of a former leader who had been suspended, this provision had been respected. However, the report mentions other cases than that referred to in the previous paragraph in which parallel unions had been set up under the former Government. In this respect the Committee had earlier recalled (in May ) the provision of Article  of Convention No. . Under this provision - as under Article  of the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ), not ratified by the Dominican Republic - workers' organisations must enjoy adequate protection against any act of interference by employers in their establishment, functioning or administration. Article  specifies that acts which are designed to promote the establishment of workers' organisations under the domination of employers or employers' organisations, or to support workers' organisations by financial or other means with the object of placing such organisations under the control of employers or employers' organisations, shall be deemed to constitute acts of interference.
.The Secretary and Under-Secretary of State for Labour declared that the present Government would not endorse or tolerate such practices as the previous Cabinet had done, specifically in the transport sector and the sugar industry. The representative of the Director-General adds the following:In a more general vein, I raised the matter of attempts by employers to interfere in the activities of workers' organisations, and not only in the public sector. On this point the Secretary and Under-Secretary of State said that the current provisions of the Labour Code did not give the Government sufficient scope to combat such practices but that it was nevertheless its policy to try to take action on the basis of the complaints received. They added that it was the Government's attention to introduce proper provisions to put a stop to such acts of interference.The Committee notes these statements and considers it desirable, even if the Government is resolved to tolerate such practices no longer, that legal protection should be strengthened and that the Labour Code should, for example, prescribe more dissuasive sanctions for contraventions of section , the provisions of which are reproduced in the footnote.
.According to the information gathered, several union Confederations also expressed concern at the creation of the General Union of Dominican Workers (UGTD) allied to the political party currently in power (PRD) because they were afraid that the new organisation would receive more favourable treatment, especially in the public sector (the State is the principal employer in certain branches of activity, such as agriculture). Dismissals had already allegedly taken place in the health sector and the sugar-cane industry. This had given rise to a fear that the dismissed workers would be replaced by others who supported the new Government. In some cases this was said to have already begun. The representative of the Director-General explains that, according to the governmental authorities he spoke to, most of the Dominican trade unions were independent of the traditional Confederations and close to the PRD; they were now able to organise themselves and were doing so within the UGTD. The report continues:The Government spokesman went on to say that the dismissals that had taken place in the public sector had not been on trade union grounds. Two points in particular should be borne in mind: in the first place, it was customary in the country to give posts in the public sector to members of the party in power (spoils system); secondly, from the economic standpoint it was necessary to cut down in personnel as the number of employees had sometimes grown far too great. They insisted that the Government would respect the right of freedom of association and ideological pluralism. In any case, legal proceedings could be undertaken against the administration if it was suspected of misuse of power.
.On more than one occasion the Committee has examined cases in which allegations were made that the public authorities had by their",0,1974,Dominican Republic
99,"attitude favoured or discriminated against one or more trade union organisations: examples of such allegations are pressure exerted on workers by means of public statements made by the authorities, unequal distribution of subsidies among unions or the granting to one union, rather than to the other, of premises for holding its meetings or carrying on its activities, and refusal to recognise the leaders of certain organisations in their legitimate activities.& Discrimination by these means or others may be an informal way of influencing the trade union membership of workers. They are therefore sometimes difficult to prove. The fact nevertheless remains, as the Committee has recalled in each of the foregoing cases, that any discrimination of this kind jeopardises the right of workers to set up and join organisations of their own choosing, a right which is explicitly recognised in Article  of Convention No. .
.The Committee also wishes to lay stress on the principles set forth in the resolution concerning the independence of the trade union movement, adopted by the International Labour Conference at its th Session (). The fundamental and permanent mission of the trade union movement, states the resolution, is the economic and social advancement of the workers. When trade unions in accordance with the national law and practice of their respective countries and at the decision of their members decide to establish relations with a political party or to undertake Constitutional political action as a means towards the advancement of their economic and social objectives, such political relations or actions should not be of such a nature as to compromise the continuance of a trade union movement or its social or economic functions irrespective of political changes in the country. The resolution also stresses that governments should not attempt to transform the trade union movement into an instrument for the pursuance of political aims, nor should they attempt to interfere with the normal functions of a trade union movement because of its freely established relationship with a political party.
.Allegations concerning the registration and cancellation of registration of trade unions
.The representative of the Director-General explained that a resolution, No. / of  October , repealed resolutions of  which, by administrative decision, cancelled the registration of numerous trade unions, including the single union of workers of the Central Romana Corporations and Central Romana By Products mentioned in the complaints. Such registration was necessary to enable the trade unions to function. In the preamble to this new resolution it is stated, among other things, that the previous Government was guilty of actions ultra vires by assuming powers that legally belonged to the courts of first instance by virtue of section  of the Labour Code. The preamble also refers to Article  of Convention no. , which prohibits the dissolution or suspension of workers' and employers' organisations by administrative authority. In these circumstances the Committee considers that this aspect of the case calls for no further examination.
.In this connection, the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has observed that according to section  of the Labour Code the registration of a trade union could be refused by the Ministry of Labour. It had asked the Government whether it was possible to appeal to the courts against a refusal to register a trade union. The Under-Secretary of State told the representative of the Director-General that it was possible to appeal against a refusal to register a trade union, as it was to appeal against any administrative act.
.Allegations concerning intervention by the public authorities in the internal affairs of trade unions and occupation of trade union premises
.The problems raised in this connection were of two kinds. The first related to an administrative resolution, No. / of  October , issued by the Secretariat of State for Labour, according to which general assemblies organised with a view to setting up a trade union, federation or Confederation, electing its executive Committee, amending its statutes, merging with other trade unions or affiliating with a federation or Confederation, had to be ""certified"" by a labour inspector. After examining the file on the case and hearing the administration's opinion, the Secretary of state decided whether the trade union can be registered, whether its executive Committee can be recognised, and whether a merger or affiliation can take place, after having previously verified that the legal requirements have been fulfilled. The Committee expressed the view in its th Report that the obligation to accept the presence of a representative of the authorities at general assemblies constituted a restriction upon the free activity of trade unions.
.The representative of the Director-General received the assurance that the resolution would shortly be repealed. The officials he talked with added that, pending the repeal, the authorities would abide by the limitations placed on this text by two rulings of the Supreme Court of Justice. According to the rulings, the powers of the Secretariat of State for Labour in trade union affairs should be interpreted restrictively and the purpose of the presence of an inspector at union assemblies could only be to provide the Secretariat with a report on the circumstances in which the assembly took place and on the decisions adopted. The Court stressed that contesting union elections was a matter for the labour tribunal and not the administrative authorities. According to officials of the CGT, says the report, while the previous Government had used this resolution to commit excesses, the present Government was not applying it in the same spirit.
.The second set of problems raised relates to factual situations: intervention by the authorities in the elections of the Stevedores' Union (POASI); manoeuvres in other undertakings, with the assistance of the authorities, to remove trade union leaders from office; confiscation and misappropriation of the funds of POASI; and occupation of its premises and those- of the National Union of Independent Drivers (UNACHOSIN). In this connection the representative of the Director-General makes the following statement in his report:With regard to the election of trade union leaders, the Secretary and Under-Secretary of State declared that the Supreme Court ruling in the POASI case was a clear case of the infringement of the law by the Government of that period. They confirmed that the POASI had organised elections on  October  and was now operating normally. They also confirmed that the premises of the POASI and UNACHOSIN had been occupied but that a stop had now been put to these measures. The Under-Secretary of State for Labour said that in occupying union premises the previous Government had not respected existing legal provisions. Forcible entry is prohibited by law and misuse of power by public servants is a punishable offence under the Penal Code. As to the allegations concerning POASI funds, he said that this was now past history and that the POASI was currently verifying its financial records. If any misappropriation of funds was brought to light, the matter would be brought before the competent authorities.
.The representative of the Director-General continues:In more general terms, the Secretary of State for the Interior and for the Police informed me that meetings organised on union premises were allowed to take place unhindered and that no authorisation was required open-air meetings were another matter and did require authorisation, and the appropriate decisions were taken in the light of all relevant factors: importance of the date for the union ( May, for example), traffic problems, proximity of an important building (hospital, for example), etc.
.The Committee notes that a solution has now been found to the factual problems raised in the complaints. It also notes the intention of the Government to repeal Resolution No. / mentioned above and trusts that this measure will be taken in the near future.
.Allegations concerning interference with the right to strike
.Complaints were also made with reference to the exercise of the right to strike. In this connection, the representative of the Director-General points out, the labour authorities have recognised that it was virtually impossible to engage in strike action in the present state of the legislation. Such action could only last for a few days because judges were empowered to order a return to work. The report adds:It is significant that the Labour Code only authorises strike action within very strict limits (see sections ,  and ): for example, more than  per cent of the employees concerned must have voted in favour of the strike; a strike cannot take place if one of the parties decides to submit the dispute to arbitration; and it must come to an end upon the expiry of the legal time limit for the resumption of work ordered by the judge. The right to strike is restricted even further by the provisions governing arbitration procedure: the presiding judge can appoint the arbitrators ex officio or at the request of the Secretary of State for Labour (section ) and may order the resumption of work (section ; see also sections  to  and ). The arbitration award has the effect of a collective agreement (section",0,1974,Dominican Republic
100,"). The Secretary of State adds that the judge orders the resumption of work but that, moreover, arbitrators were not appointed. The Under-Secretary told me that he knew of hardly any case where a strike had been recognised as legal. In the past the police had often intervened and an appeal to the tribunal was barely conceivable under these conditions. Nowadays, whenever a collective labour dispute arose, the Government tried to reconcile the parties; often the employers accepted to reinstate at least some of the strikers, and the police no longer intervened. However, he added that in the current period of transition he would not hesitate to apply the sections of the Labour code that empowered him to prevent a strike if he felt that public order was threatened - although this situation had not arisen.
.The representative of the Director-General referred to information according to which the party in power, the PRD, had undertaken to revise the Labour Code so as to make it more liberal; the debate on the subject had already begun in the legislative chambers. The question of the right to strike had not yet been taken up, but the Secretary of State for Labour said that he intended to propose the adoption of liberal provisions in this respect as he wanted to bring Dominican legislation fully into line with the ILO's standards and principles respecting freedom of association.
.The Committee has always considered the right to strike as one of the essential means by which workers and their organisations may promote and defend their occupational interests it has held that restrictions or prohibitions on the right to strike are admissible only under certain conditions, in particular in the public service and in essential services (in the strict sense of the term). In the latter cases, it has added, such restrictions should be accompanied by adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures in which the parties can take part at every stage, and at which the awards are binding on both parties in all cases. Such awards should be executed rapidly and completely.
.The Committee notes the Government's intention to revise its legislation on this important question. It has also noted that the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has made certain observations on the present strike legislation. It would be desirable that the envisaged amendments should be adopted at an early date.
.Allegations concerning the trade union rights of agricultural workers
.This aspect of the case was the subject both of a complaint and of observations by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, which considered that the exclusion of certain rural workers from the field of application of the provisions of the Labour Code which guaranteed the right of association was incompatible with Convention No. . In this connection the representative of the Director-General states the following:When asked about this, the Secretary and Under-Secretary of State for Labour explained that under the previous regime there had in practice been a certain amount of opposition to unionisation. On the other hand, the present Government was trying to meet and encourage the participation of peasants' representatives. Under the Labour Code agricultural workers were entitled to set up trade unions. According to section , the provisions of the Code do not apply to any agricultural undertaking, agricultural undertaking of an industrial type or stock raising or forestry undertaking which does not continuously and permanently employ more than ten persons, but this refers to the undertakings themselves and not to the workers. As the Secretary of State pointed out, this means that the workers cannot set up a works union and, in fact, section  of the Code stipulates that associations of employees must have not less than  members. However, nothing prevents them from setting up an occupational ""class"" union. The government authorities I spoke to actually cited two federations that were registered with the Secretariat of State for Labour (and therefore possess juridical personality)
.The information gathered by the representative of the Director-General refers both to the de facto situation and to certain legal difficulties. From the latter point of view the authorities have provided the necessary explanations, even though it would be desirable for the Labour Code to be more explicit in recognising the right of all rural workers to form unions. It would also appear that the de facto situation has improved, and the Committee takes note of this development.
.Allegations concerning the trade union rights of teachers and public servants
.The complainants mention the specific case of a teachers' union, the Dominican Teachers' Association (ADP), which the public authorities refused to recognise. In its th Report the Committee referred to the comments of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations and expressed concern at the position of public officials and public servants in general, who are excluded from the Labour Code and thereby deprived of the trade union rights proclaimed by the Code.
.The ADP, reports the representative of the Director-General, was granted legal personality in January . Another union - the National Union of Educators (UNE) - was registered at the Secretariat of State for Labour in accordance with the provisions of the Labour Code. These two organisations were theoretically for teachers from the private sector; however, according to their by-laws and, with the tacit assent of the public authorities, teachers from the public sector were also allowed to join.
.Generally speaking, public servants and other persons employed by the public authorities are excluded, with certain exceptions, from labour legislation (section  of the Labour Code, Act No.  of  July ] and are therefore deprived of the guarantees provided for therein with respect to freedom of association. Furthermore, the representative of the Director-General refers to an Act, No.  of  November , which prohibits any propaganda activity or attempt to encourage people to join trade unions within public and municipal administrations or autonomous state institutions (section ). ""According to government officials"", he writes, ""this latter provision means in effect that all trade union activity in the public sector is prohibited. Outside the public service in the strict sense, however, individual statutes do provide for the right to organise.""
.The report continues:The Secretary of State for Labour said that, although the right for public servants to join trade unions was not recognised, their right of association on the basis of Act No.  on non-profit-making associations was fully guaranteed. As early as  the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations had, however, made a number of comments on this Act, which contains provisions (for example, section  which refers to the dissolution of an association by the executive authority) whose application could constitute an infringement of Convention No. . The trade union organisations with which I had discussions were highly critical of this legislation: Act No.  permits the creation of cultural or mutual assistance associations but, according to them, not of real workers' organisations entitled, for instance, to submit claims and to negotiate collectively. Moreover, it is the Government which is responsible for registering and recognising these associations, which are not governed by the Labour Code. However, according to the UGTD, although trade union legislation would be preferable these associations do nevertheless permit workers to organise themselves and to defend their interests and they are also able to take legal action. According to the Under-Secretary of State for Labour, the Government accepts the activities of organisations set up to defend the interests of public servants. Thus, for instance, a Dominican Public Service Federation (FEDOMEPIA) has been created. The Secretary of State added that he intended to propose a new public service status which would sanction the right to organise in this sector.
.The Committee has often stressed, and particularly in two recent cases, that the standards on freedom of association embodied in Convention No.  apply to all workers ""without distinction whatsoever"", and are therefore applicable to employees of the State. It was indeed considered inequitable to draw any distinction in trade union matters between workers in the private sector and public servants, since persons in either category are permitted to become organised for the defence of their interests. It was also made clear during the preparatory work on Convention No.  that recognition of the right of association of public servants in no way prejudges the question of the right of such officials to strike. Their special situation has, as mentioned earlier, led the Committee to admit that this right could be restricted for public servants.
.The Committee takes note of the information gathered regarding the present opportunities for state personnel to join associations for the defence of their occupational interests, and on the reforms envisaged. It nevertheless considers it essential that the right of all public servants to organise should be fully recognised in the near future, and in this connection notes that the question is the subject of an examination and observations by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions",0,1974,Dominican Republic
101,"and Recommendations.
.The right to form federations and Confederations
.During the direct contacts mission discussions were also held with the authorities on a restriction imposed by legislation on the right to form federations and Confederations. In this connection the representative of the Director-General writes:Finally, the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations noted that Resolution No. / of the Secretariat of State for Labour requires a minimum of seven trade unions to form a federation and four federations - or three federations of craft unions - to form a Confederation. The Committee considered that these provisions restricted the right of organisations to establish federations and Confederations as provided in Article  of the Convention. The Secretary of State informed me that the purpose of this text was to avoid the proliferation of trade union federations and Confederations. However, when I explained to him the point of view of the ILO supervisory bodies on the matter as a whole, he informed me that the resolution would very shortly be repealed.
.Although this matter has not been the subject of complaints, the Committee takes note of this information, to which it draws the attention of the Committee of Experts.
.Generally speaking, the Committee notes that due to the recent change in Government there has been a favourable development in the trade union situation in the country since the complaints were presented. Although certain matters remain to be settled - in particular the question of dismissals of trade unionists and certain alleged discriminatory practices in the public sector - a solution has now been found to the other points raised by the complainants and amendments to the trade union legislation on the points raised by the Committee and the Committee of Experts are under examination.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the death, arrest or banishment of trade unionists:
.Since  the Committee has been called upon to examine numerous complaints of infringement of freedom of association in the Dominican Republic, presented by the following organisations: world Confederation of Labour (WCL), world Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), International Metalworkers' Federation (IMF), World Federation of Teachers' Unions, General Workers' Federation (CGT), National Federation of Dockworkers, Stevedores' Union (POASI), National Union of Heavy Machinery Operators (SINOMAPE), National Union of Telephone Workers (SNTT). These complaints have been examined as Cases Nos. , , , ,  and .
.In these complaints allegations were made relating, inter alia, to the death, arrest and banishment of trade unionists, dismissals on account of trade union activities, the dismantling of trade union organisations, intervention by the public authorities in the internal affairs of trade unions (meetings, elections, trade union funds), the occupation of trade union premises, interference with the right to strike and the trade union rights of teachers and agricultural workers.
.The subject-matter of these complaints was brought to the attention of the Government as the complaints were received. The Government provided comments on several of the allegations.
.The Committee examined Case No.  at its sessions in May and November , when it submitted interim reports to the Governing Body, A further interim report was submitted by the Committee to the Governing Body with respect to Case No.  and Cases Nos. , ,  and  in May . The Committee again examined all the cases pending with regard to the Dominican Republic at its November  session 
.At its may  session the Committee observed that although the Government had submitted comments and information on several of the allegations made, the Committee possessed insufficient information to enable it to reach conclusions at that stage regarding the substance of the various issues raised. The Committee recalled, moreover, that it had already examined, on several occasions, cases concerning the Dominican Republic which involved allegations similar to those made in the present cases. In these circumstances, the Committee considered that it would be very useful to apply the direct contacts procedure. The Governing Body, accordingly, requested the Government to consider the possibility of giving its consent to the carrying out of a study in the Dominican Republic of the facts surrounding the complaints by a representative of the Director-General, who would report to the Committee thereon.
.No reply having been received from the Government in November  and February  the Committee invited it to give its early consideration to the request for direct contacts and to communicate its decision in this connection as soon as possible.
.In May , in the continued absence of any communication from the Government in this connection, the Committee decided to apply the special procedure provided for in paragraphs  and  of its th Report. Under this procedure, the Government was immediately informed that the Chairman of the Committee would, on behalf of the Committee, make contact with its representatives attending the rd Session of the International Labour Conference, draw their attention to the particular cases involved and discuss with them the reasons for the delay in transmitting the observations requested. The Chairman was then to report to the Committee on the results of such contacts. However, since the Government did not designate any representative to the rd Session of the Conference, the said procedure could not be applied.
.In a letter dated  August , the Government stated that it was considering the request it had received to accept the visit of a representative of the Director-General, and added that a final reply would be given when it was in the interests of the country to do so.
.At its November  session the Committee expressed its regret at the Government's delay in acceding to the request made of it to give its consent to the visit of a representative of the Director-General. In this connection, the Committee emphasised that the purpose of the whole procedure was to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and expressed its confidence that, if this procedure protected governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their part would recognise the importance for the protection of their own good name of co-operating with the Committee in every way so that it could examine the allegations fully and seek possible solutions to the problems involved. The Committee moreover laid particular stress on the importance it attached to the direct contacts procedure.
.In these circumstances, the Governing Body, on the Committee's recommendation,(a) urged the Government to give its consent without delay to an inquiry into the trade union situation being carried out in the Dominican Republic by a representative of the Director-General;(b) requested the Director-General to contact the Government at the highest possible level so as to express the concern of the Committee and to insist that the Government should give a favourable response to the request for direct contacts.
.In February , the Committee noted that in spite of the reminders sent to the Government on this question the Government had not replied. The Committee deplored the fact that the Government of the Dominican Republic had shown no desire to cooperate with the procedures available in the field of trade union rights. In these circumstances, the Governing Body decided that, in the event of no reply being received from the Government before its next session, wider publicity should be given to the allegations, to the replies of the Government, to the recommendations of the Committee and to the obstructive attitude of the Government's.
.Since then, no reply has been received from the Government.
.The Dominican Republic has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee must first of all deplore the fact that, notwithstanding the insistent and repeated requests addressed to the Government at the highest level, the Government has failed to reply to the proposal made by the Committee and the Governing Body that recourse be had to direct contacts. In view of the importance and seriousness of the matters raised in the complaints and the inadequacy of the information at its disposal, the Committee remains convinced that a visit to the Dominican Republic by a representative of the Director-General would have afforded an opportunity to gain a greater insight into the trade union situation and give fruitful consideration to possible solutions to the problems involved.
.Before taking up each of the matters raised by the complainants, the Committee wishes to emphasise the importance of the cases under consideration, which raise serious issues pertaining to freedom of association and human rights in relation to trade union rights. In this connection the Committee expresses its deep concern at the acuteness and diversity of the problems faced by a substantial part of the Dominican trade union movement in a wide variety of branches of activity.
.The Committee notes in particular that, according to the allegations, certain trade union organisations, in many cases of nation-wide importance, have for many years been having great difficulty in carrying on their activities owing to the multiple obstacles that have been put in their path: arrest and dismissal of",0,1974,Dominican Republic
102,"their leaders, occupation of their premises, interference in their internal affairs. Such an atmosphere cannot be conducive to the development of a truly free and independent trade union movement, nor to the promotion of normal industrial relations. The Committee wishes to emphasise before proceeding any further that, as stated in the resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties adopted by the International Labour Conference in , the absence of civil liberties removes all meaning from the concept of trade union rights, and the rights conferred upon workers' and employers' organisations must be based on respect for those civil liberties.
.The allegations refer to a considerable number of murders of officials of workers' organisations, especially in the agricultural sector, committed in most cases by employers or overseers. In the absence of any detailed information on these cases from the Government, the Committee feels bound to observe that the Government has not established that these deaths occurred for reasons unconnected with the status or activities of the officials in question. The Committee considers that, in any event, the circumstances of these cases should have prompted the authorities to take effective steps to establish the facts, punish the culprits and restore the situation to normal, this being an essential prerequisite for the free exercise of trade union rights.
.Many of the complaints mention the arrest and detention of officials of various trade union organisations. Contradictory explanations as to the reasons for these measures have been given by the complainants and by the Government. According to the former they were due to trade union activities, while the latter has claimed in general terms that the officials in question were arrested for breaches of laws in respect of public order or for common-law offences.
.Be this as it may, the Committee must observe that the Government has not supplied detailed information as to the acts of which the persons arrested were accused, thus preventing the Committee from examining the allegations with all the facts before it. The Committee considers that the onus was on the Government to show that the measures it had taken were not prompted by the trade union activities of the persons concerned.
.While most of the trade unionists mentioned in the complaints appear to have now recovered their freedom, it has none the less been clearly established that some of them were kept in custody for relatively lengthy periods of time, in some cases at repeated intervals. It is impossible to determine from the Government's replies whether the persons concerned were brought before the courts. Only in a few cases does it appear from the information supplied by the complainants that legal proceedings were initiated against the trade union officials concerned. One of them was moreover kept in prison even though he had been found not guilty by a court of first instance.
.The Committee must recall in this connection that it is one of the fundamental rights of the individual that a detained person should be brought without delay before the appropriate judge, this right being recognised in such instruments as the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man. In the case of persons engaged in trade union activities, this is one of the civil liberties which should be ensured by the authorities in order to guarantee the full effectiveness of the exercise of trade union rights. The Committee further wishes to point out that the detention by the authorities of trade unionists concerning whom no grounds for prosecution are subsequently found is liable to involve restrictions on trade union rights, and governments should take steps to ensure that the authorities concerned have instructions appropriate to eliminate the danger of detention for trade union activities.
.According to the complainants, the authorities have also ordered the expulsion from the country of certain trade union officials. One of them was refused entry into the Dominican Republic on his return from an international trade union conference. In the Committee's opinion, a measure exiling trade unionists, which is in violation of human rights, is of particular gravity since it deprives the persons concerned of the possibility of working in their country and of contacts with their families. It is also in violation of freedom of association in that it undermines the trade union organisations which are thereby deprived of their leaders.
.According to the information supplied by the complainants, many trade union officials and members have been dismissed from their jobs in a large number of undertakings covering a wide range of activities. In most of these cases it has been alleged that the sole ground for the action in question was the trade union activities of the persons concerned. In some cases the underlying intention was stated to be the dismantling of trade unions, though this has been denied by the Government. The Government has however admitted that some undertakings engage in practices hardly conducive to the development of sound industrial relations which it cannot combat effectively under the legislation in force.
.The Committee considers that no person should be discriminated against on account of his trade union membership or activities, and that governments should take measures to ensure that workers are protected against acts, including dismissal, which are likely to provoke or have as their object anti-union discrimination in respect of employment. Legislation enabling employers in practice - on condition that they pay the compensation prescribed by law for cases of unjustified dismissal - to get rid of any worker, even if the true reason is his trade union membership or activities, does not give sufficient protection against acts of anti-union discrimination.
.Protection against acts of anti-union discrimination is particularly desirable in the case of trade union officials, because, in order to carry out their trade union functions in full independence, they must have the assurance that they will not be victimised by virtue of their trade union office. Such an assurance is also necessary to ensure that effect is given to the principle that workers' organisations should have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom .
.A large number of trade union organisations appear to have been dismantled over the past few years, either through the withdrawal of their legal personality or through the setting up of parallel unions or through their destruction by employers. In answer to these allegations the Government has merely stated that the great majority of the organisations in question are still in existence but their leaders have been removed from office by decision of their members. The Committee does not have sufficient information to enable it to express an opinion on these matters in full knowledge of the facts. In particular, it has not been specified whether the legal personality of the trade union mentioned by the complainants was withdrawn by order of the administrative authorities or as a result of court proceedings. The Committee notes, however, that under the terms of section  of the Labour Code, the registration of a trade union may be cancelled by a decision of the courts if the trade union pursues activities not connected with its lawful objectives.
.As concerns the setting up of parallel unions and the destruction of trade unions by employers, the Committee wishes to recall that under the terms of Article  of Convention No. , ratified by the Dominican Republic, workers' and employers' organisations must enjoy adequate protection against any acts of interference by each other or each other's agents or members in their establishment, functioning or administration. Article  specifies that acts which are designed to promote the establishment of workers' organisations under the domination of employers or employers' organisations, or to support workers' organisations by financial or other means with the object of placing such organisations under the control of employers or employers' organisations, shall be deemed to constitute acts of interference.
.The allegations of interference by public authorities in the internal affairs of trade unions are mainly concerned with the right of assembly, the right to elect officials in full freedom and trade union funds. The Committee considers that freedom of assembly for trade union purposes constitutes one of the fundamental elements of trade union rights, and that the authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof. The obligation to accept the presence of a representative of the authorities at general assemblies constitutes a restriction upon the free activity of trade unions.
.With regard to trade union elections, the complainants stated that rigged elections had been held in the POASI union and that the Supreme Court had ruled them to be illegal. According to more recent information supplied by the Government, properly conducted elections were subsequently held in this union. In this connection the Committee wishes once again to emphasise the importance it attaches to the principle that workers and their organisations should have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom.
.The POASI is also alleged by the complainants to have had its assets confiscated.",1,1974,Dominican Republic
103,"According to the Government these allegations are false. In view of the contradictory nature of these statements, the Committee can only recall the importance of the principle that trade union funds should be adequately protected.
.It appears from the allegations made that the headquarters of certain trade union organisations have been occupied by the police, in some cases several times. The latest intervention of this kind - involving the POASI - seems to have been quite recent. In this connection the Committee wishes to draw the Government's attention to the fact that, in the resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties, the International Labour Conference, expressed the view that the right to protection of the property of trade union organisations was one of the civil liberties which were essential for the normal exercise of trade union rights. While trade unions cannot claim immunity from a search of their premises, such a search should only be made following the issue of a warrant by the ordinary judicial authority after that authority has been satisfied that reasonable grounds exist for supposing that evidence exists on the said premises material to a prosecution for an offence under the ordinary law and provided that such search is restricted to the purposes in respect of which the warrant was issued.
.With regard to the allegations relating to interference with the right to strike, the Committee recalls that the right to strike is one of the essential means through which workers and their organisations may promote and defend their occupational interests. The Committee points out in this connection that on several occasions the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has made comments with respect to sections  to  of the Labour Code, which allow all cases of collective labour disputes to be referred to arbitration, culminating in a binding award, which might severely restrict the right to strike and thus infringe the right of trade unions to organise their activities. As concerns the calling in of the police to obstruct, according to the complainants, the exercise of the right to strike, the Committee considers that intervention by security forces in the event of strikes should be limited to the maintenance of public order.
.As concerns the Government's refusal to recognise the legal existence of the Dominican Teachers' Association, the Committee refers to the comments of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations with respect to the position of public servants in the Dominican Republic, who are excluded from the Labour code and thereby deprived of the trade union rights proclaimed by the Code. The Committee recalls that public servants, including teachers, are entitled to enjoy the right to organise, just as other workers are.
.A number of complaints were partly concerned with the trade union situation in the agricultural sector. This branch of activity does indeed seem to have been particularly affected by extremely serious incidents, sometimes involving the death of trade union officials. In addition, according to the complainants, the Government has prevented agricultural workers from organising themselves freely, even though their trade union rights are recognised by law. The Committee wishes in this connection to emphasise the particular importance the International Labour Conference attached to the trade union rights of rural workers in adopting the Rural Workers' Organisations Convention (No. ) in . Article  of this Convention provides that it shall be an objective of national policy concerning rural development to facilitate the establishment and growth, on a voluntary basis, of strong and independent organisations of rural workers as an effective means of ensuring the participation of rural workers, without discrimination, in economic and social development and in the benefits resulting therefrom.
.In these circumstances, as concerns the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the Government's attention to the considerations and principles set forth in paragraphs  to  concerning the death, arrest, banishment and dismissal of trade unionists, the dismantling of trade union organisations, intervention by public authorities in the internal affairs of trade unions, the occupation of trade union premises, the right to strike and the trade union rights of teachers and agricultural workers;(b) to deplore the obstructive attitude and lack of co-operation shown by the Government, which, by not consenting to a mission on the spot, and by not transmitting its replies on the questions before the Committee has made it impossible to obtain all the information on the serious allegations made and to decide what measures could be taken as regards the problems involved;(c) to decide to give wider publicity to the present report, in particular during the next session of the International Labour Conference.Geneva,  May . (Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.
.The Committee has already examined several complaints of infringements of trade union rights in the Dominican Republic, presented by the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), the International Metalworkers' Federation (IMF), the National Union of Heavy Machinery Operators (SINOMAPE), the National Federation of Dockworkers, the Stevedores' Union (POASI) and the General Workers' Federation (CGT). These complaints were dealt with under Cases Nos. , , ,  and . With regard to Case No. , the Committee submitted a number of conclusions to the Governing Body that appear in paragraphs  to  of its st Report and in paragraphs  to  of its rd Report. The Committee also examined Case No.  and Cases Nos. , ,  and  in its th Report (paragraphs  to ) in which it also submitted certain conclusions to the Governing Body.
.Since then, further allegations have been received in connection with these cases. They have been made by the WFTU (communication of  July ), the National Union of Telephone Workers (communications of  July  and  September ), the POASI and the CGT (joint communication of  April ) and the CGT (communication of  June ).
.The World Federation of Teachers' Unions also submitted allegations in a letter of  May  (Case No. ).
.The Government submitted certain information in a letter of  August .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee notes the information communicated by the Government which recognises, in particular, that, in certain undertakings, practices exist that are not conducive to the development of healthy labour management relations and to which it cannot effectively put a stop under the legislation currently in force. New complaints have been received containing allegations that are as serious and as varied as those previously examined. It should be borne in mind, moreover, that the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has for several years been making observations on the application by the Dominican Republic of Conventions Nos.  and , which it has ratified.
.The Committee regrets the Government's delay in acceding to the request made of it to give its consent to the visit of a representative of the Director-General. In this connection, the Committee wishes to emphasise that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and the Committee is confident that, if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their part will recognise the importance for the protection of their own good name of co-operating with the Committee in every way so that it can examine the allegations fully and seek possible solutions to the problems involved. In paragraphs  to  of its th Report, the Committee has laid particular stress on the importance it attaches in this connection to the direct contacts procedure.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to urge the Government to give its consent without delay to an inquiry into the trade union situation being carried out in the Dominican Republic by a representative of the Director General;(b) to request the Director-General to contact the Government at the highest possible level so as to express the concern of the Committee and to insist that the Government should give a favourable response to the request made above;(c) to take note of this interim report.
.The Committee already examined Case No.  in May and November  and on each occasion it submitted a report to the Governing Body. These reports appear in paragraphs  to  of the Committee's st report and paragraphs  to  of its rd report.
.In its rd Report, the Committee recommended that the Governing Body request the Government to provide additional information on one aspect of the matter. Despite repeated requests, this information was not received. The Committee, therefore, addressed urgent appeals to the Government in November  and February and May  that it supply the information requested. In November  and February , the Committee noted with regret that despite its appeals the requested information still had not been received. In May ",1,1974,Dominican Republic
104,"it again made an urgent appeal to the Government to supply the information.
.Regarding Cases Nos. , ,  and , the complaints and additional information submitted by the complainants appear in the following communications: three communications, of  October ,  September  and  June , from the National Union of Heavy Machinery Operators (SINOMAPE), a communication of  November , from the National Federation of Dockworkers, two communications, of  May  and  November , from the Stevedores' Union (POASI), a communication of  August , from the General Workers' Federation (CGT), two communications, of  September  and  July , from the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), three communications, of  November ,  July and  October , from the World Confederation of Labour (WCL).
.These complaints were transmitted to the Government as they were received, with requests for observations. Apart from some very general replies sent by communications of  January and  July , and despite the time which had elapsed since the presentation of the first complaints (Case No. ), the Committee received no information from the Government on the various allegations. In November  and May , the Committee sent urgent requests to the Government to submit the information requested (Case No. ).
.As the information requested on all these cases was not received, the Committee asked the Director-General in November  to communicate with the highest level of the Government, on behalf of the Committee, expressing the Committee's concern and urgently requesting the Government to provide the observations requested from it (Cases Nos. , ,  and ). The Government finally submitted information by communications of ,  and  February .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).",1,1974,Dominican Republic
105,".Since  the Committee has had before it numerous complaints of violation of freedom of association in the Dominican Republic. These complaints come from the following workers' organisations: World Confederation of Labour (WCL), World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), International Metalworkers' Federation (IMF), World Federation of Teachers' Unions, General Workers' Federation, National Federation of Dockworkers, Stevedores' Union (POASI), National Union of Heavy Machinery Operators (SINOMAPE), and National Union of Telephone Workers (SNTT). They are dealt with in Cases Nos. , , , ,  and .
.The Committee examined Case No.  in May and November  and at each of these sessions presented conclusions to the Governing Body. The Committee submitted further conclusions to the Governing Body (on Cases Nos. , , ,  and ) in May . Finally, it examined all the outstanding cases relating to the Dominican Republic in November  and May .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In May  the Committee considered that the information at its disposal seemed insufficient to enable it to reach conclusions regarding the substance of the various issues raised. It had already examined, on several occasions, cases concerning the Dominican Republic which contained allegations similar to those made in the cases under examination. In these circumstances it considered that it would be very useful to apply the direct contacts procedure. The Governing Body accordingly requested the Government to consider the possibility of giving its consent to the carrying out of a study in the Dominican Republic of the facts surrounding the complaints by a representative of the Director-General.
.This request was repeated on a number of occasions. In addition, new complaints were presented which, like the earlier ones, contained a variety of serious allegations. Since no detailed reply had been received by May , the Committee had been obliged to formulate its conclusions on the cases in its th Report. However, the new Dominican Government constituted after the elections in May  accepted direct contacts by letter of  September .
.The Director-General appointed Mr. Jean-Michel Servais, an official of the Freedom of Association Branch of the International Labour Standards Department, to represent him during this mission. The visit to the country took place from  to  November , and a report on the mission was submitted to the Committee. During his visit, the representative of the Director-General had conversations with the Secretary of State for Labour and the Secretary of State for the Interior and the Police, with the Under-Secretaries of State for Labour and the Under-Secretaries o?State for the Interior and for the Police, and with the Public Prosecutor of the Republic. He was also received by the President of the Supreme Court of Justice. He met the leaders of a number of trade union organisations - including those of two of the complainant organisations, CGT and POASI - on their trade union premises. Finally, he had discussions at the headquarters of the Employers' Confederation of the Dominican Republic with the officials of this organisation, and with those of the Association of Industries of the Dominican Republic.
.The Committee notes with satisfaction that the representative of the Director-General enjoyed the co-operation of all concerned. He was able to carry out all his tasks in full freedom and independence and the Dominican Government afforded him the necessary facilities to perform his mission in the best possible circumstances.
.The representative of the Director-General collected information on the various issues raised in the complaints and on the measures taken or envisaged to solve the problems encountered. At the invitation of the Government he also discussed the comments made by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations during its periodic examination of the application of Conventions Nos.  and  under article  of the ILO Constitution. All these points are examined in the paragraphs which follow.
.First of all, however, it should be pointed out that, according to the representative of the Director-General, a number of Confederations are at present contending for the allegiance of the workers and the control of the works unions. ""Thus"", he writes, ""at the time of my visit antagonism had taken a very serious turn in the Central Romana Corporations and Central Romana By-Products enterprise, a situation which seems likely to continue, if not to deteriorate further, in the coming months."" Trade union Confederations often maintain close political relations with political parties. The General Union of Dominican Workers (UGTD), which was set up very recently, is in sympathy with the Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD). As will be seen later on the Government has been accused of favouring this new organisation to a certain extent. A similar preoccupation is revealed in a telegram of  December  from the General Workers' Federation (CGT), in which this organisation protests against the administrative order allegedly given by the Government to close down the programme of the ""Rutas"" radio station at La Romana and its alleged prevention of the reorganisation of the local union. This communication has been transmitted to the Government for its observations. The employers' representatives, the report continues, have expressed the view that this situation has created a tense atmosphere in industrial relations on the other hand, it appears that large numbers of unions are now being formed in the present social circumstances.
.Allegations concerning the death, arrest or banishment of trade unionists
.As the mission report states, an amnesty law was passed on  September . All the trade unionists who were mentioned as having been under arrest have now been released. In addition, the banished trade unionists have recently returned to the country under the amnesty law and after the removal of administrative obstacles to their return.
.Finally, it appears from the information gathered that under the Code of Penal Procedure any person who is detained must be brought before a judge within  hours of his arrest. In addition, an old habeas corpus Act protects individuals against arbitrary arrest. In the past, according to the Public Prosecutor of the Republic, the practice was to refer pleas of this nature to the Public Ministry ""which sometimes took rather arbitrary decisions""; this has now been changed and the pleas come before a judge of first instance. Moreover, a Hill to amend the habeas corpus Act is in preparation which stipulates explicitly that the plea must be referred to a judge and prescribes an appeals procedure. As regards banishment, the Public Prosecutor stated that, legally, such a measure could only be taken against foreigners (under the Immigration Law). No law permits the expulsion of nationals, and the measures taken by the previous Government were, in his opinion, arbitrary. There had been no more expulsions since  August .
.Legal proceedings have been instituted in respect of the two cases of murder mentioned in the complaints of the peasants' trade union leaders (Florinda Muoz Soriano in November , and Dionisio Frias in June ). The Secretary and the Under-Secretary of State for Labour said that they would send detailed information regarding the judicial investigations undertaken. It was, they admitted, true that peasant leaders had in the past met their deaths in abnormal circumstances. The new Government, they added, had stated that it would pursue a policy of respect for civil liberties and human rights, including freedom of association. The Undersecretary of State further emphasised the determination of the authorities to abide strictly by the law. The representative of the Director-General also learned from the officials of the Autonomous Confederation of Christian Trade Unions (CASC) that legal proceedings were still pending in the case of the murder of Dionisio Frias; as regards the death of Florinda Muoz Soriano the court had considered that the accused had acted in self-defence.
.The Committee notes these various items of information, in particular the release or the return from exile of the trade unionists mentioned in the complaints. The facts surrounding the deaths of two peasant leaders in  and  have been the subject of trials before the courts one of these cases, moreover, appears to have ended in an acquittal. The Government, while admitting that trade unionists in the rural sector had in the past met their deaths in abnormal circumstances, has stated its will to secure respect for the law and for civil liberties. In these circumstances the Committee is of the opinion that these different points call for no further consideration, provided that it is kept informed of the results of the trials in the cases of the deaths of Dioniso Frias and Florinda Muoz Soriano.
.Allegations concerning the dismissal of trade unionists
.Many allegations referred to the dismissal of trade union leaders and militants. According to the complainants the chief target of these dismissals were the executive Committees of the unions, but certain allegations also referred to the dissolution, or attempted dissolution, of workers' organisations. The representative of the Director-General points out in his report that this issue appeared",0,1973,Dominican Republic
106,"to be a fundamental problem which was still disrupting industrial relations in the country. Although section  of the Labour Code prohibits anti-union practices, the penal sanctions imposed are fines ranging from  to  pesos ( peso  US dollar). According to the report, the Government appears willing to do everything in its power to find a solution:The Secretary and Under-Secretary of State recognise that there have been numerous dismissals and that some cases had apparently involved trade union officials. It was also possible that, in order to get rid of certain leaders, employers had dismissed a whole group of workers. The Government had tried to solve matters through conciliation and mediation and had sometimes succeeded. As it stood, however, the existing legislation did not provide it with the means to do more. Quite apart from the fact that it was difficult to find proof - a problem which is not unique to the Dominican Republic, of course - the Labour Code (section ) allows the employer to terminate a contract for an indefinite period, without giving any reason. Consequently, an employer can dismiss a worker if he finds it convenient provided he pays his employee the amounts to which he is legally entitled (corresponding to the period of notice, the leaving grant and days of leave). This applies even when a collective agreement contains a special clause providing for the protection of union officials. According to existing case law, an employer who fails to respect this provision and dismisses trade union leaders is only required to pay the special indemnity which is provided for in the event of a violation of this clause.
.The report mentions that there are at present proposals to amend the Labour Code, in particular section . The representative of the Director-General mentions the various drafts which have been prepared and adds:The President of the Republic has made a public appeal for a social truce. The representatives of the workers and employers are therefore in the process of negotiating an agreement through the Secretariat of State for Labour. One meeting was held during our mission, and the various inter-occupational Confederations whose officials I met took part in it along with the employers' associations. One of the items for discussion had to do with genuine respect for the freedom of association of workers: the employers' organisations are apparently prepared to guarantee that no trade union leader and no leader of any trade union in the process of being set up will be dismissed from their enterprises except by authorisation of an arbitration Committee. In practice, this amounts to an amendment by agreement of section  of the Labour Code. ... Moreover, it is quite feasible that, following the agreement, the matter will be brought before the Congress in the form of a Bill. The Secretary of State informed me that, even if no agreement is reached, a draft amendment to the law will be submitted on this point. Such an amendment could therefore be adopted without it being necessary to wait for the adoption of a new Labour code.
.As the Committee has already pointed out in other cases, legislation which merely prescribes that any worker dismissed without just cause is entitled in certain cases to compensation and damages in addition to the wage corresponding to the period of notice, does not give sufficient protection against acts of anti-union discrimination, since it enables an employer, on condition that he pays the compensation prescribed by law, to dismiss any member of his staff, whether a member of a trade union or not, for trade union or other activities, the public authorities being powerless to prevent him from doing so. Protection is particularly desirable in the case of trade union officials because, in order to be able to perform their trade union duties in full independence, they must have the guarantee that they will not be prejudiced on account of the mandate which they hold from their trade unions. This guarantee is also necessary to secure respect for the principle that workers' organisations have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom.
.The Dominican Government stated that it was keenly aware of the gaps in its legislation in this respect, and that it was trying to obtain a broad consensus as regards the solution to these difficulties. The Committee considers it essential that this question should be settled in the near future, given the problems which have arisen in the country.
.Allegations concerning unfair practices in the public sector
.The allegations referred to the setting up by the Government of a parallel union in Puerto de Andrs at Boca Chica (communication of August ) and a manoeuvre in the Dominican Telephone Company (CODETEL) to make the National Union of Telephone Workers (SNTT) lose its legal representative character (communication of June ).
.As regards the latter point, the representative of the Director-General wanted to assure himself that the SNTT was exercising its trade union activities fully and that it had recently concluded a collective agreement with the enterprise for the period -. The agreement contains a special clause concerning the protection of trade union officials. Except in the case of a former leader who had been suspended, this provision had been respected. However, the report mentions other cases than that referred to in the previous paragraph in which parallel unions had been set up under the former Government. In this respect the Committee had earlier recalled (in May ) the provision of Article  of Convention No. . Under this provision - as under Article  of the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ), not ratified by the Dominican Republic - workers' organisations must enjoy adequate protection against any act of interference by employers in their establishment, functioning or administration. Article  specifies that acts which are designed to promote the establishment of workers' organisations under the domination of employers or employers' organisations, or to support workers' organisations by financial or other means with the object of placing such organisations under the control of employers or employers' organisations, shall be deemed to constitute acts of interference.
.The Secretary and Under-Secretary of State for Labour declared that the present Government would not endorse or tolerate such practices as the previous Cabinet had done, specifically in the transport sector and the sugar industry. The representative of the Director-General adds the following:In a more general vein, I raised the matter of attempts by employers to interfere in the activities of workers' organisations, and not only in the public sector. On this point the Secretary and Under-Secretary of State said that the current provisions of the Labour Code did not give the Government sufficient scope to combat such practices but that it was nevertheless its policy to try to take action on the basis of the complaints received. They added that it was the Government's attention to introduce proper provisions to put a stop to such acts of interference.The Committee notes these statements and considers it desirable, even if the Government is resolved to tolerate such practices no longer, that legal protection should be strengthened and that the Labour Code should, for example, prescribe more dissuasive sanctions for contraventions of section , the provisions of which are reproduced in the footnote.
.According to the information gathered, several union Confederations also expressed concern at the creation of the General Union of Dominican Workers (UGTD) allied to the political party currently in power (PRD) because they were afraid that the new organisation would receive more favourable treatment, especially in the public sector (the State is the principal employer in certain branches of activity, such as agriculture). Dismissals had already allegedly taken place in the health sector and the sugar-cane industry. This had given rise to a fear that the dismissed workers would be replaced by others who supported the new Government. In some cases this was said to have already begun. The representative of the Director-General explains that, according to the governmental authorities he spoke to, most of the Dominican trade unions were independent of the traditional Confederations and close to the PRD; they were now able to organise themselves and were doing so within the UGTD. The report continues:The Government spokesman went on to say that the dismissals that had taken place in the public sector had not been on trade union grounds. Two points in particular should be borne in mind: in the first place, it was customary in the country to give posts in the public sector to members of the party in power (spoils system); secondly, from the economic standpoint it was necessary to cut down in personnel as the number of employees had sometimes grown far too great. They insisted that the Government would respect the right of freedom of association and ideological pluralism. In any case, legal proceedings could be undertaken against the administration if it was suspected of misuse of power.
.On more than one occasion the Committee has examined cases in which allegations were made that the public authorities had by their",0,1973,Dominican Republic
107,"attitude favoured or discriminated against one or more trade union organisations: examples of such allegations are pressure exerted on workers by means of public statements made by the authorities, unequal distribution of subsidies among unions or the granting to one union, rather than to the other, of premises for holding its meetings or carrying on its activities, and refusal to recognise the leaders of certain organisations in their legitimate activities.& Discrimination by these means or others may be an informal way of influencing the trade union membership of workers. They are therefore sometimes difficult to prove. The fact nevertheless remains, as the Committee has recalled in each of the foregoing cases, that any discrimination of this kind jeopardises the right of workers to set up and join organisations of their own choosing, a right which is explicitly recognised in Article  of Convention No. .
.The Committee also wishes to lay stress on the principles set forth in the resolution concerning the independence of the trade union movement, adopted by the International Labour Conference at its th Session (). The fundamental and permanent mission of the trade union movement, states the resolution, is the economic and social advancement of the workers. When trade unions in accordance with the national law and practice of their respective countries and at the decision of their members decide to establish relations with a political party or to undertake Constitutional political action as a means towards the advancement of their economic and social objectives, such political relations or actions should not be of such a nature as to compromise the continuance of a trade union movement or its social or economic functions irrespective of political changes in the country. The resolution also stresses that governments should not attempt to transform the trade union movement into an instrument for the pursuance of political aims, nor should they attempt to interfere with the normal functions of a trade union movement because of its freely established relationship with a political party.
.Allegations concerning the registration and cancellation of registration of trade unions
.The representative of the Director-General explained that a resolution, No. / of  October , repealed resolutions of  which, by administrative decision, cancelled the registration of numerous trade unions, including the single union of workers of the Central Romana Corporations and Central Romana By Products mentioned in the complaints. Such registration was necessary to enable the trade unions to function. In the preamble to this new resolution it is stated, among other things, that the previous Government was guilty of actions ultra vires by assuming powers that legally belonged to the courts of first instance by virtue of section  of the Labour Code. The preamble also refers to Article  of Convention no. , which prohibits the dissolution or suspension of workers' and employers' organisations by administrative authority. In these circumstances the Committee considers that this aspect of the case calls for no further examination.
.In this connection, the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has observed that according to section  of the Labour Code the registration of a trade union could be refused by the Ministry of Labour. It had asked the Government whether it was possible to appeal to the courts against a refusal to register a trade union. The Under-Secretary of State told the representative of the Director-General that it was possible to appeal against a refusal to register a trade union, as it was to appeal against any administrative act.
.Allegations concerning intervention by the public authorities in the internal affairs of trade unions and occupation of trade union premises
.The problems raised in this connection were of two kinds. The first related to an administrative resolution, No. / of  October , issued by the Secretariat of State for Labour, according to which general assemblies organised with a view to setting up a trade union, federation or Confederation, electing its executive Committee, amending its statutes, merging with other trade unions or affiliating with a federation or Confederation, had to be ""certified"" by a labour inspector. After examining the file on the case and hearing the administration's opinion, the Secretary of state decided whether the trade union can be registered, whether its executive Committee can be recognised, and whether a merger or affiliation can take place, after having previously verified that the legal requirements have been fulfilled. The Committee expressed the view in its th Report that the obligation to accept the presence of a representative of the authorities at general assemblies constituted a restriction upon the free activity of trade unions.
.The representative of the Director-General received the assurance that the resolution would shortly be repealed. The officials he talked with added that, pending the repeal, the authorities would abide by the limitations placed on this text by two rulings of the Supreme Court of Justice. According to the rulings, the powers of the Secretariat of State for Labour in trade union affairs should be interpreted restrictively and the purpose of the presence of an inspector at union assemblies could only be to provide the Secretariat with a report on the circumstances in which the assembly took place and on the decisions adopted. The Court stressed that contesting union elections was a matter for the labour tribunal and not the administrative authorities. According to officials of the CGT, says the report, while the previous Government had used this resolution to commit excesses, the present Government was not applying it in the same spirit.
.The second set of problems raised relates to factual situations: intervention by the authorities in the elections of the Stevedores' Union (POASI); manoeuvres in other undertakings, with the assistance of the authorities, to remove trade union leaders from office; confiscation and misappropriation of the funds of POASI; and occupation of its premises and those- of the National Union of Independent Drivers (UNACHOSIN). In this connection the representative of the Director-General makes the following statement in his report:With regard to the election of trade union leaders, the Secretary and Under-Secretary of State declared that the Supreme Court ruling in the POASI case was a clear case of the infringement of the law by the Government of that period. They confirmed that the POASI had organised elections on  October  and was now operating normally. They also confirmed that the premises of the POASI and UNACHOSIN had been occupied but that a stop had now been put to these measures. The Under-Secretary of State for Labour said that in occupying union premises the previous Government had not respected existing legal provisions. Forcible entry is prohibited by law and misuse of power by public servants is a punishable offence under the Penal Code. As to the allegations concerning POASI funds, he said that this was now past history and that the POASI was currently verifying its financial records. If any misappropriation of funds was brought to light, the matter would be brought before the competent authorities.
.The representative of the Director-General continues:In more general terms, the Secretary of State for the Interior and for the Police informed me that meetings organised on union premises were allowed to take place unhindered and that no authorisation was required open-air meetings were another matter and did require authorisation, and the appropriate decisions were taken in the light of all relevant factors: importance of the date for the union ( May, for example), traffic problems, proximity of an important building (hospital, for example), etc.
.The Committee notes that a solution has now been found to the factual problems raised in the complaints. It also notes the intention of the Government to repeal Resolution No. / mentioned above and trusts that this measure will be taken in the near future.
.Allegations concerning interference with the right to strike
.Complaints were also made with reference to the exercise of the right to strike. In this connection, the representative of the Director-General points out, the labour authorities have recognised that it was virtually impossible to engage in strike action in the present state of the legislation. Such action could only last for a few days because judges were empowered to order a return to work. The report adds:It is significant that the Labour Code only authorises strike action within very strict limits (see sections ,  and ): for example, more than  per cent of the employees concerned must have voted in favour of the strike; a strike cannot take place if one of the parties decides to submit the dispute to arbitration; and it must come to an end upon the expiry of the legal time limit for the resumption of work ordered by the judge. The right to strike is restricted even further by the provisions governing arbitration procedure: the presiding judge can appoint the arbitrators ex officio or at the request of the Secretary of State for Labour (section ) and may order the resumption of work (section ; see also sections  to  and ). The arbitration award has the effect of a collective agreement (section",0,1973,Dominican Republic
108,"). The Secretary of State adds that the judge orders the resumption of work but that, moreover, arbitrators were not appointed. The Under-Secretary told me that he knew of hardly any case where a strike had been recognised as legal. In the past the police had often intervened and an appeal to the tribunal was barely conceivable under these conditions. Nowadays, whenever a collective labour dispute arose, the Government tried to reconcile the parties; often the employers accepted to reinstate at least some of the strikers, and the police no longer intervened. However, he added that in the current period of transition he would not hesitate to apply the sections of the Labour code that empowered him to prevent a strike if he felt that public order was threatened - although this situation had not arisen.
.The representative of the Director-General referred to information according to which the party in power, the PRD, had undertaken to revise the Labour Code so as to make it more liberal; the debate on the subject had already begun in the legislative chambers. The question of the right to strike had not yet been taken up, but the Secretary of State for Labour said that he intended to propose the adoption of liberal provisions in this respect as he wanted to bring Dominican legislation fully into line with the ILO's standards and principles respecting freedom of association.
.The Committee has always considered the right to strike as one of the essential means by which workers and their organisations may promote and defend their occupational interests it has held that restrictions or prohibitions on the right to strike are admissible only under certain conditions, in particular in the public service and in essential services (in the strict sense of the term). In the latter cases, it has added, such restrictions should be accompanied by adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures in which the parties can take part at every stage, and at which the awards are binding on both parties in all cases. Such awards should be executed rapidly and completely.
.The Committee notes the Government's intention to revise its legislation on this important question. It has also noted that the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has made certain observations on the present strike legislation. It would be desirable that the envisaged amendments should be adopted at an early date.
.Allegations concerning the trade union rights of agricultural workers
.This aspect of the case was the subject both of a complaint and of observations by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, which considered that the exclusion of certain rural workers from the field of application of the provisions of the Labour Code which guaranteed the right of association was incompatible with Convention No. . In this connection the representative of the Director-General states the following:When asked about this, the Secretary and Under-Secretary of State for Labour explained that under the previous regime there had in practice been a certain amount of opposition to unionisation. On the other hand, the present Government was trying to meet and encourage the participation of peasants' representatives. Under the Labour Code agricultural workers were entitled to set up trade unions. According to section , the provisions of the Code do not apply to any agricultural undertaking, agricultural undertaking of an industrial type or stock raising or forestry undertaking which does not continuously and permanently employ more than ten persons, but this refers to the undertakings themselves and not to the workers. As the Secretary of State pointed out, this means that the workers cannot set up a works union and, in fact, section  of the Code stipulates that associations of employees must have not less than  members. However, nothing prevents them from setting up an occupational ""class"" union. The government authorities I spoke to actually cited two federations that were registered with the Secretariat of State for Labour (and therefore possess juridical personality)
.The information gathered by the representative of the Director-General refers both to the de facto situation and to certain legal difficulties. From the latter point of view the authorities have provided the necessary explanations, even though it would be desirable for the Labour Code to be more explicit in recognising the right of all rural workers to form unions. It would also appear that the de facto situation has improved, and the Committee takes note of this development.
.Allegations concerning the trade union rights of teachers and public servants
.The complainants mention the specific case of a teachers' union, the Dominican Teachers' Association (ADP), which the public authorities refused to recognise. In its th Report the Committee referred to the comments of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations and expressed concern at the position of public officials and public servants in general, who are excluded from the Labour Code and thereby deprived of the trade union rights proclaimed by the Code.
.The ADP, reports the representative of the Director-General, was granted legal personality in January . Another union - the National Union of Educators (UNE) - was registered at the Secretariat of State for Labour in accordance with the provisions of the Labour Code. These two organisations were theoretically for teachers from the private sector; however, according to their by-laws and, with the tacit assent of the public authorities, teachers from the public sector were also allowed to join.
.Generally speaking, public servants and other persons employed by the public authorities are excluded, with certain exceptions, from labour legislation (section  of the Labour Code, Act No.  of  July ] and are therefore deprived of the guarantees provided for therein with respect to freedom of association. Furthermore, the representative of the Director-General refers to an Act, No.  of  November , which prohibits any propaganda activity or attempt to encourage people to join trade unions within public and municipal administrations or autonomous state institutions (section ). ""According to government officials"", he writes, ""this latter provision means in effect that all trade union activity in the public sector is prohibited. Outside the public service in the strict sense, however, individual statutes do provide for the right to organise.""
.The report continues:The Secretary of State for Labour said that, although the right for public servants to join trade unions was not recognised, their right of association on the basis of Act No.  on non-profit-making associations was fully guaranteed. As early as  the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations had, however, made a number of comments on this Act, which contains provisions (for example, section  which refers to the dissolution of an association by the executive authority) whose application could constitute an infringement of Convention No. . The trade union organisations with which I had discussions were highly critical of this legislation: Act No.  permits the creation of cultural or mutual assistance associations but, according to them, not of real workers' organisations entitled, for instance, to submit claims and to negotiate collectively. Moreover, it is the Government which is responsible for registering and recognising these associations, which are not governed by the Labour Code. However, according to the UGTD, although trade union legislation would be preferable these associations do nevertheless permit workers to organise themselves and to defend their interests and they are also able to take legal action. According to the Under-Secretary of State for Labour, the Government accepts the activities of organisations set up to defend the interests of public servants. Thus, for instance, a Dominican Public Service Federation (FEDOMEPIA) has been created. The Secretary of State added that he intended to propose a new public service status which would sanction the right to organise in this sector.
.The Committee has often stressed, and particularly in two recent cases, that the standards on freedom of association embodied in Convention No.  apply to all workers ""without distinction whatsoever"", and are therefore applicable to employees of the State. It was indeed considered inequitable to draw any distinction in trade union matters between workers in the private sector and public servants, since persons in either category are permitted to become organised for the defence of their interests. It was also made clear during the preparatory work on Convention No.  that recognition of the right of association of public servants in no way prejudges the question of the right of such officials to strike. Their special situation has, as mentioned earlier, led the Committee to admit that this right could be restricted for public servants.
.The Committee takes note of the information gathered regarding the present opportunities for state personnel to join associations for the defence of their occupational interests, and on the reforms envisaged. It nevertheless considers it essential that the right of all public servants to organise should be fully recognised in the near future, and in this connection notes that the question is the subject of an examination and observations by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions",0,1973,Dominican Republic
109,"and Recommendations.
.The right to form federations and Confederations
.During the direct contacts mission discussions were also held with the authorities on a restriction imposed by legislation on the right to form federations and Confederations. In this connection the representative of the Director-General writes:Finally, the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations noted that Resolution No. / of the Secretariat of State for Labour requires a minimum of seven trade unions to form a federation and four federations - or three federations of craft unions - to form a Confederation. The Committee considered that these provisions restricted the right of organisations to establish federations and Confederations as provided in Article  of the Convention. The Secretary of State informed me that the purpose of this text was to avoid the proliferation of trade union federations and Confederations. However, when I explained to him the point of view of the ILO supervisory bodies on the matter as a whole, he informed me that the resolution would very shortly be repealed.
.Although this matter has not been the subject of complaints, the Committee takes note of this information, to which it draws the attention of the Committee of Experts.
.Generally speaking, the Committee notes that due to the recent change in Government there has been a favourable development in the trade union situation in the country since the complaints were presented. Although certain matters remain to be settled - in particular the question of dismissals of trade unionists and certain alleged discriminatory practices in the public sector - a solution has now been found to the other points raised by the complainants and amendments to the trade union legislation on the points raised by the Committee and the Committee of Experts are under examination.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the death, arrest or banishment of trade unionists:
.Since  the Committee has been called upon to examine numerous complaints of infringement of freedom of association in the Dominican Republic, presented by the following organisations: world Confederation of Labour (WCL), world Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), International Metalworkers' Federation (IMF), World Federation of Teachers' Unions, General Workers' Federation (CGT), National Federation of Dockworkers, Stevedores' Union (POASI), National Union of Heavy Machinery Operators (SINOMAPE), National Union of Telephone Workers (SNTT). These complaints have been examined as Cases Nos. , , , ,  and .
.In these complaints allegations were made relating, inter alia, to the death, arrest and banishment of trade unionists, dismissals on account of trade union activities, the dismantling of trade union organisations, intervention by the public authorities in the internal affairs of trade unions (meetings, elections, trade union funds), the occupation of trade union premises, interference with the right to strike and the trade union rights of teachers and agricultural workers.
.The subject-matter of these complaints was brought to the attention of the Government as the complaints were received. The Government provided comments on several of the allegations.
.The Committee examined Case No.  at its sessions in May and November , when it submitted interim reports to the Governing Body, A further interim report was submitted by the Committee to the Governing Body with respect to Case No.  and Cases Nos. , ,  and  in May . The Committee again examined all the cases pending with regard to the Dominican Republic at its November  session 
.At its may  session the Committee observed that although the Government had submitted comments and information on several of the allegations made, the Committee possessed insufficient information to enable it to reach conclusions at that stage regarding the substance of the various issues raised. The Committee recalled, moreover, that it had already examined, on several occasions, cases concerning the Dominican Republic which involved allegations similar to those made in the present cases. In these circumstances, the Committee considered that it would be very useful to apply the direct contacts procedure. The Governing Body, accordingly, requested the Government to consider the possibility of giving its consent to the carrying out of a study in the Dominican Republic of the facts surrounding the complaints by a representative of the Director-General, who would report to the Committee thereon.
.No reply having been received from the Government in November  and February  the Committee invited it to give its early consideration to the request for direct contacts and to communicate its decision in this connection as soon as possible.
.In May , in the continued absence of any communication from the Government in this connection, the Committee decided to apply the special procedure provided for in paragraphs  and  of its th Report. Under this procedure, the Government was immediately informed that the Chairman of the Committee would, on behalf of the Committee, make contact with its representatives attending the rd Session of the International Labour Conference, draw their attention to the particular cases involved and discuss with them the reasons for the delay in transmitting the observations requested. The Chairman was then to report to the Committee on the results of such contacts. However, since the Government did not designate any representative to the rd Session of the Conference, the said procedure could not be applied.
.In a letter dated  August , the Government stated that it was considering the request it had received to accept the visit of a representative of the Director-General, and added that a final reply would be given when it was in the interests of the country to do so.
.At its November  session the Committee expressed its regret at the Government's delay in acceding to the request made of it to give its consent to the visit of a representative of the Director-General. In this connection, the Committee emphasised that the purpose of the whole procedure was to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and expressed its confidence that, if this procedure protected governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their part would recognise the importance for the protection of their own good name of co-operating with the Committee in every way so that it could examine the allegations fully and seek possible solutions to the problems involved. The Committee moreover laid particular stress on the importance it attached to the direct contacts procedure.
.In these circumstances, the Governing Body, on the Committee's recommendation,(a) urged the Government to give its consent without delay to an inquiry into the trade union situation being carried out in the Dominican Republic by a representative of the Director-General;(b) requested the Director-General to contact the Government at the highest possible level so as to express the concern of the Committee and to insist that the Government should give a favourable response to the request for direct contacts.
.In February , the Committee noted that in spite of the reminders sent to the Government on this question the Government had not replied. The Committee deplored the fact that the Government of the Dominican Republic had shown no desire to cooperate with the procedures available in the field of trade union rights. In these circumstances, the Governing Body decided that, in the event of no reply being received from the Government before its next session, wider publicity should be given to the allegations, to the replies of the Government, to the recommendations of the Committee and to the obstructive attitude of the Government's.
.Since then, no reply has been received from the Government.
.The Dominican Republic has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee must first of all deplore the fact that, notwithstanding the insistent and repeated requests addressed to the Government at the highest level, the Government has failed to reply to the proposal made by the Committee and the Governing Body that recourse be had to direct contacts. In view of the importance and seriousness of the matters raised in the complaints and the inadequacy of the information at its disposal, the Committee remains convinced that a visit to the Dominican Republic by a representative of the Director-General would have afforded an opportunity to gain a greater insight into the trade union situation and give fruitful consideration to possible solutions to the problems involved.
.Before taking up each of the matters raised by the complainants, the Committee wishes to emphasise the importance of the cases under consideration, which raise serious issues pertaining to freedom of association and human rights in relation to trade union rights. In this connection the Committee expresses its deep concern at the acuteness and diversity of the problems faced by a substantial part of the Dominican trade union movement in a wide variety of branches of activity.
.The Committee notes in particular that, according to the allegations, certain trade union organisations, in many cases of nation-wide importance, have for many years been having great difficulty in carrying on their activities owing to the multiple obstacles that have been put in their path: arrest and dismissal of",0,1973,Dominican Republic
110,"their leaders, occupation of their premises, interference in their internal affairs. Such an atmosphere cannot be conducive to the development of a truly free and independent trade union movement, nor to the promotion of normal industrial relations. The Committee wishes to emphasise before proceeding any further that, as stated in the resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties adopted by the International Labour Conference in , the absence of civil liberties removes all meaning from the concept of trade union rights, and the rights conferred upon workers' and employers' organisations must be based on respect for those civil liberties.
.The allegations refer to a considerable number of murders of officials of workers' organisations, especially in the agricultural sector, committed in most cases by employers or overseers. In the absence of any detailed information on these cases from the Government, the Committee feels bound to observe that the Government has not established that these deaths occurred for reasons unconnected with the status or activities of the officials in question. The Committee considers that, in any event, the circumstances of these cases should have prompted the authorities to take effective steps to establish the facts, punish the culprits and restore the situation to normal, this being an essential prerequisite for the free exercise of trade union rights.
.Many of the complaints mention the arrest and detention of officials of various trade union organisations. Contradictory explanations as to the reasons for these measures have been given by the complainants and by the Government. According to the former they were due to trade union activities, while the latter has claimed in general terms that the officials in question were arrested for breaches of laws in respect of public order or for common-law offences.
.Be this as it may, the Committee must observe that the Government has not supplied detailed information as to the acts of which the persons arrested were accused, thus preventing the Committee from examining the allegations with all the facts before it. The Committee considers that the onus was on the Government to show that the measures it had taken were not prompted by the trade union activities of the persons concerned.
.While most of the trade unionists mentioned in the complaints appear to have now recovered their freedom, it has none the less been clearly established that some of them were kept in custody for relatively lengthy periods of time, in some cases at repeated intervals. It is impossible to determine from the Government's replies whether the persons concerned were brought before the courts. Only in a few cases does it appear from the information supplied by the complainants that legal proceedings were initiated against the trade union officials concerned. One of them was moreover kept in prison even though he had been found not guilty by a court of first instance.
.The Committee must recall in this connection that it is one of the fundamental rights of the individual that a detained person should be brought without delay before the appropriate judge, this right being recognised in such instruments as the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man. In the case of persons engaged in trade union activities, this is one of the civil liberties which should be ensured by the authorities in order to guarantee the full effectiveness of the exercise of trade union rights. The Committee further wishes to point out that the detention by the authorities of trade unionists concerning whom no grounds for prosecution are subsequently found is liable to involve restrictions on trade union rights, and governments should take steps to ensure that the authorities concerned have instructions appropriate to eliminate the danger of detention for trade union activities.
.According to the complainants, the authorities have also ordered the expulsion from the country of certain trade union officials. One of them was refused entry into the Dominican Republic on his return from an international trade union conference. In the Committee's opinion, a measure exiling trade unionists, which is in violation of human rights, is of particular gravity since it deprives the persons concerned of the possibility of working in their country and of contacts with their families. It is also in violation of freedom of association in that it undermines the trade union organisations which are thereby deprived of their leaders.
.According to the information supplied by the complainants, many trade union officials and members have been dismissed from their jobs in a large number of undertakings covering a wide range of activities. In most of these cases it has been alleged that the sole ground for the action in question was the trade union activities of the persons concerned. In some cases the underlying intention was stated to be the dismantling of trade unions, though this has been denied by the Government. The Government has however admitted that some undertakings engage in practices hardly conducive to the development of sound industrial relations which it cannot combat effectively under the legislation in force.
.The Committee considers that no person should be discriminated against on account of his trade union membership or activities, and that governments should take measures to ensure that workers are protected against acts, including dismissal, which are likely to provoke or have as their object anti-union discrimination in respect of employment. Legislation enabling employers in practice - on condition that they pay the compensation prescribed by law for cases of unjustified dismissal - to get rid of any worker, even if the true reason is his trade union membership or activities, does not give sufficient protection against acts of anti-union discrimination.
.Protection against acts of anti-union discrimination is particularly desirable in the case of trade union officials, because, in order to carry out their trade union functions in full independence, they must have the assurance that they will not be victimised by virtue of their trade union office. Such an assurance is also necessary to ensure that effect is given to the principle that workers' organisations should have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom .
.A large number of trade union organisations appear to have been dismantled over the past few years, either through the withdrawal of their legal personality or through the setting up of parallel unions or through their destruction by employers. In answer to these allegations the Government has merely stated that the great majority of the organisations in question are still in existence but their leaders have been removed from office by decision of their members. The Committee does not have sufficient information to enable it to express an opinion on these matters in full knowledge of the facts. In particular, it has not been specified whether the legal personality of the trade union mentioned by the complainants was withdrawn by order of the administrative authorities or as a result of court proceedings. The Committee notes, however, that under the terms of section  of the Labour Code, the registration of a trade union may be cancelled by a decision of the courts if the trade union pursues activities not connected with its lawful objectives.
.As concerns the setting up of parallel unions and the destruction of trade unions by employers, the Committee wishes to recall that under the terms of Article  of Convention No. , ratified by the Dominican Republic, workers' and employers' organisations must enjoy adequate protection against any acts of interference by each other or each other's agents or members in their establishment, functioning or administration. Article  specifies that acts which are designed to promote the establishment of workers' organisations under the domination of employers or employers' organisations, or to support workers' organisations by financial or other means with the object of placing such organisations under the control of employers or employers' organisations, shall be deemed to constitute acts of interference.
.The allegations of interference by public authorities in the internal affairs of trade unions are mainly concerned with the right of assembly, the right to elect officials in full freedom and trade union funds. The Committee considers that freedom of assembly for trade union purposes constitutes one of the fundamental elements of trade union rights, and that the authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof. The obligation to accept the presence of a representative of the authorities at general assemblies constitutes a restriction upon the free activity of trade unions.
.With regard to trade union elections, the complainants stated that rigged elections had been held in the POASI union and that the Supreme Court had ruled them to be illegal. According to more recent information supplied by the Government, properly conducted elections were subsequently held in this union. In this connection the Committee wishes once again to emphasise the importance it attaches to the principle that workers and their organisations should have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom.
.The POASI is also alleged by the complainants to have had its assets confiscated.",1,1973,Dominican Republic
111,"According to the Government these allegations are false. In view of the contradictory nature of these statements, the Committee can only recall the importance of the principle that trade union funds should be adequately protected.
.It appears from the allegations made that the headquarters of certain trade union organisations have been occupied by the police, in some cases several times. The latest intervention of this kind - involving the POASI - seems to have been quite recent. In this connection the Committee wishes to draw the Government's attention to the fact that, in the resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties, the International Labour Conference, expressed the view that the right to protection of the property of trade union organisations was one of the civil liberties which were essential for the normal exercise of trade union rights. While trade unions cannot claim immunity from a search of their premises, such a search should only be made following the issue of a warrant by the ordinary judicial authority after that authority has been satisfied that reasonable grounds exist for supposing that evidence exists on the said premises material to a prosecution for an offence under the ordinary law and provided that such search is restricted to the purposes in respect of which the warrant was issued.
.With regard to the allegations relating to interference with the right to strike, the Committee recalls that the right to strike is one of the essential means through which workers and their organisations may promote and defend their occupational interests. The Committee points out in this connection that on several occasions the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has made comments with respect to sections  to  of the Labour Code, which allow all cases of collective labour disputes to be referred to arbitration, culminating in a binding award, which might severely restrict the right to strike and thus infringe the right of trade unions to organise their activities. As concerns the calling in of the police to obstruct, according to the complainants, the exercise of the right to strike, the Committee considers that intervention by security forces in the event of strikes should be limited to the maintenance of public order.
.As concerns the Government's refusal to recognise the legal existence of the Dominican Teachers' Association, the Committee refers to the comments of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations with respect to the position of public servants in the Dominican Republic, who are excluded from the Labour code and thereby deprived of the trade union rights proclaimed by the Code. The Committee recalls that public servants, including teachers, are entitled to enjoy the right to organise, just as other workers are.
.A number of complaints were partly concerned with the trade union situation in the agricultural sector. This branch of activity does indeed seem to have been particularly affected by extremely serious incidents, sometimes involving the death of trade union officials. In addition, according to the complainants, the Government has prevented agricultural workers from organising themselves freely, even though their trade union rights are recognised by law. The Committee wishes in this connection to emphasise the particular importance the International Labour Conference attached to the trade union rights of rural workers in adopting the Rural Workers' Organisations Convention (No. ) in . Article  of this Convention provides that it shall be an objective of national policy concerning rural development to facilitate the establishment and growth, on a voluntary basis, of strong and independent organisations of rural workers as an effective means of ensuring the participation of rural workers, without discrimination, in economic and social development and in the benefits resulting therefrom.
.In these circumstances, as concerns the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the Government's attention to the considerations and principles set forth in paragraphs  to  concerning the death, arrest, banishment and dismissal of trade unionists, the dismantling of trade union organisations, intervention by public authorities in the internal affairs of trade unions, the occupation of trade union premises, the right to strike and the trade union rights of teachers and agricultural workers;(b) to deplore the obstructive attitude and lack of co-operation shown by the Government, which, by not consenting to a mission on the spot, and by not transmitting its replies on the questions before the Committee has made it impossible to obtain all the information on the serious allegations made and to decide what measures could be taken as regards the problems involved;(c) to decide to give wider publicity to the present report, in particular during the next session of the International Labour Conference.Geneva,  May . (Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.
.The Committee has already examined several complaints of infringements of trade union rights in the Dominican Republic, presented by the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), the International Metalworkers' Federation (IMF), the National Union of Heavy Machinery Operators (SINOMAPE), the National Federation of Dockworkers, the Stevedores' Union (POASI) and the General Workers' Federation (CGT). These complaints were dealt with under Cases Nos. , , ,  and . With regard to Case No. , the Committee submitted a number of conclusions to the Governing Body that appear in paragraphs  to  of its st Report and in paragraphs  to  of its rd Report. The Committee also examined Case No.  and Cases Nos. , ,  and  in its th Report (paragraphs  to ) in which it also submitted certain conclusions to the Governing Body.
.Since then, further allegations have been received in connection with these cases. They have been made by the WFTU (communication of  July ), the National Union of Telephone Workers (communications of  July  and  September ), the POASI and the CGT (joint communication of  April ) and the CGT (communication of  June ).
.The World Federation of Teachers' Unions also submitted allegations in a letter of  May  (Case No. ).
.The Government submitted certain information in a letter of  August .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee notes the information communicated by the Government which recognises, in particular, that, in certain undertakings, practices exist that are not conducive to the development of healthy labour management relations and to which it cannot effectively put a stop under the legislation currently in force. New complaints have been received containing allegations that are as serious and as varied as those previously examined. It should be borne in mind, moreover, that the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has for several years been making observations on the application by the Dominican Republic of Conventions Nos.  and , which it has ratified.
.The Committee regrets the Government's delay in acceding to the request made of it to give its consent to the visit of a representative of the Director-General. In this connection, the Committee wishes to emphasise that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and the Committee is confident that, if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their part will recognise the importance for the protection of their own good name of co-operating with the Committee in every way so that it can examine the allegations fully and seek possible solutions to the problems involved. In paragraphs  to  of its th Report, the Committee has laid particular stress on the importance it attaches in this connection to the direct contacts procedure.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to urge the Government to give its consent without delay to an inquiry into the trade union situation being carried out in the Dominican Republic by a representative of the Director General;(b) to request the Director-General to contact the Government at the highest possible level so as to express the concern of the Committee and to insist that the Government should give a favourable response to the request made above;(c) to take note of this interim report.
.The Committee already examined Case No.  in May and November  and on each occasion it submitted a report to the Governing Body. These reports appear in paragraphs  to  of the Committee's st report and paragraphs  to  of its rd report.
.In its rd Report, the Committee recommended that the Governing Body request the Government to provide additional information on one aspect of the matter. Despite repeated requests, this information was not received. The Committee, therefore, addressed urgent appeals to the Government in November  and February and May  that it supply the information requested. In November  and February , the Committee noted with regret that despite its appeals the requested information still had not been received. In May ",1,1973,Dominican Republic
112,"it again made an urgent appeal to the Government to supply the information.
.Regarding Cases Nos. , ,  and , the complaints and additional information submitted by the complainants appear in the following communications: three communications, of  October ,  September  and  June , from the National Union of Heavy Machinery Operators (SINOMAPE), a communication of  November , from the National Federation of Dockworkers, two communications, of  May  and  November , from the Stevedores' Union (POASI), a communication of  August , from the General Workers' Federation (CGT), two communications, of  September  and  July , from the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), three communications, of  November ,  July and  October , from the World Confederation of Labour (WCL).
.These complaints were transmitted to the Government as they were received, with requests for observations. Apart from some very general replies sent by communications of  January and  July , and despite the time which had elapsed since the presentation of the first complaints (Case No. ), the Committee received no information from the Government on the various allegations. In November  and May , the Committee sent urgent requests to the Government to submit the information requested (Case No. ).
.As the information requested on all these cases was not received, the Committee asked the Director-General in November  to communicate with the highest level of the Government, on behalf of the Committee, expressing the Committee's concern and urgently requesting the Government to provide the observations requested from it (Cases Nos. , ,  and ). The Government finally submitted information by communications of ,  and  February .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).",1,1973,Dominican Republic
113,".The Committee last examined this case in May  and submitted to the Governing Body at that session, a final report which appears in paragraphs  to  of its st Report. The Governing Body approved this Report at its th Session (May ).
.The Government sent further observations in a communication dated  July .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations concern the imprisonment of Mr. Fernando de la Rosa, Workers' Education Secretary of the Dominican National Workers' Confederation. He had been sentenced to one year's imprisonment by virtue of legislation outlawing the Communist Party and making those who carry on propaganda in favour of banned associations liable to imprisonment. He had subsequently been set free. There was nothing in the verdicts rendered to indicate the specific facts of which this person had been accused. In its st Report, the Committee had found this the more regrettable in that the Government had not provided the precise information asked for about the actual circumstances which led to Mr. Fernando de la Rosa's conviction.
.The Committee had taken the view that it was not competent to consider purely political allegations, but that it could and should consider action of a political nature taken by governments in so far as such action might affect the exercise of trade union rights. It had recalled that the aim of its procedure is to ensure respect for freedom of association in law as well as in fact and that it is convinced that just as this procedure protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side should recognise the importance, for the protection of their own good name, of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to such detailed factual charges as may be put forward.
.In these circumstances, the Committee had recommended the Governing Body to draw the Government's attention to the principles and considerations set forth in paragraphs  and  above, and to deplore the fact that neither the Government's comments nor the verdicts rendered contained any specific information about the actual circumstances which led to Mr. Fernando de la Rosa's conviction, as a result of which the Committee was unable to reach its conclusions in full knowledge of the facts.
.In its latest communication, the Government states that the person concerned did not lodge an appeal with the Supreme Court against the decision of the competent court of appeal, and that this decision has therefore become binding and may no longer be changed. The National Constitution, the Government adds, establishes the separation of the legislative, executive and judicial powers and the independence of the judiciary is guaranteed by law. The Code of Criminal Procedure further provides for extraordinary appeals for civil review or on the grounds of denial of justice. The Government points out that since Mr. Fernando de la Rosa had not appealed to the Supreme Court, the case is closed.
.The Committee considered this case at its sessions in February and May , submitting interim reports on each occasion (paragraphs  to  of its th Report, and paragraphs  to  of its th Report).
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee recalls that the allegations still outstanding concern the imprisonment of Mr. Fernando de la Rosa, Workers' Education Secretary of the Dominican National Workers' Confederation. According to the WFTU, he was imprisoned, although he had not been convicted by any court of law, in April  and has remained in prison ever since, although his release was ordered in April .
.The Government, in the observations it made on  October , stated that trade union organisation was free in the Dominican Republic, provided that both in their rules and their activities the unions observed ""a democratic organisation compatible with Constitutional principles and purposes pertaining strictly to the field of labour"". The Government had always complied with the provisions of Convention No. , by authorising the development, without interference, of all trade union organisations conforming with national labour legislation. However, it submitted no observations concerning the allegations relating to Mr. Fernando de la Rosa.
.At its session in February , the Committee recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to comment on these allegations, indicating what had happened to Mr. Fernando de la Rosa and whether he had been brought before a national court of law; if he had been, then the Government should be asked to supply a copy of the verdict rendered.
.With its letter dated  April , the Government sent a photocopy of the verdict rendered against Mr. Fernando de la Rosa. The latter, it said, had served his sentence, but the Secretary of State for Labour knew nothing of his whereabouts. At its session in May , the Committee concluded from the verdict rendered that on  April  Mr. Fernando de la Rosa had been sentenced to six months' imprisonment for breach of Acts Nos. ,  and  of . There was nothing in the verdict to indicate the nature of these Acts or the charges brought against the accused.
.In paragraph  of its th Report, the Committee noted that the accused was at liberty. Nevertheless, so as to be able to submit its conclusions in full knowledge of the facts, it recommended the Governing Body to request the Government for information about the legislation which the accused was said to have infringed, and about the events as a result of which he had been sent to prison for six months.
.In a letter dated  October , the Government confined itself to sending a further copy of the verdict of the court of first instance on Mr. Fernando de la Rosa, together with a copy of the judgment given by the Appeals Court. This latter judgment, dated  July , increased the sentence to one year's imprisonment, but it contained no more information than the first judgment about the content of the legislation infringed (Acts Nos. ,  and  of ) or about the charges brought against the accused.
.In a letter dated  January , the Government sent a copy of Act No.  dated  October , as amended by Acts Nos.  and  dated  and  November , on the basis of which the accused had been sentenced. This Act, as amended, outlaws the Communist Party and associations pursuing destructive ends or conspiring against the sovereignty of the nation. It prescribes terms of imprisonment for those who carry on propaganda on behalf of bodies banned by law.
.The Committee has always taken the view that it was not competent to consider purely political allegations, but that it could and should consider action of a political nature taken by governments in so far as such action might affect the exercise of trade union rights.
.In this particular instance, the Committee observes that the accused was sent to prison for a year on the basis of laws outlawing the Communist Party and making those who carry on propaganda in favour of banned associations liable to imprisonment. But there is nothing in the verdicts rendered to indicate the specific events for which the accused had been held responsible. This is the more regrettable in that the Government has not provided the information asked for about the actual circumstances which led to Mr. Fernando de la Rosa's conviction.
.In this connection, the Committee feels obliged to recall, as it has already done in another case concerning the Dominican Republic, that the aim of its procedure is to ensure respect for freedom of association in law as well as in fact. It is convinced that just as this procedure protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side should recognise the importance, for the protection of their own good name, of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to such detailed factual charges as may be put forward.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to draw the Government's attention to the principles and considerations set forth in paragraphs  to  above, and to deplore the fact that neither the Government's comments nor the verdicts rendered contain any specific information about the actual circumstances which led to Mr. Fernando de la Rosa's conviction, as a result of which the Committee is unable to reach its conclusions in full knowledge of the facts.
.The Committee has already examined this case at its session in February , at which time it submitted to the Governing Body a report contained in paragraphs  to  of its th Report (approved by the Governing Body at its th Session, February-March ).
.The Dominican Republic has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No.",0,1972,Dominican Republic
114,").
.It was alleged in the complaint, sent on  July , that Mr. Julio de Pena Valdez, Secretary-General of the Dominican National Workers' Confederation (FOUPSA-CESITRADO) had been arrested and sentenced to ten years' imprisonment. The reason for this arrest and subsequent sentence was that he had allegedly conspired against the safety of the State and been in possession of war material. In fact, according to the complainants, Mr de Pea Valdez, as he himself stated in a letter to the World Federation of Trade Unions, had apparently been condemned because he was the most representative leader of the revolutionary proletariat, because he was the leader of class-conscious trade unionism and because he was ""in the forefront of the fight against the oligarchy - the lackey of imperialism - which is despotically governing"" the Dominican Republic. In his letter to the WFTU Mr de Pena Valdez alleged that for nine months he had been kept ""in a solitary underground cell in inhuman conditions - naked, without air and light, totally isolated"". It was also alleged that Mr. Fernando de la Rosa, Secretary for Workers' Education of the Dominican National Workers' Confederation, was in prison although he had been acquitted by the courts; he was said to have been arrested in April , and even though his release had been ordered a year later he was still in prison.
.In its observations of  October  the Government declared first of all that by virtue of article , paragraph , subparagraph (a), of the National Constitution there was freedom of association in the Dominican Republic, provided that in their bylaws as in their conduct the trade unions observed a democratic organisation compatible with the principles affirmed in the Constitution and strictly for labour ends. The Government stated that it had always respected the provisions of Convention No.  by allowing the free development, without official interference, of all trade union organisations which complied with the national labour legislation. As far as the case of Mr. Julio de Pea Valdez was concerned, he had been found guilty by the competent courts of the crime of possessing and trafficking in arms. The Government made no comment upon the allegations concerning Mr. Fernando de la Rosa.
.At its session in February  the Committee recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to supply the text of the judgement rendered against Mr. Julio de Pea Valdez as well as its observations concerning the allegations relating to Mr. Fernando de la Rosa, indicating what his present situation was and whether he had appeared before a national court, in which case the Government should supply the text of the judgement rendered.
.By a communication dated  April , the Government forwarded copies of the judgements rendered against these two persons, stating that Mr. Fernando de la Rosa had already served his sentence and the Secretariat of State for Labour did not know his present address.
.The Committee observes that according to the text of the judgement rendered against Mr. Fernando de la Rosa he was sentenced on  April  to six months' corrective detention for breaches of Acts Nos. ,  and  of . The judgement gives no details as to the terms of these Acts or as to the offences Mr de la Rosa is said to have committed.
.As concerns Mr. Julio de Pea Valdez, the text of the judgement of the Court of Appeal of Santo Domingo, dated  October , indicates that he was sentenced, together with other persons, to three years' imprisonment and payment of a fine for having in his possession war materials and firearms, in pursuance of the provisions of section , subsection IV, of Act No. , as amended by Act No. , and section  of the Penal Code. This judgement of the Court of Appeal amends the judgement of the court of first instance, which had imposed a ten-year sentence for the same offence.
.The complaint of the world Federation of Trade Unions is contained in a communication dated  July  addressed direct to the International Labour Organisation. This complaint was transmitted to the Government, which submitted its observations thereon in a communication dated  October .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), as well as the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.It is alleged that Mr. Julio de Pea Valdez, Secretary-General of the Dominican National Workers' Confederation (FOUPSA-CESITRADO), was arrested and sentenced to ten years' imprisonment. The reason for this arrest and sentence was that he had allegedly conspired against the security of the State and had been in possession of war material. In fact, say the complainants, Mr de Pea Valdez, as he states in a letter sent to the World Federation of Trade Unions, was apparently condemned because he was the most representative leader of the revolutionary proletariat, because he was the leader of class-conscious trade unionism and because he was ""in the forefront of the fight against the oligarchy - dependants of imperialism - which governs despotically"" in the Dominican Republic. In the letter which he sent to the WFTU, Mr de Pea Valdez alleged that during nine months he was kept ""in a solitary underground cell in inhuman conditions: naked, without air and light, and totally isolated"".
.It is also alleged that Mr. Fernando de la Rosa, Secretary for Workers' Education of the Dominican National Workers' Confederation, was imprisoned although no tribunal had considered that there were any charges against him; this person is alleged to have been in prison since April , and, though his release was ordered to take place a year later, in April , it is alleged that he is still detained.
.In its comments the Government states, first of all, that by virtue of Article , paragraph , subparagraph (a), of the National Constitution, the trade union movement in the Dominican Republic is free, provided that in their statutes as in their activities the trade unions observe a democratic organisation compatible with the principles affirmed in the Constitution and strictly for labour ends. The Government points out that it has always respected the provisions of Convention No.  by allowing the development without any interference of all trade union organisations which conform with national labour legislation.
.As far as the case of Mr. Julio de Pea Valdez is concerned, the Government states that the competent tribunals found him guilty of the crime of possessing and trafficking in arms.
.In accordance with the practice it has always followed, the Committee, considering that such information would be useful for judging whether the allegations were founded or not, recommends the Governing Body to request the Government to be good enough to supply the text of the judgement rendered against Mr. Julio de Pea Valdez as well as the grounds adduced therefor.
.As for the allegations concerning the case of Mr. Fernando de la Rosa (see paragraph  above), the Committee notes that the Government refrains in its reply from making any observations on this aspect of the case.
.The Committee considers that it should recall at this stage that in all cases where trade union leaders are preventively detained these measures may involve a serious interference with the exercise of trade union rights, and wishes to draw attention to the fact that it has always emphasised the right of all detained persons to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment.
.Accordingly, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to request the Government to be good enough to submit its observations concerning the allegations relating to Mr. Fernando de la Rosa, indicating the present situation of this person, stating whether he has appeared before a national court, and, if so, to supply the text of the judgement rendered as well as the grounds adduced therefor.
.In these circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to request the Government to be good enough to supply the text of the judgement rendered against Mr. Julio de Pea Valdez as well as the grounds adduced therefor;(b) to request the Government to be good enough to submit its observations concerning the allegations relating to Mr. Fernando de la Rosa, indicating the present situation of this person, stating whether he has appeared before a national court, and, if so, to supply the text of the judgement rendered as well as the grounds adduced therefor;(c) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report when it has received the additional information specified in the two preceding subparagraphs.Geneva,  February . (Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.",0,1972,Dominican Republic
115,".Since  the Committee has had before it numerous complaints of violation of freedom of association in the Dominican Republic. These complaints come from the following workers' organisations: World Confederation of Labour (WCL), World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), International Metalworkers' Federation (IMF), World Federation of Teachers' Unions, General Workers' Federation, National Federation of Dockworkers, Stevedores' Union (POASI), National Union of Heavy Machinery Operators (SINOMAPE), and National Union of Telephone Workers (SNTT). They are dealt with in Cases Nos. , , , ,  and .
.The Committee examined Case No.  in May and November  and at each of these sessions presented conclusions to the Governing Body. The Committee submitted further conclusions to the Governing Body (on Cases Nos. , , ,  and ) in May . Finally, it examined all the outstanding cases relating to the Dominican Republic in November  and May .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In May  the Committee considered that the information at its disposal seemed insufficient to enable it to reach conclusions regarding the substance of the various issues raised. It had already examined, on several occasions, cases concerning the Dominican Republic which contained allegations similar to those made in the cases under examination. In these circumstances it considered that it would be very useful to apply the direct contacts procedure. The Governing Body accordingly requested the Government to consider the possibility of giving its consent to the carrying out of a study in the Dominican Republic of the facts surrounding the complaints by a representative of the Director-General.
.This request was repeated on a number of occasions. In addition, new complaints were presented which, like the earlier ones, contained a variety of serious allegations. Since no detailed reply had been received by May , the Committee had been obliged to formulate its conclusions on the cases in its th Report. However, the new Dominican Government constituted after the elections in May  accepted direct contacts by letter of  September .
.The Director-General appointed Mr. Jean-Michel Servais, an official of the Freedom of Association Branch of the International Labour Standards Department, to represent him during this mission. The visit to the country took place from  to  November , and a report on the mission was submitted to the Committee. During his visit, the representative of the Director-General had conversations with the Secretary of State for Labour and the Secretary of State for the Interior and the Police, with the Under-Secretaries of State for Labour and the Under-Secretaries o?State for the Interior and for the Police, and with the Public Prosecutor of the Republic. He was also received by the President of the Supreme Court of Justice. He met the leaders of a number of trade union organisations - including those of two of the complainant organisations, CGT and POASI - on their trade union premises. Finally, he had discussions at the headquarters of the Employers' Confederation of the Dominican Republic with the officials of this organisation, and with those of the Association of Industries of the Dominican Republic.
.The Committee notes with satisfaction that the representative of the Director-General enjoyed the co-operation of all concerned. He was able to carry out all his tasks in full freedom and independence and the Dominican Government afforded him the necessary facilities to perform his mission in the best possible circumstances.
.The representative of the Director-General collected information on the various issues raised in the complaints and on the measures taken or envisaged to solve the problems encountered. At the invitation of the Government he also discussed the comments made by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations during its periodic examination of the application of Conventions Nos.  and  under article  of the ILO Constitution. All these points are examined in the paragraphs which follow.
.First of all, however, it should be pointed out that, according to the representative of the Director-General, a number of Confederations are at present contending for the allegiance of the workers and the control of the works unions. ""Thus"", he writes, ""at the time of my visit antagonism had taken a very serious turn in the Central Romana Corporations and Central Romana By-Products enterprise, a situation which seems likely to continue, if not to deteriorate further, in the coming months."" Trade union Confederations often maintain close political relations with political parties. The General Union of Dominican Workers (UGTD), which was set up very recently, is in sympathy with the Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD). As will be seen later on the Government has been accused of favouring this new organisation to a certain extent. A similar preoccupation is revealed in a telegram of  December  from the General Workers' Federation (CGT), in which this organisation protests against the administrative order allegedly given by the Government to close down the programme of the ""Rutas"" radio station at La Romana and its alleged prevention of the reorganisation of the local union. This communication has been transmitted to the Government for its observations. The employers' representatives, the report continues, have expressed the view that this situation has created a tense atmosphere in industrial relations on the other hand, it appears that large numbers of unions are now being formed in the present social circumstances.
.Allegations concerning the death, arrest or banishment of trade unionists
.As the mission report states, an amnesty law was passed on  September . All the trade unionists who were mentioned as having been under arrest have now been released. In addition, the banished trade unionists have recently returned to the country under the amnesty law and after the removal of administrative obstacles to their return.
.Finally, it appears from the information gathered that under the Code of Penal Procedure any person who is detained must be brought before a judge within  hours of his arrest. In addition, an old habeas corpus Act protects individuals against arbitrary arrest. In the past, according to the Public Prosecutor of the Republic, the practice was to refer pleas of this nature to the Public Ministry ""which sometimes took rather arbitrary decisions""; this has now been changed and the pleas come before a judge of first instance. Moreover, a Hill to amend the habeas corpus Act is in preparation which stipulates explicitly that the plea must be referred to a judge and prescribes an appeals procedure. As regards banishment, the Public Prosecutor stated that, legally, such a measure could only be taken against foreigners (under the Immigration Law). No law permits the expulsion of nationals, and the measures taken by the previous Government were, in his opinion, arbitrary. There had been no more expulsions since  August .
.Legal proceedings have been instituted in respect of the two cases of murder mentioned in the complaints of the peasants' trade union leaders (Florinda Muoz Soriano in November , and Dionisio Frias in June ). The Secretary and the Under-Secretary of State for Labour said that they would send detailed information regarding the judicial investigations undertaken. It was, they admitted, true that peasant leaders had in the past met their deaths in abnormal circumstances. The new Government, they added, had stated that it would pursue a policy of respect for civil liberties and human rights, including freedom of association. The Undersecretary of State further emphasised the determination of the authorities to abide strictly by the law. The representative of the Director-General also learned from the officials of the Autonomous Confederation of Christian Trade Unions (CASC) that legal proceedings were still pending in the case of the murder of Dionisio Frias; as regards the death of Florinda Muoz Soriano the court had considered that the accused had acted in self-defence.
.The Committee notes these various items of information, in particular the release or the return from exile of the trade unionists mentioned in the complaints. The facts surrounding the deaths of two peasant leaders in  and  have been the subject of trials before the courts one of these cases, moreover, appears to have ended in an acquittal. The Government, while admitting that trade unionists in the rural sector had in the past met their deaths in abnormal circumstances, has stated its will to secure respect for the law and for civil liberties. In these circumstances the Committee is of the opinion that these different points call for no further consideration, provided that it is kept informed of the results of the trials in the cases of the deaths of Dioniso Frias and Florinda Muoz Soriano.
.Allegations concerning the dismissal of trade unionists
.Many allegations referred to the dismissal of trade union leaders and militants. According to the complainants the chief target of these dismissals were the executive Committees of the unions, but certain allegations also referred to the dissolution, or attempted dissolution, of workers' organisations. The representative of the Director-General points out in his report that this issue appeared",0,1971,Dominican Republic
116,"to be a fundamental problem which was still disrupting industrial relations in the country. Although section  of the Labour Code prohibits anti-union practices, the penal sanctions imposed are fines ranging from  to  pesos ( peso  US dollar). According to the report, the Government appears willing to do everything in its power to find a solution:The Secretary and Under-Secretary of State recognise that there have been numerous dismissals and that some cases had apparently involved trade union officials. It was also possible that, in order to get rid of certain leaders, employers had dismissed a whole group of workers. The Government had tried to solve matters through conciliation and mediation and had sometimes succeeded. As it stood, however, the existing legislation did not provide it with the means to do more. Quite apart from the fact that it was difficult to find proof - a problem which is not unique to the Dominican Republic, of course - the Labour Code (section ) allows the employer to terminate a contract for an indefinite period, without giving any reason. Consequently, an employer can dismiss a worker if he finds it convenient provided he pays his employee the amounts to which he is legally entitled (corresponding to the period of notice, the leaving grant and days of leave). This applies even when a collective agreement contains a special clause providing for the protection of union officials. According to existing case law, an employer who fails to respect this provision and dismisses trade union leaders is only required to pay the special indemnity which is provided for in the event of a violation of this clause.
.The report mentions that there are at present proposals to amend the Labour Code, in particular section . The representative of the Director-General mentions the various drafts which have been prepared and adds:The President of the Republic has made a public appeal for a social truce. The representatives of the workers and employers are therefore in the process of negotiating an agreement through the Secretariat of State for Labour. One meeting was held during our mission, and the various inter-occupational Confederations whose officials I met took part in it along with the employers' associations. One of the items for discussion had to do with genuine respect for the freedom of association of workers: the employers' organisations are apparently prepared to guarantee that no trade union leader and no leader of any trade union in the process of being set up will be dismissed from their enterprises except by authorisation of an arbitration Committee. In practice, this amounts to an amendment by agreement of section  of the Labour Code. ... Moreover, it is quite feasible that, following the agreement, the matter will be brought before the Congress in the form of a Bill. The Secretary of State informed me that, even if no agreement is reached, a draft amendment to the law will be submitted on this point. Such an amendment could therefore be adopted without it being necessary to wait for the adoption of a new Labour code.
.As the Committee has already pointed out in other cases, legislation which merely prescribes that any worker dismissed without just cause is entitled in certain cases to compensation and damages in addition to the wage corresponding to the period of notice, does not give sufficient protection against acts of anti-union discrimination, since it enables an employer, on condition that he pays the compensation prescribed by law, to dismiss any member of his staff, whether a member of a trade union or not, for trade union or other activities, the public authorities being powerless to prevent him from doing so. Protection is particularly desirable in the case of trade union officials because, in order to be able to perform their trade union duties in full independence, they must have the guarantee that they will not be prejudiced on account of the mandate which they hold from their trade unions. This guarantee is also necessary to secure respect for the principle that workers' organisations have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom.
.The Dominican Government stated that it was keenly aware of the gaps in its legislation in this respect, and that it was trying to obtain a broad consensus as regards the solution to these difficulties. The Committee considers it essential that this question should be settled in the near future, given the problems which have arisen in the country.
.Allegations concerning unfair practices in the public sector
.The allegations referred to the setting up by the Government of a parallel union in Puerto de Andrs at Boca Chica (communication of August ) and a manoeuvre in the Dominican Telephone Company (CODETEL) to make the National Union of Telephone Workers (SNTT) lose its legal representative character (communication of June ).
.As regards the latter point, the representative of the Director-General wanted to assure himself that the SNTT was exercising its trade union activities fully and that it had recently concluded a collective agreement with the enterprise for the period -. The agreement contains a special clause concerning the protection of trade union officials. Except in the case of a former leader who had been suspended, this provision had been respected. However, the report mentions other cases than that referred to in the previous paragraph in which parallel unions had been set up under the former Government. In this respect the Committee had earlier recalled (in May ) the provision of Article  of Convention No. . Under this provision - as under Article  of the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ), not ratified by the Dominican Republic - workers' organisations must enjoy adequate protection against any act of interference by employers in their establishment, functioning or administration. Article  specifies that acts which are designed to promote the establishment of workers' organisations under the domination of employers or employers' organisations, or to support workers' organisations by financial or other means with the object of placing such organisations under the control of employers or employers' organisations, shall be deemed to constitute acts of interference.
.The Secretary and Under-Secretary of State for Labour declared that the present Government would not endorse or tolerate such practices as the previous Cabinet had done, specifically in the transport sector and the sugar industry. The representative of the Director-General adds the following:In a more general vein, I raised the matter of attempts by employers to interfere in the activities of workers' organisations, and not only in the public sector. On this point the Secretary and Under-Secretary of State said that the current provisions of the Labour Code did not give the Government sufficient scope to combat such practices but that it was nevertheless its policy to try to take action on the basis of the complaints received. They added that it was the Government's attention to introduce proper provisions to put a stop to such acts of interference.The Committee notes these statements and considers it desirable, even if the Government is resolved to tolerate such practices no longer, that legal protection should be strengthened and that the Labour Code should, for example, prescribe more dissuasive sanctions for contraventions of section , the provisions of which are reproduced in the footnote.
.According to the information gathered, several union Confederations also expressed concern at the creation of the General Union of Dominican Workers (UGTD) allied to the political party currently in power (PRD) because they were afraid that the new organisation would receive more favourable treatment, especially in the public sector (the State is the principal employer in certain branches of activity, such as agriculture). Dismissals had already allegedly taken place in the health sector and the sugar-cane industry. This had given rise to a fear that the dismissed workers would be replaced by others who supported the new Government. In some cases this was said to have already begun. The representative of the Director-General explains that, according to the governmental authorities he spoke to, most of the Dominican trade unions were independent of the traditional Confederations and close to the PRD; they were now able to organise themselves and were doing so within the UGTD. The report continues:The Government spokesman went on to say that the dismissals that had taken place in the public sector had not been on trade union grounds. Two points in particular should be borne in mind: in the first place, it was customary in the country to give posts in the public sector to members of the party in power (spoils system); secondly, from the economic standpoint it was necessary to cut down in personnel as the number of employees had sometimes grown far too great. They insisted that the Government would respect the right of freedom of association and ideological pluralism. In any case, legal proceedings could be undertaken against the administration if it was suspected of misuse of power.
.On more than one occasion the Committee has examined cases in which allegations were made that the public authorities had by their",0,1971,Dominican Republic
117,"attitude favoured or discriminated against one or more trade union organisations: examples of such allegations are pressure exerted on workers by means of public statements made by the authorities, unequal distribution of subsidies among unions or the granting to one union, rather than to the other, of premises for holding its meetings or carrying on its activities, and refusal to recognise the leaders of certain organisations in their legitimate activities.& Discrimination by these means or others may be an informal way of influencing the trade union membership of workers. They are therefore sometimes difficult to prove. The fact nevertheless remains, as the Committee has recalled in each of the foregoing cases, that any discrimination of this kind jeopardises the right of workers to set up and join organisations of their own choosing, a right which is explicitly recognised in Article  of Convention No. .
.The Committee also wishes to lay stress on the principles set forth in the resolution concerning the independence of the trade union movement, adopted by the International Labour Conference at its th Session (). The fundamental and permanent mission of the trade union movement, states the resolution, is the economic and social advancement of the workers. When trade unions in accordance with the national law and practice of their respective countries and at the decision of their members decide to establish relations with a political party or to undertake Constitutional political action as a means towards the advancement of their economic and social objectives, such political relations or actions should not be of such a nature as to compromise the continuance of a trade union movement or its social or economic functions irrespective of political changes in the country. The resolution also stresses that governments should not attempt to transform the trade union movement into an instrument for the pursuance of political aims, nor should they attempt to interfere with the normal functions of a trade union movement because of its freely established relationship with a political party.
.Allegations concerning the registration and cancellation of registration of trade unions
.The representative of the Director-General explained that a resolution, No. / of  October , repealed resolutions of  which, by administrative decision, cancelled the registration of numerous trade unions, including the single union of workers of the Central Romana Corporations and Central Romana By Products mentioned in the complaints. Such registration was necessary to enable the trade unions to function. In the preamble to this new resolution it is stated, among other things, that the previous Government was guilty of actions ultra vires by assuming powers that legally belonged to the courts of first instance by virtue of section  of the Labour Code. The preamble also refers to Article  of Convention no. , which prohibits the dissolution or suspension of workers' and employers' organisations by administrative authority. In these circumstances the Committee considers that this aspect of the case calls for no further examination.
.In this connection, the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has observed that according to section  of the Labour Code the registration of a trade union could be refused by the Ministry of Labour. It had asked the Government whether it was possible to appeal to the courts against a refusal to register a trade union. The Under-Secretary of State told the representative of the Director-General that it was possible to appeal against a refusal to register a trade union, as it was to appeal against any administrative act.
.Allegations concerning intervention by the public authorities in the internal affairs of trade unions and occupation of trade union premises
.The problems raised in this connection were of two kinds. The first related to an administrative resolution, No. / of  October , issued by the Secretariat of State for Labour, according to which general assemblies organised with a view to setting up a trade union, federation or Confederation, electing its executive Committee, amending its statutes, merging with other trade unions or affiliating with a federation or Confederation, had to be ""certified"" by a labour inspector. After examining the file on the case and hearing the administration's opinion, the Secretary of state decided whether the trade union can be registered, whether its executive Committee can be recognised, and whether a merger or affiliation can take place, after having previously verified that the legal requirements have been fulfilled. The Committee expressed the view in its th Report that the obligation to accept the presence of a representative of the authorities at general assemblies constituted a restriction upon the free activity of trade unions.
.The representative of the Director-General received the assurance that the resolution would shortly be repealed. The officials he talked with added that, pending the repeal, the authorities would abide by the limitations placed on this text by two rulings of the Supreme Court of Justice. According to the rulings, the powers of the Secretariat of State for Labour in trade union affairs should be interpreted restrictively and the purpose of the presence of an inspector at union assemblies could only be to provide the Secretariat with a report on the circumstances in which the assembly took place and on the decisions adopted. The Court stressed that contesting union elections was a matter for the labour tribunal and not the administrative authorities. According to officials of the CGT, says the report, while the previous Government had used this resolution to commit excesses, the present Government was not applying it in the same spirit.
.The second set of problems raised relates to factual situations: intervention by the authorities in the elections of the Stevedores' Union (POASI); manoeuvres in other undertakings, with the assistance of the authorities, to remove trade union leaders from office; confiscation and misappropriation of the funds of POASI; and occupation of its premises and those- of the National Union of Independent Drivers (UNACHOSIN). In this connection the representative of the Director-General makes the following statement in his report:With regard to the election of trade union leaders, the Secretary and Under-Secretary of State declared that the Supreme Court ruling in the POASI case was a clear case of the infringement of the law by the Government of that period. They confirmed that the POASI had organised elections on  October  and was now operating normally. They also confirmed that the premises of the POASI and UNACHOSIN had been occupied but that a stop had now been put to these measures. The Under-Secretary of State for Labour said that in occupying union premises the previous Government had not respected existing legal provisions. Forcible entry is prohibited by law and misuse of power by public servants is a punishable offence under the Penal Code. As to the allegations concerning POASI funds, he said that this was now past history and that the POASI was currently verifying its financial records. If any misappropriation of funds was brought to light, the matter would be brought before the competent authorities.
.The representative of the Director-General continues:In more general terms, the Secretary of State for the Interior and for the Police informed me that meetings organised on union premises were allowed to take place unhindered and that no authorisation was required open-air meetings were another matter and did require authorisation, and the appropriate decisions were taken in the light of all relevant factors: importance of the date for the union ( May, for example), traffic problems, proximity of an important building (hospital, for example), etc.
.The Committee notes that a solution has now been found to the factual problems raised in the complaints. It also notes the intention of the Government to repeal Resolution No. / mentioned above and trusts that this measure will be taken in the near future.
.Allegations concerning interference with the right to strike
.Complaints were also made with reference to the exercise of the right to strike. In this connection, the representative of the Director-General points out, the labour authorities have recognised that it was virtually impossible to engage in strike action in the present state of the legislation. Such action could only last for a few days because judges were empowered to order a return to work. The report adds:It is significant that the Labour Code only authorises strike action within very strict limits (see sections ,  and ): for example, more than  per cent of the employees concerned must have voted in favour of the strike; a strike cannot take place if one of the parties decides to submit the dispute to arbitration; and it must come to an end upon the expiry of the legal time limit for the resumption of work ordered by the judge. The right to strike is restricted even further by the provisions governing arbitration procedure: the presiding judge can appoint the arbitrators ex officio or at the request of the Secretary of State for Labour (section ) and may order the resumption of work (section ; see also sections  to  and ). The arbitration award has the effect of a collective agreement (section",0,1971,Dominican Republic
118,"). The Secretary of State adds that the judge orders the resumption of work but that, moreover, arbitrators were not appointed. The Under-Secretary told me that he knew of hardly any case where a strike had been recognised as legal. In the past the police had often intervened and an appeal to the tribunal was barely conceivable under these conditions. Nowadays, whenever a collective labour dispute arose, the Government tried to reconcile the parties; often the employers accepted to reinstate at least some of the strikers, and the police no longer intervened. However, he added that in the current period of transition he would not hesitate to apply the sections of the Labour code that empowered him to prevent a strike if he felt that public order was threatened - although this situation had not arisen.
.The representative of the Director-General referred to information according to which the party in power, the PRD, had undertaken to revise the Labour Code so as to make it more liberal; the debate on the subject had already begun in the legislative chambers. The question of the right to strike had not yet been taken up, but the Secretary of State for Labour said that he intended to propose the adoption of liberal provisions in this respect as he wanted to bring Dominican legislation fully into line with the ILO's standards and principles respecting freedom of association.
.The Committee has always considered the right to strike as one of the essential means by which workers and their organisations may promote and defend their occupational interests it has held that restrictions or prohibitions on the right to strike are admissible only under certain conditions, in particular in the public service and in essential services (in the strict sense of the term). In the latter cases, it has added, such restrictions should be accompanied by adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures in which the parties can take part at every stage, and at which the awards are binding on both parties in all cases. Such awards should be executed rapidly and completely.
.The Committee notes the Government's intention to revise its legislation on this important question. It has also noted that the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has made certain observations on the present strike legislation. It would be desirable that the envisaged amendments should be adopted at an early date.
.Allegations concerning the trade union rights of agricultural workers
.This aspect of the case was the subject both of a complaint and of observations by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, which considered that the exclusion of certain rural workers from the field of application of the provisions of the Labour Code which guaranteed the right of association was incompatible with Convention No. . In this connection the representative of the Director-General states the following:When asked about this, the Secretary and Under-Secretary of State for Labour explained that under the previous regime there had in practice been a certain amount of opposition to unionisation. On the other hand, the present Government was trying to meet and encourage the participation of peasants' representatives. Under the Labour Code agricultural workers were entitled to set up trade unions. According to section , the provisions of the Code do not apply to any agricultural undertaking, agricultural undertaking of an industrial type or stock raising or forestry undertaking which does not continuously and permanently employ more than ten persons, but this refers to the undertakings themselves and not to the workers. As the Secretary of State pointed out, this means that the workers cannot set up a works union and, in fact, section  of the Code stipulates that associations of employees must have not less than  members. However, nothing prevents them from setting up an occupational ""class"" union. The government authorities I spoke to actually cited two federations that were registered with the Secretariat of State for Labour (and therefore possess juridical personality)
.The information gathered by the representative of the Director-General refers both to the de facto situation and to certain legal difficulties. From the latter point of view the authorities have provided the necessary explanations, even though it would be desirable for the Labour Code to be more explicit in recognising the right of all rural workers to form unions. It would also appear that the de facto situation has improved, and the Committee takes note of this development.
.Allegations concerning the trade union rights of teachers and public servants
.The complainants mention the specific case of a teachers' union, the Dominican Teachers' Association (ADP), which the public authorities refused to recognise. In its th Report the Committee referred to the comments of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations and expressed concern at the position of public officials and public servants in general, who are excluded from the Labour Code and thereby deprived of the trade union rights proclaimed by the Code.
.The ADP, reports the representative of the Director-General, was granted legal personality in January . Another union - the National Union of Educators (UNE) - was registered at the Secretariat of State for Labour in accordance with the provisions of the Labour Code. These two organisations were theoretically for teachers from the private sector; however, according to their by-laws and, with the tacit assent of the public authorities, teachers from the public sector were also allowed to join.
.Generally speaking, public servants and other persons employed by the public authorities are excluded, with certain exceptions, from labour legislation (section  of the Labour Code, Act No.  of  July ] and are therefore deprived of the guarantees provided for therein with respect to freedom of association. Furthermore, the representative of the Director-General refers to an Act, No.  of  November , which prohibits any propaganda activity or attempt to encourage people to join trade unions within public and municipal administrations or autonomous state institutions (section ). ""According to government officials"", he writes, ""this latter provision means in effect that all trade union activity in the public sector is prohibited. Outside the public service in the strict sense, however, individual statutes do provide for the right to organise.""
.The report continues:The Secretary of State for Labour said that, although the right for public servants to join trade unions was not recognised, their right of association on the basis of Act No.  on non-profit-making associations was fully guaranteed. As early as  the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations had, however, made a number of comments on this Act, which contains provisions (for example, section  which refers to the dissolution of an association by the executive authority) whose application could constitute an infringement of Convention No. . The trade union organisations with which I had discussions were highly critical of this legislation: Act No.  permits the creation of cultural or mutual assistance associations but, according to them, not of real workers' organisations entitled, for instance, to submit claims and to negotiate collectively. Moreover, it is the Government which is responsible for registering and recognising these associations, which are not governed by the Labour Code. However, according to the UGTD, although trade union legislation would be preferable these associations do nevertheless permit workers to organise themselves and to defend their interests and they are also able to take legal action. According to the Under-Secretary of State for Labour, the Government accepts the activities of organisations set up to defend the interests of public servants. Thus, for instance, a Dominican Public Service Federation (FEDOMEPIA) has been created. The Secretary of State added that he intended to propose a new public service status which would sanction the right to organise in this sector.
.The Committee has often stressed, and particularly in two recent cases, that the standards on freedom of association embodied in Convention No.  apply to all workers ""without distinction whatsoever"", and are therefore applicable to employees of the State. It was indeed considered inequitable to draw any distinction in trade union matters between workers in the private sector and public servants, since persons in either category are permitted to become organised for the defence of their interests. It was also made clear during the preparatory work on Convention No.  that recognition of the right of association of public servants in no way prejudges the question of the right of such officials to strike. Their special situation has, as mentioned earlier, led the Committee to admit that this right could be restricted for public servants.
.The Committee takes note of the information gathered regarding the present opportunities for state personnel to join associations for the defence of their occupational interests, and on the reforms envisaged. It nevertheless considers it essential that the right of all public servants to organise should be fully recognised in the near future, and in this connection notes that the question is the subject of an examination and observations by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions",0,1971,Dominican Republic
119,"and Recommendations.
.The right to form federations and Confederations
.During the direct contacts mission discussions were also held with the authorities on a restriction imposed by legislation on the right to form federations and Confederations. In this connection the representative of the Director-General writes:Finally, the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations noted that Resolution No. / of the Secretariat of State for Labour requires a minimum of seven trade unions to form a federation and four federations - or three federations of craft unions - to form a Confederation. The Committee considered that these provisions restricted the right of organisations to establish federations and Confederations as provided in Article  of the Convention. The Secretary of State informed me that the purpose of this text was to avoid the proliferation of trade union federations and Confederations. However, when I explained to him the point of view of the ILO supervisory bodies on the matter as a whole, he informed me that the resolution would very shortly be repealed.
.Although this matter has not been the subject of complaints, the Committee takes note of this information, to which it draws the attention of the Committee of Experts.
.Generally speaking, the Committee notes that due to the recent change in Government there has been a favourable development in the trade union situation in the country since the complaints were presented. Although certain matters remain to be settled - in particular the question of dismissals of trade unionists and certain alleged discriminatory practices in the public sector - a solution has now been found to the other points raised by the complainants and amendments to the trade union legislation on the points raised by the Committee and the Committee of Experts are under examination.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the death, arrest or banishment of trade unionists:
.Since  the Committee has been called upon to examine numerous complaints of infringement of freedom of association in the Dominican Republic, presented by the following organisations: world Confederation of Labour (WCL), world Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), International Metalworkers' Federation (IMF), World Federation of Teachers' Unions, General Workers' Federation (CGT), National Federation of Dockworkers, Stevedores' Union (POASI), National Union of Heavy Machinery Operators (SINOMAPE), National Union of Telephone Workers (SNTT). These complaints have been examined as Cases Nos. , , , ,  and .
.In these complaints allegations were made relating, inter alia, to the death, arrest and banishment of trade unionists, dismissals on account of trade union activities, the dismantling of trade union organisations, intervention by the public authorities in the internal affairs of trade unions (meetings, elections, trade union funds), the occupation of trade union premises, interference with the right to strike and the trade union rights of teachers and agricultural workers.
.The subject-matter of these complaints was brought to the attention of the Government as the complaints were received. The Government provided comments on several of the allegations.
.The Committee examined Case No.  at its sessions in May and November , when it submitted interim reports to the Governing Body, A further interim report was submitted by the Committee to the Governing Body with respect to Case No.  and Cases Nos. , ,  and  in May . The Committee again examined all the cases pending with regard to the Dominican Republic at its November  session 
.At its may  session the Committee observed that although the Government had submitted comments and information on several of the allegations made, the Committee possessed insufficient information to enable it to reach conclusions at that stage regarding the substance of the various issues raised. The Committee recalled, moreover, that it had already examined, on several occasions, cases concerning the Dominican Republic which involved allegations similar to those made in the present cases. In these circumstances, the Committee considered that it would be very useful to apply the direct contacts procedure. The Governing Body, accordingly, requested the Government to consider the possibility of giving its consent to the carrying out of a study in the Dominican Republic of the facts surrounding the complaints by a representative of the Director-General, who would report to the Committee thereon.
.No reply having been received from the Government in November  and February  the Committee invited it to give its early consideration to the request for direct contacts and to communicate its decision in this connection as soon as possible.
.In May , in the continued absence of any communication from the Government in this connection, the Committee decided to apply the special procedure provided for in paragraphs  and  of its th Report. Under this procedure, the Government was immediately informed that the Chairman of the Committee would, on behalf of the Committee, make contact with its representatives attending the rd Session of the International Labour Conference, draw their attention to the particular cases involved and discuss with them the reasons for the delay in transmitting the observations requested. The Chairman was then to report to the Committee on the results of such contacts. However, since the Government did not designate any representative to the rd Session of the Conference, the said procedure could not be applied.
.In a letter dated  August , the Government stated that it was considering the request it had received to accept the visit of a representative of the Director-General, and added that a final reply would be given when it was in the interests of the country to do so.
.At its November  session the Committee expressed its regret at the Government's delay in acceding to the request made of it to give its consent to the visit of a representative of the Director-General. In this connection, the Committee emphasised that the purpose of the whole procedure was to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and expressed its confidence that, if this procedure protected governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their part would recognise the importance for the protection of their own good name of co-operating with the Committee in every way so that it could examine the allegations fully and seek possible solutions to the problems involved. The Committee moreover laid particular stress on the importance it attached to the direct contacts procedure.
.In these circumstances, the Governing Body, on the Committee's recommendation,(a) urged the Government to give its consent without delay to an inquiry into the trade union situation being carried out in the Dominican Republic by a representative of the Director-General;(b) requested the Director-General to contact the Government at the highest possible level so as to express the concern of the Committee and to insist that the Government should give a favourable response to the request for direct contacts.
.In February , the Committee noted that in spite of the reminders sent to the Government on this question the Government had not replied. The Committee deplored the fact that the Government of the Dominican Republic had shown no desire to cooperate with the procedures available in the field of trade union rights. In these circumstances, the Governing Body decided that, in the event of no reply being received from the Government before its next session, wider publicity should be given to the allegations, to the replies of the Government, to the recommendations of the Committee and to the obstructive attitude of the Government's.
.Since then, no reply has been received from the Government.
.The Dominican Republic has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee must first of all deplore the fact that, notwithstanding the insistent and repeated requests addressed to the Government at the highest level, the Government has failed to reply to the proposal made by the Committee and the Governing Body that recourse be had to direct contacts. In view of the importance and seriousness of the matters raised in the complaints and the inadequacy of the information at its disposal, the Committee remains convinced that a visit to the Dominican Republic by a representative of the Director-General would have afforded an opportunity to gain a greater insight into the trade union situation and give fruitful consideration to possible solutions to the problems involved.
.Before taking up each of the matters raised by the complainants, the Committee wishes to emphasise the importance of the cases under consideration, which raise serious issues pertaining to freedom of association and human rights in relation to trade union rights. In this connection the Committee expresses its deep concern at the acuteness and diversity of the problems faced by a substantial part of the Dominican trade union movement in a wide variety of branches of activity.
.The Committee notes in particular that, according to the allegations, certain trade union organisations, in many cases of nation-wide importance, have for many years been having great difficulty in carrying on their activities owing to the multiple obstacles that have been put in their path: arrest and dismissal of",0,1971,Dominican Republic
120,"their leaders, occupation of their premises, interference in their internal affairs. Such an atmosphere cannot be conducive to the development of a truly free and independent trade union movement, nor to the promotion of normal industrial relations. The Committee wishes to emphasise before proceeding any further that, as stated in the resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties adopted by the International Labour Conference in , the absence of civil liberties removes all meaning from the concept of trade union rights, and the rights conferred upon workers' and employers' organisations must be based on respect for those civil liberties.
.The allegations refer to a considerable number of murders of officials of workers' organisations, especially in the agricultural sector, committed in most cases by employers or overseers. In the absence of any detailed information on these cases from the Government, the Committee feels bound to observe that the Government has not established that these deaths occurred for reasons unconnected with the status or activities of the officials in question. The Committee considers that, in any event, the circumstances of these cases should have prompted the authorities to take effective steps to establish the facts, punish the culprits and restore the situation to normal, this being an essential prerequisite for the free exercise of trade union rights.
.Many of the complaints mention the arrest and detention of officials of various trade union organisations. Contradictory explanations as to the reasons for these measures have been given by the complainants and by the Government. According to the former they were due to trade union activities, while the latter has claimed in general terms that the officials in question were arrested for breaches of laws in respect of public order or for common-law offences.
.Be this as it may, the Committee must observe that the Government has not supplied detailed information as to the acts of which the persons arrested were accused, thus preventing the Committee from examining the allegations with all the facts before it. The Committee considers that the onus was on the Government to show that the measures it had taken were not prompted by the trade union activities of the persons concerned.
.While most of the trade unionists mentioned in the complaints appear to have now recovered their freedom, it has none the less been clearly established that some of them were kept in custody for relatively lengthy periods of time, in some cases at repeated intervals. It is impossible to determine from the Government's replies whether the persons concerned were brought before the courts. Only in a few cases does it appear from the information supplied by the complainants that legal proceedings were initiated against the trade union officials concerned. One of them was moreover kept in prison even though he had been found not guilty by a court of first instance.
.The Committee must recall in this connection that it is one of the fundamental rights of the individual that a detained person should be brought without delay before the appropriate judge, this right being recognised in such instruments as the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man. In the case of persons engaged in trade union activities, this is one of the civil liberties which should be ensured by the authorities in order to guarantee the full effectiveness of the exercise of trade union rights. The Committee further wishes to point out that the detention by the authorities of trade unionists concerning whom no grounds for prosecution are subsequently found is liable to involve restrictions on trade union rights, and governments should take steps to ensure that the authorities concerned have instructions appropriate to eliminate the danger of detention for trade union activities.
.According to the complainants, the authorities have also ordered the expulsion from the country of certain trade union officials. One of them was refused entry into the Dominican Republic on his return from an international trade union conference. In the Committee's opinion, a measure exiling trade unionists, which is in violation of human rights, is of particular gravity since it deprives the persons concerned of the possibility of working in their country and of contacts with their families. It is also in violation of freedom of association in that it undermines the trade union organisations which are thereby deprived of their leaders.
.According to the information supplied by the complainants, many trade union officials and members have been dismissed from their jobs in a large number of undertakings covering a wide range of activities. In most of these cases it has been alleged that the sole ground for the action in question was the trade union activities of the persons concerned. In some cases the underlying intention was stated to be the dismantling of trade unions, though this has been denied by the Government. The Government has however admitted that some undertakings engage in practices hardly conducive to the development of sound industrial relations which it cannot combat effectively under the legislation in force.
.The Committee considers that no person should be discriminated against on account of his trade union membership or activities, and that governments should take measures to ensure that workers are protected against acts, including dismissal, which are likely to provoke or have as their object anti-union discrimination in respect of employment. Legislation enabling employers in practice - on condition that they pay the compensation prescribed by law for cases of unjustified dismissal - to get rid of any worker, even if the true reason is his trade union membership or activities, does not give sufficient protection against acts of anti-union discrimination.
.Protection against acts of anti-union discrimination is particularly desirable in the case of trade union officials, because, in order to carry out their trade union functions in full independence, they must have the assurance that they will not be victimised by virtue of their trade union office. Such an assurance is also necessary to ensure that effect is given to the principle that workers' organisations should have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom .
.A large number of trade union organisations appear to have been dismantled over the past few years, either through the withdrawal of their legal personality or through the setting up of parallel unions or through their destruction by employers. In answer to these allegations the Government has merely stated that the great majority of the organisations in question are still in existence but their leaders have been removed from office by decision of their members. The Committee does not have sufficient information to enable it to express an opinion on these matters in full knowledge of the facts. In particular, it has not been specified whether the legal personality of the trade union mentioned by the complainants was withdrawn by order of the administrative authorities or as a result of court proceedings. The Committee notes, however, that under the terms of section  of the Labour Code, the registration of a trade union may be cancelled by a decision of the courts if the trade union pursues activities not connected with its lawful objectives.
.As concerns the setting up of parallel unions and the destruction of trade unions by employers, the Committee wishes to recall that under the terms of Article  of Convention No. , ratified by the Dominican Republic, workers' and employers' organisations must enjoy adequate protection against any acts of interference by each other or each other's agents or members in their establishment, functioning or administration. Article  specifies that acts which are designed to promote the establishment of workers' organisations under the domination of employers or employers' organisations, or to support workers' organisations by financial or other means with the object of placing such organisations under the control of employers or employers' organisations, shall be deemed to constitute acts of interference.
.The allegations of interference by public authorities in the internal affairs of trade unions are mainly concerned with the right of assembly, the right to elect officials in full freedom and trade union funds. The Committee considers that freedom of assembly for trade union purposes constitutes one of the fundamental elements of trade union rights, and that the authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof. The obligation to accept the presence of a representative of the authorities at general assemblies constitutes a restriction upon the free activity of trade unions.
.With regard to trade union elections, the complainants stated that rigged elections had been held in the POASI union and that the Supreme Court had ruled them to be illegal. According to more recent information supplied by the Government, properly conducted elections were subsequently held in this union. In this connection the Committee wishes once again to emphasise the importance it attaches to the principle that workers and their organisations should have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom.
.The POASI is also alleged by the complainants to have had its assets confiscated.",1,1971,Dominican Republic
121,"According to the Government these allegations are false. In view of the contradictory nature of these statements, the Committee can only recall the importance of the principle that trade union funds should be adequately protected.
.It appears from the allegations made that the headquarters of certain trade union organisations have been occupied by the police, in some cases several times. The latest intervention of this kind - involving the POASI - seems to have been quite recent. In this connection the Committee wishes to draw the Government's attention to the fact that, in the resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties, the International Labour Conference, expressed the view that the right to protection of the property of trade union organisations was one of the civil liberties which were essential for the normal exercise of trade union rights. While trade unions cannot claim immunity from a search of their premises, such a search should only be made following the issue of a warrant by the ordinary judicial authority after that authority has been satisfied that reasonable grounds exist for supposing that evidence exists on the said premises material to a prosecution for an offence under the ordinary law and provided that such search is restricted to the purposes in respect of which the warrant was issued.
.With regard to the allegations relating to interference with the right to strike, the Committee recalls that the right to strike is one of the essential means through which workers and their organisations may promote and defend their occupational interests. The Committee points out in this connection that on several occasions the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has made comments with respect to sections  to  of the Labour Code, which allow all cases of collective labour disputes to be referred to arbitration, culminating in a binding award, which might severely restrict the right to strike and thus infringe the right of trade unions to organise their activities. As concerns the calling in of the police to obstruct, according to the complainants, the exercise of the right to strike, the Committee considers that intervention by security forces in the event of strikes should be limited to the maintenance of public order.
.As concerns the Government's refusal to recognise the legal existence of the Dominican Teachers' Association, the Committee refers to the comments of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations with respect to the position of public servants in the Dominican Republic, who are excluded from the Labour code and thereby deprived of the trade union rights proclaimed by the Code. The Committee recalls that public servants, including teachers, are entitled to enjoy the right to organise, just as other workers are.
.A number of complaints were partly concerned with the trade union situation in the agricultural sector. This branch of activity does indeed seem to have been particularly affected by extremely serious incidents, sometimes involving the death of trade union officials. In addition, according to the complainants, the Government has prevented agricultural workers from organising themselves freely, even though their trade union rights are recognised by law. The Committee wishes in this connection to emphasise the particular importance the International Labour Conference attached to the trade union rights of rural workers in adopting the Rural Workers' Organisations Convention (No. ) in . Article  of this Convention provides that it shall be an objective of national policy concerning rural development to facilitate the establishment and growth, on a voluntary basis, of strong and independent organisations of rural workers as an effective means of ensuring the participation of rural workers, without discrimination, in economic and social development and in the benefits resulting therefrom.
.In these circumstances, as concerns the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the Government's attention to the considerations and principles set forth in paragraphs  to  concerning the death, arrest, banishment and dismissal of trade unionists, the dismantling of trade union organisations, intervention by public authorities in the internal affairs of trade unions, the occupation of trade union premises, the right to strike and the trade union rights of teachers and agricultural workers;(b) to deplore the obstructive attitude and lack of co-operation shown by the Government, which, by not consenting to a mission on the spot, and by not transmitting its replies on the questions before the Committee has made it impossible to obtain all the information on the serious allegations made and to decide what measures could be taken as regards the problems involved;(c) to decide to give wider publicity to the present report, in particular during the next session of the International Labour Conference.Geneva,  May . (Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.
.The Committee has already examined several complaints of infringements of trade union rights in the Dominican Republic, presented by the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), the International Metalworkers' Federation (IMF), the National Union of Heavy Machinery Operators (SINOMAPE), the National Federation of Dockworkers, the Stevedores' Union (POASI) and the General Workers' Federation (CGT). These complaints were dealt with under Cases Nos. , , ,  and . With regard to Case No. , the Committee submitted a number of conclusions to the Governing Body that appear in paragraphs  to  of its st Report and in paragraphs  to  of its rd Report. The Committee also examined Case No.  and Cases Nos. , ,  and  in its th Report (paragraphs  to ) in which it also submitted certain conclusions to the Governing Body.
.Since then, further allegations have been received in connection with these cases. They have been made by the WFTU (communication of  July ), the National Union of Telephone Workers (communications of  July  and  September ), the POASI and the CGT (joint communication of  April ) and the CGT (communication of  June ).
.The World Federation of Teachers' Unions also submitted allegations in a letter of  May  (Case No. ).
.The Government submitted certain information in a letter of  August .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee notes the information communicated by the Government which recognises, in particular, that, in certain undertakings, practices exist that are not conducive to the development of healthy labour management relations and to which it cannot effectively put a stop under the legislation currently in force. New complaints have been received containing allegations that are as serious and as varied as those previously examined. It should be borne in mind, moreover, that the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has for several years been making observations on the application by the Dominican Republic of Conventions Nos.  and , which it has ratified.
.The Committee regrets the Government's delay in acceding to the request made of it to give its consent to the visit of a representative of the Director-General. In this connection, the Committee wishes to emphasise that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and the Committee is confident that, if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their part will recognise the importance for the protection of their own good name of co-operating with the Committee in every way so that it can examine the allegations fully and seek possible solutions to the problems involved. In paragraphs  to  of its th Report, the Committee has laid particular stress on the importance it attaches in this connection to the direct contacts procedure.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to urge the Government to give its consent without delay to an inquiry into the trade union situation being carried out in the Dominican Republic by a representative of the Director General;(b) to request the Director-General to contact the Government at the highest possible level so as to express the concern of the Committee and to insist that the Government should give a favourable response to the request made above;(c) to take note of this interim report.
.The Committee already examined Case No.  in May and November  and on each occasion it submitted a report to the Governing Body. These reports appear in paragraphs  to  of the Committee's st report and paragraphs  to  of its rd report.
.In its rd Report, the Committee recommended that the Governing Body request the Government to provide additional information on one aspect of the matter. Despite repeated requests, this information was not received. The Committee, therefore, addressed urgent appeals to the Government in November  and February and May  that it supply the information requested. In November  and February , the Committee noted with regret that despite its appeals the requested information still had not been received. In May ",1,1971,Dominican Republic
122,"it again made an urgent appeal to the Government to supply the information.
.Regarding Cases Nos. , ,  and , the complaints and additional information submitted by the complainants appear in the following communications: three communications, of  October ,  September  and  June , from the National Union of Heavy Machinery Operators (SINOMAPE), a communication of  November , from the National Federation of Dockworkers, two communications, of  May  and  November , from the Stevedores' Union (POASI), a communication of  August , from the General Workers' Federation (CGT), two communications, of  September  and  July , from the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), three communications, of  November ,  July and  October , from the World Confederation of Labour (WCL).
.These complaints were transmitted to the Government as they were received, with requests for observations. Apart from some very general replies sent by communications of  January and  July , and despite the time which had elapsed since the presentation of the first complaints (Case No. ), the Committee received no information from the Government on the various allegations. In November  and May , the Committee sent urgent requests to the Government to submit the information requested (Case No. ).
.As the information requested on all these cases was not received, the Committee asked the Director-General in November  to communicate with the highest level of the Government, on behalf of the Committee, expressing the Committee's concern and urgently requesting the Government to provide the observations requested from it (Cases Nos. , ,  and ). The Government finally submitted information by communications of ,  and  February .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.This case has already been the subject of a report by the Committee, contained in paragraphs  to  of its st Report. In this report the Committee, and subsequently the Governing Body, noted that despite repeated requests, the Government had still not furnished its observations on the allegations made.
.Immediately after the Committee's session, held on  May , the Director-General received the Government's observations, which are contained in a communication dated  May .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants allege that according to information provided by their member organisation in the Dominican Republic-the National Union of Heavy-Machinery Operators-the headquarters of the UNACHOSIN and POASI unions were broken into and ransacked and that Mr. Albuquerque, General Secretary of the UNACHOSIN union, and  other workers, members of this organisation, were arrested. The complainants maintain that these acts were carried out by members of the national police force in collaboration with a private organisation connected with the Government and called the "" Juventud Democrtica Reformista Anticomunista "".
.In its observations, the Government states that "" the furniture and premises belonging to the POASI and UNACHOSIN unions are private union property and, if they have been destroyed, the unions can apply to the courts for any damages sustained since the registration of a union, by conferring legal personality upon it, gives it power to institute court proceedings "".
.The Government adds that the premises of the UNACHOSIN union were handed back to the union's officers a few days after the incident and that "" trade union activities in both the POASI and the UNACHOSIN are proceeding normally "".
.While it notes that, according to the information related in the preceding paragraph, the situation in the POASI and UNACHOSIN unions appears to have returned to normal, the Committee also notes, from what is stated in paragraphs  and , that the Government does not deny that there had been such intervention.
.In these circumstances, the Committee finds itself obliged to recommend the Governing Body, as it did when it last examined the case:(a) while it recognises that trade unions, like other associations or individuals, cannot claim immunity against a search of their premises, to emphasise the importance that should be attached to the principle that such a search should be made only following the issue of a warrant by the ordinary judicial authority, after that authority has been satisfied that reasonable grounds exist for supposing that such a search will provide the evidence required to prosecute for an offence under ordinary law, and provided that the search is limited to the purposes in respect of which the warrant was issued;(b) to draw the Government's attention to the fact that the International Labour Conference, at its th Session (Geneva, ), in its resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties, considered that the right to protection of trade union property was one of those civil liberties which are essential to the normal exercise of trade union rights.
.As regards the allegations concerning the arrest of Mr. Albuquerque, General Secretary of the UNACHOSIN union, and of  other workers, members of this organisation, the Committee notes that the Government has made no reference to this matter in its observations.
.The Committee recalls that, in all cases involving the arrest, detention or sentencing of trade union leaders, the Committee itself and the Governing Body, taking the view that individuals should be presumed innocent until found guilty, have considered that it was for the Government to show that the measures it had taken were in no way occasioned by the trade union activities of the persons concerned.
.The Committee further recalls that in cases of this kind, when the Committee itself and the Governing Body reached the conclusion that allegations concerning the arrest, detention or sentencing of trade unionists did not call for further examination, this was only after observations had been received from the Government showing sufficiently precisely and with sufficient detail that the measures were in no way occasioned by trade union activities, but solely by activities outside the trade union sphere which were either prejudicial to public order or of a political nature.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to request the Government to submit its observations on the complainants' allegations concerning arrests, specifying the present situation of Mr. Albuquerque and of the  workers said to have been arrested with him.
.As regards the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the allegations concerning the ransacking of the POASI and UNACHOSIN unions:(i) while it recognises that trade unions, like other associations or individuals, cannot claim immunity against a search of their premises, to emphasise the importance that should be attached to the principle that such a search should be made only following the issue of a warrant by the ordinary judicial authority, after that authority has been satisfied that reasonable grounds exist for supposing that such a search will provide the evidence required to prosecute for an offence under ordinary law, and provided that the search is restricted to the purposes in respect of which the warrant was issued;(ii) to draw the Government's attention to the fact that the International Labour Conference at its th Session (Geneva, ), in its resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties, considered that the right to protection of trade union property was one of those civil liberties which are essential to the normal exercise of trade union rights;(b) as regards the allegations concerning the arrest of Mr. Albuquerque and  other workers, for the reasons stated in paragraphs  and  above, to request the Government to furnish its observations thereon, specifying the present situation of the persons concerned;(c) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report as soon as it has received the additional information referred to in the preceding subparagraph.
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complaint made by the International Metalworkers' Federation is contained in a communication dated  June  addressed direct to the ILO.
.The complainants allege that, according to information provided by their affiliated organisation in the Dominican Republic, the National Union of Heavy Machinery Operators, the headquarters of the UNACHOSIN and POASI unions have been broken into and ransacked, and that Fliz Albuquerque, General Secretary of UNACHOSIN, and  other workers belonging to this union have been arrested. This action, the complainants state, has been taken by members of the national police force together with a private organisation linked to the Government and called the "" Juventud Democrtica Reformista Anticomunista "".
.On  June , this complaint was forwarded to the Government, which has made no comments on it. Accordingly, at its session in November , the Committee urged the Government to supply the information requested (th Report, paragraph ). This",1,1971,Dominican Republic
123,"appeal having proved fruitless, the Committee, at its session in February , and by virtue of the procedure set forth in paragraph  of its th Report, informed the Government that it might submit a report on the substance of the matter at the Committee's present session, even if the information requested from the Government had still not been received. This information has not yet been received.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to recall the observation made by the Committee as early as its First Report, namely that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and the Committee is confident that, if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side should recognise the importance for the protection of their own good name of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to such detailed factual charges as may be put forward;(b) to note that the allegations made involve a number of principles relating to the free exercise of trade union rights;(c) recognising that trade unions, like other associations or persons, cannot claim immunity from search for their premises, to emphasise the importance which the Committee attaches to the principle that such a search should only be made following the issue of a warrant by the ordinary judicial authority, after that authority has been satisfied that reasonable grounds exist for supposing that evidence exists on the said premises material to a prosecution for an offence under the ordinary law, and provided that such search is restricted to the purposes in respect of which the warrant was issued;(d) to draw attention to the fact that the international Labour Conference at its th Session (Geneva, ) in its resolution on trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties, expressed the view that the right to protection of trade union property was one of those civil liberties which are essential for the normal exercise of trade union rights;(e) to recall that in all cases involving the arrest, detention or sentencing of a trade union official, the Committee and the Governing Body, taking the view that individuals have the right to be presumed innocent until found guilty, have considered that it was incumbent upon the Government to show that the measures it had taken were in no way occasioned by the trade union activities of the individual concerned;(f) to recall that in cases of this kind, while the Committee and the Governing Body have reached the conclusion that allegations relating to the arrest, detention or sentencing of trade unionists did not call for further consideration this was only after considering observations from the governments concerned indicating the specific measures taken against such persons and showing sufficiently precisely and with sufficient detail that the measures were in no way occasioned by the exercise of trade union freedoms but by activities outside the trade union sphere which were either prejudicial to public order or of a political nature;(g) to note that in this particular case the Government has failed to supply information showing that the allegations made by the complainants are unfounded;(h) to draw attention to the principle that it should be the policy of every government to ensure observance of the rights of man and, especially, of the right of all detained or accused persons to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment; and(i) to request the Director-General to maintain all appropriate forms of contact with the Government in order to obtain information concerning the situation of the trade unionists, mentioned in paragraph  above, who were arrested.",1,1971,Dominican Republic
124,".The complaint is contained in two communications dated  November  and  December  addressed to the ILO directly by the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions (CLASC) and the World Confederation of Labour respectively. The complaint was forwarded by letter dated  December  to the Government, which furnished its observations thereon in a communication dated  March .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.It is alleged that on  November  Mr. Emilio Mspero, the General Secretary of the CLASC, who was on his way to attend the Third National Congress of the Autonomous Confederation of Christian Trade Unions (CASC) (scheduled for  to  November ), was met on his arrival at the airport of Santo Domingo by the Chief of Immigration, who informed him that he was persona non grata in the country and that the Government of the Dominican Republic had ordered that he be sent back in the aeroplane in which he had arrived and this despite the fact that all his papers were in order. Mspero asked to be allowed to get in touch with some of the other government authorities and with the union leaders of the CASC, but the immigration officer ordered that Mspero be escorted by some fifteen armed police and put back in the aeroplane from which he had disembarked.
.In these circumstances the complainants requested the ILO to take up Mspero's case with the Dominican authorities and to demand that basic trade union rights be guaranteed.
.In its observations the Government points out that its Ministry of Labour immediately took the necessary measures to redress this regrettable incident and that as a result of these measures Mr. Emilio Mspero was allowed to re-enter the country the following day so as to permit him to take an active part in the Third National Congress of the CASC, which was held in Santo Domingo between  and  November of last year. During his stay in the country Mr. Mspero was received by the Minister of Labour, together with the leaders of the CASC. Moreover, Mr. Mspero enjoyed the ample facilities made available to him by the Dominican authorities, amongst which might be mentioned his participation in a television programme where he was able to expatiate on the aims and purposes of his organisation before a group of local journalists.
.In view of the Government's explanation the Committee is led to the conclusion that the matters raised in the complaint have been satisfactorily resolved.",0,1969,Dominican Republic
125,".The Committee examined this case at its session in May , when it submitted to the Governing Body an interim report contained in paragraphs - of its th Report, which was approved by the Governing Body.
.In paragraph  of its th Report, the Committee submitted to the Governing Body a number of final conclusions on certain aspects of the case and a recommendation that the Governing Body request the Government of the Dominican Republic to send further information to enable the Committee to form its conclusions on the allegation, the examination of which had remained in abeyance. The Government furnished this information in a communication dated  October .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their first communication the complainants had alleged that on  November  the police and army had opened fire on the premises of the Stevedores' Union (POASI), before occupying the premises by force, although they had no legal warrant to do so; fifteen workers are said to have been arrested and other workers, who were injured, are said to have disappeared. Many workers are alleged to have been brutally assaulted and there is said to have been destruction of furniture and of the union headquarters in general.
.In its first communication concerning these allegations, the Government stated that it was incorrect that there had been a considerable number of persons injured in connection with the above-mentioned events. The Government stated that on the night of  November  a police patrol was attacked by individuals. When the attackers were pursued by the patrol to the premises in which they had taken refuge, the building of the above-mentioned trade union organisation suffered some damage. Although the Government assumed no responsibility for the incidents, it had taken the necessary measures for the building to bet repaired.
.The Committee had taken note of the Government's statements and recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to indicate whether an official inquiry had been carried out to establish responsibility for these occurrences and, if so, to communicate the results of this inquiry.
.In its subsequent communication the Government states that it ordered a detailed inquiry into the facts complained of, and that this inquiry has revealed that the police who took action in the case did so within the limits of their functions. The Government repeats that it has no responsibility "" in this regrettable incident "", despite which it "" compensated the leaders of the Stevedores' Union (POASI), in agreement with them, for repairs to the damaged building and furniture "".
.At the time of noting these new statements by the Government, the Committee deplores the fact that they contain no concrete information on the causes behind the incidents, simply stating that the police were not exceeding their powers. For their part, the complainants have not taken advantage of the possibility of supplying more detailed information on the events complained about. The Committee considers that for want of more detailed evidence it is impossible for it to reach definite conclusions on the facts in question.
.In any case, in view of the fact that the Government has in the meanwhile paid compensation to the Stevedores' Union, in agreement with its leaders, in order for the trade union building to be repaired, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide, subject to the above reservation, that this aspect of the case calls for no further examination.
.This complaint, lodged by the Latin American Workers' Permanent Congress on Trade Union Unity, was made in a letter dated  December . On  January  the complaint was referred to the Government, which, in a communication dated  April   sent in its observations.
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants allege that "" freedom of association and the right to organise are systematically violated by the most diverse forms of repression and particularly by violent police activities "".
.The complainants allege (in very general language) that "" over forty trade unions of state and sugar establishments have been taken over and their entire managing committees removed from office arbitrarily and without justification. Trade union leaders have been persecuted by the political police of the rgime and many of them have been unjustly put in prison. "" The headquarters of the Dominican National Federation of Workers are said to have been raided and equipment confiscated. Municipal unions have not been recognised and , municipal workers have been dismissed for not joining the government party. Lastly, it is said that the wages of dockworkers belonging to the union known as POASI have had their wages arbitrarily reduced by  per cent.
.The complainants also say that the Government has passed an Austerity Act freezing wages, despite the workers' protests and despite an alarming rise in the cost of living.
.These are general allegations couched in very general terms. They do not name the unions the executive committees of which are said to have been dissolved, or the trade union leaders said to have been persecuted or arrested, nor is there any indication as to exactly when these events took place. The complainants do, however, make certain other allegations of a rather more specific kind.
.Thus they claim that on  November  the police and army opened fire on the premises of the Stevedores' Union (POASI), before occupying those premises by force, despite the fact that they had no legal warrant to do so. Fifteen workers, it is stated, were arrested and thrown into gaol, and others disappeared; their present whereabouts are unknown, but there is reason to believe they may have been wounded. Many workers, it is said, were fired on and brutally assaulted with rifle butts and clubs.
."" This brutal assault by the police and military "", the complainants go on to say, "" also involved the destruction by the attackers of desks, pictures, telephones, windows, typewriters, files, doors and fans, and the union headquarters were subjected to a general and destructive vandalism......
.In its observations on the general allegations (see paragraph ) the Government simply states that ""it is not true that trade union leaders have been persecuted or imprisoned "".
.The Committee thus has to decide which of two completely contradictory statements is the more worthy of credence. In view, however, of the very general language used by the complainants, who failed, moreover, to avail themselves of the possibility of backing up their allegations with further information, the Committee feels that the veracity of these allegations has not been adequately demonstrated, and hence recommends the Governing Body to decide that this aspect of the case calls for no further consideration.
.The freezing of wages, referred to in paragraph  above, would appear to be an aspect of official wages policy rather than an attack on the principle of freedom of association. In this connection, the Government declares that the Austerity Act, which froze wages for the sake of the balance of payments, has recently been amended in a manner favourable to the workers. Their claims, the Government affirms, have to some extent been met, since private firms and public undertakings which have made a profit during the financial year have been authorised to increase wages.
.This aspect of the matter is not directly related to the exercise of trade union rights, and the Committee accordingly recommends that the Governing Body merely take note of the Government's statement.
.As regards the allegations analysed in paragraphs  and  above, the Government begins by asserting that, contrary to the complainants' statement, it is quite untrue that there were numerous victims of the events which took place on the night of  November .
.The Government then presents what happened in the following night. In the middle of the night, it says, a police patrol was attacked; the attackers, pursued by the police, took refuge in the trade union premises concerned, which premises suffered some damage in the ensuing action. The Government continues by saying that, although in no way responsible for "" these deplorable incidents "", it has arranged for the necessary repairs to be undertaken.
.While taking due note of the Government's statement concerning this aspect of the matter, the Committee wishes to know whether any official investigation has been undertaken to ascertain responsibilities and, if so, what the conclusions are.
.Hence it recommends the Governing Body to ask the Government to be so good as to supply the information mentioned in paragraph  above.
.As regards the case as a whole, the Committee recommends that the Governing Body:(a) decide that for the reasons set forth in paragraph  above, the general allegations analysed in paragraph  (winding up of trade union executive committees, arrest of trade union leaders and dismissals of workers) call for no further consideration;(b) take note of the Government's statement that the Austerity",0,1968,Dominican Republic
126,"Act has been amended in such a way that the workers' aspirations are to some extent met;(c) ask the Government to state whether any official inquiry has been made with a view to assessing responsibility for the events of  November , mentioned in paragraphs ,  and  above, and, if there has been such an inquiry, to indicate what the conclusions were;(d) take note of the present interim report, on the understanding that the Committee will report again after it has received the additional information referred to in paragraph (c) above.",1,1968,Dominican Republic
127,".The complaint of the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions (I.F.C.T.U.) is contained in a telegram dated  September , sent directly to the I.L.O. The complainants were informed that they were entitled to submit further information in support of their complaint, but they have not availed themselves of this opportunity. The complaint was transmitted to the Government, which forwarded its observations thereon in a communication dated  October .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants allege that on  September  soldiers and police of the Dominican Republic prevented a demonstration by the Autonomous Federation of Christian Trade Unions against a wage-freezing law. They allege that several trade union leaders were imprisoned, and they request the I.L.O. to intervene with a view to securing their release.
.In its observations, after stating that no trade unionist has been imprisoned, the Government indicates that the demonstration referred to by the I.F.C.T.U was in fact forbidden by the police acting on the basis of a decision taken by the State Secretariat for the Interior and the Police, which is empowered by law to grant or refuse authorisation for public demonstrations. The Government states that in the circumstances referred to in the complaint there was every reason to fear that the planned demonstration would degenerate into disorders, the consequences of which it was impossible to foresee. It adds that it was for this reason that the demonstration was not authorised.
.The Government goes on to say that the austerity legislation designed to freeze wages and so stabilise the balance of payments has recently been amended in a manner favourable to the workers, some of whose claims have been met. Thus, under the amendments made, wage increases have been rendered possible in undertakings, both public and private, which have made profits in the course of the financial year.
.Finally, the Government states that it views favourably the exercise of trade union rights and the workers' claims to the extent that they are compatible with the national Constitution and legislation.
.As regards the banning of the demonstration, the Committee recalls that in the past it has considered that trade union organisations must observe the general provisions relating uniformly to all public meetings. In the same connection, the Committee was also of the opinion that it rests with the Government, which is responsible for the maintenance of public order, to decide in the exercise of its corresponding powers whether meetings, including trade union meetings, may in certain special circumstances endanger public order and security and to take adequate preventive measures.
.In the present case it seems, firstly, that the demonstration planned was intended as a protest against the Government's economic policy, since it was directed against the austerity legislation to freeze wages, and secondly, and principally, that the reason for the banning of the meeting lay in the authorities' fears that public order might be endangered.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide, in the light of the precedents referred to in paragraph  above and for the reasons indicated in paragraph , that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.
.As regards the allegation that some trade union leaders had been imprisoned, which the Government formally denies, the Committee observes that although the complainants were accorded the possibility to do so, they did not supply any further information in support of their allegations, such as the names of the persons alleged to have been arrested.
.In these circumstances, considering that the complainants have not supplied sufficient evidence of their contentions, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that this aspect of the case and, consequently, the case as a whole, does not call for further examination.",0,1968,Dominican Republic
128,".The complaint presented by the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions is contained in a communication of  June , which was forwarded to the ILO by the United Nations. A copy was sent to the Government of the Dominican Republic, which presented its observations on  September .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.It is alleged in the complaint that on  June  the Dominican Government arbitrarily expelled the Christian trade union officer Alfredo Di Pacce, who was carrying out an important trade union mission for the benefit of Dominican peasants and workers. The complainants explain that Mr. Di Pacce had all his papers in order and they request the intervention of the ILO to re-establish respect for human and trade union rights in the Dominican Republic.
.The Government states in its reply that while Mr. Di Pacce was in the country he enjoyed the traditional hospitality of the Dominicans, but that he abused this hospitality and devoted his time to political activities that were forbidden to him as a foreigner. When his visa expired, the migration authorities therefore decided not to extend his residence permit and they requested him to leave the national territory. In its communication the Government reproduces the Constitutional provisions under which it is the duty of every foreigner to refrain from taking part in political activities on Dominican territory.
.The Committee has considered in the past that it was not for the Committee to deal with measures deriving from national legislation concerning aliens, unless these measures had direct repercussions on the exercise of trade union rights.
.In the present case the Committee observes in this connection that, although the complainants state that Mr. Di Pacce was carrying out a trade union mission, the Government asserts that he was really devoting himself to political activities that were forbidden to him as a foreigner. The Committee also observes that the Government meets the complainants' statement that Mr. Di Pacce was expelled although his papers were in order by maintaining that his visa had expired and that his residence permit was not extended by the authorities.
.In these circumstances the Committee considers that this is a case of factual questions concerning the period of validity of the residence permit granted to Mr. Di Pacce for his stay in the Dominican Republic-questions moreover on which the complainants and the Government have given versions that appear to be contradictory-and that the Committee is no more competent to express an opinion on these questions than it is on the right of a government to extend or not to extend the validity of a residence permit;",0,1968,Dominican Republic
129,".The complaint of the World Federation of Trade Unions (W.F.T.U.) is contained in a letter of  April , sent directly to the I.L.O. This complaint having been passed on to the Government, the latter submitted its observations on the matter in a letter dated  October .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), as well as the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The W.F.T.U makes a certain number of allegations which will be examined separately below.
.Having noted the Government's observations, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that this aspect of the case, and consequently the case as a whole, calls for no further examination on its part.",0,1967,Dominican Republic
130,".This matter was considered by the Committee at its session in February , when it submitted an interim report theron, in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, which was approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (February-March ).
.In that report the Committee submitted its final conclusions on some of the allegations made in the complaints, but requested the Government to furnish its observations on other aspects of the case. The following paragraphs deal only with those aspects still outstanding.
.In a communication dated  April  the Government sent the additional observations which it had been asked to supply.
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its telegram dated  February  the National Confederation of Free Workers (CONATRAL) alleged, without providing any particulars, that the rights of the free and democratic trade union organisations in the Dominican Republic were being violated by political mobs with aims foreign to Dominican culture and tradition and that trade unionists had been murdered. "" Our bases "", the telegram also stated, "" are destroyed with impunity, our principles violently strangled; terror, menace and death are methods regularly used to bring about our destruction; political alliances join to eliminate us.""
.In two communications, of  and  February , the Inter-American Regional Organisation of Workers (of the I.C.F.T.U.) (O.R.I.T.) expressed support for the complaint brought by CONATRAL and said that the latter organisation had been attacked by extremist groups in an effort to impose upon it attitudes and positions, which, in the opinion of the O.R.I.T, would in no way contribute to re-establishing the atmosphere of peace and tranquillity so badly needed by the Dominican Republic. The same extremist groups were said to have taken their revenge by means of a bomb attack on CONATRAL headquarters.
.The Independent Union of Labourers, in part of its communication dated  March , alleged that in the country there was no respect for the most elementary rights of free trade unions and that mobs taking orders from political parties attacked anybody not sharing their ideas. In a communication of  May  the same organisation supplied additional information in the form of a newspaper article which had appeared in San Juan (Puerto Rico) on  March . This article reported statements by an "" Inter-Union Committee of Dominican Trade Union Leaders in Exile "" to the effect that democratic and anti-Communist trade union leaders from Santo Domingo were arriving daily in Puerto Rico, fleeing from brutal persecution by the "" red mob "", whose activities the provisional Government had not prevented. The Independent Union of Labourers added that both its own General Secretary and other high-level officers of the free and democratic trade union movement were being persecuted and turned out of their jobs by "" mobs ""; and also that the Sugar Corporation had been handed over to a political party, so that party members only could obtain employment there.
.At its sessions in May and November , and in February , the Committee postponed consideration of these allegations, as it had not received the Government's observations.
.In a communication dated  April  the Government forwards the comments made on this matter by the Ministry of Labour. According to the latter the allegations made by CONATRAL merely reflect the disquiet and anxiety felt by those persons in CONATRAL who were involved in political manoeuvres alien to the purposes of the organisation and as a result of the serious crisis that the Dominican Republic had lived through following the revolutionary outbreak of  April , which gave rise to a military occupation by forces of the Organisation of American States. "" A proof of this assertion "", continues the Ministry of Labour, "" is that, once order had been re-established and the country had returned to normal, this workers' organisation had not even the vaguest reasons for complaint concerning its stability and development.""
.The Ministry goes on to say that, the situation being as described above, if any trade union leader left the country (and the Ministry had no knowledge of any such departure), it would have been of his own free will.
.The Ministry finally states that the allegations of discrimination in employment engaged in by the Sugar Corporation are undoubtedly attributable to the same reasons, which no longer hold good.
.The Committee observes that the allegations made by the complainants seem to have referred to events occurring during an obviously abnormal period, as a result of serious political convulsions, and the consequences thereof, as far as the allegations are concerned, have now been surmounted. In addition, the complaints are formulated in very general terms, and the complainants did not make use of their right to submit fuller details in support of their allegations relating to the violation of trade union rights.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.
.The complaints are contained in five communications which were sent directly to the I.L.O, namely a telegram from the National Confederation of Free Workers (CONATRAL) dated  February , two letters from the Inter-American Regional Organisation of Workers of the I.C.F.T.U. (O.R.I.T.) dated  and  February , and a letter from the Independent Union of Labourers dated  March . The last-named organisation sent further information regarding its complaint by letter of  May .
.Each of the above communications was transmitted to the Government, which replied in a communication dated  October  and received in the Office too late to be examined by the Committee at its meeting in November of that year.
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its telegram dated  February  CONATRAL alleged, without giving any particulars, that the rights of the free and democratic trade union organisations in the Dominican Republic were being violated by political mobs with aims foreign to Dominican culture and tradition and that trade unionists had been assassinated. The telegram also says: "" our bases are destroyed with impunity, our principles violently strangled; terror, menace and death are methods regularly used to bring about our destruction; political alliances join to eliminate us ""; and it alleges the support of , Dominican workers.
.In its communication of  February , which was corrected by another dated  February , O.R.I.T expressed its support for CONATRAL's complaint and stated further that CONATRAL had been "" attacked by extremist groups in an effort to impose upon it attitudes or positions "" which, in the opinion of O.R.I.T, "" will in no way contribute to re-establish the atmosphere of peace and tranquillity so badly needed by the Dominican Republic "". The same extremist groups were said to have "" avenged themselves on CONATRAL by means of a bomb attack on its headquarters "". O.R.I.T asked the I.L.O to make representations to the provisional Government informing it of the workers' situation and so to give them the assistance which, according to CONATRAL's complaint, they required.
.The Independent Union of Labourers, for its part, appended to its communication of  March  the text of a letter which, it said, it had sent to the provisional President of the Republic, asking for compensation for the damage suffered by the union during the recent civil war (including the sack of its offices and co-operatives) and subsequently since the provisional Government took office. The union hoped that the I.L.O would "" take note of the fact that in this country there is no respect for the most elementary rights of free trade unions and that mobs taking orders from political parties attack ... any person not sharing their ideas"". It also asked the I.L.O to send a representative ""to see for himself the constant and flagrant violation of all the International Labour Conventions "". On  May  the Independent Union of Labourers sent, as additional information, the text of a newspaper article which had appeared at San Juan (Puerto Rico) on  March : this reported statements by an "" Inter-Union Committee of Dominican Trade Union Leaders in Exile "" to the effect that "" democratic and anti-communist trade union leaders from Santo Domingo "" were arriving daily in Puerto Rico, having - the statement alleged - fled from brutal persecution by the "" red mob "", whose activities the provisional Government had not prevented. The union added that both its own General Secretary and other high-level officers of the free and democratic trade union movement were being persecuted and turned out of their employment by the "" mobs ""; and also that the Sugar Corporation had been handed over to a political party so that only members of the party could obtain employment there.
.In its reply of  October  the Government transcribes the observations of the",0,1966,Dominican Republic
131,"Ministry of Labour on the request made by the Independent Union of Labourers to the President of the Republic for compensation for damage suffered by the union. According to the Ministry, since many persons had suffered losses owing to the civil war, the provisional Government had established a Commission for War Damage Compensation, which had been carefully examining and assessing all such complaints; the Independent Union of Labourers should therefore send its complaint of damage to the Commission.
.As regards the alleged constant violation of the International Labour Conventions, the Government states that these allegations are untrue.
.As regards the allegations concerning the damage suffered by the Independent Union of Labourers, it is difficult to appreciate, on the basis of the information provided by the complainants, to what extent this question is related to the exercise of trade union rights in the precise sense of that term. In any case the Government states that there is a commission specially established to examine all complaints such as that put forward by the Independent Union of Labourers. For the above reasons the Committee considers that these particular allegations do not call for further examination on its part.
.As for the allegations of violation of the International Labour Conventions, the Committee observes that they are expressed in very general terms and that the complainants do not make any precise statement as to which of the Conventions are at issue. The Government replies that these allegations are unfounded.
.Nevertheless, the Committee notes that the Government has not sent its observations on the following: (a) the assassination of trade unionists, the destruction of trade union "" bases "" and the other acts of persecution alleged by CONATRAL in its letter of  February ; (b) the acts of pressure on CONATRAL and the terrorist attack on that organisation's headquarters which are alleged by O.R.I.T in its letter of  February ; and (c) the circumstances which have obliged many trade union officers to leave the country, the acts of persecution and personal violence against the General Secretary of the Independent Union of Labourers and other officers, and the discrimination in respect of employment alleged to be practised by the Sugar Corporation (matters raised in the letter from the Independent Union of Labourers dated  May ). Accordingly, before continuing its examination of the case, the Committee considers it necessary to ask the Government to be good enough to furnish its observations, as a matter of urgency, on the allegations with which the present paragraph deals.",1,1966,Dominican Republic
132,".The complaint of the Latin American Confederation of Christian Trade Unionists (C.L.A.S.C.) is contained in a communication dated  August  and that of the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions in a communication dated  August . On  August  I.F.C.T.U sent a new communication containing additional information. After these had been forwarded to it, the Government sent its replies on  November  and  March . The allegations before the Committee relate especially to the provisions of the existing legislation and to their application in practice.
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee notes that the case involves two aspects of the same problem, which derives fundamentally from the legislation in force in the Dominican Republic respecting collective disputes and strikes. One is the criminal aspect and the other is the purely industrial aspect, though both are closely related.
.With regard to the industrial aspect the Committee points out that on a previous occasion it was called upon to examine the legislation of the Dominican Republic on collective labour disputes and the right to strike) Notwithstanding certain amendments to that legislation, the Committee notes that the rules applied are basically the same. On that occasion the Committee had felt that the cumulative effect of the various provisions applicable in this matter, especially the provision that a trade union must, before declaring a strike, satisfy the government authorities of the economic character of the dispute, a provision which may well become indistinguishable in practice from a requirement of prior government authorisation, amounts to a denial of the right to strike, and for that reason recommended the Governing Body to draw the Government's attention to the desirability of its giving further consideration to the matter.
.On the other hand, with a view to stating still more clearly its observations on the relevant legislation, the Committee finds it necessary to point out that, under section  of the Labour Code, one of the requirements to be satisfied before a strike may be declared is that one of the parties to the dispute has not appointed arbitrators after the administrative conciliation procedure. In such event, according to section , the arbitrators may be nominated ex officio, i.e. a dispute may be taken to arbitration in any case. However, as section  seems to imply, a strike declared after the commencement of arbitration proceedings would be illegal. On the other hand, according to section , the award, once given, has the effect of a collective agreement and its application is compulsory. Taken together, these provisions may be interpreted as absolutely prohibiting the right to strike.
.The Committee has always maintained the principle that allegations respecting the right to strike are within its competence in so far, but only in so far, as they affect the exercise of trade union rights and has pointed out on a number of occasions that workers and their organisations are usually granted the right to strike as a legitimate means of defending their occupational interests. In this connection the Committee has emphasised the importance it attaches, where strikes are prohibited or are subject to restrictions, in essential services, to the establishment of adequate safeguards to protect the interests of the workers, who are thus deprived of an essential means of defending their occupational interests, and has pointed out that such restrictions should be accompanied by adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures, in which the parties concerned may participate at every stage, and that the awards given should in all cases be binding on both parties. The Committee explained in this connection that these principles do not apply to the absolute restriction of the right to strike, but to the restriction of that right in the essential services or in the civil service, in which case adequate guarantees should be provided to safeguard the interests of the workers s
.The Committee observes that in a report sent by the Government of the Dominican Republic on the application of Convention No.  it is stated that all the requirements and formalities which the Labour Code imposes on trade unions before a strike may be declared are purely for the information of the Secretariat of State for Labour, which allows them to use its good offices in an endeavour to achieve a settlement through conciliation, and that the requirements are never laid down with the idea that the Secretariat should come to any kind of decision as to whether the workers do in fact wish to strike or not, or as to the nature of the strike, such decisions falling exclusively within the competence of the labour courts. The Government adds that there has been no case where workers have been restricted in their freedom to determine whether or not to strike, although they have been notified on many occasions that they must follow the procedure laid down in the Labour Code if the strike is to be declared lawful.
.The Committee feels that the legal provisions cited seem to admit of the interpretation that it is possible to prohibit the exercise of the right to strike in all cases by declaring a strike illegal, even though this is done by a court. It is also possible that the existence of seemingly contradictory provisions respecting the right to strike might give rise to uncertainty.
.The Committee accordingly recommends the Governing Body to draw the Government's attention once again to the desirability of re-examining the provisions governing strikes in the light of the considerations set forth in paragraphs  and  above, so as to establish sufficiently simple and speedy procedures prior to a strike and thereby ensure that workers are not, in practice, deprived of one of the essential means at their disposal for furthering their demands.
.With regard to the criminal aspect of this case the Committee notes that, under the legislation in force, persons found guilty of promoting an illegal strike are liable to imprisonment for a period between  days and six months, as prescribed in Act No. . In this connection the Committee notes that, according to the information furnished by the Government, the persons concerned were sentenced for offences under this Act only, and that fines were imposed having regard to substantial extenuating circumstances.
.The Committee therefore recommends the Governing Body, while noting that the accused persons are not being detained and that they have merely been fined, to draw the Government's attention to the fact that the restrictive nature of the provisions governing strikes and the possible consequence of the procedure to be followed before a strike may be declared appear to make it possible for strikers to be liable in all cases to penal sanctions, which would imply a violation of the provision of Convention No.  that "" the law of the land shall not be such as to impair, nor shall it be so applied as to impair, the guarantees provided for "" in the Convention (Article , paragraph ), and especially the right of workers' p organisations to "" organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes "" (Article ).
.In all the circumstances, while reaffirming the principle that allegations respecting the right to strike are within its competence, in so far-but only in so far-as they affect the exercise of trade union rights, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the Government's attention once again to the desirability of re-examining the provisions respecting strikes in the light of the considerations set forth in paragraphs  and  above, so as to establish a simplified procedure prior to the declaration of a strike and thereby ensure that the workers are not deprived in practice of one of the essential means at their disposal for furthering their demands;(b) while noting that the accused persons are not being detained and that they have merely been fined, to draw the Government's attention to the fact that the restrictive nature of the provisions governing strikes and the possible consequence of the procedure to be followed before a strike may be declared appear to make it possible for strikers to be liable in all cases to penal sanctions, which would imply a violation of the provisions of Convention No.  that "" the law of the land shall not be such as to impair, nor shall it be so applied as to impair, the guarantees provided for "" in the Convention (Article , ), and especially the rights of workers' organisations to "" organise their paragraph administration and activities and to formulate their programmes "" (Article ).",0,1964,Dominican Republic
133,".The Committee examined this case previously at its meetings held in November , November  and May , when it submitted to the Governing Body the interim reports contained in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, paragraphs  to  of its th Report and paragraphs  to  of its th Report respectively.,
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), as well as the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.It was alleged that Mr and Mrs. Monegro, General Secretary and Secretary respectively of the National Dominican Confederation of Workers (FOUPSA-CESITRADO), had been compelled to leave the country.
.When it examined the case at its meeting in May , the Committee observed that there was a discrepancy between the statements of the complainants - namely that Mr and Mrs. Monegro were compelled to go into exile - and the observations sent by the Government, according to which they had left the country voluntarily.
.The Committee therefore recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to be good enough to inform it whether Mr and Mrs. Monegro were now in the country and at liberty or free to return there or, if not, to specify the nature of the alleged offences and whether court proceedings had been taken against them.
.This request for information was sent to the Government in a letter dated  June , to which the Government replied by a communication dated  August .
.In this communication the Government states firstly that no legal action has ever been taken against Mr and Mrs. Monegro. It goes on to state that the couple are again living in the country and that Mrs. Monegro has been employed since  March  in the Community Development Office of Santo Domingo.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that no purpose would be served by further examination of this aspect of the case.
.The complainants further alleged that the workers' leaders, Hctor Porfirio Quezada, Julio Anibal Garcia Dickson and Alberto Laracuent, had been murdered in the large sugar producing centre of La Romana.
.As the Government had not answered this allegation, the Committee, at its meeting in May , recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to furnish its observations on this subject.
.In its communication of  August  the Government makes the following statement: "" The disappearance of the workers' leaders, Hctor Porfirio Quezada, Julio Anibal Garcia Dickson and Alberto Laracuent, remains a mystery to the Dominican legal authorities since it occurred in , that is to say during the Trujillo rgime, when the trade union federations which have submitted the complaint did not exist.""
.The Committee notes the Government's statement that its investigations have thrown no light on the fate of the above-mentioned persons. Considering nevertheless that the events to which the allegations in question refer took place too long ago for a continued investigation to serve any useful purpose, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.
.The complainants also alleged that trade union leaders Rodolfo Sessman and Luis Polivio Padilla had been arrested and imprisoned.
.At its meeting in May  the Committee, noting that the Government had not made any observations on this aspect of the case, recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to furnish its observations and, in particular, to specify the position of Rodolfo Sessman and Polivio Padilla with regard to the law.
.In its communication of  August  the Government states that the persons in question are free and that "" they are in no way being persecuted under the rule of law prevailing in the country "". The Government indicates that Mr. Polivio Padilla has been a workers' representative on the State Sugar Council since this organisation was set up in July .
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.
.The complainants alleged lastly, in somewhat vague terms, that a "" yellow "" trade union had been set up by the municipal authorities of the National District and that the Government supported the Dominican Confederation (CONATRAL), the leaders of which were alleged to be the only ones to enjoy any safeguards.
.As the Government did not answer these allegations, the Committee, at its meeting in May , recommended the Governing Body to ask the Government to furnish its observations thereon.
.In its communication of  August  the Government states that the workers of the National District are workers like any others and that it is not true that the municipality operates a "" yellow "" trade union. It also asserts that it is totally untrue that the Government has a preference for any particular trade union.
.The Committee notes that the Government's statements are only countered by the complainants with very general allegations, lacking in specific facts. Consequently, considering that the complainants have not produced proof of their allegations, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide, for the reasons indicated in paragraphs  and , ,  and , and  above, that the case as a whole does not call for further examination.
.The Committee examined this case previously at its meetings held in November  and November , when it submitted to the Governing Body the interim reports contained respectively in paragraphs  to  of its th Report and paragraphs  to  of its th Report. Both reports were approved by the Governing Body.
.By a communication dated  March  the Government supplied additional observations concerning this case.
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its th Report the Committee submitted to the Governing Body its conclusions concerning some of the allegations made. With regard to the examination of the allegations remaining in suspense, while the Committee had taken due account of the fact that a change of Government had occurred in the Dominican Republic in the meantime, it considered that in order to be able to reach valid conclusions on those aspects, it would have to ask the new Government to supply certain additional information which it specified in paragraphs  (c) and (d) of the th Report, subsequently approved by the Governing Body.
.Paragraph  (c) of the th Report invited the Government to answer the allegations to the effect that Mr and Mrs. Monegro had been compelled to leave the country in order to preserve their freedom. According to a complaint dated  January , Mr. Monegro, the General Secretary of the National Dominican Confederation of Workers (FOUPSA-CESITRADO), had been transferred by the police after several days to the Embassy of Mexico under a safe conduct order from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in order to seek asylum but under orders to leave the country. Mrs. Monegro, Secretary of the Confederation, was also called upon to leave the country and was listed as a person to be refused re-entry to the country.
.In paragraph  (d) of the th Report the Government was requested to send its observations concerning various other allegations among those on which no observations had been received from the previous Government.
.In its communication of  March  the Government stated that, as regards the complaint concerning Mr and Mrs. Monegro, it had been ascertained that the circumstances complained of were in no way connected with trade union activities but with the fact that these persons had committed acts contrary to public order which constituted common law offences punishable under the Penal Code, and that they had evidently sought diplomatic asylum in order to escape possible legal proceedings. The fact that the diplomatic asylum sought did not receive official approval in due and proper form, for example by the granting of a safe conduct, showed the unlawful and unmotivated nature of the actions committed by Mr and Mrs. Monegro.
.The Government deplored the fact that events which took place during a period of subversion resulting in a state of civil war and anarchy, under circumstances in which it was utterly impossible to continue to ensure individual rights and safeguards, should have given rise to the complaints in question. The situation in which the Dominican Republic found itself during that period was grave enough to be known all over the world, and the Government hoped that the Committee on Freedom of Association would take this into account in considering the explanations it was submitting.
.In earlier cases the Committee has taken the view, when it has had before it allegations relating to violations of trade union rights by an earlier Government, that although the Government in power could obviously not be held responsible for events which took place under its predecessor, it",0,1963,Dominican Republic
134,"is clearly responsible for any continuing consequences which they may have had since its accession to power.
.In the present case the Committee notes what the Government says concerning the situation obtaining in the country at the time the complaints were presented, which was some time ago; while it recognises that some or all of the allegations whose examination is still pending may in the meantime have become out of date, it feels bound to repeat the request previously made by the Governing Body to the Government for detailed observations and all the information the Government considers relevant, so as to enable the Committee to determine whether the allegations still in suspense are founded in fact or not.
.As regards the allegations concerning Mr and Mrs. Monegro, the Committee notes that there is a discrepancy between the statements of the complainants-namely that these persons were compelled to go into exile-and the observations sent by the Government, according to which Mr and Mrs. Monegro left the country voluntarily. However, the Committee wishes, in order to complete the information available to it on this aspect of the case, to ask the Government to inform it as soon as possible whether Mr and Mrs. Monegro are now in the country and at liberty, or whether they are free to return to the country and, if not, what are the offences with which they are charged and whether court proceedings have been taken against them.
.As regards the other allegations concerning which no answer was ever received from the Government, the Committee would be grateful if the Government would send as soon as possible its observations and detailed information concerning: () the alleged murder of three trade union leaders, Hctor Porfirio Quezada, Julio Anibal Garcia Dickson and Alberto Laracuent, with the outcome of any legal action undertaken to elucidate the facts; () the present position before the law of the trade union leaders Rodolfo Sessman and Luis Polivio Padilla; and () the alleged establishment of a "" yellow "" trade union by the municipal authorities of the National District and alleged discrimination against all trade union organisations other than the Dominican Confederation, CONATRAL, whose leaders are alleged to be the only ones to enjoy any safeguards.
.In these circumstances, with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the allegations concerning the exile of Mr and Mrs. Monegro, to request the Government to be good enough to furnish as soon as possible the additional information requested in paragraph  above;(b) as regards the other allegations remaining in suspense, to request the Government once again to furnish as soon as possible the observations and detailed information requested in paragraph  above;(c) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will report further to the Governing Body after receiving the additional observations and information requested from the Government in subparagraphs (a) and (b) above.
.With regard to the case as a whole the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to decide, for the reasons set forth in paragraphs  and  above, that the allegations relating to the arrest of the trade union leader Henry Molina and the raiding and closure of the premises of the National Dominican Confederation of Workers (FOUPSA-CESITRADO) do not call for further examination;(b) to decide, with regard to the allegations concerning the murder of the trade union leader Benito Acevedo, to take note of the information furnished by the Government and at the same time to express its regret that the investigation has not led to a concrete result;(c) to request the Government to be good enough to reply to the allegation that the two trade union leaders Mr and Mrs. Monegro have been obliged to go into exile in order to preserve their freedom;(d) with regard to the other allegations set forth in paragraph  above, to request the Government to be good enough to furnish its observations as soon as possible;(e) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will report further to the Governing Body when it has received the additional information requested in subparagraphs (c) and (d) above.
.The complaints by the Autonomous Confederation of Christian Trade Unions (C.A.S.C.), the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unionists (C.L.A.S.C.), the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions (I.F.C.T.U.) and the International Federation of Public Service and Postal Employees' Unions are contained in communications sent directly to the I.L.O and dated respectively ,  (two) and  November . Two complaints were sent by the National Dominican Confederation of Workers (FOUPSA-CESITRADO), one by its General Secretary (in exile) dated  January  and the other by its President dated  March . The C.A.S.C sent a new communication on  April . All these communications were transmitted to the Government, whose observations dated  June  have been received.
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.As regards the case as a whole the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to take note that Mr. Miguel Soto is no longer in prison, to draw the attention of the Government to the restriction of the exercise of trade union rights that may arise from the preventive detention of leaders concerning whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found, and to request the Government to take steps to ensure that authorities have appropriate instructions in order to eliminate this danger;(b) to call the attention of the Government to the importance that the Committee attaches to the guarantee of due legal process when trade unionists are accused of offences of a political nature or of common law crimes, and to the fact that the granting of his freedom to a trade unionist on condition that he leaves the country is not compatible with the free exercise of trade union rights; and to request the Government as soon as possible to send its observations on the position of Mr. Henry Molina in view of the urgent nature of this part of the case, and also on the legal position of Mr and Mrs. Monegro and the possibilities they have of returning legally to the country;(c) to reaffirm the principles set forth in paragraph  above and to request the Government to furnish its observations on the allegations concerning the raiding and closure of the premises of the National Dominican Confederation of Workers (FOUPSA-CESITRADO) and in particular on the present de facto and de jure position of that organisation;(d) to request the Government, in view of the lack of direct information from it concerning the other allegations referred to in paragraph  above, which relate to matters considered as urgent under the procedure in force, to furnish its observations thereon as speedily as possible, and, in particular, in respect of the alleged murder or detention of the trade union leaders named;(e) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will report further to the Governing Body when it has received the additional information requested.",0,1963,Dominican Republic
135,".The Committee examined this case earlier at its sessions of February , May  and February  s, when it submitted to the Governing Body certain recommendations concerning a first series of allegations and provisional conclusions concerning new allegations presented in  by the National Federation of School Teachers (FENAMA). Concerning the allegations pending, the Committee requested the Government and the complainant organisation to furnish certain additional information, the nature of which is indicated in paragraphs  and  of the th Report approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (March ).
.By a communication dated  May  the Government replied to this request for additional information.
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.Up to the present no reply has been received from the complainant organisation to the request for additional information made in a letter dated  March  and repeated in another letter dated  June .
.As for the allegations pending (see paragraph  above), the Committee notes that the Government has repeatedly and formally denied what was maintained by the complainants, although it admitted that perhaps the Secretary of State for Education might not have received the representatives of FENAMA on the occasion referred to in the complaint but that if this had been the case it was only due to lack of time.
.On the other hand, the information received from the Government shows that FENAMA omitted to deposit its Constitution and another document, the existence of which should not be difficult to prove since it is the text of a government resolution adopted by decree. In this case the Government recognises that the resolution has been taken. As for the Constitution, its simple transmission appears to be a requirement of form, frequently imposed in such cases, which in itself would not give rise to a problem of freedom of association unless it were proved that the transmission of the Constitution was subject to a condition, the nature of which was such as to impair the exercise of trade union rights. This would be the case, for instance, if the contents of the Constitution were subject to the discretionary approval of the authorities. In fact, Article  of Convention No. , which has been ratified by the Dominican Republic, lays down that workers' organisations have the right to draft their Constitutions and rules and that public authorities shall refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof. The Committee, as also the ILO Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, has pointed out in this respect that this right appears, unfortunately, to be considerably restricted in certain countries where, it would appear, Constitutions have to be submitted for prior approval to the authorities, whose power of decision does not seem to be restricted by any particular standard. It should be pointed out that in spite of the declaration of the Government, according to which approval of the Constitution is not a condition for obtaining or retaining legal personality, section  of Act No.  contains a provision on the approval by the Executive of any change in the Constitution.
.The Committee lacks the information which would enable it to judge whether or not this implies that at some stage in the creation of associations such as FENAMA the Constitution itself has to be approved. However, in the present case, the statements of the Government show that the formality omitted consisted in the simple transmission of the Constitution.
.The complainant organisation has failed to supply the Committee with information that might lead to the view that FENAMA's lack of legal personality is attributable to some restriction of freedom of association.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body, subject to the principles and considerations set out in paragraphs  and  above, to decide that the allegations pending in this case and consequently the case itself do not call for further examination.
.The Committee previously examined this case at its sessions in February  and May . On the latter occasion it submitted to the Governing Body a new interim report, contained in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, which was approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session (May-June ).
.In the report referred to, the Committee made certain recommendations on a first series of allegations, but postponed reaching conclusions on other allegations made in  by the National Federation of Schoolteachers (FENAMA) while awaiting more detailed observations from the Government.
.The Government replied in a letter dated  October , which was received too late for the Committee to examine it at its session in November .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee also requests the complainant organisation to furnish additional information on its Constitution, affiliated organisations, number of members and any other information which it considers relevant concerning its present situation.
.In these circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) in respect of the general question of the right of workers in the service of the State to organise, to draw the attention of the Government to the considerations set out in paragraphs  and  above;(b) in respect of the specific allegations made in this case, to note that the Committee has decided to request the Government and the complainants to provide certain additional information specified in paragraphs  and  above, respectively;(c) to take note of this interim report, on the understanding that the Committee will submit a new report when it has received the additional information mentioned in the preceding subparagraph.
.When the Committee last examined this case at its February  session it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body in paragraphs  to  of its nd Report, which was approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session (May-June ).
.In a communication dated  January  the National Federation of Schoolteachers (FENAMA) made fresh allegations relating to the case. The text of this communication was transmitted to the Government by a letter dated  March .
.The Government has forwarded certain observations by a communication received on  April .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In order to be able to make its conclusions in full knowledge of all the facts, the Committee considers that the Government should be given a further opportunity to supply more detailed observations on these allegations.
.In these circumstances, with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the allegations made in  concerning the dismissal of  union leaders as a measure of reprisal against the National Federation of Schoolteachers:(i) to express its disappointment at the fact that, notwithstanding the repeated requests made in this connection, the Government has failed to supply detailed observations on this point;(ii) to emphasise once again the importance it attaches to the standard in Article  of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), ratified by the Dominican Republic, to the effect that workers shall enjoy adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment;(b) with regard to the allegations made in  concerning new measures of interference and discrimination against the National Federation of Schoolteachers, to request the Government to be good enough to supply detailed observations in respect of the allegations referred to in paragraphs  to  above;(c) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will report again when it has received the detailed observations referred to in clause (b) of this paragraph.
.The original complaint made by the National Federation of Schoolteachers (FENAMA) appears in a telegram dated  July  to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights (New York), which was forwarded to the I.L.O. When the complainants were informed of their right to send additional information in support of their complaint they furnished a note contained in a memorandum dated  August .
.These communications were forwarded to the Government of the Dominican Republic, which replied in a note couched in general terms; this note was remitted to the Secretary-General of the United Nations on  September  by the Permanent Representative of the Dominican Republic to that organisation. The note was then forwarded to the I.L.O. At its th Session (November ) the Committee on Freedom of Association decided to adjourn its examination of the case to its next meeting, and requested the Government to be good enough to forward directly to the I.L.O its detailed observations on the specific allegations. In a communication dated  December  the Government",0,1963,Dominican Republic
136,"forwarded its reply concerning those allegations directly to the I.L.O, and the Committee proceeded to an initial examination of the case at its th Session (February ). On  January and  February  the Government transmitted further communications.
.The Dominican Republic has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their memorandum the complainants assert that the Government had openly given support to a parallel trade union organisation, and had been present at the installation ceremony of the Executive Committee of that organisation, but had not granted FENAMA the interviews it had requested although FENAMA is a majority organisation with  affiliated organisations. FENAMA then appealed by letter to the President of the Republic and explained the situation in which the teaching profession found itself and also submitted a number of claims. The only reply the President gave was to appear on television making statements discreditable to FENAMA. According to the complainants the Government issued an order for the discharge of several teachers and the headmaster of a secondary school, contrary to the guarantees of security of employment granted to the teaching profession by the National Constitution, the Education Law and the Ordinance of the National Council of Education. The President's reply to FENAMA's claims was merely to accuse FENAMA of political activity without making any reference whatsoever to its complaints, in which it protested about political pressure exercised on teachers by provincial governments and the party authorities. The aim of the Government had been that of replacing the schoolmasters by persons loyal to the Dominican Revolutionary Party. Attached to the complaint of the complainants is a resolution adopted by a trade union requesting that this political interference in the teaching profession should cease, together with excerpts from the National Constitution, the Education Law and a circular issued by the Secretariat of State for Education, Fine Arts and Worship, which states that before a person is appointed as a teacher the responsible provincial government should be consulted. Finally the letter containing the memorandum states that as a measure of reprisal  FENAMA leaders were dismissed from their posts.
.The note from the Permanent Representative of the Dominican Republic to the United Nations merely points out that the Government was acting in accordance with Constitutional precepts when it carried out sanctions against  national schoolmasters for having organised an illegal strike largely for political reasons. In the Government's reply dated  December , it is stated in general terms that a satisfactory solution has been found to the problems which gave rise to the complaints made by FENAMA, that both Dominican schools and teachers are given the proper attention which their merits call for, and that consequently there is no reason to continue the dispute.
.To sum up, the complainants assert that for political reasons the services of several members of the teaching profession were terminated in order to substitute for them adherents of a particular party, that the Government openly gave support to a rival trade union organisation and discredited the complaining organisation, and that furthermore reprisals were taken against  leaders of that union who were dismissed from their posts.
.The Committee considered at its th Session that the charges concerning dismissal of teaching staff for political reasons, and interference by the party authorities in the teaching world contrary to the security of employment of schoolteachers guaranteed by national legislation, constituted a problem which was not within its province. This was not the case, however, as regards the allegations concerning dismissal of FENAMA leaders as a measure of reprisal and the allegations according to which the Government has favoured a particular trade union organisation while discrediting the complaining organisation, whose petitions it neither answers nor heeds.
.Indeed, the Committee has always upheld the principle that workers should enjoy adequate protection against all acts of discrimination tending to impair trade union freedom in respect of their employment, as laid down in Article  of Convention No. . The reply of the Government in regard to the allegation that  leaders of FENAMA were dismissed from their posts is somewhat vague. The note from the Permanent Representative of the Dominican Republic to the United Nations refers to sanctions taken against  schoolteachers because of a political strike. The Government's note dated  December  merely indicates in general terms that all problems relating to the teaching profession have been solved. The Committee considered consequently that the information forwarded by the Government was not sufficiently precise to enable it to reach a conclusion on this case, and requested certain additional information.
.As regards the alleged interference by the Government in the sense of favouring the other rival trade union organisation and discrediting FENAMA, and of not hearing its complaints, the Government had not forwarded any observations. In view of the importance the Committee attaches to the principle embodied in Article  of Convention No. , ratified by the Dominican Republic, a principle which states that "" Workers' and employers' organisations shall have the right ... to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes "" and that "" The public authorities shall refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof "", the Committee requested the Government to be good enough to furnish more detailed information on this aspect of the case.
.By a communication transmitted to the I.L.O on  January  the Government referred to this matter, but confined itself to stating very tersely that in the opinion of the Secretariat of State for Education and Fine Arts there had been no violation of trade union rights as far as FENAMA was concerned. In its note dated  February  the Government states that it "" maintains normal relations with FENAMA and that nothing impedes or interferes with the carrying out of the programmes of that Federation "".",0,1963,Dominican Republic
137,".The complaint by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions is contained in three letters, dated respectively  July ,  October  and  January . These are analysed below.
.With the first of these letters the I.C.F.T.U transmitted the text of a resolution on the Dominican Republic adopted by its Executive Board in July . In this resolution the Executive Board, "" taking note ... of the suppression of the free labour movement and lack of adequate social legislation and protection "" in the Dominican Republic, reaffirms its determination to fight for the restitution of trade union freedom and other democratic rights suppressed by the tyranny of Trujillo and calls on its affiliates to join in a world-wide campaign of protest. The General Secretary of the I.C.F.T.U would study the possibility of making a complaint to the International Labour Office on the violation of trade union rights and also the possibility of proclaiming a boycott of the Dominican Republic. The second letter, dated  October , contains the text of the complaint itself. According to this document, Rafael L. Trujillo forcibly seized the Presidency of the Dominican Republic on  August  and installed an authoritarian rgime which deprived the Dominican people of all fundamental freedoms, including freedom of association ; since that date, the Dominican people have lived under a rgime characterised by absolute control over all the activities of the country; the workers are subject to continuous repression and are obliged to swear fidelity to the President of the Republic, as actually occurred in a public ceremony on  May .
.The complaint continues to the following effect : according to an Act of  July  a trade union organisation can function only if it has been recognised by the Ministry of Labour, to which a request for registration must be addressed; the Labour Code-known as the Trujillo Labour Code - provides, in section , that the Secretariat of State for Labour may forward to the persons concerned the documents required for the establishment of the union, including the rules, and point out any defects in these documents ; section  provides that registration of the union shall be refused if any of the required conditions are not fulfilled. These provisions show, the complaint goes on, that the trade unions are dependent on the Government, and this dependence is proved also by the following facts : there are two kinds of trade union leaders, some being not even union members but officials of the rgime (provincial governors, etc.) whom the law has made responsible for trade union duties ; the others are members of the unions, elected according to the instructions of the party in power ; this party has a political monopoly and constitutes a single entity with the Government : the trade union leaders elected according to its instructions should therefore be regarded as public officials ; trade union congresses are organised by officials of this party, and they indicate the subjects for discussion ; when a trade union wishes to call a strike it must notify the Secretariat of State for Labour, giving its reasons, and the strike may not be called until two weeks after this notification ; the trade union must prove that the strike has for its exclusive object the settlement of an economic dispute (section  of the Code). Other provisions of the Labour Code, the complainant argues, also show lack of freedom : section  prohibits trade unions from directly or indirectly restricting freedom to work, and this constitutes interference in the operation of the unions ; section  prohibits trade unions from dealing with political questions ; section  permits cancellation of registration by decision of the courts, and dissolution of the union, if it engages in activities not connected with its lawful objectives ; lastly, section  requires previous approval by the Department of Labour before collective agreements can become applicable. There is therefore no doubt that freedom of association does not exist in the Dominican Republic. On the one hand, there are legislative provisions restricting freedom of association ; on the other hand, the existing trade unions are not authentic, the so-called Dominican Confederation of Labour being an instrument used by President Trujillo to dominate the working class. The complainant therefore urges the Governing Body to request the Government of the Dominican Republic to re-establish the autonomy of the trade unions in relation to the executive authorities and eliminate all interference in trade union activities ; the sections of the Labour Code mentioned in the complaint should be amended, and the Government of the Dominican Republic should be reminded of the obligations assumed by it as a Member of the International Labour Organisation.
.In its third letter, dated  January , the I.C.F.T.U states that the action for which provision was made by the Governing Body when it adopted the conclusions of the Committee on the previous case regarding the Dominican Republic-Case No.  -has not materialised. The complainant organisation then recapitulates the various stages in the examination of Case No.  and particularly the question of the Government's invitation-subsequently withdrawn-to send a mission which would study "" the practical application of the legal provisions concerning freedom of association in force in the Dominican Republic "". The Committee on Freedom of Association, the letter continues, deplored the Government's refusal to give its consent to the sending of this mission and took note of the assurances given by the Government to the following effect-that workers' organisations could not be suspended or dissolved by administrative action, that there was nothing to prevent the Confederation of Dominican Workers from affiliating with an international organisation, and that the Government intended to ratify the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) ; moreover, the Committee emphasised how important it was that the provisions guaranteeing free exercise of trade union rights should be effectively applied. The I.C.F.T.U further refers to the assurances given at that time by the Government of the Dominican Republic ; it expresses "" the disappointment and regret of the free trade union movement "" at the attitude of the Government of the Dominican Republic in refusing to receive an I.L.O mission and attaching no value to the assurances given to the I.L.O; it also calls attention to the delay in ratifying Convention No. . The letter adds : "" Although the Government has given the I.L.O the formal assurance that in the Dominican Republic freedom of association exists, is exercised and is respected, the workers may in fact adhere only to trade unions approved by the Government, whose leaders are not elected freely by the workers and do not therefore represent them "".ANALYSIS OF THE REPLY
.In its letter of  November  the Government of the Dominican Republic said that a study of the complaint made it clear that this referred not only to labour questions but also to questions of an indubitably political character. The Government might have abstained from any rebuttal as regards the latter questions because they lay outside the terms of reference of the Committee on Freedom of Association. The Committee on Freedom of Association, the Government continued, had already had occasion to pass judgment, in a manner extremely satisfactory to the rgime of the Dominican Republic, on a similar complaint, also submitted by the I.C.F.T.U. ; in the light of this previous judgment by the Committee the position of the I.C.F.T.U was no longer tenable, because the Dominican legislation on which the Committee based the conclusions of its Fifth Report remained in force today ; this fresh complaint by the I.C.F.T.U could be explained only by its ignorance of the findings in the Fifth Report of the Committee, or by an intention on its part to act as an instrument of political interests extraneous to the objectives of the International Labour Organisation.
.The first allegation, the reply went on, was that the laws of the Dominican Republic infringed freedom of association because a trade union could function only if it had been "" recognised "" by the Secretariat of State for Labour, which might return the prescribed documents to the persons concerned ; on this point the Committee on Freedom of Association had already given a ruling, in favour of the present legislation, in its Fifth Report. The I.C.F.T.U mentioned the Act of  July , but this had been repealed by section  of the Labour Code another point which the Committee had certified in its Fifth Report. The registration referred to in sections  and  of the Code was a mere administrative formality, chiefly intended to enable legal personality to be accorded to trade unions ; hitherto, not a single case of refusal of registration had occurred. Provision for a similar formality was to be found in the legislation of many I.L.O member States, as was pointed out in the report of the Committee on Freedom of Employers' and Workers' Organisations (McNair Committee), submitted to",0,1956,Dominican Republic
138,"the Governing Body at its st Session (March ).
.The second allegation of the I.C.F.T.U referred to the trade union leaders who were stated to be government officials at the same time ; this allegation was based on an error and an untrue statement of fact. The provisions attributing trade union functions to certain public officials-those of Act No.  of  May -had been repealed many years ago, as the Committee had recognised in paragraph  of its Fifth Report. The third allegation, regarding the lack of freedom of the Confederation of Dominican Workers, also proceeded from imaginary facts. The Confederation of Dominican Workers held congresses every two years in accordance with its own rules, and the agenda of these meetings consisted of trade union matters ; many of the aspirations proclaimed at these congresses had been converted into legislation for the benefit of the working class. Political parties, political leaders and members of the armed forces did not intervene in any way in these congresses.
.As regards the allegations dealing with exercise of the right to strike - i.e. that the union must inform the Secretariat of State for Labour of its reasons for deciding to call a strike this was an aspect of the dispute which should be examined in the light of the sovereign rights of the State. The Dominican Republic had a political rgime established by the free will of its people. In virtue of sovereign Constitutional powers the Executive, when issuing the Trujillo Labour Code, had considered that it was indispensable to afford absolute autonomy to trade union organisations, but that it was not appropriate to the vital interests of the country for such organisations to be able to engage in political activities. Such a view had been confirmed by experience in some other countries, where trade union organisations really operated on behalf of causes contrary to public peace. The limitation imposed by Dominican legislation on the activities of trade unions in no way infringed the independence to which they were legitimately entitled. In other words, a trade union as a legal person could not engage in political activities, but this rule in no way prevented the members of the union as natural persons from freely entering the political field. The right to strike was recognised, but in regulating this right the Legislative Power had thought fit to restrict its exercise to cases of economic dispute. These regulations had not been the object of any observation in the Fifth Report of the Committee on Freedom of Association. The restrictions had been imposed in virtue of sovereign Constitutional powers and of the elementary duty of every government to ensure the maintenance of public peace. The prescribed waiting period between notification and declaration of a strike, and the rule that only the courts of law may appreciate the character of a strike, did not involve an infringement of trade union rights. The I.C.F.T.U had also pointed out that the trade unions were prohibited from directly or indirectly restricting freedom to work, alleging that this was an interference in the operation of trade unions. Such an allegation was quite unspeakable. Freedom to work was an essential attribute of the individual laid down in the Constitution of the Dominican Republic. A law which permitted trade union organisations to restrict this fundamental freedom would be in flagrant conflict with the highest Constitutional principles. Every worker, whether a trade union member or not, was free to engage in the activity which was most attractive to him or best suited his interests ; this freedom was guaranteed by the Labour Code, which prohibited employers from exerting influence over workers to induce them to join or refrain from joining trade unions ; and section  of the Code expressly made it illegal for any person applying for employment to be required to enter or refrain from entering a trade union. These safeguards were in conformity with the standards of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, , which had been ratified by the Dominican Republic on  June . The same principle had been laid down in a special resolution adopted by the International Labour Conference at its th Session. As already recognised by the Committee in the Fifth Report, Dominican legislation gave trade union organisations all the safeguards required by these international instruments. Trade unions could not establish political relations with political parties, nor could the Government seek to obtain the political co-operation of the unions. Similarly, prohibitions were to be found in the legislation of many of the States Members of the I.L.O, as had been indicated in the report of the Committee on Freedom of Employers' and Workers' Organisations. Special reference should be made to the case of Cuba, whose legislation prohibited trade unions from engaging in political activity, because the Cuban Workers' Confederation had been "" the evident instigator of the I.C.F.T.U's complaint "".
.The I.C.F.T.U also alleged that the legislation of the Dominican Republic violated freedom of association because it permitted registration of a trade union to be cancelled by the courts, followed by dissolution of the union, if it engaged in activities not connected with its lawful activities. The only obligation of States Members of the I.L.O was to guarantee complete independence to the trade unions so that they might perform the functions proper to them ; it was no infringement of this independence to prohibit engagement in activities foreign to the said functions. To sanction the cancellation of a union's registration if it pursued improper objectives was a normal course, provided the cancellation was ordered as the result of a judicial and not of an administrative procedure. This was, moreover, the rule specified in Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, , which had been ratified by the Dominican Republic.
.The last allegation by the complainant organisation referred to collective agreements. As it was necessary to handle this question in a manner varying with national conditions, no uniform international standards had been adopted on the subject. Article  of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), only stated that, where necessary, appropriate measures should be taken to encourage and promote the full development and utilisation of machinery for voluntary negotiation. Every collective agreement must have regard to the rules of public order, introduced to protect the workers' rights. Therefore, before a collective agreement was put into effect and even during its currency, the administrative authorities must exercise supervision thereover. The intention of the previous approval required by section  of the Trujillo Labour Code was only to make it possible to ascertain whether a draft agreement was or was not contrary to the current rules of public order. Similar provisions applied in many other countries belonging to the I.L.O. Furthermore, refusal to grant approval was subject to appeal to the courts of law.
.The Government closed its first communication by referring to the conclusions of the I.C.F.T.U's complaint. The complainant, as such, must bring proof of what it alleged. It had not done this. Dominican legislation surrounded freedom of association with full safeguards and the autonomy enjoyed by the trade unions was in no way infringed. Such a situation had been reached by legislative action and by the personal initiative of Generalissimo Trujillo. The Government did not claim that its legislation was perfect, but it did emphatically state that this legislation embodied the legitimate aspirations of the working class. Proof of this was the ratification of Convention No. , as reported by the Committee on Freedom of Association in its Sixth Report.
.In its second letter dated  January  in reply to the I.C.F.T.U's communication of  January , the Dominican Government stated that the complaining organisation had not adduced any new evidence but had merely recapitulated a case which the Committee on Freedom of Association had already dealt with. The only new feature was the proposed procedural measures which could only be justified once the Committee had passed on the substantive question, and not before. The complainant organisation, the Government concluded, was not pursuing any constructive designs in preferring its charges, its sole aim being to secure, for obviously political reasons, a verdict detrimental to the Dominican Government. The I.C.F.T.U itself admitted that the Government had ratified the international Conventions on freedom of association, and to say that such ratification had come lately did not obscure the fact that the principles given international recognition in those Conventions had been the law of the land in the Dominican Republic ever since . The Government therefore considered that the Committee should not proceed with the case "" owing to the clearly political character of the complaint "", coupled with the lack of evidence to support the charges.
.In all the circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to decide, subject to the reservation made in paragraph  above, that the allegations relating to recognition of trade unions, the subordination of trade unions to the Government,",0,1956,Dominican Republic
139,"the cancellation of the registration of trade unions and the dissolution of these unions, relate partly to legislation which the Governing Body has already found in Case No.  was repealed in  and partly to legislative provisions which the Governing Body found in Case No.  to be satisfactory, subject to employers and workers being able in actual practice to form and join organisations of their own choosing in full freedom ; so far as the allegations relating to the latter legislation are concerned, there are no allegations of fact concerning the manner in which it has been applied submitted in the complaint;(b) to note that both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ) have now been ratified by the Dominican Republic and that the other allegations concerning failure to give effect to the recommendations made by the Committee in Case No.  are too vague to call for further examination ;(c) with regard to the prohibition on political activity by trade unions, to draw the attention of the Dominican Government to the fact that section  of the Labour Code admits of interpretations incompatible with the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, , ratified by the Dominican Republic, and to the fact that the application of Act No.  of  June  to employers' or workers' organisations might also be incompatible with the Convention, and to draw this matter also to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations ;(d) to decide that the allegations relating to freedom not to associate examined in paragraphs  and  above do not call for further examination ;(e) to draw the attention of the Dominican Government to the importance which the Committee attaches, in cases in which strikes are prohibited in essential occupations, to ensuring adequate guarantees to safeguard to the full the interests of the workers thus deprived of an essential means of defending occupational interests ;(f) to note that the cumulative effect of all the various provisions set forth in sections  to  of the Labour Code, including in particular the provision that a trade union must before calling a strike satisfy a government authority of the economic character of the dispute-a provision which may well become indistinguishable in practice from a requirement of government authorisation prior to calling a strike-amounts to a denial of the right to strike, and to draw the attention of the Government to the desirability of its giving further consideration to the matter ;(g) as regards the provisions of the Labour Code requiring previous approval by the authorities of collective agreements, to draw the attention of the Dominican Government to Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, , and Article  of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, , both ratified by the Dominican Republic, and to the desirability of its giving further consideration to this question, and to draw the matter also to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.",0,1956,Dominican Republic
140,".The Governing Body will remember that the examination of these complaints has passed through several stages.
.At its th Session (Geneva, - March ), the Governing Body considered that the case called for further examination. The Governing Body also decided that the Government of the Dominican Republic should be afforded an opportunity to discuss with the Committee on Freedom of Association the various questions raised in the complaints before the Committee formulated any further recommendations on the subject.
.At its meeting on  May , the Committee heard Mr. Franco Franco, representative of the Dominican Republic, and took note of his statement to the effect that the Government consented to the sending of an I.L.O Mission and confirmed the invitation which had been addressed to the Director-General by the Confederation of Dominican Workers.
.This statement was confirmed by a letter dated  June  from the representative of the Dominican Republic to the Chairman of the Committee. This letter was as follows:
.At its th Session (May-June ), the Governing Body approved the conclusions reached by the Committee after it had heard the representative of the Dominican Republic. These conclusions were as follows:
.The Director-General, by a letter dated  July , communicated the decisions of the Governing Body to the Government of the Dominican Republic. The text of this letter was as follows:By a telegram dated  May  you were good enough, in response to the request which I had made to you in my letter No. TUR. - of  March , to appoint His Excellency Dr. Franco Franco as representative of your Government to discuss with the Committee on Freedom of Association the points contained in the complaints alleging infringements of trade union rights in the Dominican Republic.His Excellency Dr. Franco Franco was heard by the Committee on Freedom of Association on  May . Subsequently, he wrote to the Chairman of the Committee, on  June , informing him that your Government would be most pleased to welcome an I.L.O Mission for the purpose, in response to the invitation given by the Confederation of Dominican Workers, of examining objectively the situation as to the freedom accorded to trade unions, the social protection enjoyed by the workers and the work which has been achieved in the social field during a period of  years in the Dominican Republic.At the conclusion of its examination of the case, the Committee submitted to the Governing Body the recommendations which are contained in its Fifth Report (paragraphs  to ), a copy of which is enclosed. In particular, I would draw your attention to subparagraph  of paragraph , in which the Committee recommended the Governing Body to authorise the acceptance of the invitation received from the Dominican Government. This report, to which, you will observe, is appended the whole text of the statements made to the Committee by the representative of the Government of the Dominican Republic, was approved by the Governing Body on  June , during the course of its th Session.In accordance with the decision taken by the Governing Body, I have the honour to inform you that I should be happy to accept the invitation which you have been good enough to extend to me through His Excellency Dr. Franco Franco, and, on the conditions decided by the Governing Body, to send a Mission to the Dominican Republic to study the practical application of the legal provisions concerning freedom of association in force in your country.The Governing Body asked me, in this connection, to request you to be good enough to give me an assurance that every facility will be granted to the Mission in order to enable it to fulfil its mandate, that it will be permitted to make all necessary contacts for this purpose and that, on its return, it may submit a report to the Governing Body which may be published.I have no doubt that you will be in agreement with these proposals and, when you have kindly informed me accordingly, I shall not fail to communicate with you again with reference to the composition of the Mission,and the date on which it might visit your country.I am convinced that the sending of such a Mission to the Dominican Republic cannot fail to contribute greatly to the strengthening of the ties which exist between your country and the International Labour Organisation.
.On  November , Mr. Peynado, representative of the Dominican Republic, informed the Director-General that the Government of the Dominican Republic was not disposed to receive a Mission from the I.L.O, the sending of which might have the appearance of being a consequence of the complaint now pending before the Committee on Freedom of Association. The views of the Government of the Dominican Republic were embodied in a memorandum which Mr. Peynado handed to the Director-General during the conversation, and the text of which is as follows:The Government of the Dominican Republic has entrusted its diplomatic representative in Berne with the duty of informing the International Labour Organisation, through the Director-General, of its firm point of view with regard to an untruthful accusation submitted for examination to the Committee on Freedom of Association, which has given rise to a plan to send a commission of investigation to the national territory. The salient facts in this matter are as follows:Following the presentation of a complaint made by Dominican political agitators residing abroad alleging that restrictions are placed on freedom of association in the Dominican Republic, the Director-General invited the Government of this country to send a representative to the meeting of the Committee on Freedom of Association which had been called upon to examine and give a decision on the complaint in question. In his letter of invitation to the Dominican Government, the Director-General gave the text of a recommendation made by the Committee and approved by the Governing Body to the effect that, with reference to the case concerning the Dominican Republic, the Governing Body should give the Government an opportunity to discuss with the Committee the points raised in the discussions before the Committee made any recommendations on the case to the Governing Body. The recommendation added, and this must not be forgotten, that the Committee hoped that these discussions might result in the Government concerned indicating steps which it is taking or would be prepared to take to give effect to the principle of freedom of association.Out of deference for the Organisation and being anxious to respond favourably to the invitation made by the Director-General, the Dominican Government, without delay, entrusted the duty of representing it to His Excellency the Ambassador Tulio Franco Franco, being convinced that it would be easy for him to demonstrate to the Committee the lack of basis of this slanderous complaint and its ill-concealed political design and, at the same time, to inform the Committee as to the present legal situation with regard to freedom of association in the Dominican Republic. It also appeared to be a favourable opportunity to put the Committee on its guard against the danger of finding itself becoming involved in this political manoeuvre which might create a most unfortunate precedent. The Government also intended to take advantage of this opportunity to enable it by a more direct approach to make those responsible for the direction at the highest level of the I.L.O aware of the progress achieved in the Dominican Republic with regard to the protection of the workers, thanks to the industrious and continuous activity of the Government and thanks also to the fruitful lessons drawn from close contact for many long years with the I.L.O.Contrary to all expectations and in spite of the fact that the representative of the Government was able to demonstrate to the Committee why the complaint was irreceivable, both through its own defects and through defects in the procedure followed the matter has been allowed to develop until, as will be shown subsequently, it has given rise to a serious misunderstanding which must be cleared up.The Confederation of Dominican Workers felt that it should invite the I.L.O to send to the Dominican Republic a delegation chosen by the latter in order to obtain information on the spot as to the achievements attained in various fields of labour activity and of workers' protection. Having been informed of the step taken, the Ambassador made it known to the I.L.O that such a visit, for the purpose mentioned above, would certainly have the approval of the Government which has every reason to be proud of the social work which, without ignoring the manifold problems with which it had to cope, the Government has succeeded in achieving within the space of a few years in a young country in the full tide of development and without any previous experience of social affairs. The communication made by the Dominican representative gave rise to an erroneous impression that the Government of the Dominican Republic had addressed an official invitation to the I.L.O to send a commission of investigation to study on the spot the practical",0,1950,Dominican Republic
141,"application in the country of the legal provisions respecting freedom of association and that the invitation had been issued as a consequence of the decisions taken by the Committee with respect to the complaint referred to above. In these circumstances, it is necessary to clarify the situation as follows:(a) It is with the keenest regret that the Government of the Dominican Republic finds it necessary to state that at no time has it addressed any invitation either to the Committee on Freedom of Association or to any other I.L.O body to send such a commission to its territory.(b) Whatever may be the decision adopted or to be adopted by the Committee on Freedom of Association with regard to the despatch of such a Mission or of a Mission in consequence of the complaint already referred to, it cannot in any way be binding upon the Government of the Dominican Republic as this country has not ratified Convention No.  concerning freedom of association. Consequently, the Dominican Government is not bound to accept any of the obligations which may result from ratification of international instruments dealing with this question.(c) The Dominican Republic wishes to emphasise once again that the sending of a representative to the meeting of the Committee must be regarded as a mark of courtesy to the Organisation and to its Director-General ; it does not mean in any way that it intends to encourage the malevolent actions of persons moved and blinded by political passion.The Government did its duty by giving information as to the present situation and with regard to its legislation respecting freedom of association. Likewise, it in no way failed to give the necessary assurances. In these circumstances, it had a right to hope that more credibility would be attached to the statements made by its delegate than to untruthful allegations made by persons whose earlier activities, being illegal, have been punished according to the law.(d) In the opinion of the Government of the Dominican Republic, the decisions adopted by the Committee on Freedom of Association in the present case and also the procedure which has been followed in order to reach these decisions are vitiated because they are null and void. In this connection it must be emphasised yet again that Convention No. , which may form the basis for the procedure which has been instituted, has not been ratified by the Dominican Republic and, consequently, cannot validly be applied to the present case. Furthermore, it may be useful to point out that one of the reasons for non-ratification of the said Convention is the fact that the certified Spanish copy requested from the I.L.O by the Government has not yet been received, with the result that its consideration by the competent authorities and any decisions which might be made with respect to the Convention have been delayed.(e) The attitude of the Dominican Government has been and will be that it will not interfere in any way in connection with the visit of any I.L.O commission organised as a consequence of and in the spirit of the initiative taken privately by the Confederation of Dominican Workers ; but the Government will never allow any commission to come to make investigations in its territory in connection with a complaint emanating from offenders who have been judged guilty of acts which endangered internal peace and the external security of the Republic and is even less disposed to allow it when, in order that such a visit may be made, the request for guarantees addressed to the Government is not free from prejudices and vexatious reservations which the Government of the Dominican Republic regards as inadmissible.(f) From the beginning, the Dominican Government considered, and its point of view has not changed, that the matter had been brought before the I.L.O under such irregular circumstances that, once this was explained, the rejection of the complaint and the suspension of the procedure would necessarily follow. But, even if the matter was not to develop as expected, the Government knew that it could go beyond the recommendation of the Committee by stating what it had already accomplished and not what it intended to do to ensure freedom of association according to the request made to it. The Dominican Government is astonished, moreover, by the fact that the I.L.O has already announced, without strict adherence to the true facts, that a commission of investigation, that is to say, a commission of an entirely different character from that proposed by the Confederation of Dominican Workers, would visit the country; this announcement was made even before the I.L.O had received the Government's reply to the request addressed to it by the I.L.O for its authorisation with respect to the publication of the information which the said commission might assemble. It is on the basis of these facts that the Government feels that it can only note with the deepest regret the lack of impartiality and responsibility with which this affair has been pursued against a Member which has never failed to demonstrate its adherence and fidelity to the International Labour Organisation.(g) The Dominican Government is happy to reiterate the formal and absolute assurance given to the I.L.O that, in the Dominican Republic, both under the Constitution and under the Trujillo Labour Code, the principles governing the application of which in the field of activities regulated by it are based on the Constitution, freedom of association exists, is exercised and is respected as it deserves. The Government is firmly convinced that this assurance in itself will be sufficient to provide a criterion on the basis of which the I.L.O can judge this case and, consequently, will be led to the conclusion that it must reject the unjust and baseless accusation on which it is founded.(h) In view on the foregoing considerations, the Dominican Government, having confidence in the spirit of justice and high understanding of the directive organs of the I.L.O, evidence of which other Members in similar circumstances had had the satisfaction of observing, repeats its demand that the complaint which forms the basis of this complaint, and the nature and objects of which are known to everyone, should be rejected.Geneva,  November .
.A further communication was subsequently received from the Dominican Government in the form of a report on Dominican legislation and practice concerning the questions dealt with in the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, , presented by the Dominican Government on  January  in accordance with Article  of the I.L.O Constitution. The text of this report is as follows:
.Under the rgime instituted by the Constitution of the Republic, which guarantees freedom of association as one of the inherent rights of man, industrial associations both of workers and of employers have developed in our country in complete freedom and in harmony with the essentially democratic character of our Government.Promulgated on  October , the Trujillo Labour Code, the crowning development in our labour legislation, lays down in its Fifth Book complete and uniform legal rules determining the organisation and operation of industrial association, in full conformity with the provisions of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention (No. ), this Convention, while it has not yet been ratified by our Government, is in fact applied in full under our legislation, having regard to the economic and social characteristics of our people.It should be pointed out that the procedure for ratifying this Convention has been initiated in anticipation of the receipt of the authentic Spanish text requested by our Government from the International Labour Office.The articles of the Trujillo Labour Code which are related to the provisions of the unratified Convention No.  and the measures adopted by our Government to improve the social conditions of the workers and the protection accorded by the Government to all registered industrial associations have created in our country an atmosphere which is favourable to the development of trade union activities in general.
.A brief analysis is given below of the provisions in the Labour Code which give effect to the provisions of the unratified Convention No. .The Code, while it is adapted to the characteristics of the Dominican people, is inspired by the universal principles enunciated by the International Labour Organisation. It includes a series of provisions which give full effect to Convention No.  concerning freedom of association, although that Convention has not yet been ratified by our country.As an example we analyse below the articles in the Trujillo Labour Code which are related to the Articles of the unratified Convention No. :Article  of the ConventionThis Article in the Convention embodies the principle that workers should freely constitute their organisations, subject only to the condition that the members shall conform to the rules of those organisations. This same principle is formulated in our legislation by articles  and  of the Trujillo Labour Code:Article . Industrial unions may be formed by persons who habitually follow the same occupation or business, or an",0,1950,Dominican Republic
142,"allied occupation or business, irrespective of the undertaking for which they work.Article . Employers' associations may be formed by employers who pursue the same or similar activities.Article  of the ConventionThis Article deals with the right which workers and employers should have to draw up their Constitutions and rules in full freedom without any interference.The guarantee prescribed by this Article of the Convention is ensured by articles  and  of our Code:Article . Industrial associations may prescribe in their rules further conditions in addition to those prescribed by the law for the admission of members.Article . All industrial associations shall be completely free to establish in their rules the manner of dismissing members. All decisions taken in this respect by the organs and officials of the association in conformity with its rules shall be final and shall not be subject to any appeal.Article  of the ConventionThis Article prohibits the dissolution or suspension of workers' and employers' organisations by administrative authority. The same principle is embodied in our legislation by articles  and  of the Code:Article . The rules may establish special grounds for the dissolution of the association.Where the rules do not contain any provisions for dissolution, the general meeting may decide on dissolution.Article . The registration of the association may be cancelled by a decision of the courts if the association pursues activities not connected with its lawful objectives.Cancellation of registration shall automatically entail dissolution of the association.It is evident from these two articles that our legislation provides for only two methods of dissolution or suspension of workers' and employers' organisations, namely : dissolution by agreement and dissolution or suspension by the courts. In other words, there can be no dissolution or suspension by the administrative authority.Article  of the ConventionThis Article establishes the right of workers' and employers' organisations to establish federations and Confederations. The same right is embodied in article  of our Code, which provides that:Article . Industrial associations shall be permitted to form communal, provincial, regional or national federations.Such federations shall be permitted in their turn to form Confederations on the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the members at a general meeting.Article  of the ConventionThis Article provides that the provisions of Articles ,  and  apply to federations and Confederations of workers' and employers' organisations. This provision is in fact applied by articles  (in fine) and  of the Code:Article . The provisions applying to industrial associations in general shall also apply to all federations and Confederations.Article . All federations and Confederations of industrial associations shall be subject to the rules respecting registration prescribed for industrial associations by this Code.Article  of the ConventionThis Article, which deals with the legal personality of workers' and employers' associations, is applied by virtue of article  of the Code:Article . All industrial associations shall by virtue of registration with the Secretariat of State for Labour acquire legal personality.Consequently, they shall have the right to sue and be sued, to acquire without administrative authorisation, either by gift or against payment, personal or real property and shall in general be entitled to perform any legal act or business having for its object the attainment of the objectives of the association.Article  of the ConventionThis Article establishes the principle that workers and employers and their respective organisations shall respect the law of the land. The same principle is affirmed by article  of the Code, which provides:Article . No industrial association shall directly or indirectly restrict the freedom to work or take any steps to compel any employee or employer to be a member of the association or to remain therein.Article  of the ConventionThe application of the guarantees provided for in Convention No.  to the armed forces and the police appears to be incompatible with the neutrality, impartiality and security which should characterise these institutions with respect to social and political matters.Article  of the ConventionThis Article, which defines the meaning of the term "" organisation "" in the Convention, corresponds to article  of our Code:Article . An "" industrial association "" shall mean any association of employees or employers constituted in accordance with this Code for the purpose of the study, advancement and protection of the common interests of its members.With respect to collective labour agreements, the Trujillo Code contains complete and detailed regulations in its articles  to . Articles , ,  and  indicate the role and duties of trade unions with respect to collective labour agreements.With respect to the procedures applicable where necessary, with regard to co-operation between employers' and workers' organisations, reference should be made to Part I of Book VI of the Trujillo Labour Code concerning the settlement of economic disputes.
.(a) As is apparent from the foregoing, the national legislation was amended during  in order to give effect to all the provisions of Convention No. , which, up to the present, has not been ratified by our country. This amendment of the earlier legislation, with a view to giving effect to Convention No. , is precisely the amendment made by the Trujillo Labour Code, which came into force on  October .(b) The ratification of Convention No.  presents no difficulty for our country which could prevent or delay such ratification. On the contrary, as indicated above, the Convention has already been put into application through our national legislation.(c) The reply to this question is apparent from the foregoing survey.
.Reports concerning the application of Convention No.  are always communicated to the Federation of Dominican Workers and to the Employers' Confederation of the Dominican Republic.
.The Committee, having noted the memorandum presented by Mr. Peynado, and having noted also a communication from the Director-General giving the date on which six separate despatches of copies of the Spanish version of the text of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, , were made to the Government of the Dominican Republic, and having noted, further, the report presented by the Dominican Government concerning the position under its national legislation and practice with regard to the matters dealt with in the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, , has reached the following conclusions.
.The Committee deplores that the Government of the Dominican Republic has refused to give its consent to the sending of a Mission under the conditions stipulated by the Governing Body at its th Session (May-June ), whereas it appeared evident from the letter sent by its representative on  June  to the Chairman of the Committee that the Government not only endorsed the invitation issued to the I.L.O by the Confederation of Dominican Workers but had also expressed its own willingness to receive the Mission. The Committee expresses its regret that the Government of the Dominican Republic has considered it necessary to retract the statement made by its representative to the Committee on Freedom of Association to the effect that it would be prepared to receive a Mission to study the practical application of the legal provisions in force with respect to the right to organise.
.The Committee notes that the provisions in the Constitution and in the Labour Code of the Dominican Republic at present in force with respect to the right of association and other fundamental liberties appear to be satisfactory. At the same time, the Committee wishes to emphasise the importance that it attaches to the fact that workers and employers should in actual practice be able to form and join organisations of their own choosing in full freedom.
.The Committee notes the formal assurance given by the Government of the Dominican Republic that workers' organisations may not be suspended or dissolved by administrative action. It also notes that the provisions in the Labour Code at present in force with respect to the suspension and dissolution of trade union organisations offer to those concerned all the guarantees afforded by normal judicial procedure. The Committee nevertheless wishes to emphasise the importance it attaches to the fact that these provisions should be fully applied.
.The Committee notes the assurance given by the Government of the Dominican Republic that there is nothing to prevent the Confederation of Dominican Workers from affiliating with an international organisation of workers. Here again, the Committee wishes to emphasise the importance that it attaches to the fact that no obstacle should be placed in the way of the affiliation of workers' organisations in the Dominican Republic, in full freedom, with any international organisation of workers of their own choosing.
.The Committee notes the assurance given by the Government of the Dominican Republic that it will take steps without delay with a view to ratifying the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, , and expresses the hope that the Government will be able to give effect rapidly to this intention in order thus to ensure to the workers the permanent guarantee of the free exercise of trade union rights.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that",0,1950,Dominican Republic
143,"the foregoing observations should be communicated to the Government of the Dominican Republic.
.The Governing Body will remember that, at its th Session (Geneva, - March ), it took the view that the case concerning the Dominican Republic called for further examination (of. First Report of the Committee on Freedom of Association, paragraphs  to , and Third Report of the Committee, paragraph ). The Governing Body further decided that the Government of the Dominican Republic should be afforded an opportunity to discuss with the Committee on Freedom of Association the questions at issue before the Committee submitted further recommendations on the subject to the Governing Body (of. First Report of the Committee, paragraph ).
.By a letter dated  March , the Director-General informed the Government of the Dominican Republic of the Governing Body's decision and requested the Government to be good enough to appoint a representative who might be heard by the Committee at its third session.
.By a telegram dated  May , the Government of the Dominican Republic accredited His Excellency, Mr. Franco Franco, Ambassador of the Dominican Republic in Paris, as its representative to the Committee on Freedom of Association.
.The representative of the Government of the Dominican Republic made his statement to the Committee at its meeting on  May . The text of this statement is appended to the present document.
.The Committee, having taken note of the statement of the representative of the Dominican Republic, and having heard his oral explanations, came to the following conclusions concerning the various points at issue.Receivability of the Complaint
.The Government of the Dominican Republic in the first place contested the receivability of the complaint, both in its letter of  January  to the Director-General and through its representative to the Committee on Freedom of Association.
.In support of its contention the Government of the Dominican Republic puts forward the following arguments in particular:(a) the Dominican persons in exile are not qualified to present the complaint because they are not representatives of trade unions but political agitators who have been convicted of crimes or offences under ordinary law. As concerns two of the signatories to the complaint, the Government maintains that they have never exercised trade union functions but that they were members of proscribed political parties and had been convicted of crimes against the security of the State. As for the two other signatories to the complaint, the Government, while admitting that they were at one time trade union leaders, claims that they were relieved of their functions by their own constituents and, consequent upon abuses of their functions committed to the detriment of the members of the trade unions of which they were leaders, were sentenced for these abuses by the courts of ordinary law.(b) if-continues the Government of the Dominican Republic-the original complaint thus has a fundamental defect, the same is necessarily true of the complaint transmitted by the Inter-American Confederation of Workers (today the Inter-American Regional Organisation). The representative of the Government of the Dominican Republic admitted, however, that the question might take on a different aspect if the Inter-American Confederation of Workers had taken the complaint upon itself.
.The Governing Body decision establishing the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission deals in the following terms with the question of receivability of complaints:The only complaints receivable, with the exception of those officially transmitted to the I.L.O by the General Assembly of the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations, are those which come either from organisations of workers or employers or from Governments.
.The Committee on Freedom of Association, at its first session, and in the terms which will be recalled below, formulated its views on the question of receivability of complaints, which views the Governing Body made its own in adopting the First Report of the Committee on Freedom of Association
....Questions sometimes arise as to whether a particular complaint is to be regarded as having been made by an organisation of workers or employers. More particularly, it is sometimes suggested that persons purporting to act on behalf of such an organisation are not entitled to do so because the organisation has been dissolved or because the individuals lodging the complaint have ceased to be resident in the country concerned. The Committee considers that it would be altogether inconsistent with the purpose for which the procedure for the examination of allegations concerning the infringement of trade union rights has been established for it to admit that the dissolution or purported dissolution of an organisation by governmental action extinguishes the right of the organisation to invoke the procedure.
.Difficult questions may arise in such cases concerning the exact authority and knowledge of the facts of the persons claiming to act on behalf of the organisation concerned and the reliability of the testimony of persons no longer resident in the country concerned. The Committee will be prepared to consider such questions on their merits as necessary, but it will not regard any complaint as being irreceivable simply because the Government in question has dissolved or purported to dissolve the organisation on behalf of which the complaint is made, or because the person or persons making the complaint have taken refuge outside the country concerned. In taking this view it has been influenced by the conclusions unanimously approved by the Governing Body in  in the Labour Party of the Island of Mauritius Case when considering a representation under Article  of the Constitution of the Organisation (then Article ). In the Mauritius Case the Governing Body laid down the principle that it would exercise its discretion in deciding whether or not a body is to be regarded as an industrial association for the purpose of the Constitution of the Organisation and will not consider itself bound by any national definition of the term ""industrial association"". The Committee proposes to follow the same principles when considering the receivability of complaints which come before it.
.With respect more particularly to the case of the Dominican Republic, the Committee, having noted that the complaint was presented not only by the four Dominican persons, but also by the President of the Inter-American Confederation of Workers in the latter's name, reached the conclusion at its first session that, for this reason, the complaint was receivable, whether the objections raised against the qualifications of the Dominican persons in exile signatories to the complaint were justified or not.
.After careful examination of the new arguments presented by the representative of the Dominican Republic, the Committee maintained its previous decision for the reason that the Inter-American Confederation of Workers had not restricted itself to pure and simple transmission of the complaints of the four Dominican persons in exile, but had formally taken the matter over.
.In his letter of  October  to the Director-General, Mr. Bernardo Ibez did, in fact, state that:in his capacity of President of the Inter-American Confederation of Workers and Member of the Governing Body of the I.L.O, he wished to add his own request to the Governing Body of the I.L.O to study the above-mentioned request at its earliest opportunity and to submit it to the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Committee on Freedom of Association.
.Since the Inter-American Confederation of Workers (now succeeded by the Inter-American Regional Organisation) is clearly a workers' organisation within the meaning of the Governing Body decision establishing the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission, the Committee recommends to the Governing Body that it decide that the complaint is, for this reason, receivable, whatever the validity of the objections raised against the authors of the first complaint.Alleged Political Nature of the Complaint
.The Government of the Dominican Republic maintained, in the second place, that the complaint was purely political in nature, since the complainants were ""politicians in exile"" whose ""attitude has always been to stir up revolt within and without the Dominican territory "". The representative of the Government of the Dominican Republic specified that at least two of the signatories had been convicted of having taken part in the so-called Cayo Confites naval and military expedition of .
.For their part, the complainants have alleged-without, however, presenting any shadow of proof in support of their assertion-that one of the signatories to the complaint, residing in Cuba, had been kidnapped and probably murdered ""by the Dominican Government in order to deprive the working class of its principal leader and the Dominican people of one of its most active champions of democracy"".
.The Committee considered that these two sets of data were not within the competence of the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission on Freedom of Association and that it was not called upon to examine their merits.Allegations concerning the Suppression of the Free Trade Union Movement
.These allegations bear both on the legal status and on the factual situation of the Trade Unions.
.It will be recalled that the complainants alleged the following facts in particular:(a) The General Confederation of Dominican Workers was forcibly suppressed in . A demonstration protesting this measure was dispersed by the police, and several persons were killed on this occasion.(b) Certain trade unions were able to reconstitute themselves subsequently, but were",0,1950,Dominican Republic
144,"placed under extremely strict governmental supervision. The Confederation of Dominican Workers alone, a factitious body in the service of the Government, was authorised.(c) A Decree of  June , instituting a ""Trade Union Day"", in fact placed the trade unions under the supervision of the administrative authorities.(d) Strikes occurring in  and in  were forcibly broken, and several trade union leaders were killed ; others were arrested and, after a year of imprisonment, interned in a village which they could not leave without authorisation from the Government ; yet others were obliged to seek refuge in an Embassy. From  to the present, the number of trade union leaders and of ordinary workers who have suffered a similar fate has steadily mounted.
.The Government of the Dominican Republic in its first reply, as well as the representative of the Government in his statement to the Committee, disputed the veracity of these allegations:(a) The Government did not dissolve the General Confederation of Dominican Workers in .(b) On the contrary, the Government, by a whole series of social welfare measures, has promoted the rise of the working class and of the trade union movement in particular. The proof of this is that many trade unions have been freely constituted in the various regions of the country and have affiliated themselves in the Confederation of Dominican Workers, which is the most representative organisation of workers and is entirely independent of the Government.(c) The Decree instituting Trade Union Day was rescinded in .(d) The Government limits itself to formally denying that strikes have been suppressed by violence and that reprisals were taken against leaders for their trade union activities alone.
.Finally, with respect to the legal status of trade unions, the Government emphasised that the Dominican workers have complete freedom under the legislation currently in force. The representative of the Government drew the attention of the Committee, on the one hand, to the provisions of the Constitution of the Republic guaranteeing freedom of association and, on the other, to the Labour Code of  June , a copy of which the representative submitted to the Committee on Freedom of Association.
.In examining the legal position of trade unions, the Committee therefore referred to the text of the Constitution, on the one hand, and to the Labour Code, on the other, which, by virtue of its Article , repeals all previous laws, including those concerning trade unions.Constitutional Guarantee of Freedom of Association
.Under the heading of "" individual rights "", Article , paragraph  of the Constitution promulgated on  January  recognises freedom of assembly for peaceful purposes as fundamental, inherent human rights.
.Paragraph  of the same Article guarantees individual security and, in this connection, provides as follows : No one may be imprisoned or have his liberty restricted without a written warrant stating the reasons therefor issued by the competent judicial official, except in the case of a person caught in the act of committing a crime. No sentence whatsoever may be passed on any person unless he has been given a public hearing and been duly summoned to attend such hearing. This provision, however, does not apply to cases within the competence of disciplinary tribunals. Any person deprived of his freedom must be brought before the competent court within forty-eight hours of his arrest, failing which he must be liberated. Every arrest ceases to have effect or is transformed into imprisonment in the forty-eight hours following the bringing of the person concerned before the competent court ; within the same period, the person concerned must be informed of the decision rendered to this effect. Any person deprived of his freedom without just cause or without the legal formalities prescribed having been observed or under any circumstances other than those laid down by law shall be liberated forthwith, either on his own demand or on the demand of any other person.
.Article  of the Constitution provides that the enumeration of the rights of the individual set forth in Article  is not limitative.
.In case of grave and imminent danger to national sovereignty, the Congress-the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate in joint session-may decree a state of emergency and suspend the guarantees of the individual mentioned in Article  of the Constitution, with the exception of those relating to the inviolability of human life. If the Congress is not in session, the President of the Republic may issue a similar decree ; he is obliged, however, to convene the Congress by the same measure, so that it may meet within ten days to decide whether the decree shall remain in force or be revoked. If this provision is not observed or if the Congress does not meet, the Presidential decree automatically ceases to have effect.
.In the event of danger to the public peace, the Congress is empowered, by paragraph  of Article  of the Constitution, to decree a state of siege and to suspend certain guarantees of the individual, including freedom of association and of assembly, freedom of travel and individual security, with the exception, however, of the guarantees relating to normal judicial procedure (Article , paragraph  (c) ). If the Congress is not in session, the President of the Republic exercises this power (Article , paragraph ).
.The Constitution may never be suspended or revoked by any power or authority, nor by popular acclamation. It may be amended only in accordance with the provisions laid down in the Constitution itself (Article ) ; no amendment may violate the political system, which must always be civil, republican, democratic and representative (Article ).
.Any law, decree, regulation or measure contrary to the Constitution is automatically null and void (Article ).
.It appears from the analysis of the above provisions that freedom of association is guaranteed by the Constitution and that this guarantee cannot be suspended except in the cases and subject to the conditions laid down in the Constitution itself. Moreover, any legislative or administrative measure contrary to the provisions of the Constitution is automatically null and void. It would appear, therefore, that any person who considers himself wronged by any such measure can bring his case before the courts.The Labour Code
.In order to judge of the importance of the new Labour Code of  June , one may examine the provisions relating to its scope which are contained in Title I of the Code and those relating to the status of trade unions contained in Title V.Scope of the Code
.The scope of the Code is determined by the definition of the word ""worker"" in its first article. According to its provisions, ""any physical person who furnishes material or intellectual service by virtue of a contract of labour "" is a worker. By reason of this very definition, the following persons are not considered as workers and do not, consequently, come within the scope of the Code:(a) persons exercising a liberal profession, unless they devote all their time to the exclusive service of a particular person ;(b) commission agents and salesmen ;(c) commercial representatives and travellers who do not work directly and exclusively for a single person; and(d) farmers and sharecroppers.In addition, the labour relations of public officials and employees are regulated by special laws. Certain categories of workers are subject to a special rgime. Thus, according to Article , the provisions relating to trade unions do not seem to apply to home workers. According to Article , the provisions of the Code are not applicable either to agricultural undertakings or to agricultural undertakings of an industrial nature or to stock-breeding or sylvicultural undertakings, if such enterprises do not employ more than ten workers. As for the maritime transport industry, it is for the Government to determine by means of regulations to what extent the provisions of the Code are applicable to sailors. Within these limits, the trade union rgime established by the Code applies to all workers, both manual and intellectual..It cannot, however, be deduced from the restrictions concerning certain categories of workers which are not covered by the Code that the latter are not granted the right of association by virtue of ordinary law in the matter of the rights of association in general.Trade Union Rgime.Under the terms of Article  of the Code, any association of workers constituted in conformity with the Code for the purpose of studying, promoting and defending the common interests of its members is a trade union. The trade unions must be registered by the State Secretariat of Labour (Article ), failing which their actions are null and void (Article .). The request for registration must be accompanied by the rules of the trade union, the record of proceedings of the constituent assembly, and a list of the founding members. The Secretariat of Labour may, within ten days, return the documents to the persons concerned, pointing out the corrections that may need to be made. Registration may only be refused in the two following cases:(a) if the statutes do not contain the essential provisions for the normal functioning of the association,",0,1950,Dominican Republic
145,"or if any of these provisions is contrary to the law; and(b) if any of the conditions required by the Code or by the statutes for the Constitution of trade unions are not met (Article ).
.It cannot, however, be deduced from the restrictions concerning certain categories of workers which are not covered by the Code that the latter are not granted the right of association by virtue of ordinary law in the matter of the rights of association in general.Trade Union Rgime
.Under the terms of Article  of the Code, any association of workers constituted in conformity with the Code for the purpose of studying, promoting and defending the common interests of its members is a trade union. The trade unions must be registered by the State Secretariat of Labour (Article ), failing which their actions are null and void (Article .). The request for registration must be accompanied by the rules of the trade union, the record of proceedings of the constituent assembly, and a list of the founding members. The Secretariat of Labour may, within ten days, return the documents to the persons concerned, pointing out the corrections that may need to be made. Registration may only be refused in the two following cases:
.The regulations concerning the operation of trade unions provided in Article  to  of the Code, to which the statutes of the trade unions must conform, are limited to specifying the essential conditions necessary to the normal operation of the trade union. In this connection, the Statement of Policy declares that the regulations concerning the organisation and operation of trade unions are based on those relating to joint-stock companies, subject, of course, to the modifications made necessary by the nature of trade unions.
.In commenting on the provisions of the Code relating to the Constitution of trade unions, the representative of the Government of the Dominican Republic told the Committee that registration may not arbitrarily be refused to trade unions which fulfil the conditions laid down by the Code. A trade union has the right to be registered. In case of dispute, recourse to the courts and, in the last resort, to the Supreme Court, is provided for.Purposes of Trade Unions
.The purposes of the trade unions, which are defined in a general way by Article  cited above (to study, promote and defend the common interests), are specified by Article , which assigns to them the following functions in particular : to study conditions of work ; to conclude collective agreements, defend the rights ensuing from them, and to revise the collective agreements in conformity with the provisions of the Code ; to settle economic labour disputes in equitable and peaceful fashion ; to improve conditions of work, life and production ; to study and prepare legislative reforms for the above purposes. This enumeration is not, however, exhaustive, for certain articles of the Code further provide the possibility for the trade unions to establish social and cultural services, mutual societies, etc. Furthermore, the Code recognises, in principle at least, the right to strike of the workers. It is, however, forbidden to the trade unions to intervene in political or religious questions.
.It would thus appear from the various provisions which we have analysed that the workers included in the scope of the Code are free to constitute organisations of their choice and to be members of them without previous authorisation:Operation of Trade Unions
.The Code contains no provisions empowering the administrative authorities to intervene in the activities of trade unions. Article  alone imposes on the trade unions the obligation to maintain certain records (membership list, inventory of movable and immoveable goods, daily record of receipts and expenditures, record of proceedings of the various trade union bodies), but it is solely incumbent on the competent justice of the peace to initial these records on their first and last pages.
.The Code, as noted above, has rescinded all previous regulations concerning trade unions including, consequently, any measure which, according to the allegation of the complainants, enabled the Government to intervene in the administration of trade unions. It seems, therefore, that the legislation currently in force is intended to ensure full autonomy to the trade unions.Dissolution of Trade Unions
.The dissolution of trade unions is regulated by Articles  and  of the Code ; according to the first of these provisions, a works union is automatically dissolved consequent upon the definitive closing of the undertaking for which it is constituted ; indeed, as it is constituted for the workers of a single undertaking, such a union has no further reason to exist if the undertaking itself ceases to exist. Under the terms of Article , the registration of a trade union may be voided by decision of the courts if the union engages in activities foreign to its legal purposes ; the voidance of the registration automatically entails the dissolution of the union.
.In connection with these provisions on the dissolution of trade unions, the representative of the Government of the Dominican Republic told the Committee that, apart from these cases, the Government does not have the right to void registration.
.It would seem from these articles that a union is not subject to suspension or dissolution by administrative action.Trade Union Federations and Confederations
.Articles  to  of the Code deal with trade union federations and Confederations. Under these provisions, the unions may form local, provincial, regional or national federations ; these federations may in turn form Confederations, subject to the condition that two-thirds of their members meeting in a general assembly declare themselves favourable. The federations and Confederations must be registered ; the provisions applicable to unions in general also regulate the federations and Confederations.
.It would appear that the Code ensures to workers' organisations the right to constitute federations and Confederations and to affiliate with them. This being so, it also seems that the legislation currently in force does not prevent the reconstitution of the former General Confederation of Dominican Workers, which was dissolved, according to the allegations of the complainants, in .
.The Code contains no provision respecting the affiliation of unions to international organisations. The representative of the Government of the Dominican Republic pointed out in this connection that Dominican law, being national law, cannot provide for such cases, but that it does not prohibit them. Failing a negative provision on this subject, employers' and workers' organisations do not thus appear to be deprived of the right to affiliate with such organisations.
.After having made a comprehensive analysis of the case and having noted the statements made by the representative of the Dominican Republic, the Committee reached the following conclusions, which it submits to the Governing Body:
.In denying that the four signatories of the complaint exiled from the country have any capacity as trade union representatives the Government considers that the complaint, emanating not from an organisation but from mere individuals, is not receivable. By the terms of the regulations governing the procedure, the only complaints receivable, with the exception of those officially transmitted to the International Labour Organisation by the General Assembly or the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations are those emanating either from workers' or employers' organisations or from Governments.
.The Committee has observed that the complaint was lodged not only by the four Dominican persons mentioned but also by the President of the Inter-American Confederation of Labour in the name of that organisation. It would appear, therefore, that on this ground alone the complaint is receivable whether the objections raised against the other signatories are justifiable or not. The fact that this organisation has since been dissolved and replaced by the Inter-American Regional Organisation of Workers, a regional organisation of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, does not, in the view of the Committee, affect the receivability of the complaint.
.Relying on the argument that the four Dominican signatories are "" politicians in exile, condemned by the courts "", the Government attributes a purely political character to the complaint. The Government states in particular: "" The attitude of these persons has always been to stir up revolt inside and outside Dominican territory and it is for this reason that the complaint which they have signed has a purely political character. "".
.In basing their complaint on the allegation that workers' organisations cannot exist or function freely, the complainants are submitting precise facts which, if proved, would make it impossible, seemingly, to reject the complaint on the ground that it is purely political in character, whatever the motive inspiring it may actually be.
.Basing their argument on a series of repressive measures directed especially against trade union leaders and on the fact that only a single central trade union organisation under the control of the Government is authorised, the complainants claim that workers in the Dominican Republic do not have the right to organise freely according to their own choice.
.Alleging, in the second place, that by virtue of a Decree of  January  existing organisations are placed under the control of the Government, the complainants claim that the",0,1950,Dominican Republic
146,"Government interferes in the administration of trade unions.
.Without attempting at this stage to examine in detail the legislation mentioned in the Government's reply, the Committee would point out that this legislation is evidence only of the present legal situation of occupational organisations and not of the factual situation which is the principal element in the complaint.
.So far as the allegations relating to the factual situation of trade unions are concerned, the versions of the events given by the complainants and by the Government differ fundamentally and, without a preliminary enquiry on the spot, it would no doubt be impossible to decide as to their respective merits.
.It would however appear from the analysis of the facts in issue that the complaint is sufficiently precise to make possible and desirable a more-detailed examination of the facts.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends that the case merits further examination by the Governing Body.
.Neither the Venezuelan Government nor the Dominican Government has been formally requested to indicate whether it would be willing to consent to reference of the matter to the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission. Under the procedure laid down by the Governing Body this question does not arise until the Governing Body itself has decided that the Government concerned shall be asked to give its consent to reference of the matter to the Fact-Finding Commission. Although both Governments have indicated in their preliminary observations on the complaints that they would not be willing to consent to such reference, the Committee does not consider that such a preliminary reply precludes the Governing Body from discussing further whether it is advisable to make a formal request to the Government concerned that it should consent to reference of a case to the Fact-Finding Commission. They venture to hope that in future cases the preliminary observations of Governments will not anticipate any request which the Governing Body may or may not think it appropriate to make after it has had an opportunity of considering the facts of the case and expressing its views. In respect of these cases the Committee suggests that the Governing Body should authorise it to afford an opportunity to the Governments concerned to discuss with the Committee the questions at issue before the Committee attempts to formulate any further recommendations on the subject for consideration by the Governing Body. The Committee ventures to hope that such discussion might result in the Governments concerned indicating steps which they are taking or would be prepared to take to give effect to the principle of freedom of association.Geneva,  January .",0,1950,Dominican Republic
