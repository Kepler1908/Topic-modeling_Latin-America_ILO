The President of the Republic, the Minister of Industry, Economy and Commerce and the Minister of Agricultural Development and Agrarian Reform had discussions with all the employers\' groups in the industrial, commercial and agricultural sectors. They have also met with the central labour organisations with a view to defining the framework of integration for the country\'s economic reconstruction. These meetings have led to the adoption of a series of political and legal guarantees of private enterprise activities, the creation of joint ventures funded by the State and the private sector, and the establishment of mechanisms allowing for ongoing consultation with the agents of national economic activity. The Government is of the opinion that these initiatives created a new atmosphere of confidence. Through its leader, Mr. Gurdian, the COSEP has recommended its affiliates to participate in all discussions and meetings with the governmental authority, with a view to looking for agreement and consultative formulae.\n.As regards lands confiscated from private employers, the Government states that the application of legal confiscation measures has been reduced since . In that year  properties were affected; this figure dropped to  in  and to only six in . In his address of  January  to the National Assembly, the President of the Republic announced that no more land would be confiscated, since a first phase of the agrarian reform has now been completed and the productive exploitation of the land redistributed to , farmer families must now be consolidated. According to the Government, the present land ownership structure is as follows: private property (large landowners, co-operatives, small and medium producers),  per cent; State sector,  per cent; uncultivated land,  per cent.\n.Within the national consultation process defined by the Government for , and in a perspective of economic reconstruction of the country once the war will have subsided, the President of the Republic has announced to the producers and entrepreneurs that a ""legal security"" would be granted on property, with a view to establishing a better atmosphere of mutual confidence and credibility. This atmosphere is illustrated by the fact that the Government and the private consortium Nicaragua Sugar have decided to settle their differences with respect to the control of the San Antonio complex. The Government has granted a realistic indemnity to the owners, as well as a series of guarantees and support measures to other businesses providing goods and services belonging to the same economic group.\n.The Government recalls in this regard that the Committee on Freedom of Association has decided several times that ""cases where legal standards on possession and ownership of land are challenged do not concern the exercise of union rights"".\n.As regards the closing-down of the news programmes ""The Nicaraguan"" and ""Seis en Punto"", the Directorate of Media of the Ministry of the Interior, by resolution of  January , has accepted a request for the resumption of these two programmes, after a re-examination of the cases under the legislation in force.\n.In its communication of  February , the Government states that in the framework of its systematic efforts to create a climate of coexistence and social harmony among all the economic sectors, which have intensified over the last few weeks, the authorities of the Ministry of Labour, led by the Minister, have requested the President of the Republic to give special attention to the circumstances and the present stage reached in the trial against Mr. Alegra with a view to examining a measure which, while respecting the national juridical order and the full independence of the powers of the State, would demonstrate in a concrete manner the Government\'s desire for conciliation. This was requested independently of any factors concerning Mr. Alegra\'s guilt. Identical steps have been taken in Mr. Guillermo Quant\'s case; he is also a member of COSEP and sentenced for spying. The Government will inform the Committee of any forthcoming decisions coming from the President\'s Office or from any other State powers. These will probably be able to be adopted in the next few days.\n.In its communication of  February , the Government states that Mr. Felipe Martinez, a CUS official, was released during the last week of January.\n.As regards tripartism, the Government announces that it is taking the necessary measures for the creation, in the month of March, of a special tripartite consultative commission. The first item it will have to deal with is the Convention on safety and health in construction which was recently adopted by the International Labour Conference.\n.As regards the elaboration of the Labour Code already referred to in its previous communications, the Government states that the labour authorities have, during the preparation of the new Code, given special importance to the legal guarantees and safeguards for the full exercise of freedom of association. The Government confirms that it will request the technical assistance of the Office.\n.Moreover, the Government adds that the Accords signed by the Heads of State of Central America on  and  February have enlarged the political framework necessary for a thorough study of a package of measures to enable the efficient realisation of national consultation, involving all sectors, for the economic reconstruction of the country. As a direct consequence of the Government\'s wish for peace and of the Accords in question, in the coming days a broad amnesty will be adopted which will cover the repatriation or homecoming of persons linked to the activities carried out against the nation. . In its communication of  February , the Government states that, on  February, the summit meeting of Central American Presidents adopted a series of Accords which will have profound repercussions on the solution of the various problems which have been the subject of allegations before the Committee. The measures affecting internal politics proposed by the Government to contribute to peace in the region cover the whole range of legal and economic relations between the different sectors of the country and the Government. Thus, the following measures - the amendment of the election laws, the revision of the laws concerning the communications media, the change in the composition of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal and the decision to hold at an earlier date the national presidential, legislative and municipal elections - constitute fundamental steps which have direct consequences on the natural contradictions and problems existing between the labour sectors and the Government, opening new avenues for consultation and comprehension between them. In these circumstances, the Government considers it important that the Committee suggest conciliation measures at this present jucture so that a reasonable delay be granted enabling an examination of the functioning of the Accords and their repercussion in the labour fields, at least until June , before proposing initiatives such as a commission of inquiry which would not in any way serve the reconciliation process, but would, on the contrary, introduce tension.\n.The Committee has noted the Government\'s replies to the various recommendations it made at its meeting in November , but must observe that these replies do not cover some of the most important points raised by the Committee.\n.Regarding the legal aspect of the cases before it, the Committee notes that the Government is currently preparing the modification of certain legislative provisions which had been the subject of comments by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations. The Government will keep the ILO informed of these amendments. In addition, the work already undertaken on the adoption of a new Labour Code is continuing. The Committee notes in particular that four Labour Code drafts will be discussed during the next parliamentary session, and that, according to the Government, consultations have been initiated with employers\' and workers\' organisations. The Committee also notes that, according to the Government, the technical assistance of the International Labour Office will be asked for in the preparation of the Code. It notes the Government\'s statement that special importance has been given in the draft to the legal guarantees and safeguards for the full exercise of freedom of association. The Committee recalls in that respect the urgent need for the adoption of labour legislation compatible with Conventions Nos.  and , and reminds the Government that all the employers\' and workers\' organisations, as well as the ILO, should be involved in the drafting of this legislation.\n.The Committee further notes that the Government provides no information on the measures it considers taking to adopt legislation to guarantee fully the exercise of civil liberties and broaden judicial safeguards, as the Committee recommended in November .\n.The Committee takes note of the efforts reported by the Government to strengthen tripartism and create an institutional consultative body.

The Committee once again expresses hope that the Government will re-open the compensation files at the request of those who consider they have been unfairly dispossessed.\n.With respect to the closing-down of radio news programmes, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, these programmes have now resumed. The Committee must express its concern at the frequency of suspension measures imposed on the media, and recalls the importance of the right of employers\' and workers\' organisations to express their opinions through the media.\n.Regarding the allegations concerning imprisonments, the Committee notes the release of persons arrested after the demonstration organised in Nandaime in July .

In addition, in a communication of  June  several Employers\' delegates to the rd Session () of the International Labour Conference lodged a complaint, under article  of the Constitution of the ILO against the Government of Nicaragua, of infringements of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and of the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention,  (No. ).\n.The Committee has examined these questions on several occasions, most recently in November  (see st Report, approved by the Governing Body at its st Session (November )) on the basis of information compiled on the spot from  September to  October  by a study mission conducted by Professor Fernando Uribe Restrepo, a member of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.\n.Since then, the International Organisation of Employers (IOE) has submitted new allegations in communications of  December  and  January . The Government supplied its observations in communications dated  January and , , ,  and  February .\n.In its communication of  December , the IOE alleges that on  October  the Ministry of the Interior banned, for an unlimited period, the radio programme broadcast on Radio Mundial by the Supreme Council of Private Enterprise (COSEP), entitled ""The Nicaraguan"". According to the IOE, this programme reviews the main features of the economic and social situation of the country and suggests possible solutions in which the COSEP and its members would like to co-operate.\n.Moreover, the IOE notes that on  November , also by order of the Ministry of the Interior, the programme ""Seis en Punto"" broadcast by Radio Corporacin was banned indefinitely. The IOE points out that the Director of Radio Corporacin and of the banned programme is Mr. Jos Castillo Oseja, a prominent member of the COSEP who has already suffered at the hands of the regime on many occasions, particularly during a beating by the Minister of the Interior on  April .\n.The IOE emphasises that Radio Corporacin, Radio Catlica, Radio Noticias and Radio Mundial were closed down in May , and that Radio Corporacin, Radio Mundial and eight other radio stations were threatened with closure in July . Furthermore, La Prensa, already closed down for two weeks in July , regularly receives threats that it will be closed down again. According to the IOE, this proves that the Government\'s repressive attitude regarding information remains unchanged.\n.Concerning the case of Mr. Mario Alegra, the director of COSEP\'s research institute sentenced to  years in prison, the IOE objects to the fact that, apart from the disregard shown for the defendant\'s rights during the investigation (confessions were extracted in illegal conditions), he is still in detention while the appeals court dealing with his case has still not given a verdict, though the time-limit provided for by the Criminal Code of Procedure has long since expired.\n.In its communication of  January , the IOE alleges that on  January  the Government ordered the closing down, for an unlimited period, of the programme ""Seis en punto"", broadcast by Radio Corporacin. The programme is accused of having carried news concerning the dismissal of public servants from the Ministry of the Interior. According to the IOE, the news in question had already been carried by pro-government radio stations, which were not ordered closed. The IOE goes on to state that the Government was obliged to revoke this measure in view of its manifest arbitrariness.\n.In its communication dated  January , the Government expresses its desire to inform the Committee of the implementation of a set of measures which have been undertaken in the country as a concrete expression of the Government\'s flexibility and will to promote an improvement in relations among the various social, economic and political sectors and forces in Nicaraguan society.\n.In this context, the Government and the higher labour authorities have borne in mind the recommendations and suggestions made by the Governing Body at its November  Session, as well as the opinions expressed by the study mission which visited Nicaragua. The Government thus reports on various measures which were adopted in December .\n.Firstly, the Government indicates that it has decided to release Mr. Carlos Humbres in spite of his proven guilt in the matter and the purely political nature of his case. The Government has thus demonstrated its flexibility and its political willingness to achieve peace, since this gesture will be appreciated by those who have participated in the aggression against Nicaragua. This is a genuine expression of the Revolution\'s desire to create a national consensus in which all of the forces of the country will be able to contribute to the reconstruction of the nation.\n.In the same vein, the Government also released the persons involved in the violation of laws concerning public order during the Nandaime events. These releases should also be considered a concrete expression of the Government\'s flexibility and its readiness to support and intensify a political dialogue with all sectors of the nation in the search for a consensus to tackle the tasks of reconstruction of the country, which is currently suffering from the economic effects of hurricane ""Juana"" and the war of aggression. Although there is no doubt that the defendants violated the law, the Government has deemed it necessary to take concrete steps to create a national climate of responsible and constructive dialogue.\n.The Government goes on to say that the President of the Republic, in his New Year\'s message appealed to all the economic, social and political sectors of the country to establish an effective dialogue on the basis of mutual co-operation so they may patriotically assume the tasks and responsibilities entailed by the current process of national reconstruction.\n.Moreover, the labour authorities are currently preparing some legislative reforms which will make it possible to eliminate permanently some problems of compatibility between national laws and regulations and international labour Conventions. These legislative reforms will be implemented separately from the efforts to change the entire labour legislation by means of a new Labour Code. These efforts will obviously represent a large scale task calling for various stages of work in parallel with consultations with employers\' and workers\' organisations and debate in the National Assembly. The Government intends to keep the ILO informed of the progress of the efforts undertaken to change certain provisions to which the Committee of Experts and the study mission had suggested amendments.\n.The Government believes that with the national efforts it is undertaking to find opportunities for constructive dialogue and consensus among the various sectors, it is offering concrete responses to the opinions, suggestions and criteria which were presented to the authorities by the Governing Body and other ILO bodies. The Government reiterates its willingness to continue to intensify the search for points of agreement among the various sectors and thus to consolidate the various expressions of tripartism currently existing in Nicaragua. As in the past, the Government will keep the ILO informed of the results obtained.\n.In its communications dated  and  February , the Government points out that there are currently four Labour Code projects, one drafted by the Government and the others by various opposition movements (political parties and a central labour organisation). These projects will be presented at the next parliamentary session for debate and, possibly, adoption. The discussions concerning the Labour Code are prominent on the agenda of the next session of the National Assembly. The latter has engaged in consultations with the employers\' and workers\' organisations of the country. The approval of the new Labour Code has been declared a priority by the Assembly and is an item on the agenda of the - session.\n.The Government adds that the Ministry of Labour is establishing an institutional consultative body, between workers and employers without any distinction whatsoever, so that the social problems that affect them may be discussed more expeditiously.\n.As regards the application of Convention No. , the Government points out that, since January , the process of tripartite consultation has been intensified in the context of national consensus. The President of the Republic, the Minister of Industry, Economy and Commerce and the Minister of Agricultural Development and Agrarian Reform had discussions with all the employers\' groups in the industrial, commercial and agricultural sectors. They have also met with the central labour organisations with a view to defining the framework of integration for the country\'s economic reconstruction. These meetings have led to the adoption of a series of political and legal guarantees of private enterprise activities, the creation of joint ventures funded by the State and the private sector, and the establishment of mechanisms allowing for ongoing consultation with the agents of national economic activity. The Government is of the opinion that these initiatives created a new atmosphere of confidence. Through its leader, Mr. Gurdian, the COSEP has recommended its affiliates to participate in all discussions and meetings with the governmental authority,', ""VIII to XI include provisions enabling the Ministry of the Interior to admonish and order the temporary closing of communications media in a series of circumstances so vaguely defined that all abuses of the recent past could be repeated. The IOE adds that this Act does not modify Decree No.  of  which, combined with Decree No.  of , grants the monopoly of economic data publication to a state body, namely the Nicaraguan Institute of Statistics and Enumeration. According to the IOE, these two decrees constitute a breach of freedom of information in Nicaragua, and especially a violation of the INIESEP's and COSEP's right to inform their members and the general public.\n.In its communication of  May , the Government announces that Mr. Alegra was released on  April . Furthermore, the competent committee of the National Assembly has approved a pardon in the case of Mr. Guillermo Quant. This case will be submitted to the plenary assembly on  May.\n.In its communication of  May , the Government confirms the release of Mr. Mario Alegra, pursuant to the judgement issued by the Criminal Chamber of the Appeals Court of Managua. It adds that on  May , the National Assembly approved the pardon granted to Mr. Guillermo Quant, a COSEP member who had been convicted for a documented and proven breach of the country's laws. Accordingly, Mr. Quant has also been released.\n.The Government further announces the liberation, on  March , of  persons who are allegedly members of the Central Organisation of Unions (CUS), namely: Santos Francisco Garca Cruz, Juan Ramon Gutierrez Lopez, Saturnino Gutierriez Lopez, Juan Alberto Corteras Nuos, Presentacon Muoz Martnez, Ronal Gonzlez Lopez, Arnulfo Gonzalez Olivas, Jacinto Oliva Vallecillo, Salsmn de Jess Vallecillo Martnez, Ricardo Gutierrez Corteras Luis Enrique Garcia Alvarado, Euselio Garca Alvarado, Eduardo Garca Alvarado and Pedro Joaqun Talavera Perez.\n.As regards Anastasio Gimenes Maldonado, Justino Rivera, Eva Gonzles and Eliazar Marenco, who were allegedly arrested in , the Government states it is still waiting the complementary information that the Committee had requested from the complainant organisation - i.e. the WCL - on the motives and circumstances surrounding these alleged arrests, in order to adequately follow up these complaints.\n.With respect to tripartite consultations, the Government states that certain doubts arose about the viability of a system of a national tripartite consultative commission. According to the Government, all the indications are that tripartite consultations on international labour Conventions and on themes of interest to employers' and workers' organisations are more productive when they are held by sector of activity, or when they focus on specific issues previously identified. For that purpose, the President of the Republic organised during the first half of April a tripartite national consultation in the agricultural sector, with the participation of producers affiliated to COSEP and UNAG and of unions representing workers in this branch of activity. This meeting produced tangible results through the adoption of positive measures for private entrepreneurs: credit policies, tax incentives, government subsidies and marketing of farm products. On the other hand, the employers undertook to respect the workers' rights recognised in the legislation and the collective agreements. The major employer leaders welcomed these results, as established by the statements of Messrs. Gurdian and Dreyfus, leaders of the COSEP. The Government adds that a national tripartite consultation for the industrial sector is planned in May.\n.Furthermore, in view of the coming discussion on the revision of Convention No.  on indigenous populations at the International Labour Conference, the Government has organised a national tripartite seminar on this theme, where it invited the COSEP, the UNAG and the most representative workers' organisations. Unfortunately, the COSEP did not participate in the seminar in spite of that invitation.\n.As regards the reform and modifications of the labour legislation, and in particular the discussion and adoption of the new Labour Code, the Government states that the process of consultation with workers' and employers' organisations continued and improved, as evidenced by several tripartite seminars held on this theme in April. This consultative process is complex since the various central workers' organisations, which are the tangible expression of union pluralism in the country, are trying to find a consensus which would permit joint initiatives with a view to amending the legislation.\n.The Government also indicates that, in view of the agreement concluded at the Summit of the Central American Heads of State on  February , the National Assembly had to debate on a priority basis, during the first months of , the Acts guaranteeing and demonstrating the Government's will to implement the compromises it had accepted as part of the peace initiative in Central America. The Elections Act and the Communications Media Act have thus been reformed. The Government adds that the discussion and adoption of the Labour Code remains a priority on the National Assembly agenda and that the ILO's technical assistance will be requested in due course.\n.In conclusion, the Government hopes that this information will enable the Committee objectively to evaluate the efforts it is making to apply the international labour Conventions and to guarantee the rights and claims of employers and workers.\n.In a communication dated  May , the Government declares, in response to the most recent allegations made by the IOE, that the fact that the Court of Appeal overturned the judgement of the lower court is additional evidence of the separation of powers in Nicaragua and of the judiciary's independence. The delays incurred before the Court of Appeal issued its judgement probably result from a backlog of work, as happens in other countries. As regards Mr. Alegra's compensation, it is for the courts - not the Committee on Freedom of Association - to decide that point, at the request of the interested party.\n.Concerning the general legislation on communications media, the Government reaffirms that this Act has been passed by the Legislative Assembly, where various political parties with differing ideologies are represented. Furthermore, several independent institutes have compared this Act with those of other Latin American countries and found it more liberal.\n.In a communication dated  May , the Government mentions that it is facing obstacles in the process of dialogue and consultations it wants to pursue. According to the Government, certain sectors clearly intend to annihilate the efforts it made to redress the country's economy, and want to prevent any possibility of real consultations in the political and economic fields. The Government refers more specifically to the COSEP's attitude which it terms as totally inflexible. The Government explains that the President of the Republic has invited the private sector to take joint steps with it so as to obtain financial resources from the international community. The COSEP then published a press release in which it did not authorise the private sector to participate in joint missions with the Government, which is contrary to the tripartism philosophy it claims to be supporting. Furthermore, the COSEP has excluded employer leaders who had participated in such missions. This inflexible attitude has also led the COSEP not to participate in the consultations on international labour standards (the Government attaches a copy of the letter sent to the COSEP on  May , inviting it to the meeting of  and  May  concerning the revision of Convention No. ). The Government concludes by asking the Committee to note the difference between its attitude and that of the COSEP.\n.The Committee notes the replies given by the Government to the various recommendations and information requests made at its February  meeting.\n.As regards the legislative aspect of the cases referred to it, the Committee notes the Government's statement to the effect that consultations continue with employers and workers organisations with a view to drafting a new Labour Code, and that the ILO will be consulted in due course. The Committee must recall in this respect that the Committee of Experts, in its  observations on the application of Conventions Nos.  and , commented on certain labour legislation provisions which are not compatib with the Conventions, especially those dealing with the following questions: establishment of unions, control of union books and registers, right to strike and collective agreements. Given the significance of these issues for freedom of association and in view of the fact that these observations have been made for several years, the Committee must insist once again on the urgent need for legislation which is compatible with Conventions Nos.  and . The Committee expresses its concern that, according to the IOE, the COSEP was not consulted about the revision of the Labour Code. The Committee requests the Government to hear the representations made by the COSEP on this matter. It firmly hopes that consultations will be successfully held with all the employers' and workers' organisations and that the Government will take into account the opinions expressed by these organisations, without exception. Furthermore, although the Government declared it would consult the ILO in due course, the Committee deplores that no such official request for assistance has been forthcoming as yet. Therefore, it"", ""VIII to XI include provisions enabling the Ministry of the Interior to admonish and order the temporary closing of communications media in a series of circumstances so vaguely defined that all abuses of the recent past could be repeated. The IOE adds that this Act does not modify Decree No.  of  which, combined with Decree No.  of , grants the monopoly of economic data publication to a state body, namely the Nicaraguan Institute of Statistics and Enumeration. According to the IOE, these two decrees constitute a breach of freedom of information in Nicaragua, and especially a violation of the INIESEP's and COSEP's right to inform their members and the general public.\n.In its communication of  May , the Government announces that Mr. Alegra was released on  April . Furthermore, the competent committee of the National Assembly has approved a pardon in the case of Mr. Guillermo Quant. This case will be submitted to the plenary assembly on  May.\n.In its communication of  May , the Government confirms the release of Mr. Mario Alegra, pursuant to the judgement issued by the Criminal Chamber of the Appeals Court of Managua. It adds that on  May , the National Assembly approved the pardon granted to Mr. Guillermo Quant, a COSEP member who had been convicted for a documented and proven breach of the country's laws. Accordingly, Mr. Quant has also been released.\n.The Government further announces the liberation, on  March , of  persons who are allegedly members of the Central Organisation of Unions (CUS), namely: Santos Francisco Garca Cruz, Juan Ramon Gutierrez Lopez, Saturnino Gutierriez Lopez, Juan Alberto Corteras Nuos, Presentacon Muoz Martnez, Ronal Gonzlez Lopez, Arnulfo Gonzalez Olivas, Jacinto Oliva Vallecillo, Salsmn de Jess Vallecillo Martnez, Ricardo Gutierrez Corteras Luis Enrique Garcia Alvarado, Euselio Garca Alvarado, Eduardo Garca Alvarado and Pedro Joaqun Talavera Perez.\n.As regards Anastasio Gimenes Maldonado, Justino Rivera, Eva Gonzles and Eliazar Marenco, who were allegedly arrested in , the Government states it is still waiting the complementary information that the Committee had requested from the complainant organisation - i.e. the WCL - on the motives and circumstances surrounding these alleged arrests, in order to adequately follow up these complaints.\n.With respect to tripartite consultations, the Government states that certain doubts arose about the viability of a system of a national tripartite consultative commission. According to the Government, all the indications are that tripartite consultations on international labour Conventions and on themes of interest to employers' and workers' organisations are more productive when they are held by sector of activity, or when they focus on specific issues previously identified. For that purpose, the President of the Republic organised during the first half of April a tripartite national consultation in the agricultural sector, with the participation of producers affiliated to COSEP and UNAG and of unions representing workers in this branch of activity. This meeting produced tangible results through the adoption of positive measures for private entrepreneurs: credit policies, tax incentives, government subsidies and marketing of farm products. On the other hand, the employers undertook to respect the workers' rights recognised in the legislation and the collective agreements. The major employer leaders welcomed these results, as established by the statements of Messrs. Gurdian and Dreyfus, leaders of the COSEP. The Government adds that a national tripartite consultation for the industrial sector is planned in May.\n.Furthermore, in view of the coming discussion on the revision of Convention No.  on indigenous populations at the International Labour Conference, the Government has organised a national tripartite seminar on this theme, where it invited the COSEP, the UNAG and the most representative workers' organisations.

The foregoing is consistent with the information requested from, and provided by, the office of the ENACAL CEO.Refusal of the application by the Managua Department Inspectorate, Service Sector, submitted by the Independent Workers' Union of the DirectorateGeneral of Revenues (SITRADGI) and dismissal of Ms Maura de Jess Vivas Ramos, official of the Public Employees' Union in theDirectorate-General of Revenues of Granada (SEPGRA-DGI)\n.With regard to the refusal by the Managua Department Labour Inspectorate, Service Sector of the list of claims of  June , under paragraph  of article , submitted by the SITRADGI, the Government indicates that the Managua Department Labour Inspectorate, Service Sector refused the application because it had already been negotiated bilaterally with other trade unions and the DGI. On  July , the SITRADGI submitted to the Department Labour Inspectorate, Service Sector a request to negotiate a list of claims when it had already signed a new list of claims. The legal basis for refusing the list of claims in question was that a new collective agreement had already been signed.\n.Furthermore, the Directorate of Collective Bargaining and Conciliation received the collective agreement of the DGI on  July  for registration and filing, it having been negotiated directly and in accordance with articles  and  of the Labour Code by the following trade unions: the SNTUR-DGI-UNE and the SINTRACAF-UNE. The agreement was revised and certain rectifications were formulated. It was resubmitted on  July  and was signed by the Director of Collective Bargaining and Conciliation on  August  for registration.\n.On  July , the SITRADGI and the SIERMA-DGI submitted a document complaining that the trade unions which negotiated the new collective agreement were not represented in the previous collective agreement and that they did not request to join it and thus the new agreement should not be registered in the Directorate of Collective Bargaining and Conciliation. In this respect, an order was made on  July  which refused the application. Subsequently, a written submission was received on  August  from the following trade unions: the SITRADGI, the SIERMA-DGI and the SEPGRA-DGI which sent a communication to the ILO, requesting to join the collective agreement and withdraw the lists of demands submitted to the Ministry of Labour. The agreement was signed by all the trade unions mentioned in this report.\n.With regard to the termination of the contract of employment of the trade union official, Ms Maura de Jess Vivas Ramos, who is spokesperson of the SEPGRA-DGI, a decision in favour of the worker was given by the Inspectorate General of Labour on  January .National Technological Institute (INATEC)\n.With regard to this case, the Departmental Labour Inspectorate, Service Sector reported that on  July , an order was made which in its conclusion states:  the transfers of the workers and trade union officials Gloria del Carmen Paredes and Ricardo Ramn Alvarez Berrios are declared null and void' and this order was upheld on appeal on  September . In addition, the executive management of INATEC has stated that Mr Ricardo Ramn Alvarez Berrios and Ms Gloria del Carmen Paredes are working actively in their posts and with full respect for their labour and trade union rights.\n.The Committee observes that in this case the complainant organization alleges numerous dismissals of trade union officials and members, and the exclusion of trade unions from a collective bargaining process in various public institutions and state enterprises.Nicaraguan Social Security Institute (INSS)\n.As regards the allegation concerning the dismissal of ten officials (Isabel Vanessa River Ubeda, Sergio Juan Ramn Quiroz, Karla Esperanza Molina Saavedra, Moiss Ruiz Romero, Alvin Alanis Gonzlez, Karla del Rosario Alvarado Paz, Ivette Pilarte, Martha Caldern, Fruto Plazaola and Luis Prez Mairena) and  members of STEINSS, the Committee notes that the Government reports that: () in relation to the dismissals of the trade union officials, the Departmental Labour Inspectorate Service Sector stated that there was an initial complaint by the workers on  January  in relation to which a special inspection was carried out. However, the complainant (the workers' side) withdrew the complaint. On  February , the workers filed a written submission in which they complained of the transfers and breach of trade union rights as a result of which the Inspectorate concerned issued three summonses to the parties (employer and workers) with the aim of resolving the situation alleged by the workers concerned. The employer did not attend; () information was requested from the office of the INSS CEO, which provided the following information:  As a result of the administrative and structural reorganization of the institution, duly approved by the relevant authorities, the medical supervision area of the general health administration was completely closed down, changing the character from a supervisory function exercised by doctors to a function of social care carried out by social workers duly recruited by the institution'  () the measure adopted was based on article  of the Civil Service and Administrative Staff Act, Act No. , which states verbatim:  Institutional restructuring and reorganization.

Public servants affected by these programmes shall be compensated in accordance with the provisions of the present Act and the respective collective agreement'  () on  March  the contracts of employment of  medical supervisors were terminated (the names provided by the Government include almost all the trade union officials mentioned by the complainant organization); () on  March , the medical supervisors mentioned by the Government filed a claim for reinstatement and payment of wages due with the judicial authority and a decision in the case is still pending; () on  April , the dismissed workers Isabel Vanessa Rivera Ubeda (trade union official), Margarita del Carmen Snchez Mndez and Ercilia Elizabeth Aguilera Centena, withdrew their legal action; and () to date, the following dismissed workers, all former members of STEINSS have settled their claims: Isabel Vanessa Rivera Ubeda, Sergio Juan Ramn Quiroz, Karla Esperanza Saavedra, Moiss Ruiz Romero, Karla del Rosario Alvarado Paz, Ivette Pilarte Centeno and Frutos Jos Plazaola Cubillo.\n.In this respect the Committee recalls that on numerous occasions it pointed out that it can examine allegations concerning economic rationalization programmes and restructuring processes, whether or not they imply redundancies or the transfer of enterprises or services from the public to the private sector, only in so far as they might have given rise to acts of discrimination or interference against trade unions. In any case, the Committee can only regret that in the rationalization and staff-reduction process, the government did not consult or try to reach an agreement with the trade union organizations and also the Committee has emphasized that it is important that governments consult with trade union organizations to discuss the consequences of restructuring programmes on the employment and working conditions of employees [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth edition, , paras  and ]. In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to inform it whether STEINSS was consulted about the restructuring which took place and which according to the allegations prejudiced the trade union officials and members. In addition, observing that according to the Government, three workers withdrew their legal actions and seven settled their claims, the Committee, while noting that according to the Government the restructuring was carried out within the framework of the law, requests it to inform it of the result of the ongoing legal appeals relating to the remaining trade union officials and workers who were dismissed.The Nicaraguan Aqueduct and Sewer Company of Estel ' ENACAL-Estel\n.As regards the allegation relating to the termination of the contract of employment of Mr Fidel Castillo Lago (Minutes Secretary), official of the  Genaro Lazo' Union and  members, the Committee notes that the Government reports that on  June  the trade union official in question filed a claim against the company which is still in progress.

On  May , the strikers were violently ejected by the police.\n.In its communications of  and  February , the Government makes the following observations on the allegations presented by the complainants:- La Candelaria plantation: in May , the Departmental Labour Inspectorate of the city of Chinandega received  letters of dismissal involving the same number of workers, sent by the employer, the La Candelaria plantation, citing as just cause the provisions of article , paragraphs  and  of the Labour Code. After a number of administrative and legal proceedings, the Court of Appeals for the Second Region, Civil and Labour Division, decided to modify the provisions and ordered the reinstatement of the trade union executive committee, as well as payment of their social security contributions; as for the remaining workers, in addition to the payment of their social security contributions, it ordered payment of the compensation provided for in the collective agreement. As things currently stand, the decision is being implemented. The Government also states that investigations undertaken by the Civil Inspectorate for Occupational Affairs determined that on  April , workers seized the La Candelaria plantation, committing acts of violence and damaging property. Consequently, charges were filed at the First District Criminal Court of the city of Chinandega for the crime of property damage, illegal association for criminal purposes, jeopardizing personal safety, and aggravated robbery of personal property against Felipe Osejo, Medardo Ros, Emiliano Hernndez, Claudio Blandino, Pablo Castillo, Antonio Hernndez, Ramn Solano Silva, Abraham Cerda, Julio Rocha and Angela Zniga. Evidence of these facts has been presented to the court, which has not yet handed down a verdict.- San Pablo plantation: the employer did carry out massive dismissals on  August , which included members of the trade union executive committee. However, these persons reported to the Departmental Inspectorate of Labour of the city of Chinandega that they had been dismissed on  October , and requested that all members of the executive committee of the Ignacio Garcia Vargas trade union as well as all workers who were dismissed, be reinstated. Following various proceedings involving the Labour Inspectorate, the case is presently under appeal.- El Relampago plantation: the claim is based on the dismissal of  workers belonging to the trade union in July . The Second District Court of Civil and Labour Affairs of the city of Chinandega has ordered that  workers be reinstated.- Alfonso Angelina plantation: The Chinandega Departmental Inspectorate denied the request by Mrs. Valladares Neyra, finding it without ground since witnesses testified that she was a temporary worker.- El Paraiso ranch: although the Government points out that a reply was given to this allegation in connection with Case No. , the allegations in this case are new.- La Florida ranch: as regards the dismissals, no claim has been submitted to the regional office of the Ministry of Labour. As regards the death of Mr. Salmern Arceda, the national police inquiry, as well as statements from workers at the ranch, make it clear that he was murdered as a result of a personal quarrel with a former retired worker which eventually resulted in the use of firearms. This matter has absolutely nothing to do with labour or trade union affairs, as it was simply a common crime.- La Suiza ranch: the eviction alleged by the complainants resulted from a claim for return of property filed by Mrs. Concepcin Morales de Correa at the district civil court against Esthela Rodrguez, Antonieta Martnez Zamora, Josefa Prez Garca, Reyna Barrera Garca and Bertha Castro. The court granted the request for returning the property, ordering the occupants to return it to its owner, Mrs. Morales. This case concerns problems of land ownership and has absolutely nothing to do with labour or trade union affairs.- Murder of trade union official Mr. Felix Humberto Chavarra Olivas: court authorities in Matagalpa have stated that his murder was a common crime stemming from personal problems between businessmen, and that investigations showed no evidence whatsoever that the motives were related to labour or trade union matters.- Military repression of customs workers affiliated to the trade union: the customs workers strike was declared illegal for having failed to comply with provisions of sections , , and  of the Labour Code. Strikers committed a series of criminal acts in that they used violence and firearms to seize the customs buildings, blocking free access by their colleagues who were not in agreement with the strike and wanted to exercise their legitimate right to work, and attacked border customshouses, seriously wounding two policemen and one customs worker. In their zeal to pit workers against customs authorities and accentuate their differences, they forged documents, producing a list of dismissals supposedly signed by the Assistant to the General Director of Customs and with the seal of the Ministry of Finance, with the above signature and seal superimposed, a deed classified as a crime by our civil and penal legislation.- Massive dismissals at the National Development Bank: no complaints concerning massive dismissals at the National Development Bank (BANADES) were lodged with the Ministry of Labour or the courts. Bank authorities state that on the date referred to by the complainants, BANADES offered its personnel a staff reduction plan due to overstaffing. The plan was completely voluntary and offered an average compensation that was  per cent greater than the entitlement under law. Thus expectant mothers were paid for the remaining time of their pregnancy and maternity leave; workers with the most seniority were given two months' pay for every five years of service, in addition to the above compensation. Trade union officials attempted to oppose the reduction plan, but the members would not allow it as  voluntary requests had been made despite the fact that BANADES was only asking for .- Public administration: the Government denies that social security contributions provided for in collective agreements were frozen, pointing out that not only were collective agreements in force on the date of the complaint complied with, but that new agreements have been signed since that time. In accordance with records of the Office of Conciliation of the Ministry of Labour,  collective agreements were signed in , of which  ( per cent) were in the private sector and  ( per cent) in the public sector. The trade union confederations that played major roles in negotiating collective agreements were the Sandinista Workers' Confederation (CTC), the Nicaraguan Workers' Confederation (CTN), the Nicaraguan Independent Workers' Confederation (CTNA), the Unified Trade Union Confederation (CUS), two unions without a confederation, plus various confederations that participated as a group. The CST was party to the greatest number of agreements signed. In addition, as regards allegations concerning the dismissal of other civil servants, including members of trade unions affiliated with the National Employees' Union, the complainants provide no names, worksites or positions; the Government is therefore unable to communicate its observations.- National Union of Education Workers - National Association of Teachers (ANDEN): (a) expulsion of the ANDEN General Secretary, Mr. Mario Quintana, from the National Education Council, pursuant to a ministerial resolution from the Ministry of Education: ANDEN has filed an appeal with the Supreme Court of Justice, which has not yet ruled on the case; and (b) the arbitrary, unilateral dismissal of the leading ANDEN activists, who were working as teachers and educators: The Government states that two of them were not dismissed and continue to carry out their duties; two have been reinstated; one was dismissed as part of a restructuring plan; two agreed to a retraining plan; two were transferred under restructuring, which they did not accept but have made no appeal to the courts; three were dismissed for having been accomplices to the persons who seized an education office; two were dismissed for having seized the office and kidnapped its chief; one was dismissed for the crime of slander; two who were political appointees were dismissed; and one has died. As regards the following workers, the Government states that the courts have either denied their claims or not yet ruled on them, or else they have been guilty of unethical conduct: Francisco Gonzlez, Jorge Aguilar Aguilera, Martha Altamirano Vega, Jazmina Novoa Ruz, Ana Julia Castillo, Laura Bermudez Robleto, Nury Vanegas, Jaime Castilla Vlchez, Marina Liliana Duarte Cruz, Aminta Morales Videa, Ruth Espinoza Ordez, Melba Luz Aguilera, Martha Tefila Valladares Martnez, Isaura Chavarra Salgado, Brenda Lpez Caldern, Mirna"", ""Maura de Jess Vivas Ramos, spokesperson of the SEPGRA-DGI, invoking for that purpose article  of Act No. , the Civil Service and Administrative Staff Act, which does not rank higher than the Constitution and the Labour Code.\n.In its communication of  April , the Government states that the cases of the trade union officials were being heard, at the option of the parties, some by administrative proceedings in the Ministry of Labour and others in the industrial courts, in accordance with the procedures and processes laid down in Nicaraguan legislation for parties in dispute.

ENACAL has not been notified of any claim lodged by the abovementioned persons.ENACAL-Granada and ENACAL-Carazo\n.Under decision No. - of the Inspectorate General of Labour of  May , it was established that the Inspectorate General of Labour was competent under articles  and  of the Labour Code to hear and decide the application by the legal attorney of ENACAL, who on  May  requested the Inspectorate to pronounce the illegality of the strike conducted by the workers of the Carazo and Granada divisions. The reports of the special inspections carried out by the Inspectorate General of Labour in this matter showed that the workers of the Carazo and Granada divisions had gone on strike without first exhausting the legal procedures, and had defaulted on their labour obligations by arbitrarily suspending their work, in relation to a claim of non-compliance with the collective agreement and negotiation of a new list of demands.\n.The Government refers to the following decision of the labour inspectorate:  Irrespective of the reasons given by the workers of the ENACAL Carazo and Granada departments for demanding improvements in their social and labour rights, these do not allow or legitimize them in holding a collective stoppage of work, even though article  of the Constitution recognizes the labour right to complain against non-compliance with agreements of a social and labour character (article  of the Labour Code) and negotiation of lists of demands (article  and following of the Labour Code) and there are procedures, including for the exercise of the right to strike, article  of the Labour Code provides that clearly defined criteria must be satisfied and, in this case, it is clear that the workers of the departments concerned did not follow the correct procedure. This situation obliges the authority to declare the strike held by the workers of the Carazo and Granada departments illegal under the provisions of article  and following of the Labour Code. Thus in the light of these considerations, article  of the Constitution of Nicaragua, articles , , ,  and  of the Labour Code, the Inspectorate General decides: () that the application by the Legal Attorney of ENACAL that the strike be held to be illegal is justified. In consequence, the Inspectorate General of Labour declares the strike by the workers of the Carazo and Granada departmental divisions of ENACAL to be illegal; and () the striking workers must return to work within  hours, failing which the employer may deem the contracts of employment of those who continue with the illegal action to be terminated.' ,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:\n.The Government states that the dismissal of the striking workers at ENACAL Granada and Carazo was not because they were trade unionists or exercising a trade union right (which right is protected by labour law), but for breach of labour legislation and the decision given by the Inspectorate General of Labour. The Government adds that on  June , certain ENACAL (Granada) workers filed a claim for reinstatement in the District Civil and Industrial Court by operation of law in the department of Granada and that on  June , ENACAL (Carazo) workers filed a legal appeal in Jinotepe.ENACAL-Diriamba\n.With regard to the termination of the contract of employment of Mr Lester Francisco Ortiz, Secretary of the ENACAL-Diriamba Workers' Union, the official in question withdrew""]"
