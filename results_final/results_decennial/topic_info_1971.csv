More recently, the Government has declared that a major programme of agrarian reform is currently under way, the socio-economic consequences of which will ensure that the events involved in the present case cannot recur. As regards the death of Trnsito Vsquez, the Government explained that, under a court decision issued on  March , a stay of proceedings was granted concerning the charge relating to wilful homicide and the release was ordered of Mximo Garcia Lpez, Josh Felipe Garcia Vsquez and Sarbelo Garcia Ramirez. The Government adds that the accused had admitted they were members of the Federation of Catholic Peasants of El Salvador (FECCAS) and the Onion of Field Labourers (UTC) and not the Nationalist Democratic Organisation (ORDEN), as had been stated by the complainants.\n.As regards the observations made in connection with Case No. , the Government states that, on  June , after a work stoppage had been declared in the ""El Granjero S.A."" undertaking, forces of the Army intervened in order to eject the picketers who had threatened to damage plant equipment. The Government adds that terrorist elements had infiltrated into these groups.\n.As regards Case No. , the Government states that it has requested the collaboration of the Ministry of Labour and the Public Prosecutor\'s Office of the Republic so that appropriate investigations may be made into the events of  December , the results of which will be transmitted in due course. As regards the list supplied by the complainants of workers and peasants who had died, the Government states that their deaths were not the result of repressive action due to their trade union activities and obligations, but rather of the violence which continues to be generated by the extreme left and the extreme right and which, by drawing the armed forces into a purely defensive response, are plunging the country into a bloodbath which has been criticised and deplored by the true citizens of El Salvador.\n.With regard to Case No. , in which one of the complainants alleged that five trade unionists had been arrested, the Government states that the events in question were brought about by an illegal strike which bad been declared by the River Lempa Hydroelectric Company Workers\' Trade Onion on  and  August . The Government adds that the instigators of the strike violated the provisions of the Constitution by not following the procedure set forth in the Labour Code when they cut off without any advance notice the electricity service throughout the country, which seriously damaged the national economy (with losses exceeding  million colones) and caused the irreparable loss of human lives in hospitals and other medical centres. According to the Government, when the situation reached the point of posing a threat to the national security, since the service involved was one which was indispensable to the community, and as a result of the public outcry, the armed forces intervened in the plant without bloodshed and proceeded to arrest the principal leaders of the strike who - with the exception of those who were not considered to be responsible and who were subsequently released - are now being held in prison, where they are being treated correctly. The Government states that the prisoners are subject to the jurisdiction of military courts, which are now investigating their case in collaboration with their defence counsel.\n.With regard to the assassination of Rodolfo Viera, Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer (Case No. ), the Government stated that it had ordered the arrest of the wealthy right-wing businessmen Ricardo Sol Meza and Hans Christ; the latter is currently in Miami and proceedings are at present under way to seek his extradition. The Government adds that the Public Prosecutor has been especially instructed to appoint, on behalf of the State, representatives to take part in the trial being heard by the Fifth Criminal Court and these representatives have already participated in the investigations. The Government points out that Mr Viera was, in addition to being a member of the Salvadorean Communal Onion, a high official of the Government and was looked upon as one of the major proponents of agrarian reform, all of which constituted the motives for his assassination at the wretched hands of the extreme right and extreme left.\n.Finally, as regards the allegations concerning the assassination of workers, trade union leaders and school teachers between  October  and  September  (Case No. ) under the presidency of General Carlos Humberto Romero, the Government states that it does not know why the corresponding investigations did not produce any results, if indeed such investigations took place. The Government adds, however, that in order to demonstrate clearly and sincerely that the present rulers of El Salvador are free of any links or compromises with the past, an investigation will be conducted into these deplorable events, the results of which will be transmitted to the Committee as soon as possible.\n.Before considering the substance of the various matters raised by the complainants, the Committee would like to express its deep concern at the serious nature of the allegations, most of which refer to the death, assassination, arrest or disappearance of trade unionists and trade union leaders, which have continued to occur even after  October , the date on which the former Government was deposed. While noting the troubled situation which is facing the authorities in El Salvador, the Committee must draw the attention of the Government to the fact that a free and independent trade union movement can develop only in a climate of respect for fundamental human rights, and to the Resolution concerning Trade Onion Rights and their relation to civil liberties adopted by the International Labour Conference in , which states in particular that the concept of trade union rights is totally meaningless in the absence of civil liberties and that the rights conferred on workers\' and employers\' organisations must be baled on respect for civil liberties.\n.The Committee also deplores the fact that in spite of the time which has elapsed, the Government in its observations has still not replied to all the allegations or has done so only incompletely in some of the cases.\n.The Committee notes that the Government considers itself free of any responsibility for the events which allegedly occurred before  October . In this connection, the Committee considers, as it already pointed out at its session in February , that there exists a link of continuity between successive governments in the same State and that although a government cannot be held responsible for events which took place under a preceding one, it has a clear responsibility for any consequences which those events might have produced since its accession to power. This principle is particularly applicable as regards the clarification of events which have led to the loss of human lives or the detention of trade unionists who are still being held in prison.\n.As regards the allegations concerning the attacks on the lives or persons of trade unionists or trade union leaders, the Committee cannot but deplore the loss of numerous lives and the injuries mentioned in the complaints. The Committee notes the Government\'s statement that investigations are now under way concerning the events referred to in Cases Nos. ,  and  and, more generally, into the assassinations which allegedly took place between  October  and  December  (Case No. ) concerning which the Government states that an investigation is being ordered, the results of which will be transmitted to the Committee. However, since the Government has not provided information on the death of the trade union leader Tombs Rosales (Case No. ) or the injuries to which reference is made in Cases Nos.  and  and some of the assassinations referred to in Case No. , the Committee requests the Government to undertake as soon as possible - if it has not already done so - an independent judicial inquiry into these allegations with a view to elucidating', 'it has no link of continuity. However, the Government points out that a new inquiry is now being undertaken to clarify the matter, the results of which will be communicated to the Committee.\n.As regards the imprisonment of the trade union leader Francisco Girn Ramos (Case No. ), the Government states that he was indicted on a charge of destroying genuine documents and that there was never any allegation that there had been an infringement of freedom of association. The Government adds that Grancisco Girn has been free since , when the judge ruled that he should be released on bail, although it was not known why a final judgement had not been pronounced at that time.

These complaints come from the following workers\' organisations: World Confederation of Labour (WCL), World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), International Metalworkers\' Federation (IMF), World Federation of Teachers\' Unions, General Workers\' Federation, National Federation of Dockworkers, Stevedores\' Union (POASI), National Union of Heavy Machinery Operators (SINOMAPE), and National Union of Telephone Workers (SNTT). They are dealt with in Cases Nos. , , , ,  and .\n.The Committee examined Case No.  in May and November  and at each of these sessions presented conclusions to the Governing Body. The Committee submitted further conclusions to the Governing Body (on Cases Nos. , , ,  and ) in May . Finally, it examined all the outstanding cases relating to the Dominican Republic in November  and May .\n.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.In May  the Committee considered that the information at its disposal seemed insufficient to enable it to reach conclusions regarding the substance of the various issues raised. It had already examined, on several occasions, cases concerning the Dominican Republic which contained allegations similar to those made in the cases under examination. In these circumstances it considered that it would be very useful to apply the direct contacts procedure. The Governing Body accordingly requested the Government to consider the possibility of giving its consent to the carrying out of a study in the Dominican Republic of the facts surrounding the complaints by a representative of the Director-General.\n.This request was repeated on a number of occasions. In addition, new complaints were presented which, like the earlier ones, contained a variety of serious allegations. Since no detailed reply had been received by May , the Committee had been obliged to formulate its conclusions on the cases in its th Report. However, the new Dominican Government constituted after the elections in May  accepted direct contacts by letter of  September .\n.The Director-General appointed Mr. Jean-Michel Servais, an official of the Freedom of Association Branch of the International Labour Standards Department, to represent him during this mission. The visit to the country took place from  to  November , and a report on the mission was submitted to the Committee. During his visit, the representative of the Director-General had conversations with the Secretary of State for Labour and the Secretary of State for the Interior and the Police, with the Under-Secretaries of State for Labour and the Under-Secretaries o?State for the Interior and for the Police, and with the Public Prosecutor of the Republic. He was also received by the President of the Supreme Court of Justice. He met the leaders of a number of trade union organisations - including those of two of the complainant organisations, CGT and POASI - on their trade union premises. Finally, he had discussions at the headquarters of the Employers\' Confederation of the Dominican Republic with the officials of this organisation, and with those of the Association of Industries of the Dominican Republic.\n.The Committee notes with satisfaction that the representative of the Director-General enjoyed the co-operation of all concerned. He was able to carry out all his tasks in full freedom and independence and the Dominican Government afforded him the necessary facilities to perform his mission in the best possible circumstances.\n.The representative of the Director-General collected information on the various issues raised in the complaints and on the measures taken or envisaged to solve the problems encountered. At the invitation of the Government he also discussed the comments made by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations during its periodic examination of the application of Conventions Nos.  and  under article  of the ILO Constitution. All these points are examined in the paragraphs which follow.\n.First of all, however, it should be pointed out that, according to the representative of the Director-General, a number of Confederations are at present contending for the allegiance of the workers and the control of the works unions. ""Thus"", he writes, ""at the time of my visit antagonism had taken a very serious turn in the Central Romana Corporations and Central Romana By-Products enterprise, a situation which seems likely to continue, if not to deteriorate further, in the coming months."" Trade union Confederations often maintain close political relations with political parties. The General Union of Dominican Workers (UGTD), which was set up very recently, is in sympathy with the Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD). As will be seen later on the Government has been accused of favouring this new organisation to a certain extent. A similar preoccupation is revealed in a telegram of  December  from the General Workers\' Federation (CGT), in which this organisation protests against the administrative order allegedly given by the Government to close down the programme of the ""Rutas"" radio station at La Romana and its alleged prevention of the reorganisation of the local union. This communication has been transmitted to the Government for its observations. The employers\' representatives, the report continues, have expressed the view that this situation has created a tense atmosphere in industrial relations on the other hand, it appears that large numbers of unions are now being formed in the present social circumstances.\n.Allegations concerning the death, arrest or banishment of trade unionists\n.As the mission report states, an amnesty law was passed on  September . All the trade unionists who were mentioned as having been under arrest have now been released. In addition, the banished trade unionists have recently returned to the country under the amnesty law and after the removal of administrative obstacles to their return.\n.Finally, it appears from the information gathered that under the Code of Penal Procedure any person who is detained must be brought before a judge within  hours of his arrest. In addition, an old habeas corpus Act protects individuals against arbitrary arrest. In the past, according to the Public Prosecutor of the Republic, the practice was to refer pleas of this nature to the Public Ministry ""which sometimes took rather arbitrary decisions""; this has now been changed and the pleas come before a judge of first instance. Moreover, a Hill to amend the habeas corpus Act is in preparation which stipulates explicitly that the plea must be referred to a judge and prescribes an appeals procedure. As regards banishment, the Public Prosecutor stated that, legally, such a measure could only be taken against foreigners (under the Immigration Law). No law permits the expulsion of nationals, and the measures taken by the previous Government were, in his opinion, arbitrary. There had been no more expulsions since  August .\n.Legal proceedings have been instituted in respect of the two cases of murder mentioned in the complaints of the peasants\' trade union leaders (Florinda Muoz Soriano in November , and Dionisio Frias in June ). The Secretary and the Under-Secretary of State for Labour said that they would send detailed information regarding the judicial investigations undertaken. It was, they admitted, true that peasant leaders had in the past met their deaths in abnormal circumstances. The new Government, they added, had stated that it would pursue a policy of respect for civil liberties and human rights, including freedom of association. The Undersecretary of State further emphasised the determination of the authorities to abide strictly by the law. The representative of the Director-General also learned from the officials of the Autonomous Confederation of Christian Trade Unions (CASC) that legal proceedings were still pending in the case of the murder of Dionisio Frias; as regards the death of Florinda Muoz Soriano the court had considered that the accused had acted in self-defence.\n.The Committee notes these various items of information, in particular the release or the return from exile of the trade unionists mentioned in the complaints. The facts surrounding the deaths of two peasant leaders in  and  have been the subject of trials before the courts one of these cases, moreover, appears to have ended in an acquittal. The Government, while admitting that trade unionists in the rural sector had in the past met their deaths in abnormal circumstances, has stated its will to secure respect for the law and for civil liberties. In these circumstances the Committee is of the opinion that these different points call for no further consideration, provided that it is kept informed of the results of the trials in the cases of the deaths of Dioniso Frias and Florinda Muoz Soriano.\n.Allegations concerning the dismissal of trade unionists\n.Many allegations referred to the dismissal of trade union leaders and militants. According to the complainants the chief target of these dismissals were the executive Committees of the unions, but certain allegations also referred to the dissolution, or attempted dissolution, of workers\' organisations. The representative of the Director-General points out in his report that this issue appeared', '.Since  the Committee has had before it numerous complaints of violation of freedom of association in the Dominican Republic. These complaints come from the following workers\' organisations: World Confederation of Labour (WCL), World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), International Metalworkers\' Federation (IMF), World Federation of Teachers\' Unions, General Workers\' Federation, National Federation of Dockworkers, Stevedores\' Union (POASI), National Union of Heavy Machinery Operators (SINOMAPE), and National Union of Telephone Workers (SNTT). They are dealt with in Cases Nos. , , , ,  and .\n.The Committee examined Case No.  in May and November  and at each of these sessions presented conclusions to the Governing Body. The Committee submitted further conclusions to the Governing Body (on Cases Nos. , , ,  and ) in May . Finally, it examined all the outstanding cases relating to the Dominican Republic in November  and May .\n.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.In May  the Committee considered that the information at its disposal seemed insufficient to enable it to reach conclusions regarding the substance of the various issues raised.

""Thus"", he writes, ""at the time of my visit antagonism had taken a very serious turn in the Central Romana Corporations and Central Romana By-Products enterprise, a situation which seems likely to continue, if not to deteriorate further, in the coming months."" Trade union Confederations often maintain close political relations with political parties. The General Union of Dominican Workers (UGTD), which was set up very recently, is in sympathy with the Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD). As will be seen later on the Government has been accused of favouring this new organisation to a certain extent. A similar preoccupation is revealed in a telegram of  December  from the General Workers\' Federation (CGT), in which this organisation protests against the administrative order allegedly given by the Government to close down the programme of the ""Rutas"" radio station at La Romana and its alleged prevention of the reorganisation of the local union. This communication has been transmitted to the Government for its observations. The employers\' representatives, the report continues, have expressed the view that this situation has created a tense atmosphere in industrial relations on the other hand, it appears that large numbers of unions are now being formed in the present social circumstances.\n.Allegations concerning the death, arrest or banishment of trade unionists\n.As the mission report states, an amnesty law was passed on  September . All the trade unionists who were mentioned as having been under arrest have now been released. In addition, the banished trade unionists have recently returned to the country under the amnesty law and after the removal of administrative obstacles to their return.\n.Finally, it appears from the information gathered that under the Code of Penal Procedure any person who is detained must be brought before a judge within  hours of his arrest. In addition, an old habeas corpus Act protects individuals against arbitrary arrest. In the past, according to the Public Prosecutor of the Republic, the practice was to refer pleas of this nature to the Public Ministry ""which sometimes took rather arbitrary decisions""; this has now been changed and the pleas come before a judge of first instance. Moreover, a Hill to amend the habeas corpus Act is in preparation which stipulates explicitly that the plea must be referred to a judge and prescribes an appeals procedure. As regards banishment, the Public Prosecutor stated that, legally, such a measure could only be taken against foreigners (under the Immigration Law). No law permits the expulsion of nationals, and the measures taken by the previous Government were, in his opinion, arbitrary. There had been no more expulsions since  August .\n.Legal proceedings have been instituted in respect of the two cases of murder mentioned in the complaints of the peasants\' trade union leaders (Florinda Muoz Soriano in November , and Dionisio Frias in June ). The Secretary and the Under-Secretary of State for Labour said that they would send detailed information regarding the judicial investigations undertaken. It was, they admitted, true that peasant leaders had in the past met their deaths in abnormal circumstances. The new Government, they added, had stated that it would pursue a policy of respect for civil liberties and human rights, including freedom of association. The Undersecretary of State further emphasised the determination of the authorities to abide strictly by the law. The representative of the Director-General also learned from the officials of the Autonomous Confederation of Christian Trade Unions (CASC) that legal proceedings were still pending in the case of the murder of Dionisio Frias; as regards the death of Florinda Muoz Soriano the court had considered that the accused had acted in self-defence.\n.The Committee notes these various items of information, in particular the release or the return from exile of the trade unionists mentioned in the complaints. The facts surrounding the deaths of two peasant leaders in  and  have been the subject of trials before the courts one of these cases, moreover, appears to have ended in an acquittal. The Government, while admitting that trade unionists in the rural sector had in the past met their deaths in abnormal circumstances, has stated its will to secure respect for the law and for civil liberties. In these circumstances the Committee is of the opinion that these different points call for no further consideration, provided that it is kept informed of the results of the trials in the cases of the deaths of Dioniso Frias and Florinda Muoz Soriano.\n.Allegations concerning the dismissal of trade unionists\n.Many allegations referred to the dismissal of trade union leaders and militants. According to the complainants the chief target of these dismissals were the executive Committees of the unions, but certain allegations also referred to the dissolution, or attempted dissolution, of workers\' organisations. The representative of the Director-General points out in his report that this issue appeared', '.Since  the Committee has had before it numerous complaints of violation of freedom of association in the Dominican Republic. These complaints come from the following workers\' organisations: World Confederation of Labour (WCL), World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), International Metalworkers\' Federation (IMF), World Federation of Teachers\' Unions, General Workers\' Federation, National Federation of Dockworkers, Stevedores\' Union (POASI), National Union of Heavy Machinery Operators (SINOMAPE), and National Union of Telephone Workers (SNTT). They are dealt with in Cases Nos. , , , ,  and .\n.The Committee examined Case No.  in May and November  and at each of these sessions presented conclusions to the Governing Body. The Committee submitted further conclusions to the Governing Body (on Cases Nos. , , ,  and ) in May . Finally, it examined all the outstanding cases relating to the Dominican Republic in November  and May .\n.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.In May  the Committee considered that the information at its disposal seemed insufficient to enable it to reach conclusions regarding the substance of the various issues raised. It had already examined, on several occasions, cases concerning the Dominican Republic which contained allegations similar to those made in the cases under examination. In these circumstances it considered that it would be very useful to apply the direct contacts procedure. The Governing Body accordingly requested the Government to consider the possibility of giving its consent to the carrying out of a study in the Dominican Republic of the facts surrounding the complaints by a representative of the Director-General.\n.This request was repeated on a number of occasions. In addition, new complaints were presented which, like the earlier ones, contained a variety of serious allegations. Since no detailed reply had been received by May , the Committee had been obliged to formulate its conclusions on the cases in its th Report. However, the new Dominican Government constituted after the elections in May  accepted direct contacts by letter of  September .\n.The Director-General appointed Mr. Jean-Michel Servais, an official of the Freedom of Association Branch of the International Labour Standards Department, to represent him during this mission. The visit to the country took place from  to  November , and a report on the mission was submitted to the Committee. During his visit, the representative of the Director-General had conversations with the Secretary of State for Labour and the Secretary of State for the Interior and the Police, with the Under-Secretaries of State for Labour and the Under-Secretaries o?State for the Interior and for the Police, and with the Public Prosecutor of the Republic. He was also received by the President of the Supreme Court of Justice. He met the leaders of a number of trade union organisations - including those of two of the complainant organisations, CGT and POASI - on their trade union premises. Finally, he had discussions at the headquarters of the Employers\' Confederation of the Dominican Republic with the officials of this organisation, and with those of the Association of Industries of the Dominican Republic.\n.The Committee notes with satisfaction that the representative of the Director-General enjoyed the co-operation of all concerned. He was able to carry out all his tasks in full freedom and independence and the Dominican Government afforded him the necessary facilities to perform his mission in the best possible circumstances.\n.The representative of the Director-General collected information on the various issues raised in the complaints and on the measures taken or envisaged to solve the problems encountered. At the invitation of the Government he also discussed the comments made by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations during its periodic examination of the application of Conventions Nos.  and  under article  of the ILO Constitution. All these points are examined in the paragraphs which follow.\n.First of all, however, it should be pointed out that, according to the representative of the Director-General, a number of Confederations are at present contending for the allegiance of the workers and the control of the works unions.

The Governing Body approved these reports in November  and in June and November  (th, th and th Sessions), respectively. The Government handed over various documents with a bearing on the case at an interview on  June  between the Minister of Labour and the Chairman of the Committee, and supplied further information in a communication dated  July .\n.Costa Rica has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.At its sessions in June and November , the Committee made certain comments in relation to the question of principle raised by the alleged interference by the Costa Rican Social Security Fund in the affairs of its employees' union. In September  the Government sent information with respect to one aspect of the question, namely the reasons for the dismissal of a trade union official.\n.Recalling its conclusions in an earlier case relating to Costa Rica, the Committee pointed out that ratification of Convention No.  involved an undertaking, under the terms of Article  of that Convention, to ensure that workers' organisations in particular were provided by the legislation with the means to protect themselves against interference by employers or their organisations. Costa Rican legislation contained no specific provisions to this effect.\n.On the Committee's recommendation, in June , the Governing Body urged the Government to adopt the necessary provisions without delay in a communication dated  September , the Government stated that it had taken note of these recommendations, which the Governing Body reiterated in November  when it approved paragraph  of the Committee's th Report.\n.In its further observations of  July  the Government states that the alleged interference by the Costa Rican Social Security Fund in the union UNDECA never took place. Among the documents supplied is an attestation by the authorities of the Fund to the effect that an examination of the accounts for the period to which the complaint refers ( and ) shows that the Fund did not pay the travelling expenses of workers as an inducement to attend a certain trade union meeting, as has been claimed by the complainants. The Government also draws attention to the information furnished earlier to the effect that a judgement pronounced in August  had declared it not proven that Mr. Carlos Acua Castro, an official of the union, had been dismissed on account of his trade union activities. The Government supplies the text of this judgement. In addition, in letters sent to the ILO by Mr. Acuo Castro - now a Ministry of Labour official - and a number of the UNDECA officials who had signed the complaint, it is acknowledged that the facts were not as serious as was claimed in the first place.\n.The Committee notes this information. It nevertheless considers that its general conclusions as to the need for legislative provisions which will protect workers' organisations against possible interference by employers are still applicable. In effect, to give the necessary publicity to provisions such as those of Article  of the Convention and ensure that full effect is given to them in practice, even in cases where ratification has the effect of incorporating the international standard in municipal law, it is highly important that these provisions, accompanied by provision for appeals and penalties to ensure that they are complied with, should be embodied explicitly in the relevant legislation. The Committee is therefore of the opinion that the recommendations already approved by the Governing Body in this respect should be maintained.\n.The other matters still outstanding concern the dismissal from their jobs of three other officials of unions of employees in the public sector and the criminal proceedings brought by the authorities against two of them. These events occurred in  and . According to the allegations, Luis Fernando Alfaro Ziga, General Secretary of the Trade Union Association of Employees of the Costa Rican Electricity Institute, and Mario Devandas Brenes, General Secretary of the National Federation of Public Service workers, were dismissed from their jobs. Subsequently, according to the complainants, because of strikes called by workers belonging to their respective unions, they were charged with incitement to strike and other offences and imprisoned. The Government stated that Alfaro Ziga had made subversive speeches during a strike in July  at the Costa Rican Electricity Institute and that the Public Prosecutor had charged both him and Devandas Brenes with riot, incitement to a collective stoppage of public services and conduct prejudicial to public order. Both were to be brought to trial and the court had allowed them to be released on bail.\n.Bearing in mind the principles it had upheld in this connection, the Committee examined the provisions of the Labour Code which prohibit strikes in the public services and make it compulsory for any disputes between employers and workers in this sector to be referred to the labour courts. The Committee pointed out in particular that where strikes were prohibited or restricted in essential services or in the civil service, adequate guarantees should be ensured to safeguard the interest of the workers to the full, including in particular the existence of adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures in which the parties could take part at every stage and in which the awards were binding in all cases on both parties and must be fully and promptly implemented. In this connection the Government confirmed that the procedure for the peaceful settlement of disputes prescribed in the Labour Code was applicable to disputes at the Costa Rican Electricity Institute and the National Institute of Housing and Town Planning.\n.On the Committee's recommendation, in November  the Governing Body requested the Government to transmit the texts of the judgements pronounced in the cases of Messrs. Alfaro Ziga and Devandas Brenes, with the reasons adduced therefore.\n.The remaining dismissal involved Mr. Cristin Sobrado Chaves, General Secretary of the Union of Bank Employees of Costa Rica. He had been dismissed in February , according to the complainants, on the false pretext of unjustified absences from work. The Government stated inter alia that legal proceedings were pending in connection with this matter. In November  the Committee and the Governing Body drew attention to the importance of a rapid procedure for examining alleged cases of dismissal because of trade union activities. The Government was requested to supply the text of the judgement handed down in the case relating to the dismissal of Mr. Sobrado Chaves.\n.The documents and observations communicated by the Government on  June and  July  include the texts of the judgements requested. As concerns Mr. Devandas Brenes, it is stated in the judgements pronounced by the labour court and the Higher Labour Court in September and October  that he was discharged on  March  by the institute of Housing and Town Planning together with other workers, as part of a retrenchment of staff rendered necessary by financial difficulties. The judges considered it proven that Mr. Devandas Brenes had been dismissed for this reason and not arbitrarily or as a means of anti-union persecution, and that the employer had obtained authorisation in advance from an advisory board as required by the collective agreement. As regards Mr. Alfaro Ziga, the judgements, likewise of first and second instance, pronounced in March and May  state that he was dismissed in February  by the Costa Rican Electricity Institute. The union had filed a complaint with the Legislative Assembly against the authorities of the Institute, accusing them of corruption and mismanagement. The Assembly set up a commission of inquiry. Later the union executive had a statement published in the press accusing the authorities of the institute of anti-union persecution. The latter enjoined Mr. Alfaro Ziga to substantiate some of the charges made, which he did not do himself, but left it to the union, whereupon he was dismissed. The court considered that the dismissal was justified, observing, inter alia, that while the union was a separate legal entity from its members, this fact did not exonerate Mr. Alfaro Ziga from his responsibilities as an employee in his relations with his employer. According to the court, the statement published by the union was based on charges made personally by this employee, who did not substantiate them as instructed by his employer, and was thus guilty of dishonesty and disloyalty. The court considered that there was just cause for dismissal on the ground of serious non-compliance with the obligations deriving from a contract of employment as specified in the Labour Code.\n.The Government also supplies information concerning the criminal proceedings initiated in  against Messrs. Devandas Brenes and Alfaro Ziga on charges of riot"", '.The complaint from the Confederation of Democratic Workers (CCTD) was submitted by a communication dated  August ; that of the Trade Union of Workers in the Electrical and Telecommunications Industries (SITET) by a letter dated  March . SITET presented additional information on  April . The Government submitted its comments by letters dated  November and  December .\n.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.The CCTD states that during the th Session of the International Labour Conference () the Workers\' delegate of Costa Rica had accused his Government of trade union persecution and that the Government delegate had undertaken that his Government (including autonomous institutions) would not carry out any reprisals or persecution of any kind against trade union leaders. The complainants add that, disregarding this promise, the Costa Rican Electricity Institute (IOE), an autonomous body whose directors are appointed on government advice and in which there is a Minister appointed by the Central Government, had dismissed members of SITET and brought charges against Mr. Guido Nez Romn, Secretary-General of that union, accusing him of having used the right to strike, negotiated the signing of a collective agreement and exerted trade union pressure to that end.\n.SITET states in its letter of  March  that since its registration with the competent administration it has been subjected to considerable pressure from the IOE. Investigations carried out by a special Committee of the Legislative Assembly had revealed that the accusation was justified. A Member of Parliament had then tabled a motion to the effect that the terms of a loan from the Inter-American Development Bank should include trade union immunity (fuero) and the obligation to negotiate a collective agreement. The IOE administrators had then undertaken to change their policy towards the union.\n.In view of this commitment, the complainants continue, SITET had submitted a draft collective agreement in April , but one month later the Institute had transformed one of its own credit associations into a trade union called the ASDEICE and granted it all necessary privileges (furnished office, employee, car and driver, funds for the publication of a monthly bulletin, etc.). This ""home made"" union, continues the complainants, had also presented a draft collective agreement. Having received two drafts, IOE stated that the two organisations should first of all reach agreement, knowing very well that the puppet union would not agree to do so. The draft agreement had not, in fact, produced any results. Renewed pressure was exerted to make workers leave the SITET, and although the other union fell into Communist hands, according to the complainants, that did not change the IOE\'s attitude to ASDEICE, some of whose members were even promoted.\n.SITET then submitted a complaint to the Minister. As the manager of IOE stated that the dispute should be submitted to the labour courts, SITET had followed the procedure for the settlement of disputes of an economic and social nature. The parties had been summoned to appear for conciliation, but the IOE had refused to negotiate. SITET had then sought compulsory arbitration, but that had been refused since, under a special Constitutional provision, the Institute was not obliged to go to arbitration. At that point, the workers had decided to strike, although such action was illegal because IOE is a public service. The employer had then dismissed eight workers, all of whom had seventeen years\' service, not for participation in the strike but for unlawful acts harmful to the Institute. The complainant had asked the Ministry of Labour to investigate the unfair accusation and the charges had been proved to be unfounded, but the workers had not been reinstated. Also as a result of the strike, the Secretary-General of SITET, Guido Nez Romn, and other members of the executive, together with the dismissed workers, had been accused of incitement to the collective stoppage, which was an offence under Article  of the Labour Code; their case was under investigation.\n.Since then, SITET stated, the situation had become worse and pressure on the union had increased; workers had been dismissed on any pretext, without any of the benefits to which they were legally entitled. The management had organised what was known as the ""Group for the Preservation of the IOE"", composed of all the heads of department, who visited all the work centres to persuade workers to leave the union. According to SITET, it even writes letters of resignation for them. The campaign had enabled management to induce , members to leave the union. Whereas, according to the union rules, workers wishing to resign from the union must apply to the executive which then gives instructions for deductions in respect of union dues to cease, the IOE, according to the complainant, applies other methods. SITET is sometimes informed by the accounts department that a worker has decided to resign from the union and that his contributions would no longer be deducted from his pay; in such cases the union receives no other information than that given by IOE. In other cases, the worker sends his letter of resignation to the chief of personnel, who gives instructions for the deduction of union dues to cease and sends the union a copy of the worker\'s letter together with a copy of his own letter to the accounts department. Sometimes the worker communicates directly with the accounts department, which crosses the worker off its list. According to SITET, normal procedures are applied in the case of the other union; workers are not crossed off the list but are forced to remain in that organisation. It adds that it has lodged a complaint with the Ministry of Labour but so far has not heard of any action being taken.\n.The second communication from SITET concerns another practice of the same type: it claims that the chief of the personnel office ceased deducting the trade union dues of some workers, whereas the union had merely asked him to suspend the loan repayments to one of the union\'s bodies.\n.The Government replied by two communications of  November and  December . Concerning the dismissal of eight strikers, it pointed out that the action taken by IOE was illegal and referred in this connection to Section  of the Constitution and Sections , ,  and  of the Labour Code. Section  specifically bans strikes in public services and stipulates that any conflicts arising in such services shall be referred to the labour courts. Section  defines as public services all activities performed by employees of the State or of its institutions where the activities of the State or its institutions are not the same as those of private firms or agencies working for reward.\n.The Government submitted a copy of the ruling of the labour court (and that of the Supreme Labour Court confirming it), to the effect that negotiations had been broken off following a threat of strike which it declared to be illegal. Consequently, it is the Government\'s opinion that there were sufficient grounds for dismissal under Article  of the Labour Code. From later talks held with a view to restoring peace between the employer and workers, the IOE had appeared to be prepared not to dismiss workers merely for having gone on strike and to dismiss only those strikers who had acted in a manner prejudicial to the undertaking by deeds punishable under the Penal Code. In the light of that implicit undertaking and at the request of the trade union, the Ministry of Labour had carried out an investigation into the criminal liability of the dismissed workers. Seven of the eight had not participated in any punishable act, but the Institute nevertheless dismissed them, which it was legally entitled to do.\n.Regarding the criminal proceedings brought against the Secretary-General of SITET, the Government states that the IOE had brought legal proceedings pursuant to Sections ,  and  of the Penal Code. The articles in question read:\n.""The sanctions specified in section , increased by one-third for any person responsible for jeopardising the common weal, shall be imposed for:\n.""The penalty shall be imprisonment for six months to two years for any person guilty of creating a public danger or of impeding or hampering the normal operation of transport by land, sea, air or water, or of impeding or hampering public communication services or public power services in any form.\n.""The penalty shall be imprisonment for six months to two years and a fine consisting of a percentage of the income earned over a period of from  to  days for any person guilty of having urged officials or employees of public services collectively to abandon their work.""\n.The Government points out that Mr. Nez Roman has never been committed to gaol. The investigating magistrate had ordered ""imprisonment and trial"", but the accused had been left free pending trial and the case had not closed. During the proceedings, the counsel for the', '.The complaint from the Confederation of Democratic Workers (CCTD) was submitted by a communication dated  August ; that of the Trade Union of Workers in the Electrical and Telecommunications Industries (SITET) by a letter dated  March .
