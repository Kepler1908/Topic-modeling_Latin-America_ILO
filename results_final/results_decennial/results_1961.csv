0,".The Committee has already made several interim reports to the Governing Body on this case. At the May () Session it submitted the following recommendation in paragraph  of its rd Report:The Committee notes with interest the communication received from the Government, which quotes the operative part of the Supreme Court's judgment. Nevertheless, in view of the fact that the Court also refers to the judgments of first and second instance, which appear to have contained a detailed analysis of the reasons for the measures taken against Mr. Snchez Ossandn in the light of de facto and de jure aspects of the case, the Committee recommends the Governing Body, in order to secure all the material needed to come to a conclusion on this case, to request the Government to be good enough to forward copies of these judgments and their grounds.
.The rd Report was approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session (May-June ) and the request contained in paragraph  thereof was communicated to the Government by letter dated  June .
.The original complaint figures in a communication dated  August  which was sent to the I.L.O by the Chilean Confederation of Industrial and Commercial Workers. The same organisation gave supplementary information in a letter of  October . The Confederation of Privately Employed Clerical Workers submitted a complaint to the same effect in a letter dated  October . The above communications, and further information provided by the Chilean Confederation of Industrial and Commercial Workers in a letter of  January , were transmitted to the Government in due course.
.The Government of Chile sent its first reply on  November .
.Chile has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee last examined this case in full at its meeting in May , when it submitted an interim report in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, which was approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (May-June ).
.Chile has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.When it made the above-mentioned interim report the Committee recalled the terms of the complaint and the Government's reply, which contained details of the court proceedings arising out of the dismissal of a trade union official, Enrique Snchez Ossandn.
.The complainants allege that Mr. Enrique Snchez Ossandn, present Chairman of the Chilean Confederation of Industrial and Commercial Workers and a member of the Central Mixed Wages Commission, who was employed by Madeco S.A. (a copper-manufacturing company), was dismissed from that undertaking for having attended the th Session of the International Labour Conference, held in Geneva in June . The complainants add that Mr. Snchez Ossandn was appointed technical adviser to the workers under Decree No.  of  June ; that on the same day he informed Madeco of his appointment, sent a copy of the communication to the Labour Inspectorate and asked the Ministry of Labour to notify Madeco of the appointment, which was done on  June by official letter No. ; that Madeco, in its reply of  June  to official letter No. , stated that the company reserved all the necessary rights in regard to the situation created by Mr. Snchez Ossandn through having absented himself from his work without previous permission. The complainants enclosed with their complaint a copy of the said Decree No. , of the letters dated  and  June  and of official letter No.  of  June . When Mr. Snchez Ossandn returned to Chile and reported to the Madeco Company to resume his duties, he was not allowed access to his work and was informed that his services were terminated; he reported this to the Labour Inspectorate on  August and at the same time lodged a request with the labour court to be reinstated, since he enjoyed trade union privilege through being a member of the Central Mixed Wages Commission and Chairman of the Confederation of Metal Workers' Unions. Mr. Snchez Ossandn brought the case to the notice of the Ministry of Labour, which, according to the complainants, made representations to Madeco but could not induce the company to change its attitude. The complainants add that the attitude of Madeco is merely a continuance of a campaign of outright persecution against Mr. Snchez Ossandn on the sole ground of his trade union activity.
.In its reply dated  November  the Government of Chile stated that as soon as the competent authorities were informed of the matter they had instructed the labour services to investigate the facts and demand compliance with the rules protecting the privilege of trade union leaders, of whom Mr. Snchez Ossandn was one. The Government added that the Provincial Labour Inspectorate had taken measures accordingly and, in view of the undertaking's refusal to reinstate Mr. Snchez Ossandn, had laid information with the labour courts for contravention of the existing rules which forbid dismissal or the mere suspension of trade union rights without previous statutory permission. Further, the Government added in its reply, the Ministry of Labour had directly requested Madeco to explain the implications of its decision and, if possible, to reconsider the step it had taken, but was unsuccessful in this; a memorandum from the Managing Director of Madeco contended that Mr. Snchez Ossandn had not been dismissed but that his work contract had lapsed for reasons which might be summed up as frequent absences from work and abandonment of his post when he went to Geneva.
.When judgment had been given in the action against the firm of Madeco for failure to comply with statutory procedure governing the dismissal of a trade union official, the Government forwarded copies of the verdict given by the courts of first and second instance and, finally, by the Supreme Court. These verdicts showed that the firm had been sentenced to a fine for failure to comply with the law.
.Nevertheless, as regards the position of Mr. Snchez Ossandn, the Committee noted that a communication from the Government dated  February  stated that the Ministry of Labour had ascertained that he had not resumed work and had been paid no compensation, and that the case was still pending in the labour courts.
.In these circumstances the Committee took the view that the judgment of the labour courts might make available information that would be useful in appreciating whether the allegations were justified, and recommended the Governing Body to ask the Government to forward a copy of the judgment, and to decide in the meantime to postpone its examination of this aspect of the case.
.In a memorandum dated  December  the Government stated that the court of the first instance had dismissed Mr. Snchez Ossandn's case, but that he had lodged an appeal; when a final verdict had been given the Government would forward a copy.
.In view of this situation and the lack of any further information from the Government, the Committee decided, at its th, th, th and th meetings, to postpone its examination of the case while asking the Government to be good enough to forward the necessary information as soon as possible.
.In a memorandum dated  March  the Government supplied additional information about the case. The verdict given by the court of second instance was partly favourable to Mr. Snchez Ossandn, but the defendants lodged an appeal with the Supreme Court, which gave its judgment on  July . The latter body stated that all the facts recorded in the judgment of first instance showed in a way that left no room for doubt that the plaintiff repeatedly broke his contract of employment and that this constituted a ground for the lapsing of this contract, as stated by the defendants. Accordingly the Court accepted the latter's appeal and quashed the judgment of the court of second instance, upholding in all respects the judgment of first instance which had dismissed Mr. Snchez Ossandn's case.
.In all cases which are the subject of pending national judicial proceedings affording all the guarantees of normal judicial procedure the Committee has always followed the practice of not proceeding to examine such cases if the proceedings might make available information of assistance to the Committee in appreciating whether or not allegations were well founded. In many cases the Committee has asked governments to forward copies of judgments given and their grounds.
.The Committee has examined this case on two previous occasions: at its th Session (February ), when it submitted an interim report in paragraphs  to  of its st Report, which was approved by the Governing Body at the nd Session (June ); and at its nd Session (October ), when it submitted another interim report in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, which was approved by the Governing Body at the rd",0,1961,Chile
1,".In a communication dated  March  addressed directly to the I.L.O the S.O.I.M.A submitted a complaint concerning alleged violations of freedom of association in Argentina. In a subsequent letter dated  May  the complainants forwarded additional information in support of their complaint.
.At its th Session (May ), the Committee, not having received the observations requested from the Government, decided to postpone its examination of the case until its next meeting. The Government was informed of this decision by a letter dated  June .
.The Government forwarded its observations in a letter dated  September .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants allege that the S.O.I.M.A, which was established on  September  by workers in the stocking industry who had formerly belonged to the Association of Textile Workers (A.O.T.), applied to the Ministry of Labour and Social Security on  March  for trade status "" which is essential in order to be able to act officially on behalf of the membership in dealings with the Government and the employers "". The complainants added that, in Government Order No.  dated  October  (a copy of which they appended), the Ministry of Labour refused to grant the status requested by the S.O.I.M.A.
.In explanation of this refusal of trade status, Order No.  states "" according to the information contained on page  the applicant organisation has  dues-paying members whereas the Association of Textile Workers of Argentina, as indicated on page , has , dues-paying members in the stocking industry in the federal capital and , in the rest of the country-a number which suffices in itself to invalidate the applicant's case "" and adds "" in the circumstances and in view of the statement on page  that there are , workers in that branch the applicant organisation cannot in any way be considered as representative "". It would appear that, in assessing the membership of the S.O.I.M.A in accordance with section  of Act No.  respecting industrial associations of employees I which runs as follows: "" Where an association with trade status already exists, such status shall not be granted to another association for the same activity unless the number of members paying contributions to the latter over a continuous period of at least six months immediately prior to its application was greater than the number of members belonging to the association already granted such status "", a comparison had been made between the number of dues-paying members of the S.O.I.M.A. (the complainants argue that this number does not correspond with the facts) and the number of dues-paying members of the A.O.T which covered the same industry and already possessed trade status.
.The complainants also allege that the Court of Appeal annulled the trade status which the Ministry of Labour had in fact granted to another union "" for the sane reasons which led the Ministry of Labour to refuse; t to ours "" and they attach a cutting on the subject taken from La Prensa dated  May .
.In its reply dated  September  the Government states that, according to official returns, the S.O.I.M.A has only , members whereas the A.O.T has a member-, ship of ,. The Government adds that the S.O.I.M.A is therefore in no way a representative trade union and that under section  of Act No.  trade status must be granted to the union with a membership of ,, i.e. the majority of workers employed in the industry, and not to a union with only , members.
.The Government gives the following explanations on this point. Act No.  "" lays down a procedure for the granting of trade status to the union considered to be the most representative of the activity, occupation or undertaking concerned, with a view to making possible the performance of the major functions of trade unionism, including the conclusion of collective labour agreements covering all persons involved. The system adopted is a majority system, the objectivity of which will dispose of any doubts which may arise regarding the use of discretional powers in the granting of trade status for the above-mentioned purposes. There can be no doubt that the most representative organisation is that which acts most effectively in advancing the workers' interests and it is only logical that in a system like ours, in which there may be more than one trade union for a particular branch, occupation or undertaking and under which the workers in each activity or occupation can organise as many trade unions as they like, the right to conclude collective agreements should be granted exclusively to the most representative union.""
.The Committee observes that, while Order No.  refusing trade status to the S.O.I.M.A compared, for the purpose of assessing numerical size, the number of dues paying members of the S.O.I.M.A with the number of dues-paying members of the A.O.T in the stocking industry, the Government's reply dated  September  not only uses figures for both unions which are different from those mentioned in Order No. , but appears to compare the number of dues-paying members in the S.O.I.M.A with the total membership of the A.O.T.
.On several occasions, and particularly during discussion on the draft of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, the Conference referred to the question of the representative character of trade unions, and, to a certain extent, it agreed to the distinction sometimes made between the various unions concerned according to how representative they are. Article , paragraph , of the Constitution of the I.L.O states the concept of "" most representative "" organisations.
.Thus, the mere fact that the law of a country draws a distinction between the most representative trade union organisations and other trade union organisations is not in itself a matter for criticism, provided that such distinction does not accord to the most representative organisation privileges extending beyond the privilege of priority, on the ground of its having the largest membership, in representation for such purposes as collective bargaining or consultation by governments or for the purpose of nominating delegates to international bodies. In other words, this distinction should not have the effect of depriving trade union organisations not recognised as being among the most representative of the essential means whereby they may defend the occupational interests of their members, organise their administration and activities and formulate their programmes, as provided for in the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Argentina.
.The Committee has emphasised the great importance it attaches to the use of objective and predetermined criteria in deciding, under a system such as that existing in Argentina, which are the most representative trade unions, i.e. those entitled to trade status, and it recalled in another case involving Argentina, after a careful study of the law, that "" the independence of occupational organisations in relation to the public authorities might be compromised if the legislator or the executive power can effect a discrimination between the various organisations concerned which is not based on objective criteria and even more so where-as will be seen to be the case subsequently when the Argentine Act is analysed the consequences of the distinction between the different organisations are to reserve to certain organisations a monopoly both in respect of the determination of conditions of employment (collective bargaining, etc.) and in respect of the representation and defence of the interests of the workers in relation to the public authorities "".
.The Committee, in examining the case referred to in the previous paragraph, especially section  of Act No. , which states that a union possessing trade status forfeits it as soon as it ceases to be sufficiently representative and adds that "" account shall be taken of the number of its members, its trade union activity and its contribution to the defence and protection of occupational interests "", considered that the imprecise nature of the terms of this section might permit of abuse when the decision is taken by the Government whether or not to permit a particular trade union to retain its status.
.The Committee also took the view that, from the strictly trade union point of view, the functions allotted to the unions without trade status were extremely limited and recalled the definition given in Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Argentina, of the term "" organisation "", i.e. "" any organisation of workers or of employers for furthering and defending the interests of workers or of employers "".
.In view of the statutory distinction between organisations possessing trade status and ordinary trade unions, which implies that the latter are unable to defend their members' interests, the Committee considered that organisations without trade status do not have the right to organise in freedom their administration and activities and to",2,1961,Argentina
2,"of law formally laid information through the Provincial Labour Inspectorate in Santiago against Madeco for contravention of a law, the matter must now await a formal decision by the Court.
.The Committee observes that there appears to be no contradiction between the facts as stated by the complainants and the statement by the Government, which not only does not refute them but confirms them.
.Paragraph  of article  of the Constitution of the I.L.O provides: "" Delegates to the Conference, members of the Governing Body and the Director-General and officials of the Office shall likewise enjoy such privileges and immunities as are necessary for the independent exercise of their functions in connection with the Organisation.""
.The Committee considers, as it did in a previous similar case, that no delegate to any organ or conference of the I.L.O should be interfered with in any way to prevent or to deter him from carrying out his functions and that it is evident that if a delegate, after attending a conference convened by the International Labour Organisation, can become the subject of measures such as were taken in the present case, the possibility of such measures being taken is such as to prevent or to deter the delegate from carrying out his functions.
.The Committee recognises that the Government appears at once to have realised the importance of the case and to have intervened directly with the undertaking which employed Mr. Snchez Ossandn in order to induce it to reinstate him, and subsequently showed its strong disapproval of the contravention committed by the Madeco Company by initiating judicial proceedings which are now passing through the Provincial Labour Inspectorate in Santiago.
.In previous cases the Committee has followed the practice of not proceeding to examine matters which are the subject of pending judicial proceedings where the pending judicial decision may make available information of assistance to the Committee in appreciating whether or not allegations are well-founded.
.In the present case the Committee has considered it advisable to follow its usual practice and to ask the Director-General to request the Government to inform it of the result of the action instituted, and in particular, to furnish the text of the judgment given and of the legal reasons and conclusions adduced, and in the meantime to adjourn its further examination of the case.",-1,1961,Chile
3,"to have violated freedom of association;(c) to reaffirm that political matters not involving the exercise of freedom of association are outside the competence of the Committee and to decide that, in these circumstances, the Committee has no jurisdiction of the complaint in so far as the facts out of which it arose may have been acts of sabotage and is likewise incompetent to deal with the political matters referred to in the Government's reply;(d) to reaffirm that the fact that a complaint may have a political aspect does not relieve the Committee of its duty of examining whether or not an allegation of violation of freedom of association is well founded;(e) to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that it is bound by the obligations imposed by the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Cuba;(f) to reaffirm that the question whether a matter relates to a criminal offence or to the exercise of trade union rights is not one which can be determined unilaterally by the government concerned;(g) to request the Government, in accordance with the practice always followed in cases in which allegations as to sentences passed on trade unionists have been met with statements that such sentences were passed because of subversive activities or common law crimes, to indicate, in order to enable the Committee to reach a conclusion as to how far any question of freedom of association was involved, whether the appropriate and responsible court by which the sentences of death in the case of Messrs. Lesant Naser, Casielles Amig and Mndez Prez were pronounced was an ordinary court of law, and, if not, to give particulars as to its nature and procedure and to request the Government to furnish the text of the judgment given;(h) to decide that an emotional popular demand for the execution of a capital sentence cannot be invoked before the Freedom of Association Committee as evidence upon the question whether or not there has been a violation of freedom of association;(i) to draw the attention of the Government to the importance which the Governing Body has always attached to the fact that freedom from government interference in the holding and proceedings of trade union meetings constitutes an essential element of trade union rights and to the principle that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof;(j) to draw the attention of the Government to the importance which the Governing Body has always attached to the principle embodied in Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Cuba, that workers' organisations should have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom;(k) to draw the attention of the Government to the importance which the Governing Body attaches to the principle, embodied in Article  of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Cuba, that workers should enjoy adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment, including acts calculated to cause the dismissal of or otherwise prejudice a worker by reason of union membership or because of participation in union activities.",-1,1961,Cuba
4,"in Electricity, Gas and Water Undertakings, an organisation which apparently still exists in Cuba, but from which the complainants contend they were ousted as a result of threats by the Government. While the arguments of the Government on this contention are a matter for consideration when examining the merits of the case, the Committee considers that, in the circumstances, and following its earlier jurisprudence, the complaint should be regarded as receivable.
.The second contention of the Government is that no comparable complaints against the repression of the trade union movement by the previous rgime were entertained by the Committee. In fact, the Committee, in Cases No.  and , examined numerous allegations against the previous Cuban rgime, including allegations relating to arrests and acts of violence against trade unionists, and made recommendations to the Governing Body which were drawn to the notice of the Cuban Government.
.As regards the substance of the allegations, the Government declares that Messrs. Lesant Naser, Casielles Amig and Mndez Prez were arrested and sentenced in accordance with laws passed before the acts of terrorism which they committed and were convicted by an appropriate, responsible court. The Government contends that they conspired to destroy the electricity service and to commit terrorist acts and that, as the result of the activities of these persons and their associates, five of the main electrical substations in Havana were dynamited. The Government adds that no claim by the workers was involved and that no dispute with the workers was in progress and asks since when has the placing of bombs to blow up publicly owned undertakings been a trade union activity and since when has the storing of dynamite and conspiring to assassinate leaders of the Revolutionary Government and sabotaging the nationalised industries been one of the duties of trade unionists.
.If, in fact, the grounds on which the persons concerned were sentenced had no relation to the exercise of trade union rights, the matter would fall outside the competence of the Committee. In the past, however, the Governing Body has emphasised that the question as to whether such a matter is one relating to a criminal offence or to the exercise of trade union rights is not one which can be determined unilaterally by the government concerned. Where allegations as to arrests and sentences of trade unionists have been met by governments with statements that the arrests or sentences were on the ground of subversive activities or for common law crimes, the Committee has followed the rule that the governments concerned should be requested to submit further and as precise information as possible concerning the legal or judicial proceedings instituted and the result of such proceedings.
.In these circumstances, while it is not clear from the complaint how far questions relating to trade union rights may have been involved, the Committee considers that, having regard to the allegations that there was no evidence of sabotage by the persons concerned and that they were convicted by virtue of retroactive legislation and to the gravity of allegations concerning the loss of human life, it needs to have before it the text of the court decisions on which the Government relies before it can judge how far the contention of the Government that the cases involving the persons concerned were purely cases of sabotage, and not cases involving the exercise of trade union rights, is justified.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to request the Government to furnish the texts of the judgments in accordance with which the three persons concerned were sentenced to death.
.As stated in paragraph  above, the complainants also allege that the members of the executive committee of the Federation of Cuban Electricity, Gas and Water Workers, including the four signatories of the complaint, were threatened by the Government to make sure that the workers publicly demanded that the revolutionary tribunals should order the shooting of the aforesaid union members and that when they flatly refused to do so the Confederation of Trade Unions "" in collusion with the Government "" called meetings which were "" packed with individuals who had no connection at all with our industry "" and dismissed all the senior officials of the Federation from the Havana district branch.
.On this point the Government declares in its reply that it is untrue that it threatened the members of the executive committee of the Federation of Cuban Electricity, Gas and Water Workers that they must demand the shooting of the accused and it adds that ""All the workers spontaneously called for this sentence to be given "". It goes on to say that the meetings which dismissed the union officials from office were called and held in accordance with the union rules and were attended by more than , members of the Federation and the Havana district branch of the electricity, gas and water workers.
.While appreciating that the Government contends that the workers who were shot had been found guilty of sabotage, the Committee has serious difficulty in accepting without reservation the account of these events given by the Government. It is difficult to reconcile the statement that all the workers spontaneously called for the shooting of union members with the Government's further statement that  workers were suspended, some of whom will be given work only in places where they cannot commit sabotage. Nor can the existence of an emotional popular demand for the execution of a capital sentence properly be invoked before the Freedom of Association Committee as evidence upon the question whether or not there has been a violation of freedom of association.
.While noting that the Government denies the allegations to the effect that the members of the executive committee of the Federation of Cuban Electricity, Gas and Water Workers were threatened, the Committee is far from clear concerning the relationship between these allegations and the dismissals admitted by the Government.
.In this connection the Committee wishes to emphasise, as it did in Case No.  relating to conditions in Cuba under the previous Government, the importance which it has always attached to the fact that freedom from government interference in the holding and proceedings of trade union meetings constitutes an essential element of trade union rights, and to the principle that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof. It wishes to emphasise further, as it did in Case No.  relating to conditions in Cuba under the previous Government, the importance it has always attached to the principle that workers' organisations should have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom. The Committee recommends the Governing Body to draw the attention of the Government to the foregoing principles.
.The complainants also allege that as a result of the events described in paragraph  they were persecuted to such an extent that they were forced to take refuge in various embassies, where they lived for more than  days before finally going into exile.
.Lastly, the complainants allege that, after the executions took place, the Government dismissed more than  workers in the electricity industry without notice; that more than  workers in the same industry are in prison; and that as many again have had to give up their jobs as a result of the authorities' threats of imprisonment and that there are a number of union officials among them.
.On this point the Government declares in its reply that only  workers were suspended; that the proper procedure was observed in each case; that many workers have been reinstated in their jobs after due investigation; that others will be given work in places where they cannot commit sabotage; that it is false to say that hundreds upon hundreds of workers have been tortured and that "" There is not a trace of oppression of the workers in Cuba because the arms are in the workers' own hands and it is the workers who administer industry and the country itself "".
.In this connection the Committee recommends the Governing Body to draw the attention of the Government to the importance which it has always attached to the principle, embodied in Article  of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Cuba, that workers should enjoy adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment, including acts calculated to cause the dismissal of or otherwise prejudice a worker by reason of union membership or because of participation in union activities.
.In all the circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to reaffirm the duty of the Committee to examine all complaints which are receivable under the rules in force, irrespective of the government to which they relate, with equal impartiality;(b) to decide that the complaint is receivable, having regard to the principle on which the Committee has acted consistently since its First Report that a government cannot deny the right of complainants to submit a complaint by reason of measures taken against them which are alleged in the complaint",-1,1961,Cuba
5,"of the Government to the importance it has always attached to the principle that when trade unionists are accused of political or criminal offences which the government concerned considers to be outside the scope of their trade union activities, they should be given prompt and fair trial by an impartial and independent judicial authority, which principle takes on unusual importance in this case as the three trade unionists accused were sentenced to death and shot.
.The Committee also considers that the refusal of the Government of Cuba to co-operate with the Committee on Freedom of Association and the Governing Body calls for the formulation of certain observations which it wishes to bring to the attention of the Governing Body. Indeed, the Committee cannot but deplore the Government's repeated failure to co-operate in not having replied adequately to the reiterated requests of the Committee on Freedom of Association and the Governing Body for information on questions closely related to the fundamental rights of man to fair trial and personal freedom.
.Consequently, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to point out to the Government that it deplores the Government's repeated failure to co-operate in not replying adequately to the reiterated requests of the Committee on Freedom of Association and the Governing Body for information on questions closely related to the fundamental rights of man to a fair trial and personal freedom.
.In these circumstances the Committee, having regard to the fact that the Government has stated that the three trade unionists in question were sentenced to death and shot, recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the attention of the Government to the importance which the Governing Body has always attached-and which it attaches with particular emphasis in a case of such gravity as the present case-to the principle that when trade unionists are accused of political or criminal offences which the government concerned considers to be outside the scope of their trade union activities, they should be given prompt and fair trial by an independent judicial authority;(b) to deplore the inexplicable attitude of the government which has failed to reply adequately to  successive requests on behalf of the Committee on Freedom of Association and the Governing Body for information on questions closely related to the fundamental rights of man to fair trial and personal freedom.
.This case was examined by the Committee at its th Session (November ), when the Committee submitted to the Governing Body the conclusions contained in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ).
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to request the Government of Cuba to furnish as a matter of urgency the information requested in paragraph  (g) of the th Report of the Committee cited in paragraph  above.
.In a letter dated  February  addressed directly to the I.L.O, the Federation of Cuban Electricity, Gas and Water Workers (in Exile) submitted a complaint relating to alleged breaches of freedom of association in Cuba.
.The Government forwarded its observations in a letter dated  October .
.Cuba has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants allege that three fellow workers, viz. William Lesant Naser, Julio Casielles Amig and Orilio Luis Mndez Prez, were accused of having been materially responsible for acts of sabotage in Havana and were shot in January  after having been tried and sentenced to death "" despite the fact that it was not found possible to prove them guilty "". The complainants add that the court in this case applied a law which had not been promulgated until  days after the acts with which the accused were charged. The complainants also allege that the members of the executive committee of the Federation of Cuban Electricity, Gas and Water Workers, including the four signatories of the complaint, were, threatened by the Government to make sure that the workers publicly demanded that the revolutionary tribunals should order the shooting of the aforesaid union members and that when they flatly refused to do so the Confederation of Trade Unions "" in collusion with the Government "" called meetings which were "" packed with individuals who had no connection at all with our industry "" and dismissed all the senior officials of the Federation from the Havana district branch.
.In its reply dated  October  the Government begins by referring to the complaint as having been lodged "" by a group of four persons in exile who have conferred upon, themselves the intensely exaggerated title of the Federation of Cuban Electricity, Gas and Water Workers' "". The Government goes on to declare that "" it is deplorable that the I.L.O should have felt bound to give currency to this complaint by a group of privileged agents of the Electric Bond and Share Company against the Cuban Revolutionary People's Government, which has the support of the workers, the poor peasants, the intellectuals and the students and has organised armed militias-a Government which was bitterly fought by the United States monopolies and millionaire imperialists, by the former landowners and parasitical capitalists, by the thieving and tyrannical hack politicians dislodged from power and by the former corrupt, moneymaking, strike-breaking union leaders imposed on the workers by the tyranny of Batista "". The main contention of the Government appears to be that, while the I.L.O is prepared to examine allegations against the present Government, it did not examine complaints concerning the repression of the trade union movement under the previous rgime. The reply concludes as follows: "" There is not a trace of oppression of the workers in Cuba because the arms are in the workers' own hands and it is the workers who administer industry and the country itself. Action is only taken (in accordance with the law and with due respect for human dignity) against counter-revolutionaries, murderers, arsonists, terrorists, saboteurs and mercenaries who invade our country at the order of the United States Government. Never have the workers enjoyed so much freedom to meet, to settle their own problems, to discuss them with members of the Government, to hold demonstrations and to take part in the management and organisation of production. Only a government with the widest support among the workers and the entire people would turn the barracks into schools, form a militia, give arms to the workers and peasants and call: the people together to discuss questions of all kinds in public. Only a government with the unqualified backing of the people could defeat in less than  hours a well-planned and powerful attack launched by the United States Central Intelligence Agency with , well-armed mercenaries who made a surprise landing in the Zapata Marshes. This support is due to the fact that ours is a just and revolutionary government, a government of the workers, the poor peasants and the whole people, a government with a patriotic, democratic and socialist purpose.""
.The Government appears to question the right of four persons who, before they went into exile, were officials of the Federation of Cuban Electricity, Gas and Water Workers; to present the complaint, because, in its view, they were "" mercenaries "" who were thrown: out of office by their organisation as enemies of the new rgime.
.In paragraph  of its First Report, the Committee laid down the principle that it would be altogether inconsistent with the purpose for which the procedure for the examination of allegations concerning the infringements of trade union rights has been established for it to admit that the dissolution or purported dissolution of an organisation by governmental action extinguishes the right of the organisation to invoke the procedure. The Committee followed this principle, for example, in Case No.  relating to the Dominican Republic"" and in Case No.  relating to Cuba-, when the previous Government was in power. Pursuing the same line of reasoning, the Committee, in Case No.  relating to Venezuela examined in May , did not consider a complaint to be irreceivable because it relates to persons who no longer perform trade union duties as the result of a governmental measure dissolving the organisation to which they belonged and, in Case No.  relating to Spain  examined in October , did not consider a complaint irreceivable because former trade union leaders had set up a new organisation in a foreign country. The fact that their original organisation or a succeeding organisation has continued to exist in their own country, but under government control, has not been accepted by the Committee as a reason for refusing to entertain the complaint, although the question as to whether or not they were ousted from their old organisation by legitimate procedures is a factor which the Committee has had to consider when examining the complaint in substance.
.In the present case it is not disputed that the four signatories of the complaint were officials of the Cuban Federation of Workers",-1,1961,Cuba
6,".The Committee has already examined this case at its th Session (November ), when it submitted to the Governing Body a provisional report which appears in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ).
.Cuba has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants' allegations, analysed in paragraph  of the Committee's th Report, relate in particular to the shooting of three Cuban workers, William Lesant Naser, Julio Casielles Amig and Orilio Luis Mndez Prez, who had been accused of acts of sabotage.
.After examining the complainants' allegations, and the Government's reply, the Committee formulated, in paragraph  of this same report, certain recommendations and a request for additional information, in the following terms:
.In all the circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to reaffirm the duty of the Committee to examine all complaints which are receivable under the rules in force, irrespective of the government to which they relate, with equal impartiality;(b) to decide that the complaint is receivable, having regard to the principle on which the Committee has acted consistently since its First Report that a government cannot deny the right of complainants to submit a complaint by reason of measures taken against them which are alleged in the complaint to have violated freedom of association;(c) to reaffirm that political matters not involving the exercise of freedom of association are outside the competence of the Committee and to decide that, in these circumstances, the Committee has no jurisdiction of the complaint in so far as the facts out of which it arose may have been acts of sabotage and is likewise incompetent to deal with the political matters referred to in the Government's reply;(d) to reaffirm that the fact that a complaint may have a political aspect does not relieve the Committee of its duty of examining whether or not an allegation of violation of freedom of association is well founded;(e) to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that it is bound by the obligations imposed by the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Cuba;(f) to reaffirm that the question whether a matter relates to a criminal offence or to the exercise of trade union rights is not one which can be determined unilaterally by the government concerned;(g) to request the Government, in accordance with the practice always followed in cases in which allegations as to sentences passed on trade unionists have been met with statements that such sentences were passed because of subversive activities or common law crimes, to indicate, in order to enable the Committee to reach a conclusion as to how far any question of freedom of association was involved, whether the appropriate and responsible court by which the sentences of death in the case of Messrs. Lesant Naser, Casielles Amig and Mndez Prez were pronounced was an ordinary court of law, and, if not, to give particulars as to its nature and procedure and to request the Government to furnish the text of the judgment given;(h) to decide that an emotional popular demand for the execution of a capital sentence cannot be invoked before the Freedom of Association Committee as evidence upon the question whether or not there has been a violation of freedom of association;(i) to draw the attention of the Government to the importance which the Governing Body has always attached to the fact that freedom from government interference in the holding and proceedings of trade union meetings constitutes an essential element of trade union rights and to the principle that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof;(j) to draw the attention of the Government to the importance which the Governing Body has always attached to the principle embodied in Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Cuba, that workers' organisations should have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom;(k) to draw the attention of the Government to the importance which the Governing Body attaches to the principle, embodied in Article  of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Cuba, that workers should enjoy adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment, including acts calculated to cause the dismissal of or otherwise prejudice a worker by reason of union membership or because of participation in union activities.
.These recommendations, and the request for further information contained in subparagraph (g) of paragraph  of the th Report, were communicated to the Government by letter dated  November  and were again brought to its attention by letter dated  January .
.Having received no reply from the Government, at its th Session (February ) the Committee adjourned its examination of the case until its following session.,
.The Government was informed of this decision by letter dated  March  in which it was asked to furnish the information in question as early as possible and in any case before  April . A letter of reminder was sent to the Government on  April .
.As the information requested from the Government had still not been received, the Committee, at its st Session (May ), recommended the Governing Body to request "" the Government of Cuba to furnish as a matter of urgency the information requested in paragraph  (g) of the th Report of the Committee "".
.This request for information was communicated by letter of  June  to the Government of Cuba and an acknowledgment of receipt dated  June  was received indicating that the request had been transmitted to the "" competent body of the revolutionary Government for appropriate action "". On  August  the Government was sent another letter of reminder about the said request for information.
.Having received no reply from the Government, the Committee, at its nd Session (October ), adjourned its examination of the case until its following session.
.This decision was communicated to the Government by letter dated  November  also containing a request that it be good enough to send the said information at the earliest possible moment, and in any case not later than  January . A further letter of reminder was sent to the Government on  January .
.Not having received the information requested, the Committee, at its rd Session (February ), once more adjourned consideration of the case and requested the Government to furnish the information requested as speedily as possible, in time for it to be taken into account by the Committee when it examined the merits of the case at its following session.,
.This decision was communicated to the Government by letter dated  March  in which it was asked to furnish the said information at the earliest possible moment and before  April  at the latest. A letter of reminder was sent to the Government dated  April .
.The Committee notes that since its decision at its th Session (November ) to request certain further information in order to proceed with the examination of the case, and despite the despatch to the Government of  letters on the subject, it has been obliged to adjourn its examination of the case at its th, st, nd and rd Sessions, not having received the information requested.
.In regard to the merits of the case, and in the absence of a material reply from the Government of Cuba concerning the nature of the court which condemned Messrs. William Lesant Naser, Julio Casielles Amig and Orilio Luis Mndez Prez to death, on the procedure followed by that court and the text of the judgment given, the Committee cannot do otherwise than place on record that, in several earlier cases, it has stressed the importance it has always attached to the principle that when trade unionists are accused of political or criminal offences which the government considers to be outside the scope of their trade union activities, they should be given prompt and fair trial by an impartial and independent judicial authority, which principle takes on unusual importance in this case as the three trade unionists accused were sentenced to death and shot. If in certain cases the Committee has concluded that allegations relating to arrests or detentions of trade union militants did not call for further examination, this has been after it has received further information from the government showing sufficiently precisely and with sufficient detail that the arrests or detentions were in no way occasioned by trade union activities, but solely by activities outside the trade union sphere which were either prejudicial to public order or of a political nature.
.Consequently, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to draw the attention",-1,1961,Cuba
7,"formulate their programmes. "" Further, in view of the limited functions which are assigned to these organisations, it may be wondered whether the distinction does not infringe the generally recognised principle that workers shall have the right to establish and join organisations of their own choosing-a principle which is embodied in Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ).""
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the Government's attention once more to the fact that the privileged status accorded to organisations having trade status considerably curtails the means of action of organisations without such status and may indirectly operate against the freedom of the workers to join organisations of their own choosing, and to the desirability of reconsidering, in view of this fact, the distinction made between associations with trade status and other trade union organisations;(b) to draw the Government's attention to the importance which the Governing Body attaches to the principle that the determination of the most representative trade union should always be based on objective and pre-established criteria so that no union can accuse the Government of partiality in the matter.Geneva,  November .

.The complainants alleged that a Decision of  March  gave effect to a proposal, originating with an unidentified group of workers in the undertaking concerned and supported by the management, that a ballot be held to determine the desires of the workers with regard to the continuance or calling off of a strike. They added that steps of this kind had been taken without consultation of the most representative organisation and notwithstanding its clear opposition.
.The Government stated in its first reply that there is no statutory provision forbidding the holding of a ballot-at the request of the workers concerned-to decide whether to end or continue a strike, subject to the guarantees that the ballot be secret and that only workers take part to the exclusion of all outside parties whose interest in the continuance or ending of the strike might be motivated by other than plainly occupational reasons. The Government found it remarkable that an organisation of workers should consider it an act of interference "" for the Executive Power to collaborate with a view to the settlement of occupational problems free from coercion "" through the guarantee of a secret ballot among those concerned alone with no interference from outside parties who might have ulterior motives. The Government added in conclusion that in this case also no appeal had been made to the Administrative Disputes Tribunal.
.The Committee observed that, while the complainants alleged interference by the Government in the holding of a ballot to determine whether a strike should be continued or called off, the Government, on its side, found it remarkable than an organisation of workers should consider it an act of interference for the Executive Power to collaborate with a view to the settlement of occupational problems, and felt that before proceeding further with its examination of this aspect of the case it would wish the Government to specify the circumstances which led to the collaboration of the Executive Power and the exact form which this collaboration took.
.In its letter of  May  the Government transmits the text of the decision ordering a ballot to be held among the personnel of the undertaking affected by the strike. This states that the ballot was requested by a group of employees of the company concerned and that, provided exercise of the Constitutional right to strike is not thereby restricted, there is no reason why the Government should not accede to their request. Accordingly the Wages Councils Elections Tribunal was entrusted with organisation of the ballot.
.The Committee has dealt on many occasions with cases in which denial of the right to strike was alleged, and has followed the principle that it is competent in such matters in so far, but only in so far, as the prohibition affects the exercise of trade union rights. The Committee observes that in the present case there has been no prohibition of a strike. The Government expressly states that, in consequence of the Constitutional provisions which are in force, it is itself unable to adopt measures which would restrict the right to strike, from which it would seem to appear also that the exercise of this right cannot be prohibited by the Government when the results of the ballot are known. The Committee also observed that the organisation of the ballot was entrusted to a permanent, independent body and that the workers enjoyed the safeguard of a secret ballot.
.The Committee recommends the Governing Body to note the Government's statement that the Constitution does not empower it to restrict the exercise of the right to strike, but to emphasise the desirability, in situations such as that which arose in the present case, of consulting representative organisations with a view to ensuring freedom from any influence or pressure by the authorities which might affect the exercise of this right in practice.Allegations relating to Collective Bargaining Without Consultation of the Most Representative Trade Unions and in Spite of Their Categorical Opposition
.The complainants alleged that under a Decree dated  January  it is permitted to register multilateral agreements between undertakings and sections of their employees without consultation of the most representative trade unions and in spite of their categorical opposition.
.The Government first replied that in Uruguay it has always been understood that collective agreements may be concluded not only between members of organisations but also between undertakings and their employees, and that this is the understanding in national legislation, in Bills now under discussion and in the draft Labour Code, which has been signed without dissent by the legal adviser to the Uruguayan Federation of Salaried Employees in Commerce and Industry.
.The Committee observed that section  of the Decree of  January  stipulates that "" where no collective agreement has been registered by the most representative trade unions, the National Labour Institute is empowered to register agreements between undertakings and their personnel provided they are concluded by the management of the undertaking concerned and at least  per cent of its employees "". The Committee decided to ask the Government for additional information on this aspect of the case.
.In its reply of  May  the Government states that a collective agreement may be concluded between an undertaking and  per cent of its personnel even though an agreement between organisations is being negotiated at the time or it is intended to negotiate one; the personnel of an undertaking cannot be expected, the Government argues, to abstain from reaching an agreement on the leave system which suits it best merely because of a negotiation or intention which is by no means certain to bear fruit.
.The Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), which Uruguay has ratified, calls (in Article ) for measures ""to encourage and promote the full development and utilisation of machinery for voluntary negotiation between employers or employers' organisations and workers' organisations, with a view to the regulation of terms and conditions of employment..."". The Collective Agreements Recommendation,  (No. ), Paragraph  (), defines a collective agreement as an agreement concluded between "" an employer, a group of employers or one or more employers' organisations "" and "" one or more representative workers' organisations or, in the absence of such organisations, the representatives of the workers."".
.The Committee observes that the above-mentioned international instruments stress the role of workers' organisations as one of the parties in collective bargaining; they refer to representatives of unorganised workers only when there is no organisation. In these circumstances the Committee considers that direct negotiation between the undertaking and its employees, by-passing representative organisations where these exist, may be detrimental to the principle that negotiation between employers and organisations of workers should be encouraged and promoted.
.The Committee therefore recommends the Governing Body to draw the attention of the Government to the desirability of considering the possibility of taking steps to give full effect in the legislation to the aforesaid principle of collective bargaining with workers' representative organisations which is enunciated in the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Collective Agreements Recommendation,  (No. ).Allegations relating to the Absence of Measures to Protect the Workers against Dismissal for Anti-Union Reasons
.The complainants alleged that the Government had consistently failed to take adequate steps to protect the workers against dismissal from undertakings in an obviously discriminatory manner intended to encroach on freedom of association. They added that the victims of such measures had included officials of the complaining organisation, and that each such matter was brought to the notice of the authorities in due time.
.The Government stated in its first reply that obviously the Executive Power should confine its activities to ensuring compliance with the law, that any disputes which occur should be settled in accordance with legal procedure, and that only a person unacquainted with the principles governing a law-abiding State could claim that the Executive Power is invading the field of competence of the Judicial Power.
.The Committee recalled that under Article  of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), which has been ratified by Uruguay, workers must enjoy adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment. The same Article further specifies that such protection shall apply more particularly in respect of acts calculated to cause the dismissal of or otherwise prejudice a worker by reason of union membership or because of participation in union activities. The Committee noted that some of the alleged acts are of the very type that Convention No.  seeks to prevent. In view of the importance which the Committee has always attached to faithful observance of the principles embodied in this Convention, and bearing in mind that Article  of the Convention provides that machinery appropriate to national conditions shall be established where necessary for the purpose of ensuring respect for the right to organise, the Committee felt that in order to be able",0,1961,Uruguay
9,"to reach a final decision on this particular allegation in full awareness of the facts it should be informed as to what statutory or other provisions exist for the protection of the workers of Uruguay against any act calculated to cause their dismissal or otherwise prejudice them by reason of union membership, and also as to whether there is machinery to ensure respect for the right to organise.
.In its reply of  May  the Government states that as regards the protection of trade union officers against dismissal, although there is no statute ensuring the employment security of such persons, the rules laid down in Convention No.  are applied and Act No.  provides for sanctions in case of infringement.
.Article  of Convention No.  provides that ""workers shall enjoy adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment "". In this connection the Government points out that any infringement of the provisions of the Convention is punishable under domestic law and that any disputes which occur should be handled in accordance with legal procedure. But Article  of the Convention provides further that "" machinery appropriate to national conditions shall be established, where necessary "" to ensure respect for the right to organise. As the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations pointed out in its conclusions in  "" it may be difficult, if not impossible, for a worker to furnish proof "" regarding an act of anti-union discrimination against himself, for which reason, the experts stated, in certain countries, "" legislation affords special and more extensive protection to leaders of trade unions "". It is in such a contingency that the implementation of Article  of the Convention is of special importance.
.In these circumstances, since acts of discrimination against workers, including trade union officers, appear to have been committed-a fact which the Government does not deny-and having regard to the consideration set forth in the preceding paragraph, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to suggest to the Government that it may care to examine the problem of anti-union discrimination in Uruguay and to take special concrete action which will afford adequate protection to workers, as appropriate to national conditions, in accordance with the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).Allegations relating to a Bill to Introduce Regulations Governing Trade Unions
.The complainants alleged that the Government intends to approve a Bill dated  February  under which-(a) trade unions would be required to obtain previous authorisation to carry on activity; (b) restrictions would be imposed on trade unions with regard to the right to draw up their statutes; (c) the public authorities would be empowered to make the granting of legal personality to occupational organisations subject to certain conditions; and (d) restrictions would be placed on the right to form federations and Confederations. In addition, the complainants argued that the Bill fails to give the workers and their organisations any safeguard against what are described in Convention No.  as "" acts of interference ""; that it allows-and even authorises-organisations under the domination of employers to enter into collective agreements; and that it makes the exercise of fundamental trade union rights, such as the right to strike, subject to the completion of formalities in which the representative trade union organisations have no part and over which they have no control. By their communication of  May  the complainants sent a copy of the Bill and additional information concerning it.
.In its first reply the Government said it was remarkable that the complaining organisation should raise this question when it was common knowledge that the Bill had not yet come before Parliament; notwithstanding this, the Ministry of Industries and Labour held the view that the framing of regulations governing trade union activities is a task which irrevocably falls upon the government in a law-abiding State.
.In a number of cases the Committee has had to decide how far it should go in expressing an opinion on proposed legislation. While in some cases the Committee has recommended the dismissal of allegations in this regard on the grounds either that the allegations were too vague or that the Bill in question had not been sponsored by the government, it has nevertheless remarked that in the face of precise and detailed allegations concerning a proposed enactment the fact that the allegations relate to a text which does not have the force of law should not of itself prevent the Committee from expressing its opinion on the merits of the allegations made. It has expressed the opinion that in such circumstances it is desirable that the government and the complainants should be made aware of the Committee's point of view with regard to a proposed Bill before this is enacted, in view of the fact that it is open to the government, on whose initiative such a matter depends, to make any amendments which may seem desirable.
.Although in the present case the Government stated that the Bill has not yet come before Parliament, the Committee was not absolutely clear as to whether it had been completely dropped. In these circumstances the Committee felt that before going; further into this aspect of the case it should ask the Government whether there is any likelihood that the Bill in question will come before Parliament at a later stage.
.In its reply of  May  the Government states that the draft trade union regulations of  February  were removed from the Bill in which they had been included and that, owing to its defects, the Bill was never considered by Parliament. The Government also states that removal of the draft from the Bill makes it impossible for Parliament to give it formal consideration.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to take note of the above statement by the Government, but expresses the hope that, if any Bill to regulate trade unions should be contemplated in the future, full regard will be had to the provisions of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Uruguay.
.In all the circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to suggest to the Government that it might care to consider providing that, in the exceptional event of neither the titular nor the deputy workers' (or employers') representative on a wages council discharging his functions, the member appointed by the authorities shall normally be a person belonging to the industry or occupation concerned;(b) to take note, as regards the allegation relating to governmental interference in a strike, of the Government's statement that the Constitution does not empower it to restrict the exercise of the right to strike, but to emphasise the desirability, in situations such as that which arose in the present case, of consulting representative organisations with a view to ensuring freedom from any influence or pressure by the authorities which might affect the exercise of this right in practice;(c) to draw the attention of the Government to the desirability of considering the possibility of taking steps to give full effect in the legislation of the principle of collective bargaining with workers' representative organisations, which is enunciated in the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Collective Agreements Recommendation,  (No. );(d) to suggest to the Government that it may care to examine the problem of antiunion discrimination in Uruguay, having regard to the considerations set forth in paragraph  above, and to take special concrete action which will afford adequate protection to workers as appropriate to national conditions, in accordance with the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. );(e) to take note, as regards the allegations relating to a Bill to introduce regulations governing trade unions, of the Government's statement that consideration of the draft by Parliament has become impossible, but to express the hope that, if any Bill to regulate trade unions should be contemplated in the future, full regard will be had to the provisions of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Uruguay.",-1,1961,Uruguay

.Paragraph  of the th Report reads as follows:
.In the circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to request the Government, having regard to the fact that Mr. Snchez Ossandn was dismissed by his employer on his return from the International Labour Conference as adviser to the Workers' delegate and that a penalty has been imposed by the Supreme Court on the employer, to indicate whether he has been reinstated with the Madeco company or, if this is not the case, in what way he has been compensated for the harm done to him by his dismissal;(b) to request the Government to furnish its observations as soon as possible on the allegation that the Chilean Confederation of Industrial and Commercial Workers was unable to put forward candidates for membership of the Workers' delegation to the th Session of the International Labour Conference for fear of reprisals by the employers.
.That decision of the Governing Body was communicated to the Government by letter dated  November .
.At its rd Session (February ) the Committee deferred consideration of the case because it had not received the information requested from the Government.
.The Chilean Government sent the said information on  February .
.The original complaint was contained in a communication addressed directly to the I.L.O on  August  by the Chilean Confederation of Industrial and Commercial Workers.
.In a letter dated  October  the Chilean Confederation of Privately Employed Clerical Workers submitted a complaint on the same grounds. The Chilean Confederation of Industrial and Commercial Workers supplemented by a letter dated  October  the information contained in its first communication. The contents of both letters were communicated to the Government on  November . By a communication dated  January  the Chilean Confederation of Industrial and Commercial Workers furnished further information, which has also been transmitted to the Government.
.Chile has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In all the circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide, with regard to the allegations relating to the dismissal of a trade union officer, to request the Government to furnish the text of the judgment in the action initiated by Mr. Snchez Ossandn before the labour courts, and to defer further examination of these allegations for the time being.
.The Committee has already examined this case at its th Session (February ), when it submitted an interim report in paragraphs  to  of its st Report, which was approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session (June ).
.Paragraph  of the st Report reads as follows:
.In the present case the Committee has considered it advisable to follow its usual practice and to ask the Director-General to request the Government to inform it of the result of the action instituted and, in particular, to furnish the text of the judgment given and of the legal reasons and conclusions adduced, and in the meantime to adjourn its further examination of the case.
.The Governing Body's decision to this effect was communicated to the Government of Chile by letter dated  June .
.By a communication dated  September  the Chilean Government has furnished the information requested.
.The original complaint was contained in a communication addressed directly to the I.L.O on  August  by the Chilean Confederation of Industrial and Commercial Workers.
.In a letter dated  October  the Chilean Confederation of Privately Employed Clerical Workers submitted a complaint on the same grounds. The Chilean Confederation of Industrial and Commercial Workers supplemented by a letter dated  October  the information contained in its first communication. The contents of both letters were communicated to the Government on  November . By a communication dated  January  the Chilean Confederation of Industrial and Commercial Workers furnished further information, which has been transmitted to the Government.
.In the circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to request the Government, having regard to the fact that Mr. Snchez Ossandn was dismissed by his employer on his return from the International Labour Conference as adviser to the Workers' delegate and that a penalty has been imposed by the Supreme Court on the employer to indicate whether he has been reinstated with the Madeco company or, if this is not the case, in what way he has been compensated for the harm done to him by his dismissal;(b) to request the Government to furnish its observations as soon as possible on the allegation that the Chilean Confederation of Industrial and Commercial Workers was unable to put forward candidates for membership of the Workers' delegation to the th Session of the International Labour Conference for fear of reprisals by the employers.
.In a communication addressed to the I.L.O on  August  the Chilean Confederation of Industrial and Commercial Workers submitted a complaint of alleged violations of freedom of association in Chile. This complaint was communicated to the Government on  September .
.In a letter dated  October  the Chilean Confederation of Privately Employed Clerical Workers submitted a complaint on the same grounds. The Chilean Confederation of Industrial and Commercial Workers supplemented by a letter dated  October  the information contained in its first communication. The contents of both letters were communicated to the Government on  November . By a communication dated  January  the Chilean Confederation of Industrial and Commercial Workers furnished further information, which has been transmitted to the Government.
.In a communication dated  November  the Government of Chile presented its observations on the complaints which had been transmitted to it on  November .
.The complainants allege that Mr. Enrique Snchez Ossandn, present Chairman of the Chilean Confederation of Industrial and Commercial Workers and a member of the Central Mixed Wages Commission, who was employed by Manufacturas de Cobre (Madeco) S.A., was dismissed from that undertaking for having attended the th Session of the International Labour Conference, held in Geneva in June , as adviser to the Chilean Workers' delegate. The complainants add that Mr. Snchez Ossandn was appointed adviser to the Workers' delegate under Decree No.  of  June ; that on the same day Mr. Snchez Ossandn informed Madeco of his appointment, sent a copy of the communication to the Labour Inspectorate and asked the Ministry of Labour to notify Madeco of the appointment, which was done on  June by official letter No. : that Madeco, in its reply on  June  to official letter No. , stated that the company reserved all the necessary rights in regard to the situation created by Mr. Snchez Ossandn through having absented himself from his work without previous permission. The complainants enclosed with their complaint a copy of the said Decree No. , of the letters dated  and  June  and of official letter No.  of  June .
.Again, according to the complainants, when Mr. Snchez Ossandn returned to Chile and reported to the Madeco company to resume his duties, he was not allowed access to his work and was informed that his service was terminated; he reported this to the Labour Inspectorate on  August and at the same time lodged a request with the Labour Tribunal to be reinstated, since he enjoyed trade union privilege through being a member of the Central Mixed Wages Commission and also Chairman of the Confederation of Metal Workers' Unions. Mr. Snchez Ossandn brought the case to the notice of the Ministry of Labour who, according to the complainants, made representations to Madeco, but could not induce it to change its attitude. The complainants add that the attitude of Madeco is merely a continuance of a campaign of outright persecution against Mr. Snchez Ossandn on the sole ground of his trade union activity.
.In its reply dated  November  the Government of Chile states that as soon as the competent authorities were informed of the matter they instructed the labour services to investigate the facts and demand compliance with the rules protecting the privilege of trade union leaders, a position held by Mr. Snchez Ossandn. The Government adds that the Provincial Labour Inspectorate took measures accordingly and, in view of the undertaking's refusal to reinstate Mr. Snchez Ossandn, laid information with the Labour Courts for contravention of the existing rules which forbid dismissal or the mere suspension of trade union rights, without previous statutory permission. Further, the Government adds in its reply, the Ministry of Labour directly requested Madeco to explain the implications of its decision and if possible to reconsider the step it had taken, but was unsuccessful in this; a memorandum from the Managing Director of Madeco S.A. contended that Mr. Snchez Ossandn was not dismissed but that his work contract had lapsed for reasons which may be summed up as frequent absences from work and abandonment of his post when he went to Geneva. The Government concludes by saying that, since the Ministry of Labour has by process",0,1961,Chile
11,".The Committee has already examined this case at its th Session (May ) and, with the exception of one allegation by the complainants, submitted its final conclusions to the Governing Body concerning the case as a whole. These conclusions were adopted by the Governing Body at its th Session (June ).
.At its meeting in May  the Committee further examined this case, considering the sole allegation which remained outstanding, namely the alleged refusal by the management of the National Bank to comply with certain court orders in respect of the trade union leader Mr. Ral Ignacio Robacio, and made the following recommendation to the Governing Body (paragraph  of its nd Report, approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session in June )In consequence the Committee recommends the Governing Body to ask the Government specifically whether the Labour Court of Appeal, before giving its final judgment, ordered the Bank not to proceed with Mr. Robacio's posting until such judgment was pronounced.
.The Argentine Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.By a communication dated  July  the Government forwarded certain additional information in relation to this allegation.
.The allegation still outstanding concerns the posting by the management of the National Bank of Mr. Ral Ignacio Robacio, General Secretary of the Buenos Aires Bank Employees' Union (S.E.B.B.A.), to a branch  kilometres away from Buenos Aires - this is said to be a measure of anti-union discrimination - while at the same time an administrative charge was initiated against him designed to convert this posting into an outright dismissal.
.The LF.C.T.U stated that the S.E.B.B.A then applied to the judge for an injunction to prevent any modification in Mr. Robacio's position until judgment had been given in a lawsuit brought by the union. Although the judge granted this injunction, the Bank refused to comply with it, despite a further sentence by the same judge against the Chairman of the Bank for contempt of court. The Bank authorities having appealed against the labour judge's decision, the Labour Court of Appeal on  April  affirmed the interlocutory injunction granted by the judge. The National Bank refused to comply with this order also. These statements of the I.F.C.T.U have been supported by the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions of Salaried Employees, Technicians, Supervisors and Commercial Travellers.
.Having noted that the Government in its reply had refrained from making any comment on this point, the Committee took the view at its th Session (May ) that it would be advisable to adjourn examination of this particular aspect of the case pending receipt of information from the Government, and it made a recommendation to the Governing Body to this effect.
.The Committee's conclusions as adopted by the Governing Body, and in particular the request for information on the matters mentioned above, were brought to the notice of the Government by a letter from the Director-General dated  July .
.The Government replied by a communication dated  September . This reply, however, still contained no information on the points referred to above.
.In these circumstances the Committee at its th Session (November ) recommended the Governing Body to request the Government once again to furnish information in respect of the allegations to the effect that the management of the National Bank had not complied with the injunction granted by the labour judge, and subsequently affirmed by the Labour Court of Appeal, relating to the situation of the General Secretary of the S.E.B.B.A.
.In a communication dated  November  the Government forwarded further information concerning the allegation.
.In its communication dated  November  the Government stated that Mr. Ral Ignacio Robacio's posting was a normal one for which provision was made in the statutory regulations governing public employees, and that in any case Mr. Robacio had not accepted his posting and had refused to take up the new duties assigned to him. The Government added that Mr. Robacio had then lodged an appeal for protection with the sitting labour judge, who ordered the Bank not to proceed with the posting, but the Bank had refused to acknowledge the competence of the labour court and lodged an appeal to have the decision quashed. The Labour Court of Appeal-continued the Government-had affirmed the decision in that the court was competent to hear the case, but quashed the judge's decision in favour of protection. The Government concluded by stating that Mr. Robacio had open to him all legal avenues for establishing his rights, "" which proved the existence of effective legal guarantees such as characterise a system of justice "".
.The Committee observed at its th (February ) Session that the complainants' statements and those of the Government were not in themselves contradictory with each other. The Committee also observed, however, that while the Government confirmed the complainants' statement to the effect that when Mr. Robacio had appealed to the labour judge for protection the latter had ordered the Bank not to proceed, and that later the Labour Court of Appeal had affirmed the decision as to the competence of the court to hear the case, it made no reference to the contempt of court, alleged by the complainants to have been committed by the National Bank in declining to accept the rulings of the labour judge and of the Labour Court of Appeal that it should not go forward with Mr. Robacio's posting.
.In these circumstances the Committee considered that it was essential, if it was to reach a decision on this aspect of the case, for it to know whether it was correct-as the complainants alleged-that the National Bank had on a number of occasions flouted the decisions of the judicial authorities and, if so, what measures had been taken by the Government in this respect.
.Furthermore, the Committee felt that it would be difficult for it to take a decision without knowing the exact circumstances surrounding this particular allegation, and to this end it would be advisable, in accordance with its usual practice, to request the Government to forward copies of the judgments, together with all the conclusions of law and findings of fact given in this connection by the judge of first instance and the Labour Court of Appeal, instead of a summary of the dispositive part of these judgments such as the Government had given in its communication of  November .
.In its communication of  April  the Government repeats what it stated in its communication of  November  and adds that "" it should be borne in mind that under Argentine law the lodging of an appeal in protection cases has a suspensive effect, whereby in virtue of the appeal by the President of the Argentine National Bank against the ruling of the judge of first instance the proceedings remained in a state of suspense until the Labour Court of Appeal pronounced its final judgment quashing the decision of the judge of first instance in favour of protection "". The Government adds that this procedural formula does not imply, "" as the complainants mistakenly claim, a refusal to bow to the authority of the judge of first instance "".
.The Committee observed at its preceding session (May ) that in its communication of  April the Government had affirmed that under Argentine law the lodging of an appeal in protection cases has a suspensive effect, and that in consequence there was a stay of execution of the ruling of the judge of first instance in the case in question until the Labour Court of Appeal pronounced its final judgment. The Committee also observed, however, that the complainants had alleged that the injunction not to proceed with Mr. Robacio's posting was granted in the first place by the judge of first instance and subsequently ( April ) affirmed by the Labour Court of Appeal. Noting that the Government, in its various communications, had never expressly denied that the Labour Court of Appeal-as alleged by the complainants-ordered the Bank not to proceed with Mr. Robacio's posting until final judgment was pronounced, the Committee felt that if it was to come to a decision in full awareness of the facts on this aspect of the complaint it would be helpful to have this point cleared up by the Argentine Government. Accordingly, it recommended the Governing Body to ask the Government specifically whether the Labour Court of Appeal, before giving its final judgment, ordered the Bank not to proceed with Mr. Robacio's posting until such judgment was pronounced.
.In its reply of  July  the Government states that at no stage did the Labour Court of Appeal issue an order not to proceed with Mr. Robacio's posting. Furthermore the Government repeats a number of minor points figuring in its previous statements, to the effect that the complainants confuse the machinery of appeal with suspensive effect and an alleged refusal to comply, which never occurred.
.The Committee notes the Government's statement that the",2,1961,Argentina
12,"Labour Court of Appeal at no time issued an order not to proceed with Mr. Robacio's posting; it would appear to follow from this answer that the National Bank did not refuse to comply with any decision by the Labour Court of Appeal, since the said Court did not issue an order "" not to proceed "" but did issue a decision by which-because it considered the application for protection to have been unfounded-it quashed the decision of the labour judge. It would seem, moreover, that Mr. Robacio had open to him all legal means of establishing his rights and that accordingly there is no further object in proceeding with this aspect of the case.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that the outstanding allegation relating to refusal by the National Bank to comply with certain court orders does not call for further examination.",0,1961,Argentina
13,".The present case has already been examined by the Committee at its nd Session (October ), when it was decided to ask the Government for additional information on several aspects of the complaint. This was presented by the Uruguayan Federation of Salaried Employees in Commerce and Industry and set forth in a communication from that organisation dated  April , supplemented by another of  May . The Government of Uruguay sent its observations by letter dated  May  and gave the requested additional information in a letter of  May .
.At its th Session (May ) the Committee decided to defer consideration of the case until the autumn session because the additional information sent by the Government had arrived too late to be able to be examined in May.
.Uruguay has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complaint presented by the Uruguayan Federation of Salaried Employees in Commerce and Industry comprises five sets of allegations : the first concerns government interference in the appointment of members of wages councils; the second refers to government interference in the holding of a ballot to determine whether a strike should be continued or called off; the third to collective bargaining without consultation of the most representative trade unions and in spite of their categorical opposition; the fourth to the absence of measures to protect the workers against dismissal for anti-union reasons; and the fifth to a Bill to introduce regulations governing trade unions. Each set of allegations is discussed separately below.Allegations relating to Government Interference in the Appointment of Workers' Representatives on Wages Councils
.The complainants alleged that under the Decision of  September  the representatives of the textile workers on the Wages Council for that industry, who had been appointed in accordance with the relevant national legislation and enjoyed the support of the organisation representing the workers concerned, were replaced by persons who enjoyed the trust of the public authorities but were not members of the industry in question and were consequently repudiated by the union directly concerned and all the other workers' organisations.
.In its reply dated  May  the Government stated that the workers' representatives were replaced because the situation had arisen for which provision is made in section  of the Act of  November , namely:The decisions of the wages councils shall be adopted by a simple majority, but no vote in respect of wages may be taken without such vote being placed on the agenda and without notice thereof being given at least  hours beforehand Provided that a vote may be taken without the foregoing conditions being complied with if it is unanimously so decided. For a vote to be valid all three sectors must be represented by delegates.In cases where the absence from three sittings of one or more delegates renders it impossible for valid decisions to be taken, any member shall be empowered to request the Ministry of Industries and Labour that substitutes be co-opted to the Council, in accordance with the established procedure.The Government added that the replacement was consequently effected in accordance with the procedure laid down by law, and that though there exists a right to appeal against administrative decisions (article  of the Constitution) to a body completely independent from the political authorities (the Administrative Disputes Tribunal), which has jurisdictional powers and enjoys the utmost confidence of all sectors of public opinion, no appeal had been made to the aforementioned body against the administrative act in question. The Government further stated that national practice had always held that in cases where delegates had to be appointed by the authorities the persons chosen should not be members of the industry involved; that this was how the Executive Power had always understood it; and that the signatory to the complaint himself, Mr. Jos d'Elia, had also shared this view, even though he now took the opposite stand. As proof it attached a copy of the Official Gazette dated  February , in which it is stated that Mr. Jos d'Elia was appointed by the authorities to be workers' representative in the plastics industry, in which he had never worked.
.The Committee observed that, while the complainants contended that the person appointed as workers' representative on the Wages Council came from outside the industry in question-the textile industry in this instance-the Government declared that it had followed the procedure laid down by law for cases of repeated absence of titular members, and that according to national practice representatives appointed by the authorities should not be members of the industry involved, this view having been shared by the signatory to the complaint himself when he agreed on an earlier occasion to his appointment by the authorities as workers' representative on the wages council of an industry in which he had never worked.
.The Committee observed that section  of Act No.  of  November  establishing the wages councils stipulates that candidates for election as representatives must be drawn from a list of "" salaried and wage-earning employees in the industry or trade or belonging to trade union bodies."".
.The Committee considered, moreover, that the fact that one of the complainants had at one time shared the Government's viewpoint and accepted appointment as workers' representative on a wages council for an industry in which he had never worked, did not preclude him from adopting a condemnatory attitude now, in a similar case.
.The Committee felt that the appointment by the authorities, to replace the workers' delegate, of a person from outside the industry concerned appeared to run counter to section , quoted above, in which it is stated that the representation of the workers in a given industry on the wages council for that industry should be entrusted to workers in that industry and no other.
.Before going further into this aspect of the case the Committee decided to ask the Government to give the reasons why members of wages councils appointed by the authorities should be persons from outside the industry concerned and not members of it as stipulated by section  of the above-mentioned Act when referring to the election of workers' representatives on wages councils.
.In its reply of  May  the Government states that opinions are divided as regards the conditions which members of wages councils appointed by the authorities are required to fulfil; whereas the chair of labour law in the Faculty of Law, the Executive Power and trade union leaders consider that such members do not have to fulfil the conditions required by law in respect of members nominated by the occupational associations (inter alia, the requirement of belonging to the industry or occupation concerned), a second school of thought-including the Office of the Legal Adviser to the Ministry of Industries and Labour-considers that members appointed by the authorities should fulfil all the said conditions; but neither statute nor doctrine justifies the statement that persons outside the industry or occupation necessarily must be appointed.
.The Committee observes that there does not appear to be a clear doctrine as to the conditions which must be fulfilled by persons appointed by the authorities to complete the membership of the wages councils and notes the Government's view that neither statute nor doctrine justifies the statement that persons outside the industry or occupation must be appointed. The Committee observes that in Uruguay wages are determined in general by a network of wages councils, the function of which is to fix minimum wages.
.Uruguay has ratified the Minimum Wage-Fixing Machinery Convention,  (No. ). Under Article , paragraph , of that Convention "" the employers and workers concerned shall be associated in the operation of the machinery, in such manner and to such extent, but in any case in equal numbers and on equal terms, as may be determined by national laws or regulations "". The principle that it should be "" the employers and workers concerned "" who should take part in the deliberations and decisions of the wage-fixing body is also set forth in the Minimum Wage-Fixing Machinery Recommendation,  (No. ).
.The above principle is embodied in Uruguayan legislation by Act No.  of . However, as regards the appointment of members of wages councils by the authorities, the legal position seems to be doubtful. In these circumstances and having regard to the fact that Convention No.  provides for the association of employers and workers ""in such manner and to such extent, but in any case in equal numbers and on equal terms, as may be determined by national laws and regulations "", the Committee recommends the Governing Body to suggest to the Government that it, might care to consider providing that, in the exceptional event of neither the titular t nor the deputy workers' or employers' representative on a wages council discharging his functions, the member appointed by the authorities shall normally be a person belonging to the industry or occupation",1,1961,Uruguay
14,".The complaint lodged by the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions was contained in a communication sent directly to the International Labour Office on  September . The Argentine Government sent its observations in a note dated  January . The Committee examined the complaint at its February  meeting and decided to ask the Government for further information. The Government sent new information in notes dated  April and  May . At its November  meeting the Committee examined the case afresh, arriving at certain conclusions, and again decided to request the Government for further information. The Government replied by a communication dated  January .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.Although the Government did not reply fully to the request for information, the Committee gathers from its reply that as soon as the administrative resolutions withdrawing legal personality and trade union status from the organisations concerned were issued, the said measures and their consequences for trade union rights of these organisations became immediately effective. In practice, the organisations in question only appear to have recovered the rights conferred by Act No.  upon occupational associations with legal personality and trade union status after these resolutions had been reversed by a court decision or when the Ministry of Labour and Social Security had issued fresh resolutions restoring legal personality and trade union status to the union concerned.
.In view of the foregoing, and bearing in mind the powers conferred by the above Act on occupational associations with legal personality and trade union status, the Committee considers that the possibility under Argentine legislation of the adoption with immediate effect of such measures as the suspension or dissolution of a workers' organisation by administrative authority constitutes a violation of the provisions of Article  of Convention No. . In matters of this kind the Committee must look beyond the form of the action taken to its substantial nature and effect. While the organisations in question may not have been formally suspended or dissolved, the action taken in respect of them is tantamount to suspension or dissolution in its practical effect. The Convention as a guarantee of a fundamental freedom is concerned not only with words but also with realities, and the Committee must therefore look beyond the form to the substance.
.As the Committee has already had occasion to emphasise in the past, where suspension measures are issued by administrative authority, there may be a danger that they will appear to be arbitrary, even though they are issued only temporarily or for a limited time as a preliminary to subsequent court action. Accordingly, the Committee considers that for the satisfactory application of the principle contained in Article  of Convention No. , it is not sufficient for legislation to grant the right of appeal against suspension or dissolution decisions issued by administrative authority, but such decisions should not come into effect until the statutory period has expired, without an appeal being lodged, or until they have been confirmed by a court verdict.
.As already pointed out in connection with the refusal to register a trade union, and in accordance with the observations made by the I.L.O. Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, the Committee would emphasise that if the administrative authority has a discretionary right to register or cancel the registration of a trade union, the existence of a procedure of appeal to the courts does not appear to be a sufficient guarantee; in effect this does not alter the nature of the powers conferred on the administrative authorities, and the judges hearing such an appeal would only be able to ensure that the legislation had been correctly applied. Accordingly, the Committee must emphasise the importance which it attaches to judges being able to obtain information concerning the background of a case, to enable them to decide whether or not the provisions on which the administrative measures appealed against are based constitute a violation of the rights accorded to occupational organisations by the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ).
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the attention of the Argentine Government to the importance which it attaches to the principle contained in Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Argentina, which stipulates that workers' and employers' organisations shall not be liable to be dissolved or suspended by administrative authority;(b) to request the Argentine Government to examine the possibility of amending the provisions of its legislation in the light of the two preceding paragraphs;(c) to bring these conclusions to the notice of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.
.The complaint lodged by the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions was contained in a communication sent directly to the International Labour Office on  September . The Argentine Government sent its observations in a note dated  January . The Committee examined the complaint at its February  meeting and decided to ask the Government for further information. The Government sent new information in notes dated  April and  May .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee, although it recognises that under Argentine labour laws-as stated by the Government-the withdrawal of legal personality and trade union status from an organisation does not entail its dissolution, recalls that in previous cases concerning Argentina it stated that ""from the strictly trade union point of view... the role assigned to these organisations (without legal status) is extremely limited"" and that, ""in view of the statutory distinction between organisations having trade union status and ordinary trade unions, it would seem that organisations which do not have trade union status do not have the right to organise in freedom their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes"".
.The Committee observed that in the present case the allegations submitted by the complainants as well as the Government's reply and the text of Act No.  concerning workers' occupational associations fail to show clearly whether the withdrawal of legal personality and trade union status became effective as soon as resolutions'' Nos. /, / and / were issued, and these rights were not restored, in the case of the Buenos Aires Printing and Allied Trades Federation and the Federation of Salaried and Wage-Earning Postal and Telecommunications Employees, until the National Chamber of Appeals in Labour Matters had reversed these resolutions, or whether the legal personality and trade union status of these organisations were maintained during the period between the date on which the administrative resolutions withdrawing legal personality and trade union status were issued and the date on which, the court decision reversing these resolutions was handed down, or whether they were restored only after the date on which these organisations lodged their appeal. In these circumstances the Committee decided to request the Argentine Government for additional information regarding this aspect of the case and the situation respecting the appeal lodged by the Argentine Textile Workers' Association.
.By its note of  April  the Government sent a copy of resolution No.  of  March  in which it decided to restore the legal personality and trade union status of the Argentine Textile Workers' Association. In its communication of  May  the Government sent copies of resolutions Nos.  and  withdrawing the legal personality and trade union status of the Buenos Aires Printing and Allied Trades Federation and the Federation of Salaried and Wage-Earning Postal and Telecommunications Employees. The Committee observed that the Government has failed to reply to the question regarding the immediate practical effects of the resolutions withdrawing legal personality and trade union status from those unions.
.In view of the fact that Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), provides that ""workers' and employers' organisations shall not be liable to be dissolved or suspended by administrative authority"", the Committee again requests the Government to state whether withdrawal of legal personality and trade union status from the Buenos Aires Printing and Allied Trades Federation, the Federation of Salaried and Wage-Earning Postal and Telecommunications Employees and the Argentine Textile Workers' Association became effective as soon as the respective resolutions were issued and whether such personality and status were restored to these organisations only when the National Chamber of Appeals in Labour Matters gave its decision, or when subsequent resolutions were issued restoring such personality and status, or whether these organisations retained their legal personality and trade union status at all times.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to decide, for the reasons stated in paragraph  above, that the allegation relating to the withdrawal of legal personality",2,1962,Argentina

In a communication dated  April  the complaining organisation forwarded additional information in support of its claim. The Peruvian Government submitted its observations on these two communications in a letter dated  October .
.Peru has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but not the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complaint contains two series of allegations, one relating to the unionisation of government employees, and the other to the right to strike of hospital workers. These two allegations are dealt with separately below.
.In all the circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the allegations relating to the right of government employees to join trade unions:(i) to draw the attention of the Peruvian Government to the importance which it attaches to the normally accepted principle, embodied in Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), which has been ratified by Peru, that workers without distinction whatsoever should have the right to establish organisations of their own choosing;(ii) to invite the Peruvian Government to consider the possibility of abolishing the provisions of section  of the Civil Service Regulations, which are incompatible with the foregoing principle;(iii) to bring these conclusions to the notice of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations;(b) to decide that the allegations relating to the right to strike of hospital workers do not call for further examination.",-1,1962,Peru
16,".By a communication dated  November  "" The Brotherhood "" (Railway Locomotive Personnel Union) filed a complaint with the I.L.O against the Argentine Government for violation of freedom of association.
.By two communications dated  December  the complaint was communicated to the Government for its observations, and "" The Brotherhood "" was informed of its right to furnish further information in substantiation of its complaint within a period of one month.
.By a communication of  January  "" The Brotherhood "" replied that for the time being it had no arguments to add, but that if the contrary should be the case it would supply them within the prescribed time.
.At its th, st, nd and rd Sessions, the Committee, having received no reply from the Government, decided to defer examination of the case. The said reply was received on  February  only.
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainant states that in March  it requested of the Argentine State Railways Company an increase in wages for the locomotive personnel of the railways which it represented. On their side, the authorities of the state-owned railways proposed the application of a plan to eliminate the operating deficit. To that end the Government issued Decree No. /, which set up consultative committees with trade union representation to advise on the measures to be adopted in implementation of the plan.
.Subsequently the Executive Power placed the state railways under supervision and by Decree No. / the supervisor was granted emergency powers to carry out another railway plan. The clauses of the decree included one to permit the introduction of "" those modifications of the present labour regulations which may be required "". The committees created by Decree No. / found themselves hampered in their work and in the end were dissolved with no account taken of their recommendations.
.In consequence of a protest work stoppage, an agreement was signed on  May  between representatives of the Government and of the trade union organisations, "" The Brotherhood "" and the Railway Union, whereby committees were to be set up to study the workers' claims. Notwithstanding this, the Government decided to continue with its plan for reorganising the railways without the collaboration of the workers. Following a series of incidents, resolution No. /, dated  June , was issued, creating a committee made up of state and trade union representatives to study the claims and the appropriate modifications to the labour regulations. In other words the Government wanted to link a discussion of wage increases with amendments to the railway labour regulations. This point of view was not accepted by the complainant, who pressed for the implementation of the substance of the agreement of  May .
.In the face of a series of protest work stoppages a new agreement was signed between the above-mentioned trade union organisations and a government representative on  August . However, the provisions of this agreement were not carried out, for which state representatives on the various committees were to blame since they went on to set certain conditions which the workers could not accept. After a series of protest work stoppages and in view of the fact that steps had been taken towards mass dismissals and a change of the regulations on conditions of work, both "" The Brotherhood "" and the Railway Union decided to call a strike for an indefinite period as from  October .
.Despite the Government's declared intention of respecting the right to strike as laid down in the Constitution, the authorities summoned the staff to return to work on pain of being declared "" on assignment "" (en comisin), which amounted to threatening them with loss of conditions of acquired seniority (escalafonamiento), grading, job, etc. This attempt at intimidation did not have the desired effect and so the Government issued Decree No. /  requisitioning railway workers. This decree, issued in virtue of authority granted to the Executive Power under the law on the state of emergency and the National Organisation (Wartime) Act (No. ), was applied at first to railway personnel in the federal capital and within a radius of  kilometres and was extended on  November to the whole of the national territory. "" The Brotherhood "" presented an appeal for "" protection "" (amparo) at law but this was rejected.
."" The Brotherhood's "" charges against the Government are that it issued a decree requisitioning railway personnel on pain of  days' arrest for non-compliance; that the police broke into and exercised surveillance of homes, public meeting places and union premises, preventing meetings of workers and terrorising them; that officials of "" The Brotherhood "", despite their trade union status, were included in the requisition; that the railway labour regulations were amended unilaterally; that economic pressure was applied to the unions since, for over six months, dues collected by the check-off system had not been transferred to the union.
.In its reply the Government points out that the dispute has been altogether terminated by the provisions of Decree No. , dated  December . In accordance with this decree there is one representative each of "" The Brotherhood "" and of the Railway Union on the Board of Management of the State Railways. Where the strike itself is concerned, the Government states that a strike was called without recourse to the compulsory conciliation procedure established by Legislative Decree No. / (confirmed by Act No. ) and by Act No. . On the other hand, the abandonment of trains and other acts against the security of means of transport and communication are offences under the Penal Code and under Act No. . These facts and the Government's responsibility for ensuring the continuous operation of the public railway service caused the Executive Power of the nation to declare this situation a serious emergency warranting, in accordance with Acts Nos.  and , the use of police and security powers a required to ensure the regular and continuous operation of public services (Decree No. /, section ).
.The requisition order in no way implies repression on the part of the Government, whose only motive was the defence of the general interests of the country. The said decree is based on Act No. , which in its turn is founded on several articles of the national Constitution. As regards the unilateral amendment of the labour regulations, the Government states that the provisions issued for the purpose never came into force. Finally, on the non-transfer of union dues, the Government points out that according to the complainant union itself, the Argentine State Railways Company was already six months in arrears of transfer, which shows that there was no intention to cause "" The Brotherhood "" economic prejudice on account of the strike, and that the delay was attributable to the abnormal economic situation of the Argentine public treasury and railways.
.The Committee has been guided by the principle that allegations relating to the right to strike are within its competence in so far, but only in so far, as they affect the exercise of trade union rights.
.In an earlier case relating to Argentina, the Committee had occasion to examine the question of the mobilisation of workers on account of a railway strike. Although in the present circumstances requisition only is involved, a measure less serious in its implications than mobilisation, it nevertheless remains exceptional in a labour dispute in view of the gravity of its consequences with regard to personal freedoms and trade union rights. In the case in question, the Government had availed itself of Act No. , section , which states that:The mobilisation of the auxiliary forces may only be decreed by the Government when this is necessary for purposes of national defence or in the event of catastrophes or serious emergencies which affect substantial sections of the country or its population.On that occasion the Committee considered that there did not seem to have existed a state of acute national emergency, such as had been observed in a case relating to the United States in which it had been necessary to ensure the delivery of supplies and ammunition to the troops of the United Nations engaged in Korea, to justify the mobilisation of workers on account of the dispute in progress as the Government had merely invoked its anxiety not to see the development of the national economy jeopardised by the strike.
.In the present case, when the strike finally broke out after a series of negotiations, stoppages and agreements signed between the parties to the dispute, the Government argues on the one hand that the complainant did not follow the compulsory conciliation procedures established by Decree No. / and Act No. , unlawfully exercising the right to strike, and that, on the other hand, the acts against the means of transport and the need to maintain an important public service such as the",2,1962,Argentina
17,"railways caused the Government of the nation to regard this situation as a "" serious emergency "" justifying recourse to requisition.
.In regard to the compulsory conciliation procedure to which the complainant should have submitted, this appears to be governed by Decree No. / relating to labour conflicts in state-owned undertakings. The Committee has already had occasion to examine this decree in a previous case. Under it, if a direct agreement between the parties to the dispute is not reached, the dispute shall be settled by the Executive Power, after consultation with the Ministry of Labour. Before the matter is brought before the Executive Power the parties may submit a brief regarding their rights. In consequence of the system established by the decree, strikes by the workers of the Argentine State Railways Company would seem to be prohibited. From the evidence in the Committee's possession, it appears that the procedures laid down in Decree No. / have not been followed. Furthermore, although the Government refers to compulsory conciliation established by the decree, it would appear that these conciliation procedures were not included in its terms, since once the direct negotiations between the parties are broken off, it is the Executive Power that decides, after consultation with the Ministry of Labour.
.The Committee has noted in many previous cases  that the right to strike may be subject to restrictions in essential occupations and in the civil service. In such cases the Committee has stressed the importance it attaches to the provision of some procedure that will ensure peaceful settlement of such disputes so that the workers who are deprived of the right to strike may have appropriate guarantees. Consequently the Committee is bound to arrive at the same conclusion as in the previous case in which it examined Decree No. /, when it considered that the system imposed thereby for the settlement of disputes in state-owned undertakings was not in accordance with the above-mentioned principles.
.Consequently, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to draw the attention of the Government once again, as it did in the case in which it examined Decree No. / , to the desirability of investing the existing system for the settlement of disputes in state-owned undertakings with the guarantee of adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures in which the parties concerned can take part at every stage.
.With regard to the situation where a "" serious emergency "" justifies, in the eyes of the Government, recourse to the measure of requisition, the Committee recalls that, in an earlier case in which the government concerned used army technicians to maintain the telephone service, interrupted by a strike, it considered that, where an essential public service such as the telephone service is interrupted by an unlawful strike, a government may have to assume the responsibility of ensuring its maintenance, in the interests of the community and of public order, and, to this end, may consider it expedient to call in persons from the armed services or other services to perform the duties which have been suspended. In another previous case, the Committee considered that the employment of the armed forces or of another group of persons to perform duties which have been suspended as the result of a labour dispute can - if the strike is lawful-be justified only by the need to ensure the working of services or industries whose suspension would lead to an acute crisis and that the utilisation by the Government of labour drawn from outside the trade, with a view to replacing the striking workers, entails a risk of derogation from the right to strike which may affect the free exercise of trade union rights.
.In the present case the Committee, observing that the Government gives as a reason justifying the measure of requisition the need to maintain an important public service, considers, as it did in an earlier case relating to a railway strike in Argentina, that the Government has not furnished evidence to show that there existed a situation of acute national crisis, such as had existed in Case No.  referred to in paragraph  above, which would have warranted a measure of this kind, which implies serious consequences for workers and for their trade union rights and which may involve abuse during a labour dispute.
.Further, the complainant alleges that trade union meetings have been prevented or rendered difficult and that the police have occupied trade union premises. Though the Committee has no more precise information about these facts, they were not denied by the Government in its reply. In this regard the Committee has already pointed out on a previous occasion that the measures taken by the authorities to ensure the observance of the law should not result in preventing unions from organising meetings during labour disputes. The Committee has also emphasised, while recognising that trade unions, like other associations or persons, cannot claim immunity from search of their premises, the importance which it attaches to the principle that any such a search should only be made following the issue of a warrant by the ordinary judicial authority after that authority has been satisfied that reasonable grounds exist for supposing that evidence exists in the said premises material to a prosecution for an offence under the ordinary law and provided that such search is restricted to the purposes in respect of which the warrant was issued.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the attention of the Government to the possibility of abuse involved in the requisition of workers during industrial disputes and to emphasise the undesirability of recourse to such measures except for the purpose of maintaining essential services in circumstances of the utmost gravity;(b) to draw the attention of the Government to the importance which the Governing Body has always attached to the principle that measures taken by the authorities to ensure the observance of the law should not result in preventing unions from organising meetings during labour disputes, and to the principle that any search of trade union premises should only be made following the issue of a warrant by the ordinary judicial authority after that authority has been satisfied that reasonable grounds exist for supposing that evidence exists on the said premises material to a prosecution for an offence under the ordinary law and provided that such search is restricted to the purposes in respect of which the warrant was issued.Geneva,  May .

18,".This case was examined by the Committee at its th Session in November , following which the Committee submitted its final conclusions to the Governing Body in paragraphs - of its rd Report, which was approved by the Governing Body at the beginning of its th Session (June-July ). Paragraph  of this report, which contains the Committee's recommendations to the Governing Body, is couched in the following terms:
..... In the circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the Government's attention to the desirability of introducing, for cases in which there is controversy as to whether a representative trade union organisation enjoys majority support, a system embodying the necessary safeguards to ensure that all the workers concerned will be able to express their views freely and giving effect to the principle that the certification of the representative organisation should be by an independent body and that the organisation should be chosen by a majority vote of the employees in the unit concerned;(b) to suggest to the Government that it might care to reconsider the position of the Works Council for the State Railways in the light of the foregoing recommendation; and(c) to draw the attention of the Government to the importance which the Governing Body has always attached to the principles embodied in the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), that workers should enjoy adequate protection against all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment by reason of union membership or because of participation in union activities, and that their organisations should enjoy adequate protection against acts of interference by employers.
.When these conclusions had been approved by the Governing Body they were communicated to the Government in a letter dated  June . In its reply dated  July  the Government made the following comments on these conclusions:In respect of paragraph , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session, the Government of Ecuador wishes to make the following remarks:
.In disputes concerning the majority character of trade unions the procedure is to abide by the will of the majority as freely expressed to the labour authorities after supplying evidence of identity and function.
.The status of the Works Council of State Railway Workers was examined and settled several years ago and therefore the present Government did not share in or bear responsibility for the decision. No petition has been received by the Government for revision of this case.
.The right to organise and bargain collectively is given full effect not merely in theory but also in practice. Throughout the country the labour authorities have encouraged the signing of collective agreements as a means of promoting understanding and co-operation between workers and employers. Since July  more than ten agreements have been signed, protecting thousands of workers in such important branches as the sugar and petroleum industries and also employees of the Municipality of Ambato.I would be grateful if you would bring these details to the attention of the Committee on Freedom of Association and the Governing Body.
.In view of this communication from the Government the Committee considers that it should once more examine its observations in subparagraphs (a) and (b) of paragraph  of its rd Report quoted earlier.
.The Committee recalls that in the present case the Ecuadorian Confederation of Catholic Workers, Employees and Craftsmen (C.E.D.O.C.) complained that the Ministry of Social Welfare and Labour had refused to approve the by-laws of the Works Council set up by employees of the State Railways, despite the fact that, according to the complainants, the majority of the workers had in fact signed a declaration of support for the Council. The Government answered that it was unable to approve these by-laws because there had never been any meeting with sufficient unity to be described as a founders' meeting which must exist before a works council could be constituted. Accordingly the Government stated that it had appointed a committee to tour the railways and ask the workers whether they belonged to the Works Council or the Ecuadorian Railwaymen's Union, which was already in existence and opposed recognition of the Council. According to the Government this committee was unable to confirm the Council's claim to have a majority.
.As regards the formalities needed to constitute a works council, i.e. whether it was sufficient to obtain the signatures of the workers or whether it was necessary to call a founders' meeting, there appeared to be no definite rule with regard to the procedure to be followed in order to determine whether a works council had majority support when the undertaking was of the type involved in this case and when such majority support was questioned. On the one hand the presidential decision refusing to approve the by-laws seemed to accept the system of signatures adopted by the Works Council and based the refusal on the report of the committee of inquiry, according to which only a minority of the workers stated that they were in favour of the Works Council; and on the other hand the Government, in its reply, gave as a ground for refusing approval that there never was a genuine founders' meeting reflecting unity of action, which was an essential feature of a founders' meeting in the proper sense.
.As regards the measures taken there appeared to be no agreement with regard to the total number of workers on the railways or the number of members or supporters that could be claimed by either body. The Committee likewise observed that in no case did all the workers on the railways seem to have been questioned and that no figures had been collected that would allow a final judgment to be reached on the number of members of either organisation. On the contrary the procedure used to check whether the Works Council did or did not have majority support seemed to have given rise to acts of discrimination and interference by the management and at any rate to have made it difficult for the workers to express their views freely.
.In view of these considerations the Committee observed that there was a series of discrepancies with regard to the legal interpretation of the procedure applicable to the formation of a majority organisation and, bearing in mind the fact that in this case problems had arisen concerning the freedom of trade unionists to express their preference for one or other of the organisations, the Committee recommended that the Government's attention should be called to the desirability of introducing a system embodying the necessary safeguards to ensure that all the workers concerned would be able to express their views freely, that certification should be by an independent body and that the organisation should be chosen by a majority vote.
.In its letter dated  July  the Government stated that when any dispute arose concerning the majority character of a trade union organisation the problem was settled in accordance with the wishes of the majority as freely expressed to the labour authorities after production of evidence as to identity and function.
.The Committee considers that, in view of its experience in dealing with this case involving the State Railways, the Government's observations do not contain any new points of substance which could lead it to change the opinion expressed in paragraph  (a) of its rd Report cited above, and therefore recommends the Governing Body to take note of the Government's observations on this point and at the same time to reiterate its earlier recommendations.
.As regards the suggestion in paragraph  (b) of its rd Report that the Government should re-examine the position of the Works Council for the State Railways in the light of the recommendation made in paragraph  (a) thereof, the Government states that the position was settled several years ago and that it did not share in or bear responsibility for the decision. It adds that it has not received any petition to revise this case.
.In earlier cases the Committee has taken the view, when it has had before it accusations relating to violations of trade union rights by a former government, that though the government in power could obviously not be held responsible for events which took place under its predecessor, it is clearly responsible for any continuing consequences which they may have had since its accession to power.
.Having therefore already suggested to the Government that it re-examine the position with regard to the Works Council for the State Railways, the Committee considers that it is for the Government to decide whether or not it should act on this suggestion in view of the arguments put forward by the Committee and the circumstances of the case. Accordingly the Committee can only recommend the Governing Body to take note of the Government's statements, while at the same time reaffirming the principle set forth in the preceding paragraph.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to take note of the information now furnished by the Government with respect to the determination of majority organisations and to decide that it",0,1962,Ecuador
19,"contains no new elements which call for a modification of the conclusions contained in paragraph (a) of the rd Report of the Committee cited in paragraph  above;(b) to take note, while reaffirming the principle set forth in paragraph  above, of the Government's statement that the position of the Works Council for the State Railways was settled several years ago and that it did not share in or bear responsibility for the decision.
.The original complaint submitted on  November  by the Ecuadorian Confederation of Catholic Workers, Employees and Craftsmen (C.E.D.O.C.) was forwarded to the Government for its observations by a letter of the Director-General dated  December . On  January  the complainants submitted a series of additional particulars, of which the Government was notified by a letter of  January . Further information was submitted by the complainants in two communications dated  and  October , which the Committee has regarded as non-receivable under the procedure, because, apart from the lateness of their submission, the communications did not add any important new elements of substance to those contained in the original complaint.
.The Committee considered the case at its rd Session (February ) and at its th Session (May ). In the absence of the information requested from the Government the Committee decided to postpone consideration of the case until its next session. The Government sent its comments by a letter of  July .
.Ecuador has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communication of  November  the complainants state that the by-laws of the Works Council set up by workers belonging to C.E.D.O.C in the State Railways were submitted for approval to the Ministry of Social Welfare and Labour on  August . For this purpose , signatures had been collected from workers in the undertaking, which has a total labour force of , workers. The requirements of section  of the Labour Code had therefore been complied with. The Ministry refused to give its approval to the by-laws in accordance with section  of the Labour Code. This resistance on the part of the Ministry continues in spite of the fact that the Chamber of Deputies sent out a committee of inquiry to check on the authenticity of the signatures in question. It is stated that the committee reached the conclusion that there was no reason to refuse to approve the by-laws of the Works Council.
.In a note dated  January  the complainants sent in certain documents to supplement their original complaint. The documents sent in included a list of the workers on the State Railways, which was supplied by the book-keeping department of the undertaking and shows the number of wage earners and salaried employees as being , (the complainants maintain that the real figure, as shown in the budget estimates, is only ,); a copy of an affidavit by the Inspector of Labour from which it seems that , signatures of workers in the undertaking were lodged in support of the Works Council; original receipts for  additional signatures; a copy of the report of the committee of the Chamber of Deputies, stating that not a single forged signature had been discovered and giving figures concerning the railway personnel questions; affidavits by two leaders of unions affiliated to C.E.D.O.C who were members of a committee set up by the Ministry of Social Welfare and Labour to check the signatures of the workers supporting the Works Council (affidavits to the effect that the officials of the Ministry and representatives of the management had acted improperly and had engaged in discrimination); a memorandum from the leaders of the Works Council reporting what occurred during this inquiry and alleging that the inquiry served no useful purpose whatsoever; a copy of the by-laws of the Works Council; a copy of the Constitution of the Works Council signed by the delegates of local committees; and a copy of the decision of the President of the Republic refusing approval of the by-laws on the grounds that the Works Council does not have the support of a majority of the workers in the undertaking.
.In its reply dated  July  the Government states that it has not been possible to approve the by-laws of the Works Council because the records submitted by the petitioners do not all have the same date, and because they have been tampered with and do not form a single whole. According to the Government this proves that ""there was never a genuine constituent assembly, reflecting the unity of action which is an essential feature of a founders' meeting in the proper sense, from which a works council mainly springs"". The Government also furnishes a report prepared by the Office of the Legal Adviser of the Ministry of Social Welfare and Labour. This report states that after an application had been made for approval of the by-laws so that the Works Council might acquire legal personality, the existing Ecuadorian Railwaymen's Union opposed approval of the by-laws and requested that a check be made to ascertain whether the Works Council had the support of a majority of the railway workers; that an inquiry be made to discover what local committees were represented by the persons who had notified the authorities of the holding of a national meeting to set up the Works Council; and that it should be ascertained whether local meetings had been held to appoint delegates to the national meeting and whether these persons had the appropriate credentials.
.It is stated in the report of the Office of the Legal Adviser that in view of this opposition a committee was formed consisting of officials of the Ministry, of the Works Council, of C.E.D.O.C and of the Railwaymen's Union. The committee travelled along the railway line, asking the workers to what trade union organisation (the Works Council or the Railwaymen's Union) they belonged. This committee ascertained that on a certain part of the line a majority of the workers claimed to belong to the Works Council, that another sector of the labour force was ignorant of the existence of the two trade union organisations, and that in a third sector where the main railway centres are located the great majority ( per cent.) of the workers said they supported the Railwaymen's Union. The report also states that local meetings were not held to appoint the delegates who took part in the setting up of the Works Council. In any case  per cent of the railway workers had indicated that they were opposed to approval of the by-laws of the Works Council.
.With regard to the legal aspect of the question the report of the Office of the Legal Adviser states that under section  of the Labour Code a works council shall not be deemed to be duly constituted unless over  per cent of the workers in the undertaking attend the founders' meeting. In the present case the meeting was not attended by such a percentage of the workers, and those who attended as delegates were not appointed by local meetings; instead, the signatures submitted to show that more than half of the workers in the undertaking supported the Works Council had been collected over a space of two years. Consequently the statutory prerequisite had not been complied with.
.In short, the Committee notes from the information submitted to it that, in view of the opposition of the Railwaymen's Union to the approval of the by-laws of the Works Council, the Ministry of Social Welfare and Labour appointed a committee to check whether the Works Council enjoyed the support of a majority of the workers. The complainants contend that this is an illegal procedure and that in any case the government representatives and members of the management acted improperly by giving preference to the Railwaymen's Union and bringing pressure to bear on the workers in order to prevent its being proved that the Works Council had majority support. The outcome of the inquiry was that the President of the Republic refused to approve the by-laws on the grounds that the Works Council did not have the statutory majority. Referring to the reasons for refusing approval, the Government also states in its reply that the prerequisites laid down in the Code with regard to the meeting held to constitute the Works Council were not complied with.
.Section  of the Labour Code of Ecuador provides that a works council may be set up in every undertaking where  or more persons are employed. A works council shall not be deemed to be duly constituted unless over  per cent of the workers in the undertaking attend the founders' meeting. By virtue of the functions assigned to it by section  (conclusion of collective agreements, intervention in labour disputes, economic and social betterment of its members, etc.), a works council is a union at the level of the undertaking. When it is formed it must have the support of a majority",1,1962,Ecuador

22,".The complaint of the World Federation of Teachers' Unions is contained in a communication dated  June . The Government of Chile forwarded its observations by a letter dated  September .
.Chile has not ratified either the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants allege that teaching staff in Chile are denied the right to belong to trade unions, and in support of their allegation they quote Part III, paragraph , section  of the Administrative Statutes (Legislative Decree No.  of  April ) as stipulating that:wage-earning and salaried employees in the service of the State shall not have the right to form or belong to any union, nor to form brigades, teams or operational groups which are essentially political in character. Nor shall they have the right to go on strike, nor to suspend or interrupt their work completely or partially in any manner, nor to commit any act of such nature as to interfere with the normal functioning of the service to which they belong.
.In its reply of  September  the Government states that the provision referred to by the complainants is indeed in force in Chile, and that it is applicable not only to the teaching profession but to all wage-earning and salaried employees in the service of the State, and adds that in view of the existence of this provision the Government has no other course but to comply with it. The Government goes on to state that, notwithstanding the existence of the measure in question, teachers are in fact organised in the Chilean National Teachers' Association and other bodies which carry on an active campaign on behalf of their members, even going so far as strike action.
.The Committee observes that another provision in Chilean law-namely section  of the Labour Code-lays down that:wage-earning and salaried employees in the service of the State or municipal authorities or belonging to state undertakings shall not have the right to form a union or to belong to any union.
.In the light of the expressly stated ban on the forming of trade unions by workers in the service of the State contained in both the Administrative Statutes and the Labour Code, the Committee feels impelled, bearing in mind the principle laid down in other cases I regarding the importance of the right of state and local government employees to constitute and register trade unions, to point out that these provisions of Chilean legislation are incompatible with the generally accepted principle that workers, without distinction whatsoever, should have the right to form organisations of their own choosing without prior authorisation. This principle has been embodied by the International Labour Conference in Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), which reads as follows:Workers and employers, without distinction whatsoever, shall have the right to establish and, subject only to the rules of the organisation concerned, to join organisations of their own choosing without previous authorisation.
.The Committee, while observing that according to the Government's statement Chilean teachers are in fact organised into an association whose activities may be said to correspond to those of a trade union, reaffirms the opinion expressed on earlier occasions that the right of workers to form freely organisations of their own choosing cannot be deemed to be operative unless it is fully recognised and respected in law and in fact.
.Bearing in mind also that when on a previous occasion it had before it allegations similar to those now being considered and also relating to Chile, it drew the attention of the Government to the incompatibility of section  of the Chilean Labour Code with the principle that workers, including those employed by the State, should have the right to establish organisations of their own choosing without prior authorisation, the Committee considers that the Chilean Government should be requested to consider the possibility of repealing those provisions under present law which prohibit employees of the State from establishing and belonging to trade unions.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to draw the attention of the Government of Chile once again to the importance which it attaches to the principles that workers, without distinction whatsoever, including those employed by the State, should have the right to establish organisations of their own choosing without prior authorisation, and to request the Government to consider the possibility of repealing the provisions of section  of the Labour Code and section  of the Administrative Statutes, which are incompatible with the foregoing principle.",1,1962,Chile
23,"of the workers in the undertaking and it is granted two special prerogatives section  provides that where there is a works council it shall be responsible for negotiating the collective agreement on behalf of all the workers in the undertaking, and section  provides that a strike may be called only by the works council, where such exists, or failing that by a majority of the workers in the undertaking or factory.
.The Committee noted in a previous case that, while there is no necessary incompatibility with Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), in a provision for the certification of the most representative union in a given unit as the exclusive bargaining agent for that unit, this is the case only if a number of safeguards are provided. The Committee listed a number of safeguards which corresponded to the practice followed in other countries that had adopted such a system. These safeguards included provision to the effect that certification should be by an independent body and that the representative organisation should be chosen by a majority vote of the employees in the unit concerned.
.In the case of Ecuador it is laid down by law that for a works council to be formed the founders' meeting must be attended by over  per cent of the workers in the undertaking. It emerges from the Government's reply that it considers that there should be only one meeting. The Committee observes that this requirement may turn out to be impracticable in the case of a railway undertaking if the line covers an extensive part of the national territory. The Committee also observes that there appears to be no definite rule with regard to the procedure to be followed in order to determine whether a works council has majority support when the undertaking is of the type involved in this case, and when such majority support is questioned. On the one hand the presidential decision refusing to approve the by-laws seems to accept the system of signatures adopted by the Works Council, and bases the refusal on the report of the committee of inquiry, according to which only a minority of the workers stated they were in favour of the Works Council; and on the other hand the Government in its reply gives as a ground for refusing approval that ""there was never a genuine constituent assembly reflecting the unity of action which is an essential feature of a founders' meeting in the proper sense"". Similarly, the report from the Office of the Legal Adviser of the Ministry of Social Welfare and Labour does not recognise the system of signatures, and emphasises that the founders' meeting must be attended by over  per cent of the workers or that the delegates who attend such a meeting must have been elected at local meetings.
.Moreover, it emerges from the documents examined by the Committee that there is no concordance with regard to the facts either. The complainants allege that , signatures were collected, plus  at a later date, making a total of ,. This figure would exceed  per cent of the workers in the undertaking, who are said to total , according to figures supplied by the book-keeping department of the undertaking. The labour inspector involved in this case certifies that he received , signatures and that this figure ""corresponds to over  per cent of the workers on the State Railways"". The Government in its reply transmits the report from the Office of the Legal Adviser of the Ministry, which states that it emerges from the investigation that some  per cent of railway workers said they were opposed to the Works Council. On the other hand the presidential decision refusing approval of the by-laws states that the application was accompanied by , signatures, that the workers of the undertaking total , and that the committee appointed by the Chamber of Deputies to go into the workers' wishes reported that , said they were in favour of the Railwaymen's Union,  in favour of the Works Council and  in favour of both, while  resigned from the Works Council and  expressed a wish to belong to neither organisation. Subsequently the Chamber of Deputies sent in documents reporting the resignation of  workers from the Works Council. A copy of the report of the special committee of the Chamber of Deputies which was sent in by complainants states that not a single forged signature was discovered and that , workers were questioned, of whom  said they were in favour of the Railwaymen's Union and  in favour of the Works Council, while  did not belong to any organisation. In a few cases the workers were members of both organisations. The report also refers to a total of , workers in the undertaking.
.The Committee observes that both the Office of the Legal Adviser and the report of the committee appointed by the Chamber of Deputies agree that on a certain part of the railway line most of the workers stated that they were in favour of the Works Council whereas on another sector a majority were on the side of the Railwaymen's Union. The committee of inquiry explained that it recorded a smaller number of statements of allegiance to the Works Council because it was easier to make the count in the latter sector, where the Railwaymen's Union had a larger number of supporters, and that ""it had been very difficult to question permanent way and travelling personnel, among whom there seemed to be large numbers who were members of the Works Council, because it was impossible to find the workers at their place of work"".
.In their allegations the complainants submit particulars of the inquiry carried out by the committee appointed by the Ministry of Social Welfare and Labour. The Government has made no comments on this. According to the complainants, who have forwarded affidavits from two officials of trade unions affiliated to C.E.D.O.C who accompanied the committee, the officials of the Ministry refused to accept new members of the Works Council, whereas they accepted resignations from it and new members of the Railwaymen's Union. Similarly, preference was given to the meetings organised by the Union and by the State Railways; a number of workers reported that they were coerced into signing for membership of the Union and into resigning from the Works Council. The witnesses also noted that members of the management (one of them a brother of the General Secretary of the Union) organised meetings hostile to the Works Council to give support to the Union.
.The Committee has always recognised the major importance of the principles embodied in the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), that workers should enjoy adequate protection against all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment and that their organisations should enjoy independence from all interference by employers.
.On the basis of all the foregoing information the Committee observes that there is a series of discrepancies with regard to the legal interpretation of the procedure applicable to the formation of a works council and with regard to the facts themselves; with regard to the latter the discrepancies relate to the number of workers in the undertaking and the number of members or supporters of the two trade union organisations, as well as to the appointment of the delegates who attended the meeting held to set up the Works Council. The Committee also notes that in no case do all the workers of the undertaking seem to have been questioned and that in no case have figures been collected that would allow a final judgment to be reached on the number of members of either trade union organisation. On the contrary, the procedure used to check whether the Works Council did or did not have majority support seems to have given rise to acts of discrimination and interference by employers and at any rate to have made it difficult for the workers to express their views freely.
.In the circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the Government's attention to the desirability of introducing, for cases in which there is controversy as to whether a representative trade union organisation enjoys majority support, a system embodying the necessary safeguards to ensure that all the workers concerned will be able to express their views freely and giving effect to the principle that the certification of the representative organisation should be by an independent body and that the organisation should be chosen by a majority vote of the employees in the unit concerned;(b) to suggest to the Government that it might care to reconsider the position of the Works Council for the State Railways in the light of the foregoing recommendation; and(c) to draw the attention of the Government to the importance which the Governing Body has always attached to the principles embodied in the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining",1,1962,Ecuador

In that report the Committee submitted its definitive conclusions and recommendations concerning two series of allegations: (a) those relating to the imprisonment of the trade union leader Reinaldo Gonzlez and (b) those relating to the dissolution of employers' organisations. Thus the only allegations consideration of which has remained in suspense are those put forward by I.C.F.T.U concerning the detention of trade union officials; in this connection the Government was asked to supply detailed information (see paragraph  of the aforesaid report).

.In the circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the  trade union officials on whose situation the Government has supplied information, to emphasise to the Government, as it has already done previously, the importance which it attaches to the principle that accused trade unionists, like all other persons, should be entitled to the safeguards of normal judicial procedure;(b) to invite the Government to co-operate by furnishing, as soon as possible, detailed information concerning the present situation of the trade union officials in question and of those referred to in paragraphs  and  above, as well as the texts of the judgments handed down in each instance and their grounds; and meanwhile to postpone consideration of the case;(c) to take note of the present interim report of the Committee, it being understood that the Committee will report further to the Governing Body when the information referred to in subparagraph (b) above has been received.
.In accordance with the practice which it has followed in certain earlier cases, the Committee has found it convenient to consolidate and consider together the three cases relating to Cuba, which concern the complaints presented by the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions (I.F.C.T.U.), the Economic Corporations of Cuba (in exile) and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (I.C.F.T.U.).
.Cuba has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.With regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:
.The International Federation of Christian Trade Unions (I.F.C.T.U.) addressed to the Director-General on  February  a telegram containing a request for urgent intervention by the I.L.O on the ground that the Cuban trade union leader Mr. Reinaldo Gonzlez was in imminent danger of execution. The Director-General brought the contents of this telegram to the notice of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Cuba by two telegrams dated  February .
.By a letter of  February  the Director-General transmitted the complaint to the Government of Cuba in accordance with the normal procedure for the examination of complaints of alleged infringements of trade union rights. In his letter he explained to the Government that, as matters involving human life were raised in the complaint, the case fell within the category of cases regarded by the Governing Body as urgent, in accordance with the decision taken by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ), and, for this reason, requested the Government to furnish as speedy a reply as possible.
.The Government replied on  April .
.Cuba has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.Repeatedly in the past, where allegations that trade union leaders or workers had been arrested or detained for trade union activities had been met by governments with statements that the arrests or detentions were made for subversive activities, for reasons of internal security or for common law crimes, the Committee has followed the rule that the governments concerned should be requested to submit further and as precise information as possible concerning the arrests or detentions and the precise reasons which led to them. If, in certain cases, the Committee has concluded that allegations relating to the arrest or detention of trade union militants did not call for further examination, this has been after it has received information from the governments concerned showing sufficiently precisely and with sufficient detail that the arrests or detentions were in no way occasioned by trade union activities but solely by activities outside the trade union sphere, which were either prejudicial to public order or of a political nature. Moreover, the Committee has repeatedly asked governments to send information on judicial proceedings and their results, in view of the importance which such information might have in aiding the Committee to appreciate whether or not allegations were well founded.
.In the present case the Committee observes that Mr. Reinaldo Gonzlez is now serving a prison sentence after trial by the courts of his country. In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to request the Government to furnish detailed information as to the offences of which the person concerned was accused, together with information with respect to the judicial proceedings and the text of the judgment handed down, and decides to wait before formulating its conclusions, until it has fuller information with regard to the circumstances which led to the detention and conviction of Mr. Reinaldo Gonzlez.
.The I.F.C.T.U addressed to the Director-General on  February  a telegram containing a request for urgent intervention by the I.L.O on the ground that a Cuban trade union leader, Mr. Reynol Gonzlez, was in imminent danger of execution. The Director-General brought the contents of this telegram to the notice of the Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Cuba by two telegrams dated  February .
.By a letter of  February  the Director-General transmitted the complaint to the Government of Cuba in accordance with the normal procedure for the examination of complaints of alleged infringements of trade union rights. In his letter he explained to the Government that, as matters involving human life were raised in the complaint, the case fell within the category of cases regarded by the Governing Body as urgent, in accordance with the decision taken by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ), and, for this reason, requested the Government to furnish as speedy a reply as possible.
.Cuba has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.At its th Session (February ) the Committee examined the case for the first time and, noting that no reply had been received from the Government, recommended the Governing Body to request the Government of Cuba to furnish its observations on the complaint as a matter of urgency.
.The Government of Cuba was informed of this decision by a letter dated  March . On the same day the Director-General received a note from the Government, dated  March , stating that his letter of  February , mentioned in paragraph , had been referred to the competent organ of the Revolutionary Government for appropriate action. In a further note, dated  April , the Government repeated its statement to the effect that the complaint had been referred to the competent organ of the Revolutionary Government and added that this had been done so that, after study of the complaint, the appropriate observations could be made within the prescribed time.
.At its st Session (May ), not having received the Government's observations, the Committee recommended the Governing Body to request the Government of Cuba once again to furnish its observations on the complaint as a matter of urgency. This request was communicated to the Government by a letter dated  June , and the Government replied by a note dated  June  indicating once again that the said request had been referred to the competent organ of the Revolutionary Government for appropriate action. The request was repeated by letter of  August .
.At its nd Session (October ), not having yet received the Government's observations, the Committee had to adjourn examination of the case and made a special request to the Government of Cuba to furnish the information in question in time for it to be taken into account by the Committee when it examined the merits of the case at its following session. This decision was communicated to the Government by a letter dated  November  and brought once more to its attention by a letter of  January .
.At its rd Session (February ), still not having received the Government's observations, the Committee had once again to adjourn examination of",-1,1962,Cuba
26,"has the Committee been able to obtain from the complainants any information on the present situation which would have shown whether the trade union rights that appeared to have been violated had been fully re-established or whether the measure complained of still continued in effect.
.In these circumstances the Committee, considering that the specific observations which the Government has promised to supply shortly would usefully supplement the information available concerning this case, recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the attention of the Government to the importance it has always attached to the provision contained in Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), according to which workers' organisations shall have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom and organise their administration and that the public authorities shall refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof; and(b) to reiterate its request to the Government to be good enough to furnish, as a matter of extreme urgency, its detailed observations regarding the alleged interference with the Confederation of Labour of the Republic of Panama.
.The Committee examined this case at its th Session (November ), and on that occasion submitted an interim report which appears in paragraphs  to  of its th Report. This was approved by the Governing Body at its st Session (March ).
.Panama has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their complaint of  June  the complainants requested an investigation concerning, inter alia, the exercise of freedom of association in Panama, but gave no reasons for their request. The Committee observed, however, at its session in November , that three newspaper cuttings attached to the complaint appeared to show quite clearly that the executive power had intervened in the affairs of the Confederation of Labour of the Republic of Panama by virtue of Decision No.  of  June  dismissing the members of the Executive Board of the Confederation. The complainants had lodged an appeal against this decision with the Supreme Court.
.The Committee pointed out that the Government's reply had not been sent until  August , one year after communication of the complaint. The Government stated briefly that the complainants' allegations were untrue, since all workers were entitled to form trade unions and organise themselves as they wished, subject only to the restrictions imposed by law. All constituted organisations were at all times entitled to exercise their trade union rights and to operate in complete freedom in accordance with the democratic principles of the Constitution.
.The Committee observed that, according to the information in the three newspapers referred to, it appeared that there had been an infringement of the provisions of Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Panama, under which workers' organisations have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom and to organise their administration, and the public authorities are to refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof.
.However, the Committee considered that it did not possess sufficient information to be able to judge the situation properly and submit any conclusions, among other reasons because the Government's reply was extremely imprecise and general in character and contained no information which could help the Committee in its examination of the case. Accordingly the Committee recommended the Governing Body to decide to ask the Government once more to forward its precise observations on the complaint regarding the Government's action in the case of the Confederation of Labour of the Republic of Panama with the least possible delay, and in the meantime to postpone its examination of the case.
.At its th, st, nd and rd Sessions (May , November , February  and May  respectively) the Committee was obliged to postpone successively the examination of the case, as it had not received the observations requested of the Government in paragraph  of the th Report of the Committee. Since the approval of the th Report by the Governing Body the Director-General has sent ten communications to the Government, informing it of the said postponements and repeating the request for the observations in question; these observations have not so far been received. The Government answered three of the communications made by the Director-General, stating that the matter had been referred to the competent authorities. In view of this considerable delay and in order to make it possible to formulate its conclusions in this case at its next session, the Committee considers it necessary that the Government should be requested once again to furnish the observations in question, as a matter of urgency. To the same end the Committee has decided to ask the complainants directly to be good enough to furnish further information on the present situation with regard to the questions raised concerning alleged interference with the Confederation of Labour of the Republic of Panama.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to express regret at the fact that, despite the time that has elapsed since approval of the th Report of the Committee by the Governing Body (March ) and of the number of reminders that have been sent, the Government has not supplied the detailed observations which were requested in paragraph  of the said report regarding allegations concerning interference, in , with the Confederation of Labour of the Republic of Panama;(b) to request the Government once more to furnish the said observations, as a matter of urgency;(c) to note that the Committee has decided to request the complaining organisation to furnish further information on the present situation with regard to the matters raised in the complaint;(d) to note that the Committee proposes in any event to submit its conclusions on this case at its next session.
.The complaint is contained in a communication dated  June , accompanied by a number of documents and newspaper cuttings. It was duly forwarded to the Government of the Republic of Panama, which sent its reply on  August .
.Panama has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but not the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communication dated  June  the complainants asked for an investigation to be carried out into, inter alia, the exercise of freedom of association in Panama, but gave no reasons for their request. They attached a quantity of newspaper cuttings and other documents dealing with various events which had no connection with the principles governing freedom of association, together with various other documents, the contents and implications of which were difficult to interpret without further details. These details were not supplied by the complainants even though they were informed on  July  that under the Committee's procedure they were entitled to submit additional information in support of their complaint.
.Nevertheless the Committee notes that three of the newspaper cuttings in question appear to show quite clearly that the executive power has intervened in the affairs of the Confederation of Labour of the Republic of Panama since it issued a decision (No. ) on  June  dismissing the members of the Executive Board of the Confederation. The complainants stated that they had lodged an appeal against this order with the Supreme Court.
.In its reply, which was not sent until  August , the Government stated briefly that the complainants' allegations were untrue, since all workers were entitled to form trade unions and organise themselves as they wished, subject only to the restrictions imposed by law. All constituted organisations were at all times entitled to exercise their trade union rights and to operate in complete freedom in accordance with the democratic principles of the Constitution.
.The Committee notes that, according to the information contained in the three newspapers referred to, it would appear that a breach has occurred of the provisions of Article  of Convention No.  (ratified by Panama), under which workers' organisations are entitled to elect their representatives in full freedom and to organise their own administration and public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede its lawful exercise.
.However, the Committee considers that it does not possess sufficient information to be able to judge the situation properly and submit any conclusions. In the first place, the Government's reply is extremely imprecise and general in character and contains no information which could help the Committee in its examination of the case. In the second place, the Committee notes that the Government has not submitted any report on, inter alia, the application of Convention No. , despite the fact that it ratified it in .

27,".The complaint by the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions is contained in a communication dated  May  addressed directly to the I.L.O. This communication was accompanied by a memorandum from the Federation of Telephone Workers and Employees of the Argentine Republic (F.O.E.T.R.A.) and by a number of documents in support of the complaint. The complaint was transmitted to the Government, which submitted its comments in a note dated  January .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee notes that, under the provisions in force in Argentina, since the parties have been unable to reach agreement on the conclusion of a new agreement the provisions of the previous agreement remain in force. The Committee further notes, with respect to the complainants' accusation that the company has violated the provisions of the agreement, that section  of Act No.  provides for penalties and for appropriate action to secure compliance with an agreement. In this case it does not appear that the workers have taken advantage of the relevant provisions in order to defend their rights.
.In similar cases' in the past the Committee has taken the view that, where there has been failure to have recourse to appropriate national remedies with respect to matters raised in a complaint, the complainants have not offered sufficient evidence to show that an infringement of trade union rights has occurred. In the light of the facts referred to in the preceding paragraph, the Committee must reach the same conclusion in the present case.
.The complainants base their accusation of unfair practices by the company on subsections (b), (d) and (f) of section  of Act No.  concerning industrial associations of employees. The subsections in question relate to intervention by employers in the Constitution, operation or administration of an industrial association of employees, encouraging staff to join particular associations and refusal to bargain collectively with employees in accordance with the legal procedure.
.With respect to the last point, the Committee notes that in the present case the parties were unable to reach agreement in spite of the fact that a number of meetings were held. According to the complainants, the last meeting took place on  March  and ended with the refusal of the workers' representatives to accept a proposal made by the employers. The Committee recalls that in a previous case it pointed out that no provision of Article  of Convention No.  obliges the government concerned to give effect to the principle of collective bargaining by coercive measures which would change the nature of such bargaining. The Committee further pointed out that whether one of the parties adopts a conciliatory attitude or an intransigent attitude with respect to the demands of the other party is a matter for negotiation between the parties in accordance with the law of the country concerned.
.The complainants further accuse the employers of resorting to unfair practices as defined by national legislation because they negotiated directly with the workers. This allegation is made in the general petition submitted by F.O.E.T.R.A to the National Labour-Management Relations Board on the grounds of unfair practices on the part of the Company. No information concerning the result of that petition has been submitted to the Committee. The Committee has previously considered a case in which it was alleged that the legislation permitted the conclusion of collective agreements between the undertaking and  per cent of its workers outside the framework of a trade union organisation. In respect of that case, the Committee took the view that direct bargaining between an undertaking and its workers outside the framework of existing representative organisations may in certain cases be detrimental to the principle laid down in Article  of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), that governments shall encourage and promote collective bargaining between employers' and workers' organisations. According to the Government, in the present case the direct offer made by the Company to its workers was merely a repetition of the proposals previously made to the trade union, which had rejected them. In other words, it was not an attempt to engage directly in collective bargaining with the workers outside the framework of their organisation. Moreover, the Committee notes that negotiations between the Company and the trade union were subsequently resumed. This allegation on the part of the complainants therefore relates to their earlier contention that the Company refused to negotiate with F.O.E.T.R.A. In the light of the facts set out in the previous paragraphs, the Committee considers that the complainants have not demonstrated that there has been a violation of trade union rights.
.Finally, with respect to the allegation that the Company has interfered with the workers' organisation and encouraged its staff to join another organisation, the Committee points out that this allegation is couched in extremely vague terms and that the complainants have submitted no evidence in support of their complaint.
.In the light of all these circumstances, the Committee has reached the conclusion, as regards both the allegations of non-compliance with the collective agreement and the other allegations of unfair practices by the Company, that the complainants have not furnished sufficient proof in support of their complaint to the I.L.O.",2,1963,Argentina
28,"of this type, the arbitrators appointed by the parties to the dispute are unable to agree, a third arbitrator is appointed by lot from the list of co-judges of the Argentine Supreme Court. Section  declares any strikes to be illegal which affect the essential public services referred to in the previous section. It also defines communications as an essential public service.
.With respect to the dismissals mentioned by the complainants the Government declares that "" there were no dismissals because of the dispute itself "". In other words no worker was laid off because of his trade union activities, and the only ground for dismissal was serious breach of the Rules of Civilian State Personnel. Civil servants and public employees enjoy every legal protection, such as habeas corpus and the right to appeal in defending their rights.
.Finally, the Government informs the Committee that in May  the Secretary for Communications announced the reinstatement of all the workers who had been dismissed under the Rules of Civilian State Personnel.
.The Committee notes with interest the information supplied by the Government with respect to Decree No.  of , whereby disputes in essential public services are submitted to an independent tribunal. The Committee likewise notes that the Government emphasises that the workers were dismissed not because of the dispute but because they had broken the Rules of Civilian State Personnel. Nevertheless, in view of the considerations put forward earlier in paragraph , it would appear that the Government took action against the participants in the strike not because of a breach of the regulations governing disputes in essential public services but because of absenteeism for a longer period than permitted by the Rules; in the majority of cases this absenteeism had occurred before the dispute. In other words, although technically the dismissals appear to have been a punishment for breach of the Rules independently of the strike, in actual fact the dismissals were directly connected with the latter.
.The Committee considers that in questions of this type it has a duty to look beyond the technical aspect of the action taken and to examine the substance of the question and its consequences for the workers and organisations involved. Even though the type of action taken in the case of these dismissals might, in certain circumstances, constitute discrimination against workers because of their trade union activities, the Committee bears in mind the fact that under Decree No.  disputes in essential public services must be submitted to an arbitration tribunal and that workers are not allowed to resort to strike action. It follows that the workers' action would have been illegal and there would be no grounds for considering that the Government took discriminatory measures against workers who were engaged in lawful activities of a trade union character.
.Furthermore, the Government states that in the meantime all the individuals who were dismissed under the Rules of Civilian State Personnel have now been reinstated. Accordingly, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to take note of this fact and to decide that the case does not call for further examination.",-1,1963,Argentina
29,".The complaint of the Union of Postal and Telecommunications Workers of Mar del Plata is contained in a communication dated  April  to the Secretary-General of the United Nations. In accordance with current procedure the Secretary-General transmitted this complaint to the I.L.O in a letter dated  June . The complaint was communicated to the Government, which forwarded its observations in a letter dated  December .
.The Committee examined the complaint and the Government's observations at its meeting in February  and decided to ask the Government for certain additional information and, in the meantime, to postpone its examination of the case as a whole.
.In a letter dated  May  the Government supplied the information that had been requested.
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants allege in their communication that, as a result of a dispute -ending in a strike-which took place between the Union of Postal and Telecommunications Workers of Mar del Plata and the State Communications Department because of delays in the payment of the monthly salaries of the staff of the Postal and Telecommunications Administration, the said Administration, as a reprisal, terminated the contracts of  employees, members of trade unions, at the central Mar del Plata office, who had taken part in the strike. In the view of the complainants this step was an arbitrary one. It was alleged to be based on the provisions of section  (a) of Decree No. / (Rules of Civilian State Personnel) respecting unjustified absences by public servants. The complainants state that in accordance with article bis of the National Constitution cases of absence due to strike reasons cannot be considered to be unjustified. The complainants attach to their communication a list of the names of the  persons alleged to have been dismissed at the Mar del Plata. They add that in the whole country , workers were dismissed in this way.
.In its reply dated  December  the Government admits that delays due to the economic difficulties affecting the country did, in fact, take place in the payment of the salaries of state employees. It points out, nevertheless, that the telecommunications staff were among those who were least adversely affected in this respect, since the Finance Secretariat had authorised, for the payment of salaries for this category of officials, the utilisation of revenue which would normally have been paid direct to the Treasury.
.The Government also mentions that at the beginning of August  an inter-union commission, including representatives of the Argentine Association of Telegraphists and Radio Telegraphists (A.A.T.R.A.) and the Federation of Workers and Employees in Postal and Telecommunications Services (F.O.E.C.Y.T.) held negotiations with officials of the State Communications Secretariat for the purpose of obtaining a solution of the question of the payment of salaries for the month of July. Following these negotiations, so the Government declares, these two central trade union bodies informed the various affiliated unions through the medium of the press that they were to refrain from striking as from  August , since an arrangement had been made so that salaries in arrears would be paid as from  August. At that moment an isolated group of telegraph officials ceased work without having given notice of the strike. As the movement spread the Government issued an order to the trade union organisations forbidding them to have recourse to strike action. The strike continued, however, and the Government then withdrew the legal status of the two central trade union bodies mentioned above.
.The Government states that from the beginning the strike was only a partial one involving no more than  per cent of the workers, which percentage was soon reduced to . Seeing that the strike had not been valid, F.O.E.C.Y.T decided to put an end to the movement, and A.A.T.R.A followed suit. In these circumstances the two organisations had their legal status restored. As regards the dismissals, the Government declares that they were carried out under section  (a) of Decree No. /, which provides that unjustified absence of more than ten days, whether consecutive or not, constitutes a ground for dismissal. The Government adds that the majority of the persons in question, even before the strike began, had been guilty of unjustified absence exceeding the number of days prescribed by the section mentioned above.
.The Committee has always applied the principle that allegations relating to the exercise of the right to strike are not outside its competence in so far, but only in so far, as they affect the exercise of trade union rights.
.The Committee observed, at its meeting in February  on the subject of the dispute itself, that after some vicissitudes-negotiations, agreement, strikes, withdrawal of trade union status, ending of the strike and restoration of trade union status-the situation had returned to normal. In the circumstances, the Committee did not consider that there was any ground for pursuing its consideration of this aspect of the case.
.As regards the complaint proper the Committee observed that, while the complainants invoked article bis of the Constitution to show that the dismissals were illegal in character, the Government relied on the provisions of Decree No. / to justify the dismissals. Under article bis of the Constitution "" Labour shall be protected by laws guaranteeing... protection against arbitrary dismissals."" and "" trade unions shall be guaranteed the right to strike."". On the other hand, the grounds for dismissal stipulated in section  (a) of Decree No. / include a period of more than ten days, whether consecutive or not, of unjustified absence in the course of a year.
.The Committee took the view that days of absence resulting from a lawful strike could not, in view of the provisions of article bis of the Constitution, be regarded as unjustified absence within the meaning of section  (a) of Decree No. /. It considered, furthermore, that if it were intended to invoke the last-named provision, it should be clearly established that the action taken was quite independent of any consideration other than the fact that a fault had been committed by those who were affected by this action.
.The Committee felt that the Government's statements did not make it clear that the measures taken against the workers mentioned by the complainants were not related to the strike. The fact that the Government invoked as an additional argument the point that the majority of the workers affected had already been absent for more than ten days by the time the strike began would even tend to prove the contrary. In any event, it did not provide a valid explanation for the action taken in regard to the minority of the workers at issue. Moreover, as was seen previously, it is only in the case of a legal strike that article bis of the Constitution can be validly invoked. It was not clear from the Government's reply whether the strike action was illegal because it was started in defiance of a directive from the central trade union bodies or because due notice had not been given.
.Accordingly, the Committee decided, at its meeting in February , to ask the Government to supply certain additional information. It was asked to indicate, in respect of each of the dismissed workers-whose names have been supplied by the complainants what were the precise reasons for the action taken against them and whether the strike in question was regarded by the Government as illegal and, if so, by virtue of what statutory or other provisions.
.In its reply dated  May  the Government states (as it had in earlier cases) that these workers were employed by state-operated public services and their right to strike was subject to restrictions which were universally admitted by international law and practice and by the Committee on Freedom of Association itself. The Government points out that the Committee has repeatedly admitted that the general principle that workers and their organisations are entitled to strike as a legitimate means of defending their occupational interests may be subject to restrictions both in essential services and in the civil service. In these cases the Committee has stressed the importance of providing some procedure to ensure peaceful settlement of such disputes, so that the workers who are deprived of an essential means of occupational defence-such as a legal strike-may have appropriate guarantees.
.The Government states that postal and telecommunications employees, in their capacity as public servants, are not allowed to engage in strike action of the type attempted by a minority of these workers. In the event of a dispute there is a procedure laid down by Decree No.  dated  September , which takes into account the Committee's comments on Case No. , which also concerned Argentina. Section  of this decree states that disputes which may directly or indirectly cause the suspension, interruption, paralysis or denial of essential public services must be submitted to arbitration. If, in a case",2,1963,Argentina
30,".The complaint by the Textile Workers' Association was submitted in a letter dated  November  sent direct to the I.L.O. It was then forwarded to the Argentine Government with a covering letter dated  November  for its observations, which were forwarded on  January .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its complaint the Textile Workers' Association, an Argentine trade union organisation, claims that the Government has violated Article  of Convention No.  and section  of the Trade Union Act (No. ) by deliberately ending the term of office of the Association's senior officials and appointing Government administrators under Order No. / issued by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security.
.In its reply the Government stated that section  of the ministerial order referred to was rescinded by Order No. /, a copy of which was attached. The preamble to Order No. / stated that the Ministry had power to take over control of the assets of trade unions with incorporated status in special circumstances (usually where the term of office of the executive committee was extended in violation of the relevant legislation and the union's own rules). The Government explained that such emergency measures did not involve interference in the work of the unions, but merely constituted a safeguard to protect the members' interests. The preamble of the order stated that a co-administrator would only be appointed for the remaining term of office of the present officials of the Textile Workers' Association, who were responsible for the management of the union's assets. The Government explained in its letter that when the Association made an application for the withdrawal of Ministerial Order No. /, section  of that order was rescinded under a later Order No. /.
.The Committee notes, in short, that according to the complainants, the Ministry issued an order appointing an official administrator for the Textile Workers' Association in violation of section  of Act No.  as well as of Article  of Convention No. , under which workers' organisations are entitled to elect their representatives in full freedom, to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes, while the public authorities are required to refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof.
.The Government for its part states that Order No. / was only issued in order to safeguard the union's assets and that it was for this purpose that a co-administrator was appointed. Furthermore, when an appeal was made section  of the order was rescinded.
.It would appear from the information supplied that the Ministry appointed a co-administrator in the special situation created when the term of office of the executive committee of the Textile Workers' Association was extended in violation of the law and the union's own rules. It would also appear that the co-administrator was appointed by virtue of section  of Order No. /, which was later rescinded. The complainants allege that this measure involves a breach, not only of Article  of the Convention, but also of section  of Act No. , which is worded as follows:In no circumstances shall the enforcing authority have the power to intervene in the management or the administration of the occupational associations covered by this Act.
.The Committee recalls that in a number of other cases dealing with Argentina, it has had to examine the problem of government intervention in the affairs of a trade union. In these cases, the Governing Body decided to call the Government's attention to the importance it attaches to the principle explicitly set forth in Article  of Convention No.  (ratified by Argentina) that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict the right of workers' organisations to elect their representatives in full freedom and to organise their administration and activities.
.In the present case, it would appear that the Ministry of Labour appointed a co-administrator in special circumstances for a short period and in order to safeguard the union's own assets. When the complainants appealed against this order it was rescinded.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body, while calling the Government's attention once more to the principle embodied in Article  of Convention No. , to note that the measure which led to the complaint being submitted has been revoked.",2,1963,Argentina

.The complaint by the World Federation of Trade Unions was submitted in a letter sent direct to the I.L.O on  October . It was then forwarded to the Colombian Government, which sent in its comments in a letter dated  January .

.As regards the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with respect to the allegations concerning the Medellin Trade Union, since the complainants have worded their complaint in such vague terms, which do not make sufficiently clear the nature of the actions alleged to constitute a violation of trade union rights, to decide that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination;(b) to take note that the strike was prohibited on the ground that its purposes were not occupational or economic in character and because the statutory procedures for direct settlement and conciliation had not been complied with;(c) to call the Government's attention, as regards the allegation relating to the occupation, search and ransacking of trade union premises and workers' homes, to the importance it attaches to the principle that trade union premises should only be searched if the judicial authority has issued an appropriate warrant on the ground that evidence is likely to be found on those premises which is needed in preparing legal proceedings and that any such search should take place subject to the conditions laid down in the warrant;(d) to take note of the fact that all the individuals involved in the strikes have now been released, but, in view of the fact that none of the persons detained was found guilty, to call the Government's attention to the danger that may be entailed for the exercise of trade union rights by the preventive arrest of workers and their leaders against whom no charge can later be proved;(e) to call the Government's attention to the importance it attaches to the principle that a workers' or employers' organisation should not be liable to suspension or dissolution by administrative authority and to suggest to the Government the possibility of reviewing national legislation with a view to bringing it into harmony with this principle, as stated in paragraph ;(f ) to reiterate the views it expressed in Case No.  and to call the Government's attention to the abuses that may be caused by the application of section  of the Labour Code owing to its wide scope, and having regard to the effects which the prohibition of strikes may have on the exercise of trade union rights, to suggest the possibility of considering an amendment to this section, so that if it should be decided to prohibit strikes in certain cases, the latter should be restricted to services which are absolutely essential;(g) to ask the Government to be good enough to inform it as to the results of the judicial inquiries that have been made into the events which occurred during the strikers' demonstration in the square at Puerto Boyac;(h) to take note of the Committee's present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report to the Governing Body as soon as it receives the information it has requested from the Government.",-1,1963,Colombia
32,".The complaint by the Christian Trade Union Movement of Peru is contained in a telegram sent directly to the Director-General of the I.L.O and dated  March . It was communicated to the Government, for observations, by letter of  March. The Government replied by letter of  May. The complainants, who were informed by letter, also dated  March , of their right to submit further information in support of their complaint, have not made use of this right.
.Peru has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Christian Trade Union Movement of Peru alleges that the public authorities of Puno infringed freedom of association in connection with the holding of the Second Congress of Peasants ( to  March ).
.In its communication of  May  the Government states that it at all times respects Constitutional freedoms and safeguards; that among these, freedom of assembly, in particular, is respected throughout the national territory without any restriction; that this is evidenced by the meetings of a social, trade union and professional character, of many kinds and in many places, which are held from day to day and enjoy not only safeguards from the Government but also its warm appreciation, as in the case of the Second Congress of Peasants of the province of Puno. The Government concludes by asserting that no action whatever was taken against the said Congress; that owing to the distance between Lima and Puno there was some delay before the central authorities were informed of the holding of the Congress; but that as soon as they were aware of it (on the very day of its opening) instructions were given by radio and telephone to the province of Puno authorising the Congress and affording it the full protection of the law.
.The Committee observes that the complainants' apprehension with regard to the effective holding of the Second Congress of Peasants of the province of Puno appears to have been unfounded, since on the one hand they have not sent any additional information or evidence in support of their complaint and on the other hand the Government states (in its letter of  May ) that the Congress was held without any opposition on its part, and that as soon as it was aware of the arrangements which had been made it sent instructions to the province of Puno authorising the Congress, to which the full protection of the law was to be afforded.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that the case does not call for further examination.",-1,1963,Peru
33,".The Committee considered these three cases together at its meeting held in May , when it submitted the interim conclusions contained in paragraphs  to  of its rd Report, which was approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session (May-June ). In that report the Committee submitted its definitive conclusions and recommendations concerning two series of allegations: (a) those relating to the imprisonment of the trade union leader Reinaldo Gonzlez and (b) those relating to the dissolution of employers' organisations. Thus the only allegations consideration of which has remained in suspense are those put forward by I.C.F.T.U concerning the detention of trade union officials; in this connection the Government was asked to supply detailed information (see paragraph  of the aforesaid report).
.In a communication dated  November , transmitted by the Permanent Delegation of Cuba in Geneva on  December , the Government answered that request for information.
.Cuba has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the  trade union officials on whose situation the Government has supplied information, to emphasise to the Government, as it has already done previously, the importance which it attaches to the principle that accused trade unionists, like all other persons, should be entitled to the safeguards of normal judicial procedure;(b) to invite the Government to co-operate by furnishing, as soon as possible, detailed information concerning the present situation of the trade union officials in question and of those referred to in paragraphs  and  above, as well as the texts of the judgments handed down in each instance and their grounds; and meanwhile to postpone consideration of the case;(c) to take note of the present interim report of the Committee, it being understood that the Committee will report further to the Governing Body when the information referred to in subparagraph (b) above has been received.
.In accordance with the practice which it has followed in certain earlier cases, the Committee has found it convenient to consolidate and consider together the three cases relating to Cuba, which concern the complaints presented by the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions (I.F.C.T.U.), the Economic Corporations of Cuba (in exile) and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (I.C.F.T.U.).
.Cuba has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.With regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:
.The complaint is contained in a communication dated  February . It was brought to the attention of the Government, which replied to it on  April .
.Cuba has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants have submitted to the Committee a lengthy document in which it is alleged that the Cuban Government has violated the principles and standards laid down in Conventions Nos.  and  in regard to both employers and workers. As regards the actual matter of the right of association of employers, the complainants allege that as from  January , when the present rgime came to power, it began by progressive stages to restrict and interfere with the free operation of the employers' organisations, arbitrarily decreeing that there should be intervention therein, persecuting their members and leaders, thus forcing them into exile, and finally ordering the dissolution of the employers' associations, the majority of which were wound up during  and . The complainants add that in making these interventions the Ministry of Labour invoked Act No.  of  December , which empowered the Minister to order the taking of such measures where in his opinion circumstances rendered it necessary for the maintenance in operation of the centres of production. This Act, which was in force for  months before being repealed by Act No.  of  May , was the pretext used to interfere with and finally dissolve all the employers' organisations. The greater part of the document is concerned with various nationalisation and expropriation measures taken by the Government.
.In its reply the Government merely states that in regard to this case, in view of the political and ideological implications which naturally arise from it, it wishes to draw the attention of the Governing Body to the importance of the right of peoples to self-determination, and their freedom to choose the economic systems and political structures best suited to their desires for progress and culture, in peaceful co-existence with other peoples and different systems.
.The Committee considers that the Government's reply does not contain any information specific enough to enable it to form an opinion as to the merits of the complaint. The complainants allege in fact that the Minister interfered with employers' organisations, invoking Act No.  of , "" where in his opinion circumstances rendered it necessary for the maintenance in operation of the centres of production "". The complainants also declare that this interference with the associations culminated in their dissolution. The Government makes no reference to these specific allegations, nor to the reasons which motivated the Government's actions.
.The Committee observes that Cuba has ratified Convention No. , Article  of which provides that employers as well as workers, without distinction whatsoever, shall have the right to establish organisations of their own choosing without previous authorisation; Article  stipulates that public authorities shall refrain from any interference which would restrict the right of organisations to draw up their Constitutions and rules, to elect their representatives in full freedom, to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes; while Article  lays down that organisations shall not be liable to be dissolved or suspended by administrative authority. Moreover, the Committee also observes that, according to a statement made by a Government representative to the Committee on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations at the International Labour Conference in , employers may form associations in conformity with the Royal Decree of 
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to express its regret that, more than a year after the complaint was brought to its attention, the Government still has not furnished concrete observations concerning the specific allegations made in the complaint ;(b) to request the Government to be good enough to furnish its observations as soon as possible, particularly in regard to the measures taken in respect of employers' associations, the legal enactments invoked in this connection and the procedure followed ;(c) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will report further as soon as it has received the information requested from the Government.",-1,1963,Cuba
34,".By a communication dated  June , addressed directly to the I.L.O, the Printing Workers' Union of Zulia presented a complaint of alleged infringement of freedom of association against the Government of Venezuela. The complainants were informed, by a letter dated  July , of their right to furnish further information in substantiation of their complaint within a period of one month ; but they did not avail themselves of this right. The complaint was transmitted to the Government, for its observations, by a letter also dated  July  ; the Government forwarded its observations on  October .
.At its th Session (Geneva,  and  November ) the Committee decided to defer examination of the case until the present session because the Government's observations had been received too late to be examined in November.
.Venezuela has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication, the complaining organisation states that officials in the service of the government political party promote fragmentation by threatening to dismiss employees of the Government Printing Office unless they renounce their membership of the Union. It alleges that an attempt is being made to found a parallel organisation and that the acts denounced amount to introducing party politics into the trade union movement.
.In its reply the Government rejects the complaint, stating that Venezuela has a democratic rgime and that the conditions attached to establishing a trade union are defined in statutory provisions. It adds that the complainant union is dominated by extremist elements, that despite this there has been no political interference with it, and that no parallel trade union organisation has been established nor is any such action intended.
.The Committee observes that the complainants have made allegations in very general terms and that no particular person is mentioned, no date is given to the alleged events and all significant details such as might give the accusations point are omitted, so that no sufficient evidence has been adduced to support the complaint.
.Accordingly, the Committee, while it has always attached the greatest importance to the principle enunciated in the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), that "" workers shall enjoy adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment "", considers that in the present case the complainants have not produced sufficient evidence to permit of an examination of the case on its merits.",1,1963,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
35,"was not directed against the workers but against persons disturbing public order, and its aim was to restore, in the disturbed area, the legal safeguards required if the public and private affairs that had thus been disturbed were to resume their normal, peaceful course. The Government also states that these disturbances were part of an organised plan to carry out subversive activities on the territory of the Republic, in accordance with instructions from abroad, with a view to creating an atmosphere of nation-wide chaos and violence.
.In its communication of  March  the Government also states that, despite the temporary suspension of Constitutional safeguards, organised labour activities continued normally, without impediment, as indicated by the following facts: (a) the organisation of new unions; (b) the recognition of unions previously formed; (c) claims by several trade unions for better wages and working conditions, and their settlement; (d) strikes called during this period, which were dealt with by strictly labour procedures; (e) conciliation activities by the central and regional agencies of the Ministry of Labour; and (f) absolute freedom of leaders of workers' organisations to intervene in all matters of interest to them.
.The Committee notes that, of the allegations made by the complainants, some, and precisely the most serious, such as those concerning the death of over  workers and peasants, were expressed in the complaint in extremely vague terms and that, notwithstanding the opportunity granted the complainants to supply further information, they have not contributed more factual data in support of their serious accusations. The Committee therefore considers that these allegations do not call for further examination.
.The Committee further notes that though the Government in its reply rejects in a general manner what it considers to be unfounded accusations, asserting that the real issue was a defensive stand taken by the Government of Peru in face of situations and acts contrary to legal order, and quoting a series of facts to show that the trade union movement continued without any impediment whatsoever, the reply makes no reference to other accusations of a more precise nature formulated by the complainants, i.e. the detention of the trade union officials Messrs. Jos Luis Alvarado, Emiliano Huamatica, Guillermo Sheen and all the officials of the Lima Building Workers' Union and the imprisonment of many of the arrested persons, including trade union leaders, in the prison of El Sepa.
.When in previous cases allegations that trade union leaders or workers had been detained on account of trade union activities have been met by governments with statements that the persons in question had been detained for subversive activities, for reasons of internal security, or for common law crimes, the Committee has always followed the rule that the governments concerned should be requested to submit further and as precise information as possible concerning the detentions in question and the exact reasons for them. If, in certain cases, the Committee has concluded that the allegations concerning the arrest or detention of trade union leaders did not call for further examination, this has been after it has received information from the governments showing sufficiently precisely and with sufficient detail that these arrests or detentions were in no way occasioned by trade union activities but solely by activities outside the trade union sphere, which were either prejudicial to public order or of a political nature.
.In the present case the Government has confined itself to stating that the measures it was obliged to take were not directed against the workers but against persons disturbing public order.
.The Committee considers that, in order to be able to form an opinion in full knowledge of the facts, and to ascertain whether or not the allegations are justified, it would be necessary to obtain from the Government more precise information on the reasons for the detention of Messrs. Josh Luis Alvarado, Emiliano Huamatica and Guillermo Sheen, relating in particular to the acts or precise activities for which these persons are held responsible, and to ask it whether there have been or still are trade unionists detained in the prison of El Sepa.
.In all the circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to decide that the allegations referred to in paragraph  above do not, for the reasons indicated in that paragraph, call for further examination;(b) to request the Government of Peru to supply more precise information on the reasons for the detention of Messrs. Jos Luis Alvarado, Emiliano Huamatica and Guillermo Sheen, relating in particular to the acts or precise activities for which these persons are held responsible, and to ask it whether there have been or still are trade unionists detained in the prison of El Sepa, and to decide, meanwhile, to defer the examination of this case.",0,1963,Peru

During the general discussion on this Committee's report in a plenary session of the Conference the Panamanian Workers' delegate referred to news items which had appeared in a number of newspapers and declared that they showed that the Panamanian Government was intervening directly in the internal affairs of the Confederation of Labour of the Republic of Panama.
.Accordingly, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide to ask the Government once more to forward its precise observations on the complaint regarding the Government's action in the case of the Confederation of Labour of the Republic of Panama with the least possible delay, and in the meantime to postpone its examination of the case.",-1,1963,Panama
37,".The complaints of the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unionists are contained in a communication dated  December  and enlarged upon in a further communication dated  February . The Government has forwarded its observations in two letters dated  February and  May .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their first communication the complainants announced that the headquarters of the Christian Farm Workers' Front in the city of San Jos had been broken into by the police. In their second communication the complainants confirmed this statement, adding that the public authorities had subsequently given the necessary assurances and guarantees that freedom of association would be respected, following the protests received from other trade union organisations abroad. In the same letter the complainants stated that on  January  Mr. Claudio Gamboa, a senior official of the Christian Farm Workers' Front of Costa Rica, had been arrested while on a visit to the Puntarenas district. He was released after being interrogated several times, and later the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare explained to him how it had happened.
.The Federation stated categorically in the final paragraph of its second communication that it wished its complaint to be held in suspense until the situation in Costa Rica became clearer.
.In its communication of  February  the Government announced that, in view of the various protests that had been received, an investigation had been made into the alleged forcible entry by the police into the union premises. During the investigation contact was made with Mr. Claudio Gamboa, who stated that while a Christmas party was in progress at the headquarters of the Christian Farm Workers' Front in San Jos two members of the armed police came in and after staying a short time left without any further developments. Mr. Gamboa spoke to them, but did not ask them why they were there. At a later meeting at which the Minister of Public Security, the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare, Mr. Gamboa and the two policemen concerned were present, the latter declared that while on their beat during the Christmas festivities they passed in front of the union offices in question and were invited by a man who came out to join the party. They stayed for a few minutes and had a short conversation with Mr. Gamboa, and then left without in any way - disturbing the guests at the party. According to the Government Mr. Gamboa did not deny this account, but argued that he had lodged his complaint with a number of international trade union organisations because of the potential threat to trade union freedoms involved in actions such as these, which might create a precedent.
.The Government added that it was made quite clear at the meeting that the two policemen were acting on their own account and at no time had any intention of breaking in. The Minister of Labour fully explained the position to Mr. Gamboa on behalf of the Government. Mr. Gamboa later told the Minister that he was getting in touch with the trade union organisations to which he had sent his complaint to tell them of the satisfactory explanation given by the Government and ask them for permission to withdraw his complaint. The Government enclosed copies of the cables sent by Mr. Gamboa to the organisations in question.
.In its communication of  May  the Government referred to the complaint concerning the arrest of Mr. Claudio Gamboa on  January  in the Puntarenas district. According to the Government, Mr. Gamboa had gone to Puntarenas to deal with a social problem involving itinerant salesmen. The meeting he attended was alleged to be communist-inspired, and the commandant requested Mr. Gamboa to accompany him to his office. There his identity was established and he was asked a number of questions, after which he was allowed to leave. The Government made inquiries and gave Mr. Gamboa a full explanation of what had happened. Furthermore, the Government gave specific instructions to the competent authorities to take steps to ensure that the Constitutional principle of freedom of association continued to be respected.
.Without going into the substance of the allegations made, the Committee notes that Mr. Gamboa, a Christian trade union official in Costa Rica, has asked a number of trade union organisations, including the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unionists, for permission to withdraw the complaint he made of forcible entry into the premises of the Christian Farm Workers' Front, and that the Federation itself, in its communication of  February , requests that its complaint be left in suspense until the position of that organisation in Costa Rica becomes clearer.
.A question of procedure arises here of a kind which the Committee has already had to consider in similar cases in the past. In Case No. , concerning Greece, the Committee expressed the view that the desire shown by a complaining organisation to withdraw its complaint, while constituting a factor to which the greatest attention must be paid, is not in itself sufficient reason for the Committee to cease automatically to proceed with the examination of the complaint. On that occasion the Committee considered that in this respect it should be guided by the conclusions approved by the Governing Body in  and  with regard to two representations submitted by the Madras Labour Union for Textile Workers and by the Socit de Bienfaisance des Travailleurs de l'Ile Maurice, in accordance with article  of the Constitution of the Organisation (now article ). The Governing Body at that time established the principle that, from the moment that a representation was submitted to it, it alone was competent to decide what effect should be given to it, and that "" the withdrawal by the organisation making the representation is not always proof that the representation is not receivable or is not well founded"". The Committee considers that, in implementing this principle, it is free to evaluate the reasons given to explain the withdrawal of a complaint and to investigate whether these appear sufficiently plausible to lead one to believe that the withdrawal was made in complete independence. It has been pointed out by the Committee that cases might exist in which the withdrawal of a complaint by the organisation presenting it would be a result not of the fact that the complaint had become without purpose but of pressure exercised by the government against the complainants, the latter being threatened with an aggravation of the situation if they did not consent to this withdrawal.
.In the present case it would appear from the information supplied by the Government, taken in conjunction with that contained in the complainants' communication of  February , that the problems raised have been adequately taken care of the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare having given an explanation of what had occurred and issued instructions to local authorities to ensure respect for the principle of freedom of association.
.Consequently the Committee considers that, in the light of the above and of the fact that the complainants themselves have asked that their complaint should be merely adjourned, and not withdrawn completely, there appears no room for doubt that they have acted freely and of their own volition without being subjected to pressure of any kind. The Committee therefore recommends the Governing Body to decide that no useful purpose will be served by its proceeding further with the examination of the case.",1,1963,Costa Rica
38,"the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation; that the objects set forth therein are included among those which the International Labour Organisation was established to promote, according to article  of the Constitution, as amended at Montreal in ; and that the Declaration:... recognises the solemn obligation of the International Labour Organisation to further among the nations of the world programmes which will achieve... the effective recognition of the right of collective bargaining, the co-operation of management and labour in the continuous improvement of productive efficiency, and the collaboration of workers and employers in the preparation and application of social and economic measures.In these circumstances the Committee considers, as it did previously when examining the cases mentioned above, that it should,... in discharging the responsibility to promote these principles which has been entrusted to it, be guided in its task, among other things, by the provisions relating thereto approved by the Conference and embodied in the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention (No. ), .... which afford a standard of comparison when examining particular allegations, more particularly as Members of the Organisation have an obligation under article  () (e) of the Constitution to report to the Director-General of the International Labour Office, at appropriate intervals as requested by the Governing Body, the position of its law and practice in regard to the matters dealt with in unratified Conventions, showing the extent to which effect has been given, or is proposed to be given, to any of the provisions of the Convention by legislation, administrative action, collective agreement or otherwise and stating the difficulties which prevent or delay the ratification of such Conventions.Having regard to the above, and while noting that the Government of Brazil is one of those which have complied with the said obligation (at the request of the Governing Body) as regards the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and recognising that Brazil is not bound by the provisions of that Convention, the Committee considers that its non-ratification is not a sufficient reason to cause the Committee to refrain from examining the substance of allegations based wholly or partly on the provisions of that instrument or principles proceeding from it.
.It appears both from the statements of the complaint and from the Government's observations that the two trade unionists mentioned by I.M.F as having been arrested were subsequently released and that all legal proceedings against them were dropped. In these circumstances the Committee, considering that the complaint had become purposeless, might have recommended the Governing Body to decide not to examine it further.
.Nevertheless, if it be assumed that the complainant's allegations are accurate -and, far from being denied, they are largely corroborated by the Government the union officials Argeu dos Santos and Gavino Ferrari, while engaged on trade union work, were arrested by order of the Ja police, placed in cells intended for criminals and considered as such, they were accused of infringement of the "" right to work "" under section  of the Penal Code ("" coercion by violence or intimidation "") and under section  ("" action with intent to cause a stoppage of work or collective desertion and violence against persons or property ""); and only after eight days' detention in the condition summarised above were all charges against them withdrawn and themselves released, the plea of habeas corpus entered in their favour having been granted on appeal.
.In several previous cases, the Committee has pointed out that the detention of trade unionists concerning whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found is liable to involve restrictions of trade union rights. In these same cases the Committee has recommended the Governing Body to ask the government to consider whether the authorities concerned had instructions appropriate to eliminate the danger of detention for trade union activities.
.In the present case the Committee recommends the Governing Body, while taking note of the release of the persons concerned, to draw the attention of the Government to the view expressed in the previous paragraph.
.As regards the dispute itself, the Committee, noting that the labour court considered that there was breach of contract and that the case was brought before the ordinary courts to determine the workers' rights and any compensation due to them, considers that there is no ground for it to pursue further its examination of this aspect of the case.
.With regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body, while taking note of the release of Messrs. Argeu Egydio dos Santos and Gavino Ferrari, to point out to the Government that the detention by the authorities of trade unionists concerning whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found is liable to involve restrictions of trade union rights, and to ask the Government to ensure that the authorities concerned have instructions appropriate to eliminate the danger of such detention for trade union activities.",1,1963,Brazil

This was adopted by the Governing Body at its th Session in June-July . The allegations which remained pending related to the detention of trade union leaders, the dismissal of workers and trade unionists and abolition of the right to strike.
.With regard to the case as a whole the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note that, according to the information communicated by the Government, all the persons mentioned by the complainants as having been arrested are at liberty once more, and to decide that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination;(b) to suggest to the Government that it may care to examine the extent to which the laws afford the workers adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination and, if not, to enact specific provisions in conformity with the provisions of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. );(c) to note that, according to the Government's statement, the workers continue to enjoy the right of assembly for the discussion of labour problems and for the establishment of trade union organisations; and to decide that this aspect of the case does not call for further consideration;(d) to decide, having regard to the fact that the Committee has always applied the principle that allegations relating to the right to strike are not outside its competence in so far as they affect the exercise of trade union rights:(i) to note the Government's statement that the right to strike was suspended only for reasons of internal security and as an interim measure;(ii) to suggest to the Government that, in view of the time which has elapsed, it might re-examine the situation in the light of the considerations set forth in paragraph  above, and to request the Government to be good enough to keep the Governing Body informed of any new developments in the matter.

40,".The complaint by the International Metalworkers' Federation (I.M.F.) is contained in a communication addressed directly to the I.L.O and dated  February . Further information to substantiate it was sent on  May .
.The original complaint and the further information were transmitted to the Government, for its observations, in letters from the Director-General dated  March and  May . As some of the allegations made by the plaintiffs related to the arrest of trade unionists, the Director -General also informed the Government that this case belonged to the category of cases which the Committee and the Governing Body are required to examine with priority.
.The Government communicated its observations to the Office by two letters dated  and  October .
.The Committee was seized of the case at its th Session (Geneva, - November ), but, since the Government's observations had reached it too late to be examined as regards the substance of the case, decided to defer consideration until the present session.
.Brazil has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), but not the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ).
.I.M.F states that the events to which it intends to refer concern (a) members and leaders of the Ja Metal Workers' Association, which the complainant declares is associated with the Sao Paulo State Federation of Metal Workers' Unions, and (b) members and leaders of this latter organisation, which is itself affiliated to the I.M.F. It alleges that the acts in question were infringements of Conventions Nos.  and .
.The complainant organisation then gives a detailed description of the events said to have occurred. It states that since February  the Masiero Industrial Company S.A., having a staff of  metalworkers, all members of the Ja Metal Workers' Association, had been paying wages with ,  and even  days' delay, although the Labour Law stipulates that wages are payable within the first ten working days of each month.
.Having regard to the prejudice caused to the workers by this practice, the complaint goes on, Federation and local union representatives contacted company officials on several occasions, asking that the delayed payments be brought up to date; conciliatory conversations took place from March to October  but yielded no results, while the employer continued to delay payment of wages, ignoring the union's and Federation's requests to regularise the payments.
.The complaint continues to the following effect: by  November  the wages for October were still unpaid; the union, with the Federation's approval, convened a general meeting and, after discussing the facts, decided that if the company again delayed payment of wages a strike should be declared; the employer was informed and took note of this decision; the December wages were paid with only two days' delay; the company was also required by law to pay on  December the bonus for the "" thirteenth month ""; but the company gave promissory notice instead, due in  or  days, which was against the law.
.During the early days of January , the complaint goes on the union and the Federation jointly contacted the employer in an effort to fix a specific day for the payment of wages. Although the employer had promised that no delay should occur in that particular month, wages were received only after  days' delay. In view of this action, the union called a general meeting for  February, and this was attended by Argeu Egydio dos Santos, Vice-President of the Federation. The  members present (all employed by the company) decided that there should be another interview with the employer to ascertain when he intended to effect payment of wages and that the general meeting should convene again the following day,  February, to inform the workers of his reply.
.Immediately after the meeting, Argeu dos Santos and Gavino Ferrari (president of the local branch of the union) contacted the employer, who told them that, if the banks discounted the company's drafts, wages would be paid before  February; if not, the workers ""would have to be patient"".
.On  February, as arranged, the workers met again and the employer's answer was transmitted; the workers, angry at his conduct, resolved to strike, considering that this would be the only way of forcing the employer to arrange for wages to be paid in time. The strike was to start at zero hours on  February.
.Shortly after the above meeting, the decision to strike was announced from the local radio station several times during a six-hour period.
.The decision to strike having been taken, several groups of workers formed picket lines and moved towards the factory, where-the complainant states-they met a considerable force of police, civilian and military, under the orders of the Sao Paulo state government. There was no violence during the early hours of the strike, which was peaceful and complete. However, on  February about mid-day, while Messrs. Argeu dos Santos and Gavino Ferrari were talking with a group of workers in a street near the factory, they were arrested by the police without explanation and the other workers were ordered to disperse.
.As soon as the state Federation knew of these events, three officials were sent to Ja, accompanied by a lawyer, to take the appropriate steps. The workers, revolted at the police action, decided at a meeting not to reach any agreement with the employer as long as their union officials remained in gaol.
.The workers and their leaders then decided to take legal action in order to free the arrested officials. Through its legal department the Federation introduced a plea of habeas corpus for Argeu dos Santos and Gavino Ferrari before the local court at Ja. Twenty-four hours later the district judge studied this plea and rejected it. The complainants state that "" this decision aggravated the situation even further, as the judge had no right, in the absence of a crime, to deny the request of habeas corpus "".
.Having regard to the foregoing, its officials having been in gaol for eight days, the state Federation introduced another plea of habeas corpus, before the state court at Sao Paulo. On  February a judicial panel composed of ten magistrates sat to review the case and unanimously decided to release Argeu dos Santos and Gavino Ferrari; it also ordered all criminal proceedings to be discontinued, arguing that the arrests were illegal as the trade union office officials had acted to secure payment of wages which were due, that it was the duty of labour leaders to inform and guide their members, and that such action was no crime whatsoever.
.At the same time, administrative meetings (round table sessions with the Sao Paulo delegation of the Ministry of Labour) were held in an effort to settle the dispute itself. In one of these conversations Dr. Roberto Gusmao, the official representative of the Ministry of Labour, confirmed that the strike was lawful because the workers were fully entitled to claim their due wages. This statement by the Ministry's representative was published in the local Sao Paulo newspaper Ultima Hora and other newspapers.
.After the release of the two imprisoned leaders, which occurred on  February at . p.m., the workers met and unanimously decided to continue the strike until the dispute had been finally settled. Subsequently it was decided to present the workers' case before the labour court in order to obtain a decision at that level.
.On  February, the complainant states, the labour court decided that the delay in paying wages was a breach of contract and that the workers should submit individual claims to the local court at Ja which would then determine their rights and any compensation due to them.
.It was against this background, the complainant concludes, that the breach of contract was collectively attacked before the court at Ja, and that the workers at a general meeting unanimously decided to terminate the strike.
.The Government's reply and  October . In the first of these the Government merely confirms that, having been arrested and kept in custody by the judge at Jab despite the plea of habeas corpus, the two trade unionists mentioned by the complainant were released by order of the state court. In its second communication, referring to the complainant's allusion to a breach of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Government holds the view that, as Convention No.  has not been ratified by Brazil, any complaint thereon is non-receivable.
.This last statement by the Government calls first of all for an observation on the part of the Committee. While recognising that Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Committee considers it appropriate to point out, nevertheless, as it has done in relation to Case No.  (Canada), Case No.  (Sudan), Case No.  (Portugal), Case No.  (Ghana) and other previous cases that the Declaration of Philadelphia is now an integral part of",-1,1963,Brazil
41,".This case was examined by the Committee at its th Session (May ) when it submitted an interim report which is to be found in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, which was approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (June ).
.In paragraph  of its report the Committee, after examining the allegations and the Government's reply, made a number of recommendations and a request for information in the following terms:In all the circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to decide that the allegations referred to in paragraph  above do not, for the reasons indicated in that paragraph, call for further examination;(b) to request the Government of Peru to supply more precise information on the reasons for the detention of Messrs. Jos Luis Alvarado, Emiliano Huamatica and Guillermo Sheen, relating in particular to the acts or precise activities for which these persons are held responsible and to ask it whether there have been or still are trade unionists detained in the prison of El Sepa, and to decide, meanwhile, to defer the examination of this case..At its th Session (November ) the Committee decided to postpone its examination of the complaint because it had not yet received the information requested from the Peruvian Government.
.At its th Session (November ) the Committee decided to postpone its examination of the complaint because it had not yet received the information requested from the Peruvian Government.
.The Government supplied certain additional information in a letter dated  April .
.Peru has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but not the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.With regard to the outstanding allegations referred to in paragraph  (b) quoted above, the Committee recalls that the complainants had alleged that the Peruvian Military Government, under the pretext of having discovered a subversive plot, issued a decree in January  suspending Constitutional safeguards and launched a campaign of repression against the working-class movement. The police are alleged to have occupied the offices of a number of unions and to have arrested more than , people arbitrarily, including large numbers of union leaders and officials. The arrested persons included Jos Luis Alvarado, General Secretary of the Federation of Bank Employees, Emiliano Huamatica, President of the Cuzco Department Workers' Union, Guillermo Sheen, an official of the Salaried Employees' Union, and all the officials of the Lima Building Workers' Union. Still according to the complainants, many persons were sent to El Sepa Prison in the heart of the Amazonian forest. In its reply to the complaint by the World Federation of Trade Unions, the Government makes no reference to the foregoing allegations.
.The Committee recalled, when examining this aspect of the complaint and the Government's reply, that when, in previous cases allegations that trade union leaders or workers have been arrested or detained for trade union activities have been met by governments with statements that the arrests or detentions were made for subversive activities, for reasons of internal security or for common law crimes, the Committee has always followed the rule that the governments concerned should be requested to submit further and as precise information as possible concerning the arrests or detentions and the reasons for them. If, in certain cases, the Committee has concluded that allegations relating to the arrests or detentions of trade union militants did not call for further examination, this has been after it has received information from the government showing sufficiently precisely and with sufficient detail that the arrests or detentions were in no way occasioned by trade union activities but solely by activities outside the trade union sphere, which were either prejudicial to public order or of a political nature.
.In a further letter dated  April  the Government states that the events giving rise to the complaint occurred before the present Government came to power and that they are now a thing of the past.
.As regards this statement by the Government to the effect that the complaint refers to events which took place under the previous authorities, the Committee must point out that in other cases it has taken the view that there is a degree of continuity between successive governments of the same State and that, while the government in power cannot be held responsible for events which took place under its predecessor, it clearly is responsible for any continuing consequences which they may have had since its accession to power.
.The Committee notes that the Government also states that the events which gave rise to the complaint are now a thing of the past, i.e. the trade unionists referred to by the complainants in their allegations have now been set free.
.Accordingly, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that no useful purpose would be served by continuing its examination of this case.
.The complaint by the W.F.T.U is contained in a communication dated  January  addressed directly to the Director-General of the I.L.O. By a letter dated  February , the complaint was communicated to the Government for its observations. The Government replied by a communication dated  March , transmitted by the Permanent Delegation of Peru on  March . The complainants, who have been informed of their right to submit further information in support of their complaint, have not exercised this right.
.Peru has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but has not ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The W.F.T.U alleges in its complaint that, under the pretext of having discovered a subversive plot, the Military Government of Peru decreed on  January  the suspension of Constitutional safeguards throughout the country and unleashed a campaign of repression against the labour movement. The complainants also allege that the police occupied the headquarters of a number of unions and that over a thousand persons were arbitrarily detained and, in particular, a large number of trade union leaders and officials. The complainants mention among those detained Messrs. Jos Luis Alvarado, General Secretary of the Federation of Bank Employees, Emiliano Huamatica, President of the Cuzco Departmental Workers' Union, Guillermo Sheen, an official of the Salaried Employees' Union, and all the officials of the Lima Building Workers' Union. Still according to the complainants, many persons were sent to the El Sepa prison in the heart of the Amazonian Forest. The complainants further allege that this is not the first time that the Peruvian Military Junta has used these methods against the trade union movement: in December  the strike by the miners of the Cerro de Pasco Corporation was harshly suppressed and many strikers were killed and injured in the process; the Peruvian Peasants' Confederation publicly denounced the murder, at the end of December , of  peasants whose bodies were flung into the Vilcota by the forces of repression. Lastly, the complainants allege that on  January  the workers at El Callao, who were on strike for higher wages, were attacked by the police who killed one person and injured three more and that, since the coup d'tat of July , over  workers and peasants have been killed by the forces of repression.
.In its communication of  March  the Government states first of all that it is inadmissible for a body such as the W.F.T.U, which prides itself in exercising vigilance over the exercise of trade union rights, to do so without carrying out the necessary check on the information it receives, merely serving blindly as a channel for its transmission, and that a denunciation of this kind is likely to affect the spirit of goodwill and co-operation that governments may be able to show in committing themselves by the acceptance of instruments if, subsequently, without the necessary clarification, and even in an untenable form as in the present case, they may be used to exert pressure on the moral and legal conduct of the States parties to them. The Government adds that the issue in the present case is not a negation of the international obligations assumed by the Government of Peru, particularly under the labour Convention, which represents the contribution of the spirit of legislative progress and international co-operation on the part of the Government of Peru, as the Government has launched no attack on the principles of this or other labour Conventions and as there is no sign of a reaction against workers' rights. The Government goes on to point out that the real issue is the defensive stand taken by the Peruvian Government in the face of situations and acts contrary to the legal order, which have a history going back to a time prior to that of the complaint made by the W.F.T.U. For instance, the Government states, in the light of the serious incidents at Oroya, the Government was obliged to avail itself of its powers under article  of the Constitution and suspend the safeguards for the individual; this measure",0,1963,Peru
42,"the law since it had been proven that the persons sentenced had incited the workers to undermine the institutional life of the country by strikes and interruptions of work outside the bounds of the law and by direct resistance to the authority of the State, which is a breach of section  of the Penal Code, as already mentioned; this section makes it punishable for any Mexican national or alien to incite or induce others to perturb the institutional life of the country. In this connection the rulings supplied by the Government stress the fact that the action of the persons involved was not aimed at obtaining benefits for the working class, but at undermining the authority of the State for subversive ends.
.With regard to the offence of obstructing public communications, the Supreme Court of Justice points out that all the rolling stock of the national railway network was immobilised as a direct consequence of and in execution of the instructions telegraphed by Mr. Vallejo. The Supreme Court points out that for the offences defined in subparagraph VII of section  of the Penal Code to be committed it is not necessary to damage the rolling stock by force or violence.
.As regards the offence against the national economy, the Supreme Court considered that this too was fully proven, since the activities of the persons accused had undeniably caused serious perturbance in the economy of the country by immobilising thousands of tons of products and raw materials, depriving many areas of normal supplies, causing the cost of living to rise and impeding many commercial operations of vital importance to the country's economic life, all of which constitutes the offence contemplated in subparagraph III of section  of the Federal Penal Code, which makes it punishable to perturb the domestic market by any means other than the publication of false, exaggerated or tendentious news.
.The Supreme Court of Justice stressed the fact that the penalties inflicted did not violate individual safeguards since they were applied in conformity with the provisions of sections  and  of the Federal Penal Code within the minimum and maximum limits established and were proportionate to the degree of seriousness of the acts committed by the persons charged. Lastly, the Supreme Court of Justice declared that the claim of unconstitutionality made in the appeals was unfounded and refused to grant the appeal for amparo (protection of individual rights).
.The Committee notes that, in reply to the allegations made by the complainants, according to which the arrest and sentencing of former members of the national executive committee of the Railway Workers' Union of the Republic of Mexico constituted an act of repression tending to restrict the right to strike and other trade union rights, the Government has supplied the full text of the rulings of the courts of first and second instance and the full text of two rulings handed down by the Supreme Court of Justice in respect of the appeals lodged by Mr. Vallejo and the other persons charged. From these documents it appears that the competent judicial authorities, which seem to offer full procedural safeguards, considered that the acts committed by Mr. Vallejo and the other persons charged were offences under the Federal Penal Code.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note that it appears from the Court rulings, whose full text, including the grounds adduced therein, have been supplied by the Government, that Mr. Vallejo and the other persons charged were brought to trial before the ordinary courts, apparently with all the safeguards of judicial procedure, and sentenced on account of various offences contemplated in the Penal Code;(b) to note that the Supreme Court of Justice rejected the appeal for protection of individual rights (amparo) lodged by the persons concerned against the court sentences;(c) in view of the information contained in paragraphs (a) and (b) above and in accordance with the principles referred to in paragraph  above, to decide that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.Allegation relating to the Arrest and Dismissal of Strikers.With regard to the other allegations, according to which , workers were arrested and many hundreds dismissed from their jobs following the strike in , the Committee notes from the documents supplied by the Government that hundreds of workers were effectively arrested in connection with that dispute (see paragraph  above), for having maintained the strike in obedience to unlawful instructions (from their leaders) and in spite of the official pronouncements to the effect that the strikes were unlawful ("" inexistentes ""). Moreover, by its communication dated  February , the Government supplied the text of a statement made by the General Secretary of the Railway Workers' Union of the Republic of Mexico in answer to a questionnaire from the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare in December , that is to say, after the events in question and after the elections held by that trade union in  (see paragraphs  and  above). From this statement it would appear that the trade union directly concerned was not making any complaints against the Government for infringing freedom of association, which seems to show, no matter what the circumstances, that by that date the situation had returned to normal.

43,".The complaint by the Chilean Confederation of Labour (C.U.T.C.H.) and other trade union organisations was made in a letter dated  May . This letter was communicated to the Government, which forwarded its observations on  April .
.Chile has ratified the Right of Association (Agriculture) Convention,  (No. ), but not the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.According to the complainants, trade union organisations and collective disputes in agriculture in Chile are subject to special regulations which are separate from those applying to industrial workers. These regulations are contained in Act No.  of  July , which was passed many years after the Government had ratified Convention No. . The provisions of this Act are alleged to constitute a flagrant breach of the Convention not only because they subject agricultural workers to a different system from that applying to industrial workers but also because the relevant standards are so restrictive as to amount to a denial of freedom of association in agriculture. Accordingly, trade unions in agriculture are few in number, and those that do exist lead a precarious life which makes them completely incapable of defending and promoting the interests of their members. The observations made year after year by the Committee on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations of the International Labour Conference have so far had no effect, and farm workers continue to be covered by legislation which should never have been passed or should have been repealed. After these preliminary remarks the complainants give details of all the statutory provisions affecting agricultural trade unions which conflict with Convention No. .
.In its observations the Government states that at first glance a comparison between the standards applicable to workers in industry and those embodied in Act No.  concerning trade unionism among agricultural workers shows that the Chilean system does not give "" all persons employed in agriculture the same rights of association as workers in industry "". Accordingly, despite the fact that the Government has ratified Convention No. , the legislation now in force conflicts with the latter's standards. The Government adds that it should be borne in mind that the fact that agricultural workers are entitled to the same rights of association as industrial workers does not constitute an adequate safeguard in Chile, because on the whole the legislation applicable to the formation of trade unions by workers in industry, commerce, mining, etc., does not conform either to the standards of freedom of association laid down in Convention No. .
.In view of the foregoing the Government submitted a Bill to the National Congress on  February  making substantial changes in the legislation on trade unions to bring it into line with Convention No.  and make it applicable to all workers, whatever their occupation. In order to clarify its explanations the Government forwarded a copy of the legislation now applicable to agricultural workers' unions, as well as that embodied in the Bill recently submitted to the National Congress.
.The Committee observes that, for many years past, the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has been making observations to the Chilean Government with respect to the application of Convention No. . In these observations the Committee of Experts has specifically pointed out the fundamental discrepancies between the legislation on trade unionism among agricultural workers and the legislation on the same subject applicable to industrial workers. These discrepancies relate to the following points.
.Whereas according to section  of the Labour Code workers may set up two types of unions-works unions or occupational unions-agricultural workers under section  of the same Code may constitute trade unions only within the limits of an agricultural undertaking. As a result, agricultural workers do not have the right to set up unions extending beyond an undertaking or to set up federations and Confederations. There are also differences in the treatment of works unions and agricultural unions, some of which have the effect of substantially curtailing the right of association of agricultural workers. This applies, for example, to the administration of their funds and collective disputes. As regards the latter, under section  of the Labour Code unions of agricultural workers may not present statements of claims during the sowing and harvesting periods and, in any event, not more than once a year. The Committee of Experts took the view that this had no equivalent in the legislation relating to industrial workers and concluded that it led in practice to a denial to agricultural workers of any right to organise effectively, particularly in the case of seasonal or casual workers. Lastly, the provisions of section  of the Labour Code resulted in fact in prohibiting seasonal or casual workers from setting up trade unions. This was particularly important in the case of estates which employed a large proportion of seasonal or casual workers.
.The Committee has also taken note of the fact that the Government has submitted a Bill on trade unions to Congress. Under section  of this Bill, "" salaried employees and wage earners, whether or not employed by another person, and irrespective of their trade, occupation or activity, are entitled to form associations "". This Bill does not discriminate in the case of agricultural workers. Section  states that "" employers in agriculture must allow trade unions the fullest facilities to operate within their undertakings. To this end they must provide them with the premises needed to carry on their normal activity and shall permit free access by workers and their leaders to such premises and any meetings held thereon "". The Committee observes that the Committee of Experts also took note of this Bill and the fact that it applied without distinction to workers in industry and agriculture and expressed the hope that its early adoption would at last bring the legislation into full conformity with Convention No. .
.Accordingly, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the Government's attention to the discrepancies which continue to exist between the legislation still in force concerning agricultural trade unions and the Right of Association (Agriculture) Convention,  (No. ), which has been ratified by Chile;(b) to take note with interest of the Bill on trade unions recently submitted by the Government to Congress in order to eliminate these discrepancies; and(c) to request the Government to keep it informed as to any development in this matter, especially as regards the foregoing Bill, and to express the hope that it will soon be enacted.",-1,1963,Chile
44,".The complaint by the World Federation of Trade Unions is contained in a communication dated  September . It was transmitted to the Government, which sent its observations on  February .
.Mexico has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but not the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants alleged that at the beginning of August  a group of labour leaders including most of the former members of the national executive committee of the Union of Railwaymen of the Mexican Republic, as well as its General Secretary, Demetrio Vallejo Martinez, were sentenced to various terms of imprisonment; that Mr. Vallejo received a -year sentence which was confirmed on appeal; and that the said sentences were really a repressive act directed against the right to strike and other trade union rights which the convicted persons had exercised (in March , the complainants explained, the railway workers had gone on strike after negotiations for higher wages and better conditions of work proved fruitless; the Government had taken violent repressive action against the strikers, , workers being arrested; the leaders of the union had been imprisoned and prosecuted; hundreds of railwaymen had been dismissed; Mr. Vallejo and other leaders had been accused of subversive acts and left in prison for four years pending the judgment).
.The Government stated in its reply dated  February , as a preliminary issue, that the Union of Railwaymen of the Mexican Republic was not affiliated to the World Federation of Trade Unions, that the latter organisation could not claim a representative character which it did not possess, and that the complaint was therefore not receivable.
.On the substance of the case, the Government alleged that when Mr. Vallejo and the other accused became officers of the above-mentioned union they took the opportunity of promoting a series of disturbances, unlawful movements and acts of violence tending to weaken the national economy and subvert established institutions. Consequently, it continued, considering that the offence of social subversion (disolucin social), offences against the economy, the offence of disturbing public communications, etc., had been committed, the Government asked the judicial authorities to intervene. The above offences were punishable under common law provisions and the persons mentioned were accused as common law criminals. In the proceedings which followed, they were found to be criminally liable by the courts of first and second instance. However, the Supreme Court of Justice, the highest judicial organ of the country, had at that time not yet pronounced on the matter. The accused had individual defending counsel chosen by themselves and had not been in close or solitary confinement; the hearings were public, and the proceedings were conducted in accordance with the time limits provided by legislation.
.The Government attached to its reply the text of the sentence pronounced by the Second District Judge (Criminal Court) of the Federal District in the proceedings against the persons mentioned above. It also furnished a certificate from the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare to the effect that the Ministry received the records of the meetings held in January  at which the members of the various committees, particularly the national executive committee and national committee of supervision and inspection, of the Union of Railwaymen of the Mexican Republic were elected. Lastly, the Government also furnished a copy of a letter dated  December  from the General Secretary of the same union to the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare in which he replied to several questions put by the Ministry.
.It appears from the replies contained in the said letter, inter alia, that the Union of Railwaymen of the Mexican Republic is the only union organising railway workers in Mexico and has concluded collective agreements on their behalf; that the union does not belong to any national or international federation and consequently is not affiliated to the World Federation of Trade Unions; that the union has at no time empowered the W.F.T.U to make a complaint against the Government of Mexico for violation of freedom of association; that the Government has never infringed freedom of association in relation to the workers, including railwaymen; that at no time have , railway workers been arrested; that Mr. Vallejo and others had been convicted for criminal offences by a court of first instance and had instituted an appeal.Preliminary Question as to Receivability of the Complaint
.When the Committee examined the case at its th Session (June ) it recalled that, on a previous occasion, the Secretary-General of the United Nations had transmitted to the I.L.O a complaint by the Local Railway Workers' Council at Tierra Blanca (Veracruz, Mexico) relating to the arrest of Mr. Vallejo. That complaint had been communicated to the Mexican Government, which stated that at the time of lodging it the signatories were not, as they claimed, President and Secretary of the said council and therefore had no right to make the complaint. In those circumstances the Committee had asked for the information which it required in order that the situation might be clarified; as this was not received, it reached the following conclusion:Since the Committee has not been able to obtain the information it requested about the complaining organisation, and since furthermore it has not been able to ascertain the real status of the signatories of the complaint, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that the complaint is not receivable under the procedure in force.
.In the present case, observed the Committee at its th Session, the Government argued that, as the Union of Railwaymen of the Mexican Republic was not affiliated to the World Federation of Trade Unions, the latter organisation could not claim a representative character which it did not possess and that the complaint it presented was therefore not receivable.
.The Committee pointed out at its th Session that, according to the procedure in force for the examination of complaints of alleged infringements of freedom of association, allegations are receivable only if they are submitted by a national organisation directly interested in the particular matter, or an international organisation of employers or workers having consultative status with the I.L.O, or another international organisation of employers or workers where the allegations relate to matters directly affecting an organisation affiliated to it.
.In the present instance, the Committee noted, the complaint was presented by the World Federation of Trade Unions, an international organisation of workers which has consultative status with the I.L.O. This being so, it was not necessary, under the rules set out above, for the said organisation to have the Union of Railwaymen of the Mexican Republic among its affiliates in order to be able to present a complaint respecting matters affecting that union and its former officers.
.In these circumstances the Committee decided that, for the reasons given above, the complaint presented by the World Federation of Trade Unions was receivable under the procedure in force.
.This decision was brought to the notice of the Government by a letter dated  June .Allegations concerning Sentences Imposed on Trade Union Leaders
.The complainants alleged that most of the former members of the national executive committee of the Union of Railwaymen of the Mexican Republic were sentenced as an act of repression against a strike. The Government maintained that the sentences in question were imposed for the commission of criminal and particularly of subversive acts. As evidence in support of this statement, the Government transmitted the judgment handed down by the court of first instance, setting out the acts alleged to have been committed by the accused and stating the legal basis for conviction and sentence.
.When it examined the case at its th Session (June ), the Committee recalled that in previous cases "" in which allegations that trade union leaders or workers were arrested for trade union activities have been met by governments with statements that the arrests were really made for subversive activities, reasons of internal security or common law crimes, it had always followed the rule that the governments should be requested to submit further information, as precise as possible, concerning the arrests and the exact reasons for them. If in certain cases the Committee had concluded that allegations relating to the arrest and detention of trade union militants did not call for further examination this had been after it had received information from the governments showing with sufficient clarity and detail that the arrests, etc., were in no way occasioned by trade union activities but resulted from acts outside the trade union sphere which were either prejudicial to public order or of a political nature.
.The Committee observed that, according to what the Government stated in its reply, the persons mentioned in the complaint had been convicted, in first and second instance, of common law crimes. In the bulky judgment of the court of first instance transmitted by the Government, the actions of the respective accused persons and their share in the acts which they were charged with are analysed at length. Mr. Vallejo was convicted of",1,1963,Mexico
45,"the offence of social subversion (disolucin social), the offences of disturbing the public communications, and an offence equivalent to that of individual rebellion. The other persons implicated were also charged with some or all of these offences.
.After analysing the abundant evidence recorded in relation to the case, the Judge reached the conclusion that there remained no possibility of doubt, either regarding the close relationship between Communist political groups and the activities of the accused, or regarding the latter's aims, since, he said, they did not act with the specific object of supporting the claims of workers as such, but principally in order to bring about a subversive political movement. The Judge went on to declare that: "" Commission of the offence of social subversion (disolucin social), that is, any kind of action which induces or incites a person or persons to perform acts of provocation with the object of disturbing the peace, has been amply proved in the proceedings,"" since the Communist leaders against whom they were brought and some of the other accused, using means of agitation which are specified in the judgment, induced and incited the railwaymen, the members of the other workers' organisations to whom the accused appealed for solidarity and support on behalf of the railwaymen, and the proletariat in general, to perform acts of provocation with the object of disturbing the peace and public order, and those acts resulted in paralysis of the country's rail transport system consequent on the work stoppage in which all the railwaymen were persuaded to engage "" in the manner very clearly established in the present judgment"".
.The acts submitted for examination by the Judge were also considered to constitute the offences of interference with general public communications, disturbing the economy and coercing the authorities (regarded as equivalent to individual rebellion). The first of these was committed, in the Judge's opinion, by the suspension of the country's rail communications consequent upon the accused's incitement of the workers to subvert the institutional life of the nation and perform acts of provocation with the object of disturbing the peace and public order. The offence against the economy was considered to consist in disturbing the domestic market by improper means. Lastly, the offence of coercing the authorities was considered to consist in the accused's use of strike action to obtain the intervention of the authorities, not only without due process of law but contrary to what had been decided by the Federal Board of Conciliation and Arbitration.
.The Government stated in its communication dated  February  that "" the Supreme Court of Justice, the highest judicial organ of this country, has still to give a ruling; it will be called upon to decide finally what action shall be taken "". The Committee understood from this statement that the case was still pending before the Supreme Court.
.The Committee recalled at its th Session that in the past it had always followed the practice of not continuing to examine matters which were the subject of proceedings pending before a national court of law where the said proceedings might make available information of assistance to it in appreciating whether or not allegations were well founded."" The Committee has pointed out on previous occasions that it had been its regular practice to ask the governments for information regarding such judicial proceedings and their result.
.In these circumstances the Committee noted with interest the judgment sent by the Government, but, since the matter was still pending before a court of law, it requested the Government to be good enough to communicate the result of the Supreme Court's proceedings and decided in the meantime to defer the formulation of its conclusions on the case.
.At its th, th and th Sessions (November , February  and May  respectively) the Committee decided to adjourn its examination of the case since it had not received the information requested from the Government.
.In a communication dated  May  the Government stated that in order to be able to send that information it had instructed the Public Prosecutor of the Republic to supply full details, from which it appeared that the ruling of the court of second instance (first circuit court of one judge) (Tribunal Unitario del Primer Circuito) had been made the subject of an appeal for amparo (protection of individual rights) to the First Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice and that the case was still under consideration.
.Consequently, at its st and nd Sessions (November  and February ), the Committee again adjourned its examination of the case. By a communication dated  March  from the Permanent Delegation of Mexico in Geneva, the Government supplied the text of the ruling handed down by the first circuit court of one judge (Tribunal Unitario del Primer Circuito) on  May  which confirmed nearly the whole of the ruling of the court of first instance although it acquitted the persons sentenced for the offence of individual rebellion. The court of second instance also confirmed that ten of the persons sentenced had in the meantime served the prison sentences relating to the other offences, which fact it noted in its ruling. It reduced Mr. Vallejo's sentence to  years and four months and gave the other persons involved prison sentences varying from two years and eight months to  years and two months.
.At its rd Session (May ) the Committee again postponed examination of the case in the hope of receiving the ruling of the Supreme Court of Justice. By a communication dated  January  from the Permanent Delegation of Mexico in Geneva, the Government supplied the text of two rulings of  March , handed down by the First Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice in respect of appeals Nos. / and / against the ruling of the court of second instance by Mr. Vallejo and the other persons accused. It appears from the rulings of the Supreme Court that eight more similar appeals, lodged by the other persons sentenced, gave rise to similar rulings. In the enumeration of the grounds for its rulings the Supreme Court of Justice commented in detail on the elements which, according to the provisions of the Federal Penal Code, constitute each of the three offences proven before the court of second instance; it also commented on the charges themselves and the evidence brought.
.Among the grounds adduced was the fact that the offence of attempting to overthrow the State, defined in section  of the Federal Penal Code in the list of offences against the internal safety of the nation, was to be considered as coming under the heading of political crimes. It appears from the comments of the Supreme Court that the political offence for which Mr. Vallejo and other persons were sentenced consisted of promoting and executing programmes aimed at using the trade union movement to subvert the juridical and political structure of the State, established by the  Constitution, and replace it by a Socialist rgime
.The grounds for the ruling go on to describe various forms of agitation which it is claimed were provoked in  and , on the pretext of certain labour disputes, by political agitations in the trade union movement, as well as the strikes of railway workers that took place in . These strikes, which originally affected the Mexican national railway company (Ferrocarriles Nacionales de Mexico) gave rise to negotiations during which wage increases were proposed by the Ministry of Labour, but were eventually declared unlawful ("" non-existent "") since it had not been proven that they had been voted by the majority required by law. Although Mr. Vallejo, the Secretary-General of the Union, ordered the workers not to return to work, the Ministry of Labour pursued its conciliatory action and was able to settle the dispute and obtain a return to work. Strikes were subsequently declared in other railway companies (Ferrocarril Sudpacifico, Ferrocarril Mexicano and Compaia Terminal de Veracruz) which were also declared unlawful by the authorities since it could not be shown that they had been declared in conformity with the law. In all these cases the workers were ordered to return to work within  hours, which however they did not do because of instructions from their leaders not to return to work until the union's claims had been met. As work continued to be interrupted in the national company, Ferrocarriles Nacionales de Mexico, the police intervened and later, when the strike became general, the army was also called in, many trade union leaders and hundreds of workers being arrested. In the comments of the Supreme Court of Justice on the grounds for its rulings, statements and documentary proof are quoted which, it would appear, show the intervention of "" Communist elements "" in the dispute and the carrying out of political instructions by the leaders of the union.
.Essentially, the Supreme Court of Justice considered that the conclusion reached by the District Judge, which was confirmed by the court of second instance, was in accordance with",0,1963,Mexico
46,"of control of the internal acts of a trade union if those internal acts do not violate legal provisions or rules. Nevertheless, the Committee considers that it is of maximum importance that, in order to guarantee an impartial and objective procedure, control should be exercised by the relevant judicial authority.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the attention of the Government to the importance which it has always attached to the principle that the public authorities should refrain from any intervention that might restrict the freedom of the workers' organisations to elect their representatives in full freedom;(b) to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that if the authorities intervene during the election proceedings of a union, expressing their opinion on the candidates and on the possible consequences of the elections, this constitutes a serious infringement of the principle that trade union organisations have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom;(c) to decide, with regard to the alleged administrative intervention arising out of the election of trade union representatives, to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that, in the event of it proving necessary to exercise any control over the internal acts of a trade union, it is of paramount importance, in order to guarantee an impartial and objective procedure, that such control should be exercised by the competent judicial authority.",0,1963,Honduras
47,".The interim reports submitted by the Committee to the Governing Body in connection with this case are contained in paragraphs  to  of the th Report of the Committee, paragraphs  to  of the rd Report, and paragraphs  to  of the th Report.
.Panama has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and, subsequent to the date of the complaint, the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations still pending refer to a resolution of the Executive of June  interfering with the Confederation of Labour of the Republic of Panama (C.T.R.P.), on which point the Governing Body, upon the recommendation of the Committee, formulated in paragraph  of the th Report (November ), invited the Government to supply detailed observations.
.That request was repeated at each of the following sessions of the Committee which, at its th Session (November ), besides recommending the Governing Body to request the Government once again to send these observations, decided to communicate directly with the C.T.R.P asking for information on the present situation.
.On the last occasion it examined this case, at its meeting held in February , the Committee had before it a communication dated  January , the Government stating that it would do everything in its power to send the observations in question to the I.L.O as soon as possible. The Committee moreover noted that no reply whatsoever had been received to the communication sent to the complainants for the purpose of obtaining additional information. The Committee therefore noted that it had no additional information that would enable it to ascertain, on the one hand, the circumstances and legal grounds invoked for the action affecting the C.T.R.P and which, as the Committee observed at its meeting of November , seemed to constitute an infringement of the provisions of Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or, en the other hand, whether the trade union rights that appeared to have been violated had been fully re-established.
.In those circumstances the Committee recommended the Governing Body, in paragraph  of its th Report, to draw the attention of the Government to the importance it had always attached to the provision contained in the aforesaid Convention No.  according to which workers' organisations shall have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom and to organise their administration, and the public authorities shall refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof; and to reiterate its request to the Government to furnish as a matter of extreme urgency the detailed observations which it had announced its intention of sending.
.That recommendation having been approved by the Governing Body, it was brought to the knowledge of the Government. By a letter dated  March  the Government sent to the I.L.O a copy of the communication from the C.T.R.P dated  January , the original of which had not been received by the Office, and which contained the reply to the request for additional information made by the Committee to the complainant organisation. The Government confined itself to pointing out that this letter from the C.T.R.P made it clear that the complaint covered the period from June  to December .
.In the letter of which the Government supplies a copy, the C.T.R.P reiterates that resolution No.  of  June  constituted a breach of Convention No.  ratified by Panama. According to the letter, from the date of that resolution up to December  the Confederation of Labour of the Republic of Panama had suffered government interference because an official of the Ministry of Labour, Social Welfare and Public Health had been appointed as its President. Moreover, the Government then in power had exceeded its authority by convening the Fourth National Congress of the organisation for the month of December . From that date onwards the C.T.R.P had carried on its activities freely.
.This additional information confirms the Committee's original impression at its meeting of November  that the measure complained of appeared to constitute an infringement of the provisions of Article  of Convention No. . Nevertheless, the same information shows that the measure in question was taken by a former government and that its effects had ceased in December , the complainant organisation having resumed its activities in full freedom after that date.
.Consequently, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to note that the government action affecting the Confederation of Labour of the Republic of Panama in June  ended in December , from which time the Organisation has carried on its activities in full freedom.
.The Committee first examined this case at its th Session (November , see paragraphs  to  of the th Report) and most recently in November , when it submitted to the Governing Body a further interim report, contained in paragraphs  to  of the rd Report. The recommendations contained in the last of those paragraphs are worded as follows:In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to express regret at the fact that, despite the time that has elapsed since approval of the th Report of the Committee by the Governing Body (March ) and of the number of reminders that have been sent, the Government has not supplied the detailed observations which were requested in paragraph  of the said report regarding allegations concerning interference, in , with the Confederation of Labour of the Republic of Panama;(b) to request the Government once more to furnish the said observations, as a matter of urgency;(c) to note that the Committee has decided to request the complaining organisation to furnish further information on the present situation with regard to the matters raised in the complaint;(d) to note that the Committee proposes in any event to submit its conclusions on this case at its next session..These recommendations were approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ) subsequently brought to the attention of the Government by a communication dated  November  followed by a reminder dated  January . In another communication dated  November  the complainant organisation was requested to supply the additional information referred to in subparagraph (c) of paragraph  of the rd Report.
.These recommendations were approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ) subsequently brought to the attention of the Government by a communication dated  November  followed by a reminder dated  January . In another communication dated  November  the complainant organisation was requested to supply the additional information referred to in subparagraph (c) of paragraph  of the rd Report.
.The specific observations which the Government was repeatedly requested to furnish, beginning in November  and on the latest occasion in November , as a matter of urgency, refer to the allegations that the executive power had interfered with the Confederation of Labour of the Republic of Panama through a decision, No.  of  June , removing from office certain members of the executive board of that Confederation. On the basis of the information supplied by the complainants (consisting of cuttings from three newspapers) the Committee considered that the provisions of Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Panama, had been violated, since the Convention provides that workers' organisations have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom and organise their administration and that the public authorities shall refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof. However, the Committee felt that the elements in its possession were not sufficient to enable it to assess the situation, inter alia because the observations made by the Government in its communication of  August  did not contain the specific information that would have been necessary to guide the Committee in considering the case.
.By a communication dated  January  the Government reported that the Minister responsible for such matters "" could not supply the observations requested at the present date but would do everything in his power to send them to the I.L.O as soon as possible "". Up to the present time the Office has not received the observations in question.
.On the other hand, no reply whatsoever has been received to the communication sent to the complainants on  November , although there are no grounds for believing that the communication was not delivered.
.At its present meeting, therefore, the Committee has no additional information that would enable it to ascertain with any certainty the circumstances and legal grounds invoked for the action affecting the Confederation of Labour of the Republic of Panama and which, as the Committee observed at its meeting of November , seems to constitute an infringement of the provisions of Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ). Nor",-1,1963,Panama
48,".This case was last examined by the Committee at its session of November , when it submitted an interim report in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ).
.The Committee observes that the Government insists that it was the SIGINSA union that was unable to organise. The Government points out, however, that this is because the officers abandoned the procedure to obtain recognition of the union and asked the undertaking to terminate their contracts of employment with compensation. The Government also adds that, as regards the discriminatory acts denounced, the authorities were never asked to intervene in order to put an end to such acts.
.The Committee previously indicated that the complainants submitted a list of the persons on whom pressure was exerted to make them change their union membership, some of whom left the undertaking. Although the Government states that the workers who terminated their contracts of employment, with corresponding compensation, did so of their own free will, it is nevertheless rather surprising that those who took this action were, along with other workers, precisely the officers who failed to obtain registration of their union. The Government also states that no complaint was presented either to the Ministry of Labour or to the General Inspectorate of Labour regarding acts of anti-union discrimination. In view of the precise information, including the names of the persons affected, supplied to the Government by means of this complaint, the Committee considers that in order to clarify the facts the Government would have done well to state if these persons had been questioned about the events and, if so, to have sent the results of such an inquiry. With regard to the Government's statement that it has set up a special department entrusted with trade union guidance and promotion, the Committee draws attention to the danger of interference with the freedom of the trade unions entailed by the institution of such agencies unless it is clearly provided that guidance shall not be given unless the trade unions wish to avail themselves of it.
.On the other hand, however, the Committee takes note of the information supplied by the Government to the effect that the persons affected by the discriminatory acts could have filed a complaint with the General Inspectorate of Labour, which would then have advised the employers accordingly and, if necessary, referred the complaint to the judicial authorities. In this respect the Committee observes that section  of the Guatemalan Labour Code provides that employers are forbidden "" to force or attempt to force, by whatever means, workers to leave legal trade unions or groups to which they belong or to become members of others "". The penalties for violation of this provision are laid down in section  of the Code.
.There is no evidence in the information at the Committee's disposal that the workers and trade union leaders concerned asked the administrative or judicial authorities to take the safeguards provided for in the Code; moreover, in its reply, the Government expressly denies that any such intervention was requested. In these circumstances, subject to the reservations made in paragraph , the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.
.The Government forwarded its observations by a communication dated  July .
.According to the allegations of the complainants there was, in the GINSA factory, a rubber workers' union which represented the majority of the workers ( workers in the factory belonged to it) but which, nevertheless, could not obtain its registration by the labour authorities, although they recognised a union sponsored by the employers (SIGINSA). The first union was practically destroyed by the management acting in collusion with the Ministry of Labour and using every form of coercion, including the dismissal of workers who did not wish to join the employer-backed union. Immediately after the recognition by the authorities of this last-mentioned union reprisals were started against the members of the Rubber Workers' Union in the form of mass dismissals, without the authorities taking measures to protect them. On  September  a group of executives of the factory toured the premises urging the workers to sign on with the SIGINSA union, as they had orders to dismiss all those who failed to do so. In the face of this attitude many workers signed against their will, while others elected to resist doing so, whereupon they were dismissed. The General Secretary and the Disputes Secretary of the Rubber Workers' Union in the GINSA factory were forced to leave the factory under the threat that a bomb would be placed in a boiler and they would be accused of having done it. The complainants sent a list of the workers who were dismissed for not wishing to change their union membership, as well as a list of those who changed under pressure in order to keep their jobs.
.In its reply the Government states that the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare suggested to the two unions parties to the dispute (the GINSA Factory Workers' Union, SIGINSA, and the Rubber and Related Workers' Union, SITRACS) conciliation procedures to settle their differences, which were rejected. The Government finally recognised the legal personality of the Rubber and Related Workers' Union (SITRACS) in view of its having fulfilled the legal requirements. At present the majority of workers in this field of economic activity and, in particular, the majority of workers employed by the GINSA factory, are members of SITRACS, so that there is no longer any problem of a trade union character in that undertaking. The Government states that, in accordance with section  (c) of the Labour Code, it may, for reasons of public interest and in order to avoid serious disputes between industrial associations, refuse to authorise a trade union under the conditions laid down in the article; however, in this particular case, the Government did not avail itself of this faculty. Consequently, there have been no acts of discrimination against trade unionists in the GINSA factory, as alleged by the complainants.
.As regards the Government's statement concerning the power conferred upon it by section  (c) of the Labour Code under which the authorities may refuse to authorise and grant legal personality to a union, the Committee notes that the relevant provision lays down that the Ministry of Labour may take such action "" if another association comprising more than three-fourths of the total number of employees in the undertaking has already been legally recognised therein.""
.On previous occasions the Committee has accepted that the law of a country may draw a distinction between the most representative trade union organisations and other trade union organisations, provided that such distinction does not accord to the most representative organisations privileges extending beyond the privilege of priority, on the ground of its having the largest membership, in representation for such purposes as collective bargaining or consultation by governments or for the purpose of nominating delegates to international bodies. In other words if a government wishes to take measures to avoid the harmful effects which could result from a multiplicity of trade unions, respect for the principles of freedom of association requires that such measures do not reach the point of hindering the existence of minority organisations and preventing them from defending the interests of their members before the authorities and the employers, since this would constitute an infringement of the provisions of Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), according to which employers and workers have the right to establish and join organisations "" of their own choosing "".
.The Committee notes that in the present instance the Government did not avail itself of the powers conferred upon it by section  (c) of the Labour Code. In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to take note of the foregoing and to invite the Government to consider the possibility of amending its legislation in order to bring it into line with Convention No. .
.As regards the alleged acts of anti-union discrimination and coercion against workers in the GINSA factory the Committee notes that there appears to be a discrepancy between the information communicated by the complainants and the observations of the Government. The complainants state that such acts occurred against the members of the Rubber Workers' Union in favour of the SIGINSA organisation; that the Rubber Workers' Union had  members and was the majority organisation in the undertaking but that it was destroyed as soon as SIGINSA was recognised as a result of measures taken against its members. The Government on its side states that the Rubber and Related Workers' Union is the majority organisation, that its legal personality has been recognised, and that there is no longer any problem of a trade union character in the GINSA factory.
.As regards the basic problem the Committee notes that the Government has not forwarded its observations on the acts of anti-union discrimination denounced in",0,1963,Guatemala
49,"some detail by the complainants, who submitted, inter alia, a list of the persons who were forced to change their union membership and who are still working in the undertaking and a list of the persons who were dismissed for refusing to change their membership.
.The Committee has always attached the greatest importance to the principle laid down in Article  of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), which has been ratified by Guatemala, that workers shall enjoy adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment; and that such protection shall apply more particularly in respect of acts calculated to make the employment of a worker subject to the condition that he shall not join a union or shall relinquish trade union membership, or to cause the dismissal or otherwise prejudice a worker by reason of union membership or because of participation in union activities.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to request the Government:(a) to be good enough to explain the apparent discrepancy between its statements and those of the complainants with respect to the trade unionists who were implicated in the alleged acts;(b) to furnish observations and comments on the specific acts of anti-union discrimination referred to by the complainants; and(c) to be good enough to indicate the means and legal proceedings to which the workers may have recourse in the event of acts of anti-union discrimination of the kind criticised in the complaint.
.With regard to the case as a whole the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with reference to the detention of trade unionists from the Cerro Redondo Estate, to take note of the information supplied by the Government in its latest communication both as regards the procedure followed in this case and as regards the reinstatement of the workers in their employment without loss of their rights under the Labour Code ;(b) with reference to the criminal attack committed against Mr. Tereso de Jess Oliva, to request the Government to keep it informed as to any further developments in this matter, but to decide that it would be purposeless at the present time to continue its examination of this aspect of the case ;(c) with reference to the acts of discrimination against trade unionists in the GINSA factory, to request the Government to be good enough to forward its observations on this aspect of the case as soon as possible.
.The original complaint by the Latin American Confederation of Christian Trade Unionists (C.L.A.S.C.) is contained in a communication dated  August , supplemented by additional information sent by the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions (C.I.S.C.) in a letter dated  August .
.The Government presented its observations in a communication dated  October .
.The C.L.A.S.C sent further items of information in its communication of  September . The Government has so far not sent its observations on the matter.
.Guatemala has ratified the Freedom of Association and the Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.With regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to decide, with regard to the allegations relating to the detention of the trade unionists from the "" Cerro Redondo "" and "" Vias "" Estates, while taking note of the fact that the trade union leaders and workers who were detained have been released and of the Government's statement that employers will not use a state security law as a cover for certain abuses, to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that the detention by military authorities of trade unionists concerning whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found, is liable to involve restrictions of trade union rights, and to request the Government to consider whether the authorities concerned have instructions for trade union activities;(b) to request the Government to be good enough to furnish details as to the outcome of the proceedings now pending before the courts with a view to elucidating the facts connected with the attack on Mr. Tereso de Jess Oliva, and, in the meantime, to defer its consideration of this aspect of the case;(c) to take note of the present interim report of the Committee, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report on the case to the Governing Body when it has received the other information and observations requested from the Government.",-1,1963,Guatemala
50,".The Committee examined this case previously at its meetings held in November , November  and May , when it submitted to the Governing Body the interim reports contained in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, paragraphs  to  of its th Report and paragraphs  to  of its th Report respectively.,
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), as well as the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.It was alleged that Mr and Mrs. Monegro, General Secretary and Secretary respectively of the National Dominican Confederation of Workers (FOUPSA-CESITRADO), had been compelled to leave the country.
.When it examined the case at its meeting in May , the Committee observed that there was a discrepancy between the statements of the complainants - namely that Mr and Mrs. Monegro were compelled to go into exile - and the observations sent by the Government, according to which they had left the country voluntarily.
.The Committee therefore recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to be good enough to inform it whether Mr and Mrs. Monegro were now in the country and at liberty or free to return there or, if not, to specify the nature of the alleged offences and whether court proceedings had been taken against them.
.This request for information was sent to the Government in a letter dated  June , to which the Government replied by a communication dated  August .
.In this communication the Government states firstly that no legal action has ever been taken against Mr and Mrs. Monegro. It goes on to state that the couple are again living in the country and that Mrs. Monegro has been employed since  March  in the Community Development Office of Santo Domingo.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that no purpose would be served by further examination of this aspect of the case.
.The complainants further alleged that the workers' leaders, Hctor Porfirio Quezada, Julio Anibal Garcia Dickson and Alberto Laracuent, had been murdered in the large sugar producing centre of La Romana.
.As the Government had not answered this allegation, the Committee, at its meeting in May , recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to furnish its observations on this subject.
.In its communication of  August  the Government makes the following statement: "" The disappearance of the workers' leaders, Hctor Porfirio Quezada, Julio Anibal Garcia Dickson and Alberto Laracuent, remains a mystery to the Dominican legal authorities since it occurred in , that is to say during the Trujillo rgime, when the trade union federations which have submitted the complaint did not exist.""
.The Committee notes the Government's statement that its investigations have thrown no light on the fate of the above-mentioned persons. Considering nevertheless that the events to which the allegations in question refer took place too long ago for a continued investigation to serve any useful purpose, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.
.The complainants also alleged that trade union leaders Rodolfo Sessman and Luis Polivio Padilla had been arrested and imprisoned.
.At its meeting in May  the Committee, noting that the Government had not made any observations on this aspect of the case, recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to furnish its observations and, in particular, to specify the position of Rodolfo Sessman and Polivio Padilla with regard to the law.
.In its communication of  August  the Government states that the persons in question are free and that "" they are in no way being persecuted under the rule of law prevailing in the country "". The Government indicates that Mr. Polivio Padilla has been a workers' representative on the State Sugar Council since this organisation was set up in July .
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.
.The complainants alleged lastly, in somewhat vague terms, that a "" yellow "" trade union had been set up by the municipal authorities of the National District and that the Government supported the Dominican Confederation (CONATRAL), the leaders of which were alleged to be the only ones to enjoy any safeguards.
.As the Government did not answer these allegations, the Committee, at its meeting in May , recommended the Governing Body to ask the Government to furnish its observations thereon.
.In its communication of  August  the Government states that the workers of the National District are workers like any others and that it is not true that the municipality operates a "" yellow "" trade union. It also asserts that it is totally untrue that the Government has a preference for any particular trade union.
.The Committee notes that the Government's statements are only countered by the complainants with very general allegations, lacking in specific facts. Consequently, considering that the complainants have not produced proof of their allegations, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide, for the reasons indicated in paragraphs  and , ,  and , and  above, that the case as a whole does not call for further examination.
.The Committee examined this case previously at its meetings held in November  and November , when it submitted to the Governing Body the interim reports contained respectively in paragraphs  to  of its th Report and paragraphs  to  of its th Report. Both reports were approved by the Governing Body.
.By a communication dated  March  the Government supplied additional observations concerning this case.
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its th Report the Committee submitted to the Governing Body its conclusions concerning some of the allegations made. With regard to the examination of the allegations remaining in suspense, while the Committee had taken due account of the fact that a change of Government had occurred in the Dominican Republic in the meantime, it considered that in order to be able to reach valid conclusions on those aspects, it would have to ask the new Government to supply certain additional information which it specified in paragraphs  (c) and (d) of the th Report, subsequently approved by the Governing Body.
.Paragraph  (c) of the th Report invited the Government to answer the allegations to the effect that Mr and Mrs. Monegro had been compelled to leave the country in order to preserve their freedom. According to a complaint dated  January , Mr. Monegro, the General Secretary of the National Dominican Confederation of Workers (FOUPSA-CESITRADO), had been transferred by the police after several days to the Embassy of Mexico under a safe conduct order from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in order to seek asylum but under orders to leave the country. Mrs. Monegro, Secretary of the Confederation, was also called upon to leave the country and was listed as a person to be refused re-entry to the country.
.In paragraph  (d) of the th Report the Government was requested to send its observations concerning various other allegations among those on which no observations had been received from the previous Government.
.In its communication of  March  the Government stated that, as regards the complaint concerning Mr and Mrs. Monegro, it had been ascertained that the circumstances complained of were in no way connected with trade union activities but with the fact that these persons had committed acts contrary to public order which constituted common law offences punishable under the Penal Code, and that they had evidently sought diplomatic asylum in order to escape possible legal proceedings. The fact that the diplomatic asylum sought did not receive official approval in due and proper form, for example by the granting of a safe conduct, showed the unlawful and unmotivated nature of the actions committed by Mr and Mrs. Monegro.
.The Government deplored the fact that events which took place during a period of subversion resulting in a state of civil war and anarchy, under circumstances in which it was utterly impossible to continue to ensure individual rights and safeguards, should have given rise to the complaints in question. The situation in which the Dominican Republic found itself during that period was grave enough to be known all over the world, and the Government hoped that the Committee on Freedom of Association would take this into account in considering the explanations it was submitting.
.In earlier cases the Committee has taken the view, when it has had before it allegations relating to violations of trade union rights by an earlier Government, that although the Government in power could obviously not be held responsible for events which took place under its predecessor, it",-1,1963,Dominican Republic
51,".The Committee has already examined this case at its th Session in February . On that occasion the Committee presented to the Governing Body an interim report containing its final conclusions on the majority of the allegations relating to the case, recommending it at the same time to request the Government to supply additional information on other allegations. These conclusions and recommendations, which are contained in paragraphs  to  of the th Report of the Committee, were adopted by the Governing Body at its th Session (Geneva, June-July ).
.The following paragraphs deal only with the allegations which remained in abeyance and which refer to violations of trade union rights committed when a demonstration by strikers at Puerto Boyac was broken up, one worker being killed and others injured.
.Colombia has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its complaint dated  October  the World Federation of Trade Unions maintained that on  August of that year a meeting of strikers at Puerto Boyac was attacked by forces of repression, one worker being killed and others wounded. In its reply the Government stated that the meeting had taken place in spite of the prohibition on the holding of public demonstrations, that the demonstrators had attacked the forces of law and order and that with a view to ascertaining responsibility an inquiry had been opened under a criminal investigating magistrate and the Military Judge Advocate's Office.
.Examining the case at its February  session the Committee observed that in similar cases in which it had been alleged that people had been killed when the police opened fire on strikers the Committee had pointed out that, in cases in which the dispersal of public assemblies, etc., by the police on grounds of public order or similar grounds had involved loss of life, it attached special importance to the circumstances being fully investigated by an immediate and independent special inquiry and to the regular legal procedure being followed to determine the justification and responsibility for the action taken by the police. The Committee noted that in the present case the Government had denied that the forces of law and order were responsible for the alleged occurrence. In view of the fact that the Government had stated that the necessary judicial inquiries had been started, the Committee recommended the Governing Body to ask the Government to be good enough to inform it of the result of these inquiries.
.At its sessions in November  and February, May and November  the Committee postponed examination of the case as it was awaiting the information requested from the Government.
.By a communication dated  January  the Government furnished the text of the verdict at the hearing of second instance delivered by the Military High Court on  September  in the case opened in order to investigate the occurrence and determine responsibilities.
.In the part relating to the grounds of the Military High Court's verdict it is stated that the investigation of the facts was originally entrusted to a municipal police inspector of Puerto Boyac but was taken over "" successively "" by a criminal examining magistrate and two military penal examining magistrates.
.The text of the document sent by the Government gives a summary of the conclusions of the inquiry and extracts from the statements of many people who were present at or took part in the incident. In brief, the facts as they emerge from these conclusions originated in a strike declared by the workers of the Texas Company. The activities of the strikers had given rise to fears of breaches of the peace, to avoid which the Military Governor of Puerto Boyac issued Decree No.  of  August , which ruled that as from that date and until further notice permission to organise demonstrations of any nature whatsoever within the town limits was entirely suspended. Notwithstanding the prohibition, on  August a meeting, organised by Mr Italo Daza, a member of the Chamber of Representatives, was held in the main square of the town. On being informed of this occurrence, the Governor sought the collaboration and help of the military patrols which had been detached to deal with disturbances or difficult situations. When an army captain personally requested Mr. Daza to stop the speech which he had begun, the latter replied that nobody was going to get him down from where he was. The participants in the demonstration protested and one of them, Mr. Adondi Avila, went so far as to seize and strike the captain. In view of the threatening attitude of the demonstrators another officer and a patrol, under the command of a lance-corporal, intervened, the officer overpowering and arresting Mr. Avila and the patrol attempting to disperse the demonstrators. At this point, it was alleged, the officers left, taking Mr. Avila with them, and were stoned by the demonstrators as they went. Mr. Avila himself confirmed in his statements that the vehicle in which he was taken away was hit by objects which he could not identify. According to the statements of several of its members, the patrol attempted to disperse the demonstrators, first by verbal orders, then with their rifle butts, and then by throwing tear-gas grenades, which were tossed back by the demonstrators before exploding. Then a number of shots, apparently , were fired by the patrol. According to the members of the patrol, these shots were fired in the air with the object of intimidating the demonstrators. The evidence showed that Mr. Martiniano Romero was killed, Mr. Siervo Galeano wounded and Mr. Carlos Trejos suffered contusions.
.On the basis of the investigation, the Military High Court concluded, among other points, that the patrol had acted in accordance with its instructions and the orders governing the conduct of troops sent to maintain public order, in first giving verbal warnings, then using their rifle butts, then throwing tear-gas grenades and finally shooting. With regard to the rifle shots, the Court deduced that they were not fired directly at the demonstrators, because in that case the victims would have been much more numerous and that "" owing to circumstances which it is impossible to ascertain, one or two of the shots fired might have been deflected "" as a result of the pressure and contact which the demonstrators were exerting on the members of the patrol. The Court concluded that the soldiers had legitimately made use of their firearms and that their action was justified, and it confirmed the judgment of non-suit, though it applied this to the preliminary proceedings as a ruling on their probatory value and not as a verdict on the members of the patrol, as these had not been indicted in the proceedings.
.The Committee notes that the inquiry, which was first entrusted to the ordinary police and judicial authorities, was concluded by the military penal authorities, through hearings of first and second instance.
.The Committee has always applied the principle that allegations relating to the exercise of the right to strike are within its competence, in so far but only in so far as they affect the exercise of trade union rights, and on many occasions has recommended the Governing Body to affirm that the right to strike of workers and workers' organisations constitutes an essential means of promoting and defending their occupational interests. The Committee, however, has rejected allegations relating to strikes by reason of their non-occupational character, or where they have been designed to coerce a government with respect to a political matter, or have been directed against the government's policy and not ""in furtherance of a trade dispute "".s On the other hand, in many cases laid before its, the Committee has emphasised that freedom of meeting is an essential element in trade union rights. In Case No.  (Netherlands), however, the Committee affirmed that, although the right of holding trade union meetings is a basic requisite of the free exercise of trade union rights, the organisations concerned must observe the general provisions relating to public meetings, which are applicable to all.
.The Committee notes the Government's statement that, in the present case, the prohibition on demonstrations constituted a local measure based on grounds of public order and did not relate only to the meeting of members of the trade union which was on strike, and that the meeting to which the complaint relates was not held on trade union premises but in a public square, in spite of that prohibition. Further, it appears to have been called by a Member of Parliament, whose connection with the trade union is not explained.
.In these circumstances, with regard to the allegations the examination of which had remained in abeyance in this case, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to take note that, in regard to the incidents during which a worker was killed, another was wounded and a third suffered contusions, these happened on the occasion of a public",-1,1963,Colombia
52,".The Committee examined this case earlier at its sessions of February , May  and February  s, when it submitted to the Governing Body certain recommendations concerning a first series of allegations and provisional conclusions concerning new allegations presented in  by the National Federation of School Teachers (FENAMA). Concerning the allegations pending, the Committee requested the Government and the complainant organisation to furnish certain additional information, the nature of which is indicated in paragraphs  and  of the th Report approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (March ).
.By a communication dated  May  the Government replied to this request for additional information.
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.Up to the present no reply has been received from the complainant organisation to the request for additional information made in a letter dated  March  and repeated in another letter dated  June .
.As for the allegations pending (see paragraph  above), the Committee notes that the Government has repeatedly and formally denied what was maintained by the complainants, although it admitted that perhaps the Secretary of State for Education might not have received the representatives of FENAMA on the occasion referred to in the complaint but that if this had been the case it was only due to lack of time.
.On the other hand, the information received from the Government shows that FENAMA omitted to deposit its Constitution and another document, the existence of which should not be difficult to prove since it is the text of a government resolution adopted by decree. In this case the Government recognises that the resolution has been taken. As for the Constitution, its simple transmission appears to be a requirement of form, frequently imposed in such cases, which in itself would not give rise to a problem of freedom of association unless it were proved that the transmission of the Constitution was subject to a condition, the nature of which was such as to impair the exercise of trade union rights. This would be the case, for instance, if the contents of the Constitution were subject to the discretionary approval of the authorities. In fact, Article  of Convention No. , which has been ratified by the Dominican Republic, lays down that workers' organisations have the right to draft their Constitutions and rules and that public authorities shall refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof. The Committee, as also the ILO Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, has pointed out in this respect that this right appears, unfortunately, to be considerably restricted in certain countries where, it would appear, Constitutions have to be submitted for prior approval to the authorities, whose power of decision does not seem to be restricted by any particular standard. It should be pointed out that in spite of the declaration of the Government, according to which approval of the Constitution is not a condition for obtaining or retaining legal personality, section  of Act No.  contains a provision on the approval by the Executive of any change in the Constitution.
.The Committee lacks the information which would enable it to judge whether or not this implies that at some stage in the creation of associations such as FENAMA the Constitution itself has to be approved. However, in the present case, the statements of the Government show that the formality omitted consisted in the simple transmission of the Constitution.
.The complainant organisation has failed to supply the Committee with information that might lead to the view that FENAMA's lack of legal personality is attributable to some restriction of freedom of association.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body, subject to the principles and considerations set out in paragraphs  and  above, to decide that the allegations pending in this case and consequently the case itself do not call for further examination.
.The Committee previously examined this case at its sessions in February  and May . On the latter occasion it submitted to the Governing Body a new interim report, contained in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, which was approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session (May-June ).
.In the report referred to, the Committee made certain recommendations on a first series of allegations, but postponed reaching conclusions on other allegations made in  by the National Federation of Schoolteachers (FENAMA) while awaiting more detailed observations from the Government.
.The Government replied in a letter dated  October , which was received too late for the Committee to examine it at its session in November .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee also requests the complainant organisation to furnish additional information on its Constitution, affiliated organisations, number of members and any other information which it considers relevant concerning its present situation.
.In these circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) in respect of the general question of the right of workers in the service of the State to organise, to draw the attention of the Government to the considerations set out in paragraphs  and  above;(b) in respect of the specific allegations made in this case, to note that the Committee has decided to request the Government and the complainants to provide certain additional information specified in paragraphs  and  above, respectively;(c) to take note of this interim report, on the understanding that the Committee will submit a new report when it has received the additional information mentioned in the preceding subparagraph.
.When the Committee last examined this case at its February  session it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body in paragraphs  to  of its nd Report, which was approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session (May-June ).
.In a communication dated  January  the National Federation of Schoolteachers (FENAMA) made fresh allegations relating to the case. The text of this communication was transmitted to the Government by a letter dated  March .
.The Government has forwarded certain observations by a communication received on  April .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In order to be able to make its conclusions in full knowledge of all the facts, the Committee considers that the Government should be given a further opportunity to supply more detailed observations on these allegations.
.In these circumstances, with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the allegations made in  concerning the dismissal of  union leaders as a measure of reprisal against the National Federation of Schoolteachers:(i) to express its disappointment at the fact that, notwithstanding the repeated requests made in this connection, the Government has failed to supply detailed observations on this point;(ii) to emphasise once again the importance it attaches to the standard in Article  of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), ratified by the Dominican Republic, to the effect that workers shall enjoy adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment;(b) with regard to the allegations made in  concerning new measures of interference and discrimination against the National Federation of Schoolteachers, to request the Government to be good enough to supply detailed observations in respect of the allegations referred to in paragraphs  to  above;(c) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will report again when it has received the detailed observations referred to in clause (b) of this paragraph.
.The original complaint made by the National Federation of Schoolteachers (FENAMA) appears in a telegram dated  July  to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights (New York), which was forwarded to the I.L.O. When the complainants were informed of their right to send additional information in support of their complaint they furnished a note contained in a memorandum dated  August .
.These communications were forwarded to the Government of the Dominican Republic, which replied in a note couched in general terms; this note was remitted to the Secretary-General of the United Nations on  September  by the Permanent Representative of the Dominican Republic to that organisation. The note was then forwarded to the I.L.O. At its th Session (November ) the Committee on Freedom of Association decided to adjourn its examination of the case to its next meeting, and requested the Government to be good enough to forward directly to the I.L.O its detailed observations on the specific allegations. In a communication dated  December  the Government",-1,1963,Dominican Republic
53,"forwarded its reply concerning those allegations directly to the I.L.O, and the Committee proceeded to an initial examination of the case at its th Session (February ). On  January and  February  the Government transmitted further communications.
.The Dominican Republic has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their memorandum the complainants assert that the Government had openly given support to a parallel trade union organisation, and had been present at the installation ceremony of the Executive Committee of that organisation, but had not granted FENAMA the interviews it had requested although FENAMA is a majority organisation with  affiliated organisations. FENAMA then appealed by letter to the President of the Republic and explained the situation in which the teaching profession found itself and also submitted a number of claims. The only reply the President gave was to appear on television making statements discreditable to FENAMA. According to the complainants the Government issued an order for the discharge of several teachers and the headmaster of a secondary school, contrary to the guarantees of security of employment granted to the teaching profession by the National Constitution, the Education Law and the Ordinance of the National Council of Education. The President's reply to FENAMA's claims was merely to accuse FENAMA of political activity without making any reference whatsoever to its complaints, in which it protested about political pressure exercised on teachers by provincial governments and the party authorities. The aim of the Government had been that of replacing the schoolmasters by persons loyal to the Dominican Revolutionary Party. Attached to the complaint of the complainants is a resolution adopted by a trade union requesting that this political interference in the teaching profession should cease, together with excerpts from the National Constitution, the Education Law and a circular issued by the Secretariat of State for Education, Fine Arts and Worship, which states that before a person is appointed as a teacher the responsible provincial government should be consulted. Finally the letter containing the memorandum states that as a measure of reprisal  FENAMA leaders were dismissed from their posts.
.The note from the Permanent Representative of the Dominican Republic to the United Nations merely points out that the Government was acting in accordance with Constitutional precepts when it carried out sanctions against  national schoolmasters for having organised an illegal strike largely for political reasons. In the Government's reply dated  December , it is stated in general terms that a satisfactory solution has been found to the problems which gave rise to the complaints made by FENAMA, that both Dominican schools and teachers are given the proper attention which their merits call for, and that consequently there is no reason to continue the dispute.
.To sum up, the complainants assert that for political reasons the services of several members of the teaching profession were terminated in order to substitute for them adherents of a particular party, that the Government openly gave support to a rival trade union organisation and discredited the complaining organisation, and that furthermore reprisals were taken against  leaders of that union who were dismissed from their posts.
.The Committee considered at its th Session that the charges concerning dismissal of teaching staff for political reasons, and interference by the party authorities in the teaching world contrary to the security of employment of schoolteachers guaranteed by national legislation, constituted a problem which was not within its province. This was not the case, however, as regards the allegations concerning dismissal of FENAMA leaders as a measure of reprisal and the allegations according to which the Government has favoured a particular trade union organisation while discrediting the complaining organisation, whose petitions it neither answers nor heeds.
.Indeed, the Committee has always upheld the principle that workers should enjoy adequate protection against all acts of discrimination tending to impair trade union freedom in respect of their employment, as laid down in Article  of Convention No. . The reply of the Government in regard to the allegation that  leaders of FENAMA were dismissed from their posts is somewhat vague. The note from the Permanent Representative of the Dominican Republic to the United Nations refers to sanctions taken against  schoolteachers because of a political strike. The Government's note dated  December  merely indicates in general terms that all problems relating to the teaching profession have been solved. The Committee considered consequently that the information forwarded by the Government was not sufficiently precise to enable it to reach a conclusion on this case, and requested certain additional information.
.As regards the alleged interference by the Government in the sense of favouring the other rival trade union organisation and discrediting FENAMA, and of not hearing its complaints, the Government had not forwarded any observations. In view of the importance the Committee attaches to the principle embodied in Article  of Convention No. , ratified by the Dominican Republic, a principle which states that "" Workers' and employers' organisations shall have the right ... to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes "" and that "" The public authorities shall refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof "", the Committee requested the Government to be good enough to furnish more detailed information on this aspect of the case.
.By a communication transmitted to the I.L.O on  January  the Government referred to this matter, but confined itself to stating very tersely that in the opinion of the Secretariat of State for Education and Fine Arts there had been no violation of trade union rights as far as FENAMA was concerned. In its note dated  February  the Government states that it "" maintains normal relations with FENAMA and that nothing impedes or interferes with the carrying out of the programmes of that Federation "".",-1,1963,Dominican Republic
54,"in , is "" the economic and social advancement of the workers "";(iii) to the importance it attaches to the opinion expressed by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations that, although the founders of an organisation are not freed from the duty of observing formalities as to publicity or other similar formalities which may be prescribed by legislation, these formalities must not be such as to be equivalent in practice to previous authorisation, and that, when registration confers on the organisations the basic rights that they need in furthering and defending the interests of their members, the fact that registration can be refused at the discretion of the authorities leads to a situation that is not very different from that in cases in which previous authorisation is required;(iv) to the importance that must be attached to the provisions of Articles  and  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), provisions that are infringed by section  of Presidential Decree No.  as amended by Presidential Decree No. , which requires a minimum number of trade unions or federations for the establishment of organisations of higher degree and prevents the establishment of federations and Confederations bringing together the trade unions or federations of different activities in a specific locality or area;(v) to the importance that it attaches to the opinion expressed by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, when examining a provision similar to that of section  of Presidential Decree No. , which provides that a trade union can exist only if it organises more than  per cent of the workers concerned, namely that such a provision is not in conformity with Article  of Convention No. , places a major obstacle in the way of the establishment of trade unions and has the indirect result of prohibiting the establishment of a new trade union whenever a trade union already exists in the undertaking or establishment concerned;(vi) to the desirability of studying any reforms that may be necessary to bring Peruvian legislation, as soon as possible, into harmony with the principles and considerations set forth in clauses (i) to (v) above;(d) in respect of the allegations relating to the minimum number of  members required for the establishment of a trade union, to request the Government to state whether workers in work centres with fewer than  members can unite with those of other work centres to form a trade union and, if so, subject to what conditions;(e) in respect of the allegation of the complainants that under section  of Presidential Decree No.  trade union officers are denied by law the power of conferring a mandate on third parties to carry out business on behalf of the trade union, to request the Government to send its observations as soon as possible;(f) in respect of the dismissals of trade union officers alleged by the complainants, which are mentioned in paragraph  above, to request the Government to send its observations as soon as possible;(g) to take note of this interim report, on the understanding that the Committee will submit a further report when it has received from the Government the observations and information referred to in subparagraphs (d), (e) and (f) of this paragraph.
.The complaints of the Peruvian Workers' Confederation (C.T.P.) are contained in a communication dated  May , in another dated  May , forwarded by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, and in a third dated  June . These were communicated to the Government for its observations, and the Government's reply was transmitted to the I.L.O on  January .
.Peru has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communications of  and  May  the complainants declare that they reject a draft legislative decree which would infringe freedom of association. According to the text of this draft decree, which is attached to the complaints, it is proposed to amend various sections of the Penal Code. This draft aims at establishing so-called offences against freedom to work, and lays down penalties applicable to persons who resort to violence in order to compel another person to take part in a strike or prevent him from entering his workplace; it also lays down penalties for state employees or officials who collectively cease their functions.
.In their communication dated  June  the complainants transmit the text of Presidential Decree No.  of  May , making rules for the formation of trade union organisations in the country. C.T.P was of the opinion that many of the provisions of this decree violated Convention No. , among them the following: section  stipulated that no one might be compelled to belong to or not belong to a trade union; section  prohibited trade unions from devoting themselves as constituted bodies to political matters; section  required a minimum of  members for the formation of a trade union, which would prevent the formation of organisations in many small establishments; sections  to  made the registration of trade unions compulsory; section  required a minimum of five trade unions for the formation of a federation and a minimum of ten federations for the formation of a Confederation. Nor had the decree taken into account the formation of horizontal-type organisations which grouped trade unions of different branches or industries, and which already existed in the country under the name of "" associations "". Finally, state employees and workers were denied the right to organise.
.In its reply of  January  the Government states that these complaints refer to the same period and events that were dealt with in Case No.  concerning a complaint presented by the World Federation of Trade Unions (W.F.T.U) against the Government of Peru. That case was examined in the th Report of the Committee on Freedom of Association, paragraphs  to , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (May-June ), and in the th Report, paragraphs  to , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (June-July ). Consequently, the Government considers that on the basis of the considerations expressed when that case was dealt with, the Committee should reject C.T.P's complaint.
.The Committee observes that the complaints of W.F.T.U, which were examined in its th and th Reports when dealing with Case No. , referred to the occupation by the Government (at the time the Military Junta) of trade union headquarters and to the detention of trade union leaders. At no time in that case was there any mention of the draft decree amending the Penal Code or of Presidential Decree No.  concerning trade union organisations. In other words the events mentioned in the present complaint from C.T.P are quite distinct from those listed by W.F.T.U and examined by the Committee in Case No. .
.As to the period itself in which the events alleged by C.T.P took place, at the time when it examined the complaints from W.F.T.U (concerning events which took place during the period before the present Government came to power), the Committee pointed out that in other cases it had taken the view that there is a degree of continuity between successor governments of the same State, and that while the government in power cannot be held responsible for events which took place under its predecessor, it clearly is responsible for any continuing consequences which they may have had since its accession to power.
.Accordingly the Committee recommends the Governing Body to request the Government to be good enough to furnish its observations on the specific complaints of the Peruvian Workers' Confederation, namely those referred to in paragraphs  and  above, and in the meantime to postpone further examination of this case.",1,1963,Peru
55,".The Committee examined this case at its meetings in February , November  and May , when it submitted to the Governing Body interim reports that were approved by the Governing Body at its nd, rd and th Sessions respectively (May-June , November  and May ).
.One aspect of the case remained in suspense, concerning which the Government had been asked in paragraph  (c) of the th Report to supply certain additional information. The Government answered that request by a communication dated  July .
.Peru has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.It appears from the information provided by the Government in its communication dated  July  that section  (b) of Presidential Decree No.  guarantees, albeit indirectly, the right to organise of workers employed at workplaces with five workers or less. In view of the Government's previous statement, quoted in paragraph  above, it is natural to assume that the same interpretation can be placed on the situation of workplaces with more than five but less than  workers.
.The Committee wishes to stress that its request to the Government for information on the position of workers at establishments with less than  workers was motivated by the fact that section  of Presidential Decree No.  (see paragraph  above) appears to place restrictions on the right to organise to the detriment of workers in small establishments. Obviously, any distinction of that nature would have been incompatible with the provisions of the aforesaid Article  of Convention No.  and those of Article  of the same Convention, by virtue of which the acquisition of legal personality of workers' and employers' organisations shall not be made subject to conditions of such a character as to restrict the application of Article .
.What the Government states in reply to the Committee's request seems to dissipate the doubts in this connection but, in view of what is said in paragraph  above and the importance which should be attached to the provisions of Articles  and  of the Convention, the Committee feels it necessary to recommend the Governing Body to point out to the Government the advisability of considering what amendments may be necessary to bring the national legislation unequivocally into harmony with the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), which has been ratified by Peru.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to take note of the statements made by the Government in its communications dated  January and  July , from which it appears that workers in establishments with less than  employees may by virtue of section  (b) of Presidential Decree No.  join with those of other establishments to form a trade union or may join an existing trade union, provided that they belong to the same branch of activity;(b) to suggest to the Government, in view of the considerations set forth in paragraphs  and  above, that it would be desirable to consider what amendments might be made in the national legislation to bring it unequivocally into harmony with the provisions of Articles  and  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. );(c) to request the Government to inform the Governing Body of the measures it is taking or considers taking in accordance with subparagraph (b) above.
.The committee examined this case most recently at its meeting in November  when it submitted to the Governing Body an interim report that appears in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, as approved by the Governing Body at its rd Session (November ). The present report refers solely to the three series of allegations examination of which had been postponed, the Government having been requested to supply certain additional information in this connection, as mentioned in paragraph  of the th Report.
.Peru has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.With regard to the case as a whole the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) in respect of the allegation relating to the personal quality of trade union office, while reaffirming the importance which it attaches to the principle enunciated in Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), that trade union organisations shall have the right to organise their administration and activities, to decide, in view of the complainants' failure to submit sufficient evidence in support of their complaint, that this aspect of the case calls for no further examination;(b) in respect of the allegations relating to dismissal of trade union officers, to decide, for the reasons stated in paragraphs  to  above, and while reaffirming the importance that should be attached to the principle enunciated in Article , paragraph  (b), of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), according to which protection of workers against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment shall apply particularly in respect of acts calculated to cause the dismissal of a worker by reason of union membership or because of participation in union activities, that no useful purpose would be served by continuing examination of this aspect of the case;(c) with regard to the requirements for formation of a trade union, to request the Government to inform it whether workers at establishments employing five or less persons may join with those of other establishments in order to form a trade union or may join an existing trade union and, if so, subject to what conditions;(d) to take note of the present interim report, on the understanding that the Committee will submit a further report when it has received the information to be requested in accordance with subparagraph (c) of this paragraph.
.The Committee examined this case previously at its th Session (February ) and submitted an interim report that appears in paragraphs  to  of its nd Report, which was approved by the Governing Body at its st Session (March ).
.The complainants of the Peruvian Workers' Confederation (C.T.P.) are contained in a communication dated  May , in another dated  May , forwarded by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, and in a third dated  June . At each of its sessions in November , February , June  and November  the Committee decided to postpone consideration of this case, since it was awaiting the observations of the Government, which were finally received with a communication dated  January . When it examined the case at its February  Session the Committee observed that the Government in its reply did not mention the specific complaints of C.T.P but referred to the observations that had been made on an earlier case concerning different facts. The Committee in paragraph  of its nd Report therefore recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to furnish its observations on the specific complaints.
.The Government sent these observations with a communication dated  September .
.Peru has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.With regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) in respect of the allegations relating to a legislative draft to amend the Penal Code, to take note of the Government's statement to the effect that there is no longer any intention of promulgating this draft and to decide that there would be no object in examining this aspect of the case further;(b) in respect of the allegation relating to the right not to join a trade union (section  of Presidential Decree No. ), to decide, for the reasons given in paragraph  above, that there would be no object in examining this aspect of the case further;(c) in respect of specific allegations relating to other provisions of Presidential Decree No. , to draw the attention of the Government:(i) to the importance of ensuring that persons employed in the service of the State should be guaranteed the right to establish trade unions, a principle that derives from Convention No. , which has been ratified by Peru, and under Article  of which workers, without distinction whatsoever, shall have the right to establish organisations of their own choosing without previous authorisation;(ii) to the importance it attaches to the principle that it is not appropriate to prohibit all political activities by occupational organisations in general terms, but that the judicial authorities should be entrusted with the task of pronouncing on abuses that might be committed by organisations that had lost sight of the fact that their fundamental objective, according to the resolution concerning the independence of the trade union movement adopted by the Conference",1,1963,Peru
56,"is clearly responsible for any continuing consequences which they may have had since its accession to power.
.In the present case the Committee notes what the Government says concerning the situation obtaining in the country at the time the complaints were presented, which was some time ago; while it recognises that some or all of the allegations whose examination is still pending may in the meantime have become out of date, it feels bound to repeat the request previously made by the Governing Body to the Government for detailed observations and all the information the Government considers relevant, so as to enable the Committee to determine whether the allegations still in suspense are founded in fact or not.
.As regards the allegations concerning Mr and Mrs. Monegro, the Committee notes that there is a discrepancy between the statements of the complainants-namely that these persons were compelled to go into exile-and the observations sent by the Government, according to which Mr and Mrs. Monegro left the country voluntarily. However, the Committee wishes, in order to complete the information available to it on this aspect of the case, to ask the Government to inform it as soon as possible whether Mr and Mrs. Monegro are now in the country and at liberty, or whether they are free to return to the country and, if not, what are the offences with which they are charged and whether court proceedings have been taken against them.
.As regards the other allegations concerning which no answer was ever received from the Government, the Committee would be grateful if the Government would send as soon as possible its observations and detailed information concerning: () the alleged murder of three trade union leaders, Hctor Porfirio Quezada, Julio Anibal Garcia Dickson and Alberto Laracuent, with the outcome of any legal action undertaken to elucidate the facts; () the present position before the law of the trade union leaders Rodolfo Sessman and Luis Polivio Padilla; and () the alleged establishment of a "" yellow "" trade union by the municipal authorities of the National District and alleged discrimination against all trade union organisations other than the Dominican Confederation, CONATRAL, whose leaders are alleged to be the only ones to enjoy any safeguards.
.In these circumstances, with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the allegations concerning the exile of Mr and Mrs. Monegro, to request the Government to be good enough to furnish as soon as possible the additional information requested in paragraph  above;(b) as regards the other allegations remaining in suspense, to request the Government once again to furnish as soon as possible the observations and detailed information requested in paragraph  above;(c) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will report further to the Governing Body after receiving the additional observations and information requested from the Government in subparagraphs (a) and (b) above.
.With regard to the case as a whole the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to decide, for the reasons set forth in paragraphs  and  above, that the allegations relating to the arrest of the trade union leader Henry Molina and the raiding and closure of the premises of the National Dominican Confederation of Workers (FOUPSA-CESITRADO) do not call for further examination;(b) to decide, with regard to the allegations concerning the murder of the trade union leader Benito Acevedo, to take note of the information furnished by the Government and at the same time to express its regret that the investigation has not led to a concrete result;(c) to request the Government to be good enough to reply to the allegation that the two trade union leaders Mr and Mrs. Monegro have been obliged to go into exile in order to preserve their freedom;(d) with regard to the other allegations set forth in paragraph  above, to request the Government to be good enough to furnish its observations as soon as possible;(e) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will report further to the Governing Body when it has received the additional information requested in subparagraphs (c) and (d) above.

Two complaints were sent by the National Dominican Confederation of Workers (FOUPSA-CESITRADO), one by its General Secretary (in exile) dated  January  and the other by its President dated  March . The C.A.S.C sent a new communication on  April . All these communications were transmitted to the Government, whose observations dated  June  have been received.
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.As regards the case as a whole the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to take note that Mr. Miguel Soto is no longer in prison, to draw the attention of the Government to the restriction of the exercise of trade union rights that may arise from the preventive detention of leaders concerning whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found, and to request the Government to take steps to ensure that authorities have appropriate instructions in order to eliminate this danger;(b) to call the attention of the Government to the importance that the Committee attaches to the guarantee of due legal process when trade unionists are accused of offences of a political nature or of common law crimes, and to the fact that the granting of his freedom to a trade unionist on condition that he leaves the country is not compatible with the free exercise of trade union rights; and to request the Government as soon as possible to send its observations on the position of Mr. Henry Molina in view of the urgent nature of this part of the case, and also on the legal position of Mr and Mrs. Monegro and the possibilities they have of returning legally to the country;(c) to reaffirm the principles set forth in paragraph  above and to request the Government to furnish its observations on the allegations concerning the raiding and closure of the premises of the National Dominican Confederation of Workers (FOUPSA-CESITRADO) and in particular on the present de facto and de jure position of that organisation;(d) to request the Government, in view of the lack of direct information from it concerning the other allegations referred to in paragraph  above, which relate to matters considered as urgent under the procedure in force, to furnish its observations thereon as speedily as possible, and, in particular, in respect of the alleged murder or detention of the trade union leaders named;(e) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will report further to the Governing Body when it has received the additional information requested.",0,1963,Dominican Republic
57,".The original complaint was submitted on  July  by the Standard Fruit Company Workers' Union (SITRASFRUCO). A copy of the complaint was forwarded to the Government of Honduras, by letter dated  July , for its observations. These were forwarded on  September .
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the complaint the interference of the public authorities in the internal affairs of the Union is denounced. It is stated in this connection that during the Eighth Congress of SITRASFRUCO on  May  the President of the Honduran Republic sent a telegram to the Department Political Governor which read as follows:I have been informed that in the Eighth Ordinary Congress of the Workers of the Standard Fruit Company there are marked anti-democratic tendencies to obtain the inclusion in the Executive of the Union of elements of noted Marxist affiliation, some of whom have recently travelled in communist Cuba. Since the Constitution of the Republic prohibits all activity contrary to the democratic spirit of the Honduran Republic, please inform the most responsible leaders of the labour movement in this sector of employment that any infiltration of Marxist elements in the ranks of the Executive members will be considered as a practice harmful to the trade union movement, to worker/employer relations and to relationships between the Government and the workers' trade union organisations. Please get in touch with the trade union leaders of democratic views and inform me concerning the success of these steps designed to reinforce the democratic conquests achieved during the era of the Second Republic.Affectionately yours,(Signed) Ramn VILLEDA MORALES,President of the Republic.
.The complainants consider that this is a case of interference in trade union activities in contravention of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants also state that, ever since the change in the Executive Committee of the Union was registered with the Directorate-General of Labour, the authorities have declared that registration to be suspended without allowing the right to uphold legally the effects of the registration.
.In its reply the Government states that the presidential message does not imply any violation of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ). In fact under the National Constitution workers and employers may associate freely for the exclusive purposes of their economic and social activity. It appears that certain leaders of SITRASFRUCO engage in Marxist activities, which are prohibited by the National Constitution. Also under the Labour Code trade unions are not permitted to engage in party activities. In the above-mentioned message the workers were merely reminded that the trade union organisations guaranteed by Honduran legislation are inimical to communist trade union associations. In no case was there any question of limiting the right of election of trade union representatives.
.The Government also contests the allegation that in suspending the effect of the registration of the new Executive Committee Convention No.  was violated. The Government transmits in this connection the documents drawn up by the administrative authorities with regard to the facts related, as well as a copy of the award made on this matter by the Supreme Court of Justice. According to these documents, on  June , Mr. Hctor Costa Romero informed the Directorate-General of Labour of the change in the Executive Committee of which he was President. The Directorate-General confirmed that from the formal point of view the change in the Executive Committee had been accomplished legally. A few days later it was reported by the Directorate-General that irregularities had taken place in the election of that committee and the registration of another Executive Committee elected by dissident members of the Congress was requested. What happened was that, when the time came for the election of the new Executive Committee during the Eighth Congress of SITRASFRUCO, some dissident delegates abandoned the meeting and decided to elect their own Executive Committee. This occurred in the night of  May- June . In view of these facts and faced with the existence of two Executive Committees, the Directorate-General of Labour decided that the election of the trade union representatives would be temporarily without effect until the appropriate investigation had been made and until the defects of the action taken during the Congress had been rectified. The present complainants did not make an appeal against this decision of the Directorate-General.
.Subsequently another impeachment of the legality of the election of the Executive Committee with Mr. Costa Romero as President was made. According to this a series of irregularities went on during the Congress until finally a group of from  to  delegates to the Congress withdrew and those who remained decided to give a vote of confidence to the present Executive Committee of the union. In accordance with the position thus described, Mr. Costa Romero informed the Directorate-General of Labour of the appointment of a new Executive Committee. In reality, according to the rules, the election should proceed by secret ballot, nominal or otherwise, and be carried out by the Council of Delegates. For his part, Mr. Costa Romero contested the terms of the impeachment, rejecting them and explaining that in all cases the provisions of the rules had been complied with.
.The Ministry of Labour, acting through the Labour Inspectorate in La Ceiba town, carried out an investigation with a view to ascertaining whether the Congress proceeded in conformity with the legal provisions and the rules in force. According to the results of the investigation a series of acts took place which were in contravention of the provisions of the Labour Code and of the rules of the union. Consequently, the Directorate-General of Labour determined that the acts which occurred in the Congress were tainted with nullity and that neither of the two executive committees were valid. Mr. Costa Romero filed an appeal against this determination with the Supreme Court of Justice, which in its decision rejected that appeal on the grounds that no Constitutional guarantee had been violated. A few days before this decision a new Executive Committee had already been elected by the delegates duly accredited to the Thirteenth Extraordinary Congress of the Union.
.Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), provides that ""workers' and employers' organisations shall have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom, to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes"" and that the public authorities shall refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof. On a number of occasions the Committee has emphasised the importance it attaches to the generally accepted principle that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict the right of workers' organisations to elect their representatives in freedom and organise their administration and activities.
.The Committee notes that in the present case, at the time when the new Executive Committee was to be elected during the Congress held by SITRASFRUCO, a group of dissident delegates abandoned the meeting. This occurred immediately after the President of the Republic had sent the telegram mentioned in that complaint. In these circumstances the intervention of the President may have influenced the mood and the purpose of the delegates as well as influencing the attitude adopted in regard to the election of the new representatives of the organisation. The Committee considers that the fact that the authorities should intervene during the election proceedings of a union, expressing their opinion of the candidates and the consequences of the election, seriously challenges the principle whereby the trade union organisations are entitled to elect their representatives in full freedom.
.In regard to the allegations referring to the suspension of the effect of the registration of the new Executive Committee, the Committee observes that by reason of the measures of an administrative nature adopted by the Directorate-General of Labour the union was for some time deprived of ruling bodies and of representatives of the organisation. Already on other occasions the Committee has expressed the opinion that the removal by an administrative authority of a person from his office in a trade union is a procedure that might lead to abuses or to the violation of the generally recognised right which organisations possess of electing their representatives in full freedom and organising their own administration and activities.
.Since the suspension of the results of an election procedure may have similar effects to the suspension of the organisation itself, the Committee wishes to refer to what it has already pointed out on another occasion, namely that when the measures of suspension are adopted by the administrative authority there is a risk that they may appear arbitrary also when they are provisional and temporary and even when they are followed by judicial action. The Committee considers that the principles established in Article  of Convention No.  do not prevent supervision",1,1963,Honduras
58,".The Committee last examined this case when it met in February , at which time it submitted an interim report which appears in paragraphs  to  of its st Report, approved by the Governing Body at its st Session (March ). That report left outstanding certain allegations relating to the detention of trade unionists and the confiscation of trade union literature.
.The Golfito Workers' Union and the Workers' Union of Puerto Gonzlez Vquez claimed in a communication dated  June  that the authorities, after breaking up a union meeting, took into custody the workers Salomon Bustos Morales, Saturnino Alvarez Moreno, Efrain Quesada Chaverri and Esteban Fonseca Moraga, as well as the trade union officers Sabino Jurez and Guillermo Fuentes Ortega. At the same time the authorities in question confiscated a memorandum with nine signatures on the back of a list of claims, stub books of union subscription receipts and other trade union documents.
.In its reply of  December  the Government made no comment on these allegations, and the Committee therefore recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to furnish its observations on the matter, postponing in the meantime its examination of this aspect of the case.
.On  April  the Government replied to the request that had been made concerning these outstanding points. In order to comply with the request the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare had sought information from the General Inspectorate of Finance, which in its turn contacted the authorities for the area in which the events referred to by the complainants had occurred. The Deputy Inspector of Finance at Puerto Gonzlez Viquez stated that there was no record in the guard-room book of such events having taken place on the date mentioned by the complainants. Since the official who was Deputy Inspector at Puerto Gonzlez Viquez at that time is now exercising the same functions at Golfito, the authorities asked him for information on the matters raised in the complaint. Once again, however, the Deputy Inspector's reply was that on the date in question no official action was taken of the kind alleged. Finally, the Commander of the Customs Police for the southern part of the country was consulted, and his reply in no way differed from that of any of the other authorities cited.
.The Committee observes that, on the one hand, the allegation made by the complainants appears to be rather specific, since it gives the names of the persons detained and the date on which they were arrested and the trade union documents confiscated while, on the other hand, the governmental authorities for the area disclaim all knowledge of the events in question. In view of the contradictory opinions expressed by the complainants and by the Government the Committee does not consider itself sufficiently well informed to be able to reach a final decision concerning this aspect of the complaint.
.The Committee recalls, however, that the representative of the Director-General who not long ago went to the same banana-growing area on the Pacific coast of Costa Rica to investigate a series of complaints of alleged infringements of freedom of association reported that "" On several occasions the unions have complained that their leaders were arrested by the local police or by the Customs Police. It was often very difficult to find the records of such proceedings but, on the whole, the grounds for such detentions appear to be: the holding of public meetings without permission, engaging in political discussions during a trade union meeting and carrying allegedly subversive propaganda material.... These detentions are usually for a period of less than  hours and are of a preventive character. No further proceedings are generally instituted, either by the authorities or by the detainees, and so no authoritative interpretation of the law by judicial decision emerges.""
.In these circumstances, and since no further information has been forthcoming from the complainants in respect of the alleged events, and in particular in regard to the persons said to have been arrested, the Committee recommends the Governing Body, while drawing the Government's attention to the fact that the right of trade unionists to meet freely on their own premises, without prior authorisation and without supervision by the public authorities, forms a fundamental part of freedom of association, to decide that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.
.The Committee already examined this case at its session in June  and made an interim report, which appears in paragraphs  to  of its th Report adopted by the Governing Body at its th Session (June-July ) and at its session in November , when it presented another interim report, which appears in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, adopted by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ).
.When examining this case in its th Report the Committee already observed that, by reason of the many complaints received of infringement of trade union rights in the Pacific banana zone, the Government had decided to appoint a committee to investigate these events. At the time the Committee recommended the Governing Body to note that the Government had promised to furnish the results of the investigations being conducted, together with its own observations on the allegations made by the Costa Rican Workers' Confederation "" Rerum Novarum "", and to decide to postpone further examination of the case.
.In a note of  December  the Government communicated its observations together with the results of the investigations carried out by the above-mentioned committee. The Committee has studied the conclusions of this investigating committee with the greatest interest; in addition to dealing with the complaints presented to the Committee, they also treat of other complaints made directly to the investigating committee itself.
.With regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with reference to the allegations concerning the detention and dismissal of trade unionists presented by the Costa Rican Confederation of Workers "" Return Novarum "", to take note that it was not possible to furnish the investigating committee appointed by the Government with proof of the events alleged in the complaint, and that in view of the lack of more precise elements contained in the said complaint to decide that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination;(b) as regards the allegations presented by the Golfito Workers' Union and the Workers' Union of Puerto Gonzlez Viquez concerning the detention of trade unionists and the confiscation of trade union literature, to request the Government to be good enough to furnish its observations on the matter and in the meantime to postpone its examination of this aspect of the case;(c) with reference to the allegations concerning interference by the authorities and by representatives of the employers with trade union meetings, in view of the special situation that has arisen and taking into account the factors emerging from the present proceedings, to reiterate to the Government the principles set forth in paragraph  relating to the facilities that should be granted to plantation workers, particularly with regard to the right to hold trade union meetings, and to point out the need to take such steps as may be necessary to ensure the effective application of these principles;(d) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will report further when it has received the additional information requested from the Government.
.The Committee examined this case at its previous session in June  and made an interim report which appears in paragraphs - of its th Report adopted by the Governing Body at its th Session (June-July ).
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to note that the Government has promised to furnish the results of the investigation now being conducted and its own specific observations on the various points in the complaint by the Costa Rican Confederation of Workers "" Return Novarum "", and, for the time being, to postpone further examination of the case.
.By a communication dated  February  the Golfito Workers' Union presented a complaint against the Government of Costa Rica alleging violation of trade union rights in that country. Following communication of the complaint to the Government, a reply was received by note dated  April .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the allegations relating to the arrest of a trade union leader, house searches and confiscation of trade union literature and acts of discrimination against trade unionists, to note that Mr. Guillermo Fuentes was immediately released and to decide that these allegations do not call for further examination;(b) with regard to the allegations concerning intervention in trade union meetings, to request the Government to be good enough to furnish its observations and to decide in the meantime to postpone examination of this aspect of the case.Geneva,",-1,1964,Costa Rica
59,"the judgments rendered;(v) to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that the question as to whether the matter in respect of which sentences have been imposed on trade unionists is to be regarded as a matter relating to a criminal or political offence or a matter relating to the exercise of trade union rights is not one which can be determined unilaterally by the government concerned in such a manner as to prevent the Governing Body from inquiring further into it;(vi) to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that the question at issue is not the application of the legislation of a sovereign State but the question whether there has been any violation of internationally accepted principles governing the exercise of trade union rights or of the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation;(vii) to reaffirm, in these circumstances, the importance of ensuring that, where trade unionists are accused of political offences or common law crimes, they should receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment by an impartial and independent judicial authority, a principle which represents the application to the questions submitted to the Committee on Freedom of Association of the provisions of articles ,  and  of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and which, having been applied by the Committee in respect of all complaints of a nature similar to those before it in the present case, assumes a quite special importance when the person concerned is a member or deputy member of the Governing Body of the International Labour Office, by reason especially of article  of the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation, which provides that members of the Governing Body shall enjoy "" such privileges and immunities as are necessary for the independent exercise of their functions in connection with the Organisation ""; and to draw the attention of the Government to the importance attached by the Governing Body and the Conference to the discharge of those obligations;(viii) to urge the Government once again to furnish the text of the judgment by which Mr. Riani was sentenced to  years' rigorous imprisonment and of the reasons adduced therein;(ix) to request the Government to inform the Governing Body as to the result of the appeal lodged by Mr. Riani and to furnish the text of the judgment and of the reasons adduced therein and, generally, to keep the Governing Body informed of any further developments in connection with the case of Mr. Riani;(c) to request the Government once again to furnish the texts of the judgments handed down or to be handed down in the cases of the other trade union leaders named by the World Federation of Trade Unions and referred to in paragraphs  and  above, together with the reasons adduced therein;(d) to request the Government to furnish the texts of the judgments given by the courts of first instance and, when they are handed down, of the judgments of the appellate court, together, in both cases, with the reasons adduced therein, in respect of the persons named by the Latin American Confederation of Christian Trade Unionists and referred to in paragraphs  and  above;(e) to take note of the present interim report of the Committee, it being understood that the Committee will report further to the Governing Body when the information indicated in subparagraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) above has been received.
.This case was first examined by the Committee at its th Session in February , when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body in paragraphs  to  of its st Report. The Committee considered the matter again at its th Session, in May , when it submitted a further interim report in paragraphs  to  of its rd Report. The st and rd Reports of the Committee were approved by the Governing Body at its st (March ) and nd (May-June ) Sessions respectively.
.The case raised two series of allegations: one relating to the placing of trade union organisations under control, and the other to measures taken against trade union leaders.
.With regard to the case as a whole the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note the Government's statement that the control of trade union organisations in Brazil has terminated and that elections are now taking place, and to request the Government to be good enough to continue to keep the Governing Body informed of further developments with regard to this matter;(b) with regard to the particular case of Mr. Riani:(i) to draw the attention of the Government of Brazil to the importance of the considerations set forth in paragraph  above;(ii) to request the Government of Brazil to take the necessary measures to ensure that the case is dealt with on its merits within a very short period;(iii) to request the Government to forward to the Governing Body the texts of the habeas corpus judgments already given or to be given and of the judgments to be given on the merits of the case;(iv) to request the Government to forward to the Governing Body, not later than  February , information as to the position reached in the proceedings and as to the situation of Mr. Riani at that time;(c) to request the Government to be good enough to keep it informed as to further developments in the situation with regard to the measures taken against trade union leaders other than Mr. Riani, and to furnish the texts of any judgments handed down and of the reasons adduced therein;(d) to request the Government to be good enough to furnish its observations on the allegations made by the Latin American Confederation of Christian Trade Unionists in its communication dated  October ;(e) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report to the Governing Body when it has received the information and observations referred to in subparagraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) above.
.This case was already examined by the Committee at its th Session in February , when the Committee submitted to the Governing Body an interim report in paragraphs  to  of its st Report. This report was approved by the Governing Body at its st Session (March ).
.The Committee therefore recommends the Governing Body to take note of the information furnished by the Government with regard to the removal of the control exercised over trade union organisations and to request the Government to be good enough to keep it informed as to developments in this connection.
.The Government makes no reference to the allegations relating to measures taken against trade union leaders in its latest observations. The Committee therefore recommends the Governing Body to reiterate the request which it made in this connection to the Government when it approved the st Report of the Committee and to ask the Government to be good enough to furnish, as early as possible, information concerning the proceedings taken in the case of the detained trade union leaders and to furnish the texts of the judgments; when they have been handed down together with the reasons adduced therein.
.Finally, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report when it has received the additional information referred to in the two preceding paragraphs.
.The complaint of the World Federation of Trade Unions is contained in two communications dated  April and  December . The complaint of the Latin American Confederation of Christian Trade Unionists is contained in a communication dated  November . The complaint of the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions is contained in a communication dated  November . Copies of all these communications, which were addressed directly to the I.L.O, were transmitted to the Government as they were received. The Government furnished its observations in two communications dated respectively  November  and  February .
.Brazil has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), but has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations made by the complainants fall under two main heads: persecution of trade union leaders and intervention by the Government in trade union activities.
.In its communication dated  February  the Government declares in the first place that no violation of trade union rights took place on the occasion of the events referred to by the World Federation of Trade Unions. The Government states that "" it was simply a question of measures being taken in order to maintain national safety. In fact, there was visibly in the country an acceleration of a subversive process the consequences of which were easy to foresee. Warned in time, the active forces in the country had to take necessary measures to defend the legal system. This was the significance of the movement of  March , intended essentially to guarantee a democratic rgime in Brazil.""

60,".This case was already examined by the Committee at its sessions in May , February  and May . On these occasions the Committee submitted to the Governing Body interim reports on the case which appear in paragraphs  to  of its rd Report, paragraphs  to  of its th Report and paragraphs  to  of its th Report respectively. These three reports were approved by the Governing Body.
.In the previous stages of its examination of the case the Committee formed certain conclusions regarding the sentencing of  of the  trade unionists whose imprisonment was specifically referred to in the complaint of  December  from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.
.The Committee now has the observations and information, dated  December , submitted by the Government in respect of the seven remaining persons, as requested in paragraph  (c) of the th Report of the Committee.
.Cuba has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.According to the facts given in the complaint, the seven trade unionists in question were: Luis Miguel Linsuain, General Secretary of the Gastronomic Federation of Oriente Province; Alberto Garcia, General Secretary of the National Medical Federation; Antonio Dagas, Deputy General Secretary of the Cuban section of the Spanish trade union organisation, National Confederation of Labour (C.N.T.); Leandro Barreras, member of the Executive Board of the National Federation of Sugar Workers; Norberto Abreu, Secretary of the Federation of Printing and Allied Trades; Carmen Mndez Linares, employee of the Confederation of Cuban Workers; and Juan Manuel Reines, leader of the trade union section of the clandestine movement.
.From the Government's communication dated  December  and from the texts of the judgments attached thereto it emerges that all these persons-except Mr. Leandro Barreras-were judged by revolutionary courts or councils of war by virtue of penal provisions quoted in the respective judgments, and sentenced to various terms  imprisonment.
.According to the information submitted by the Government, Mr. Luis Linsuain was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment on  May  for an offence against the state authorities. He is accused of taking part in the activities of a counter-revolutionary group known as M.D.C, which is alleged to have planned to overthrow the Government by means of an armed rising, acts of sabotage, stocking and transporting arms, and attacks on government officials. Mr. Alberto Garcia was sentenced to  years' imprisonment "" for his direct participation in acts constituting an offence against the state authorities "", which are alleged to have consisted of counter-revolutionary activities in which he took part as an active member of a clandestine organisation known as the "" National Liberation Army "", in which, according to the judgment, he held the rank of captain. The sentence was passed on  October . Mr. Antonio Dagas was sentenced to three years and seven months' imprisonment "" for his direct participation in acts constituting an offence against the state authorities ""; together with other persons, he is said to have committed acts of terrorism, such as planting a bomb under a car parked in front of the offices of the C.T.C.R. (Confederation of Workers of Revolutionary Cuba). Mr. Norberto Abreu was sentenced on  June  to  years' imprisonment "" for his direct participation in acts constituting offences against the unity and stability of the nation "" as a member of the counter-revolutionary Organisation known as the ""Movement of  November"", in which he is said to have been responsible for propaganda throughout the country. Juan Manuel Reines and Maria del Carmen Mndez Linares were sentenced on  October  to nine and three years' imprisonment respectively "" for their direct participation in carrying out acts constituting offences against the unity and stability of the nation, and against the state authorities, arson, violence and possession of explosives "". Both are alleged to have belonged to an organisation known as the "" People's Revolutionary Movement "", which is said to have carried out acts of sabotage directed against industrial and commercial centres as well as against public services.
.With regard to Mr. Leandro Barreras, the Government states that the investigations which have been carried out have revealed no evidence whatsoever of any legal proceedings nor of a previous criminal record to show that this person has undergone or is undergoing a prison sentence or temporary deprivation of freedom.
.From the judgments sent by the Government it emerges that the additional penalties inflicted on the accused included the confiscation of all their goods. Names of defence counsel are also given. In some cases these appear to have been chosen by the accused and in others to have been appointed by the courts.
.The Government repeats what it stated in another case examined by the Committee, in respect of the standards applied by the revolutionary courts. It declares that in these cases too the accused participated directly in the commission of serious and sufficiently distinct acts, defined as offences under legislation promulgated before they were committed, "" and that they have nothing to do with genuine trade union militancy and activities "".
.The Committee notes that the Government has been unable to find any evidence that Mr. Leandro Barreras, one of the  trade unionists named in the complaint, has been imprisoned or tried. It points out, on the basis of the observations of the Government and of the texts of the judgments submitted by the latter at various stages in the examination of the case, that the acts imputed to each of the  remaining trade unionists, which provided grounds for the sentences, do not appear to bear any relation to trade union activities. The Committee has already pointed out that the procedure applied by the revolutionary courts dealing with these cases is the extraordinary procedure laid down in the  Act respecting Trials in Cuba Under Arms.
.This case was considered by the Committee at its meetings held in May  and February , together with Cases Nos.  and , when it submitted the interim conclusions in respect of it contained in paragraphs  to  of the rd Report and in paragraphs  to  of the th Report respectively, both of which were approved by the Governing Body.

.Cuba has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its complaint of  December  the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (I.C.F.T.U.) stated that a number of trade union officials had been imprisoned for alleged "" counter-revolutionary activities "" and requested the Governing Body to set up a fact-finding commission with a view to ascertaining the equity of the judicial procedure applied to the officials in question and the way in which they were treated in prison.
.At its meeting in February  the Committee had before it a communication from the Government dated  November , supplying information with respect to  of the  persons whose names and trade union activities were listed in the complaint, with the texts of the judgments given against them in public hearings by various Councils of War (revolutionary courts). On that occasion, in paragraph  of its th Report, the Committee recommended the Governing Body, among other things, with regard to the  trade union officials on whose situation the Government had supplied information, to emphasise to the Government, as it had already done previously, the importance which it attached to the principle that trade unionists, like all other persons, should be entitled to the safeguards of normal judicial procedure, and to invite the Government to co-operate by furnishing, as soon as possible, detailed information concerning the present situation of the trade union officials mentioned in the complaint.
.This recommendation having been approved by the Governing Body, the request for additional information referred to was brought to the notice of the Government by a letter dated  March .
.The annexes to the communication of  April  from the Cuban Permanent Delegation in Geneva contain the additional information submitted by the Cuban Government respecting five others of the  trade union officials named in the complaint, as well as the text of various relevant judgments pronounced by various Councils of War in public hearings.

.The Committee considers that it would be useful and convenient to deal in a single document with these two cases referring to Bolivia, which it now has under examination. Case No.  deals with the assault that, according to a complaint by the Bolivian Workers' Confederation, was made in August  on Mr. Juan Lechn, head of this Confederation. Case No.  deals with the complaints made by the Bolivian Workers' Confederation and the World Federation of Trade Unions concerning alleged repressive measures taken in May  by the Military Junta against trade union organisations and leaders.

The latter event occurred early in December . Mr. Portillo was walking along one of the city streets when shots were fired at him from a car which immediately vanished. It has not been possible up to now to identify its occupants. The National Investigation Corps is still investigating this crime; several clues have been discovered which it is hoped will lead to the clearing up of the mystery.
.At its meeting in November  the Committee took cognizance of this case and decided to postpone examination of it until its next meeting, when it was hoped that fresh information would have been received from the Government as to the results of the inquiries being made. Up to now no such information has been forthcoming, despite the fact that the crime was committed in December  and that according to the Government's own statement several clues were being followed up which it was hoped would lead to the clearing up of the mystery.

64,".This case has already come before the Committee, at its meetings in May  and May , on both of which occasions it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body. These reports will be found, respectively, in paragraphs  to  of the Committee's th Report and in paragraphs  to  of its th Report.
.In these reports the Committee made its final recommendations with respect to some of the allegations contained in the complaint, leaving outstanding only the allegations relating to the dismissal from his post of a public servant, Professor Amilcar Salinas Rivera, which according to the complainants took place four days after he had been elected to an official post in the National Trade Union of Public Servants of Honduras (SINASEPH).
.In paragraph  of its th Report the Committee noted that the Government had as yet made no comment as to the reasons for Professor Salinas Rivera's dismissal. In these circumstances the Committee recommended the Governing Body, in paragraph  (b) of the same report, to request the Government to be good enough to comment on the allegation that the said professor had been dismissed from his post in the public administration on account of his trade union activities. This recommendation having been agreed to by the Governing Body, the request for information in question was transmitted to the Government.
.In its reply, dated  November , the Government states first of all that none of the competent departments of the Ministry of Labour has any official knowledge of the establishment or Constitution of the National Trade Union of Public Servants of Honduras, and that it is therefore hardly possible to consider Professor Salinas Rivera (referred to as Rivera Salinas in the Government's letter) as a trade union official or to take account of his status as Secretary-General of the Action and Public Relations Committee of an organisation which has never acquired legal personality as either a civil or an industrial association. The Government adds that the person in question, who had been arrested on suspicion of a criminal attempt to undermine the democratic form of government, now enjoys unrestricted freedom.
.As regards the dismissal of Professor Salinas Rivera from his post in the public administration, the Government declares, in brief, that there is no objective and reliable evidence that the said dismissal was connected in any way with his election to a trade union post, about which the Government states that it has no authoritative information. There is nothing exceptional in the removal from his post of the person in question, which was decided upon on  October ; it is customary in the public administration of Honduras to terminate the appointments of public officials or employees simply at the discretion of the Minister concerned, who has full freedom to decide upon the desirability of such a step, particularly when, as in the present case, an official or employee engages in activities detrimental to the Government.
.The Committee recalls that in an earlier report it made recommendations to the Governing Body with respect to allegations to the effect that a group of public employees had formed a trade union (SINASEPH) on  August , but that when they applied for registration of the union and recognition of its legal personality, the Directorate-General of Labour decided on  November  that the documents submitted were in order, except for certain errors in wording discovered in its rules, yet failed to take steps to have the union - i.e. the complaining organisation - registered, which was one of the grounds for the complaint. Furthermore, SINASEPH attached to a subsequent communication dated  January  copy of a letter it had received from the Minister of Labour in reply to one from the union. At all events, bearing in mind that the initial observations of the Government, analysed by the Committee in its th Report, appeared to indicate that for the time being public employees in Honduras do not have the right to organise, the Committee recommended the Governing Body to draw the attention of the Government to "" the importance of ensuring that persons employed in the service of the State should enjoy the right to establish trade unions and to register them with a view to their lawful operation, this principle being laid down in Article  of the Convention No. , ratified by Honduras, which provides that workers, without distinction whatsoever, shall have the right to establish organisations of their own choosing without previous authorisation "". This recommendation was approved by the Governing Body and transmitted to the Government by letter dated  June .
.In view of the facts recapitulated in the preceding paragraph, especially as concerns the procedure initiated by the complaining organisation in  to secure registration and recognition of its legal personality, the decision which appears to have been taken in this respect in November  and the letter subsequently sent by the Minister of Labour to the complaining organisation, the Committee fails to understand what is meant by the remark made by the Government in its communication of  November  to the effect that the Government of Honduras has no official knowledge of the establishment or Constitution of SINASEPH.
.In any case, bearing in mind the background to this situation, and in particular the Committee's recommendation quoted in paragraph  above, the Committee considers that the fact that the complaining organisation has not been recognised nor registered does not, in the present instance, constitute a sufficient reason for rejecting the allegations which still remain outstanding.
.In regard to this last aspect of the case the point at issue is whether the dismissal of Professor Salinas Rivera was an infringement of freedom of association as the complainants maintain. The Committee notes the Government's statement to the effect that Professor Salinas Rivera was arrested on suspicion of a criminal offence, although it points out that the Government has supplied no information as to whether the charge in question was upheld in court proceedings.
.In any case the Government's observations raise a much vaster issue, namely the permissibility of dismissing employees and officials in the service of the State-and, it follows therefrom, members or officials of trade union organisations formed by them for the defence of their common economic and social interests-"" simply at the discretion of the Minister concerned, who has full freedom to decide upon the desirability of such a step "". Such a situation appears to be incompatible with the guarantee provided in Article  of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), that workers shall enjoy adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment, such protection applying more particularly in respect of acts calculated to cause the dismissal of or otherwise prejudice a worker by reason of union membership or because of participation in union activities. In effect, as matters stand at present, even if it were possible to prove that the dismissal of a public official or employee had been decided upon on grounds of union membership or participation in union activities, such proof would have no practical value as a means of defending trade union rights.
.It would consequently appear from the observations made by the Government in its communication dated  November  that in Honduras persons employed in the service of the State, whose right to form organisations of their own choosing is guaranteed by Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Honduras, do not enjoy adequate protection against possible acts of discrimination in respect of their employment of the kind referred to in Article  of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), likewise ratified by Honduras, the importance of which was already brought to the attention of the Government in paragraph  (a) (ii) of the Committee's th Report, approved by the Governing Body.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to take note of the Government's statement in its communication of  November  to the effect that it is customary in the public administration of Honduras to terminate the appointments of public officials or employees simply at the discretion of the Minister concerned, who has full freedom to decide upon the desirability of such a step, and of the fact that, in such circumstances, it would appear that officials and employees in the service of the State do not enjoy adequate protection against dismissal for reasons such as union membership or participation in lawful union activities;(b) in consequence, to draw the attention of the Government to the importance which it has always attached to the principle laid down in Article  of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Honduras, that workers shall enjoy adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment, such protection applying more particularly in respect of acts calculated to cause the dismissal of or otherwise prejudice a worker",0,1964,Honduras
65,"by reason of union membership or because of participation in union activities;(c) to request the Government to be good enough to inform the Committee of the steps it has taken or proposes to take to guarantee to persons employed in the service of the State the adequate protection to which reference is made in subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this paragraph;(d) to bring these conclusions to the attention of the I.L.O. Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.
.This case already came before the Committee at its May  meeting, when it submitted an interim report on the subject which will be found in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session (May-June ). In that report the Committee submitted its final conclusions and recommendations with respect to the allegations relating to the registration and recognition of the complaining organisation, and the paragraphs which follow will deal only with the remaining allegations, examination of which was left outstanding pending the receipt of certain additional information requested from the Government.
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its complaint dated  November  the National Trade Union of Public Servants of Honduras (SINASEPH) stated that Professor Amilcar Salinas Rivera had been arrested and wrongfully dismissed from his post in the public administration four days after being elected Secretary-General of that organisation's Action and Public Relations Committee. The complainants held that the action taken against Professor Salinas Rivera was due to his trade union activities and added that Miss Marina Barnica, who had played a prominent part in the founding of the union, had been dismissed from her post as secretary at the Labour Inspectorate on the same day.
.When it examined the case at its meeting in May  the Committee observed that in its observations the Government had given no specific explanation with respect to these allegations, merely referring to certain purely political activities which could not be pursued by trade unions. In consequence, for the reasons stated in paragraphs  and  of its th Report, the Committee recommended the Governing Body, while reaffirming the importance it attached to ensuring that trade union members arrested for political offences or for offences under ordinary law should be tried within the shortest possible period by an impartial and independent judicial authority, to request the Government to make specific observations concerning the reasons for the arrest of Mr. Salinas Rivera, and his present situation, and also to request the Government to send its observations concerning the reasons for the dismissal of Miss Marina Barnica and Mr. Salinas Rivera. Since it appeared from an earlier communication from the Government that Mr. Aristides Mejia Castro, who had signed the complaint as President of the SINASEPH, had also been dismissed, the Committee also requested the Government for observations with respect to his case.
.These recommendations, having been approved by the Governing Body, were transmitted to the Government by letter dated  June , to which the Government replied on  January .
.The Government declares on the basis of a report from the National Investigation Corps, copy of which it attaches, that Professor Salinas Rivera was arrested for the proved offence of attempting to overthrow the democratic form of government, but that he was subsequently released. The Government adds that since  August  the person concerned has occupied a post as instructor at the Co-operative Technical Industrial Centre at San Pedro Sula, and attaches an attestation to that effect. Miss Marina Barnica was dismissed at the request of her immediate superior, the Chief of the Labour Inspectorate at San Pedro Sula, for failure to perform her duties. The Government also explains that Mr. Mejia Castro was not dismissed; he requested permission to resign from his post as Chief of the Workers' Education Department in order to go to the Central American Institute of Trade Union Studies, where he took up employment on  September . The Government attaches a number of documents relating to Mr. Mejia Castro's request, including a copy of the request itself, wherein, inter alia, he expresses his gratitude for the confidence shown in him during his employment with the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare and recommends a candidate to replace him. The Government denies having infringed Article  of Convention No. , considering that the persons named in the complaint have not been the victims of discrimination in respect of employment, nor were they dismissed on account of their trade union activities.
.The Committee takes due note of the information supplied by the Government, from which it appears that Mr. Mejia Castro left his post of his own accord and that Miss Barnica was dismissed purely on account of her work. As far as the latter is concerned, since the complainants confine themselves to mentioning her dismissal and her earlier trade union activities without furnishing any evidence which would serve to establish a link between the two, the Committee considers, in the light of the Government's reply, that it would serve no useful purpose to proceed with its examination of this aspect of the case.
.As regards Professor Salinas Rivera, the Government's reply announces that he has been released. The reply does not, however, refer specifically to the allegation that Professor Salinas Rivera was dismissed from his post in the public administration at the time of his arrest, i.e. four days after he was elected Secretary-General of the Action and Public Relations Committee of the National Trade Union of Public Servants of Honduras.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with respect to the allegation relating to the dismissal of Miss Marina Barnica, to take note of the Government's statement to the effect that she was dismissed on account of her work and to decide, for the reasons stated in paragraph  above, that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination;(b) to request the Government to be good enough to comment on the allegation that Professor Amilcar Salinas Rivera was dismissed from his post in the public administration on account of his trade union activities;(c) to take note of the present interim report, on the understanding that the Committee will report further to the Governing Body when it has received the information requested from the Government in subparagraph (b) of this paragraph.Geneva,  May .

.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.With its communication dated  November  the complaining organisation also forwarded a copy of a letter to the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare stating that a group of public employees had established a trade union on  August  in accordance with section  of the Labour Code. Following the organisation's application for registration and recognition of its legal personality, the Directorate-General of Labour decided that the documents submitted were in order, except for certain errors in wording discovered in its rules. However, from the time when this decision was communicated on  November  until the present the authorities had failed to give instructions for the union to be registered, although section  of the Labour Code lays down a period of  days within which this must be done. On  October  SINASEPH held its first extraordinary congress, at which it decided to set up an Action and Public Relations Committee, Professor Amilcar Salinas Rivera being elected Secretary-General of that Committee. Four days later Professor Salinas Rivera was arrested and wrongfully dismissed from his post in the public administration. The complainants consider that the action taken against Professor Salinas Rivera is due to his trade union activities and state that Miss Marina Barnica, who had been prominent in the formation of the union, was dismissed from her post as secretary at the Labour Inspectorate on the same day.
.With their communication dated  January  the complainants sent a letter received from the Minister of Labour replying to the protests made in connection with the action taken against Professor Salinas Rivera and Miss Barnica. This letter stated that the Minister would undertake the necessary investigation. The complainants allege that this is an attempt to evade the legal requirements. The complainants also sent a copy of the decision by the Directorate-General of Labour referred to above and a copy of a letter received from the Director-General of Labour stating that, since the union was in the process of being formed, its Executive Board would remain under the special protection",1,1964,Honduras
66,".The Committee previously examined this case at its sessions held in February  and May , when it submitted interim reports to the Governing Body which are contained in paragraphs  to  of the nd Report and  to  of the th Report respectively.
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.This case refers to the assassination of Mr. Humberto Portillo, referred to as a "" Christian trade union leader "" in the complaint presented by the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unionists. The observations initially sent by the Government on  May  appeared to attribute this and other crimes to a clandestine organisation whose purpose was to promote agitation among workers and their unions. These observations referred to Mr. Portillo as a "" trade union leader "". The Committee examined the abovementioned documents at its session held in February  and recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the investigations which the Government had stated it would make to clear up this matter.
.At its session held in May  the Committee took note of a further communication from the Government, dated  January , which stated in substance that the investigation undertaken had not up to that time established the identity of the criminal or criminals or the motive for the crime, but that, in the opinion of the Government, there were no grounds for supposing the murder of Mr. Portillo to be necessarily connected with trade union activities and that in any case the Government was not responsible in any way for what had happened. The information submitted to the Committee to enable it to consider the case was not detailed or consistent enough to show whether the act denounced by the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unionists and which in itself constituted a crime was in any way connected with freedom of association. In these circumstances the Committee recommended the Governing Body in paragraph  of its th Report to express the hope that all steps necessary to establish the truth would be taken and to request the Government to keep it informed of any fresh information that might come to light.
.The Government answered this request for information by a communication dated  November  from which it appeared that the motive for the crime and the identity of its perpetrator were still unknown. The Government went on to state that it had made inquiries in order to ascertain whether Mr. Portillo was in actual fact a trade union leader, and attached an attestation signed by the Vice-President of the Authentic Trade Union Federation of Honduras (F.A.S.H.) which stated that Mr. Portillo had never been a member of any of the member unions of F.A.S.H or held any office of employment in that organisation. The Government therefore considered that the person in question was not a trade unionist, although that circumstance in no way affected the continuation of the inquiry concerning his death.
.Summing up the case, the Committee notes that, in the first place, the complaint referred to Mr. Portillo as a "" Christian trade union leader "" without giving further details. In the second place, the Government, after referring to Mr. Portillo as a trade union leader in its initial communications and giving indications that his assassination had been an act of terrorism aimed at workers and their unions, had subsequently stated that it had reached the conviction that he was not a trade unionist, and had reported that the investigation of the crime had produced no results up to the time of writing.
.In the circumstances, in view of the discrepancy between the terms of the complaint and those of the Government's observations as regards Mr. Portillo's capacity as a trade union leader, and bearing in mind the vagueness of the information set forth in the complaint and the fact that the investigation carried out by the authorities has not brought to light the exact circumstances of the crime, it does not appear that sufficient proof has been furnished to show that the assassination of Mr. Humberto Portillo raises any question relating to the exercise of trade union rights which would warrant further examination of this complaint.
.The Committee examined this case previously at its meeting in February , when it submitted an interim report appearing in paragraphs  to  of its nd Report, approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session (May ).
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its complaint dated  March  the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unionists alleged that the trade union leader Humberto Portillo had been murdered. In its reply dated  May , which is summarised in paragraph  of the nd Report, the Government mentioned the existence and activities of an organisation (the Integrated Liberation Movement) devoted to terrorism and sabotage, which had gone so far as to attack persons with the purpose of embarrassing the trade unions and workers. These acts of violence had made three victims-two officials murdered on the north-coast banana plantations and a trade union leader, Mr. Humberto Portillo, shot dead in the streets of Tegucigalpa in December . As the Government had stated that investigations were going on with the purpose of throwing light on the death of Mr. Portillo, the Committee recommended the Governing Body in paragraph  of the above-mentioned report to request the Government to furnish all possible information on the results of the investigations. This recommendation was approved by the Governing Body and communicated to the Government by a letter dated  June .
.In a letter dated  January  the Government states that it has not so far been possible to throw light on the crime but that investigations continue. From a report of the National Investigation Department, enclosed with the letter, it appears that, although various suspects were taken into custody and questioned, they were released because their complicity in the crime could not be proved.
.The Government states that no responsibility in the matter can be attributed to it. It adds that since the motives of the crime are unknown, there is no proof that it was necessarily connected with the trade union activities of Mr. Portillo. In any case the matter comes within the competence of the courts of justice, whose responsibility it is to establish the truth. Lastly, the Government states that it reaffirms its intention of complying to the full with its international obligations, especially with respect to the preservation of freedom of association.
.The Committee takes note of these statements by the Government, which appear to modify those contained in the latter's communication of  May , since the earlier statements seemed to be based on the assumption that Mr. Portillo had been murdered because he was a trade union leader, by members of an organisation devoted to embarrassing the trade unions and workers by this and other acts.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to take note of the statement by the Government that it has not yet been possible to throw light on the circumstances relating to the murder of the trade union leader Mr. Humberto Portillo;(b) to take note that the competent authorities are continuing to investigate the case;(c) to express the hope that the Government will take all the necessary steps to establish the truth concerning this grave matter;(d) to request the Government to be good enough to inform the Governing Body of everything new arising in connection with the case;(e) to take note of this interim report, on the understanding that the Committee will submit a new report when the Government has supplied the information referred to in subparagraph (d).

.In its reply of  May  the Government states that there exists in the country an organisation of young communists whose mission is to commit acts of terrorism and sabotage.

.With regard to the observations contained in items (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (g) and (j), the Committee considers that they appear to relate to formal requirements that must be complied with by the Federation in its application for registration and the granting of legal personality, requirements that the Government can properly lay down without this implying a violation of the principles of freedom of association. In fact, although Article  of Convention No.  provides that workers and employers shall have the right to establish organisations "" without previous authorisation "", this does not free the founders of an organisation from the duty of "" observing formalities as to publicity or other similar formalities which may be prescribed in certain countries, either generally in respect of all associations or specifically in respect of trade unions "", as the I.L.O. Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has stated, though these formalities must not be such as to be equivalent, in practice, to previous authorisation or to constitute a serious obstacle to the establishment of an organisation.
.With regard to the requirements contained in items (f) and (i) the Committee considers that they relate not to matters of mere form, but directly to the right of the organisations "" to draw up their Constitutions and rules "" in accordance with Article  of Convention No. . These requirements refer to the legal obligation of trade unions to make provision for a specific majority and quorum for the adoption of their decisions, in accordance with section  of the Labour Code. It is prescribed that resolutions of the general meeting shall be adopted by a simple majority vote; but that in the cases of approving the by-laws and any amendments thereto, fixing the contributions and wages to be paid and deciding on the expulsion of members, the majority vote shall be two-thirds of the members present; in the cases of amalgamation of unions and affiliation with, or withdrawal from, a federation or Confederation and of the dissolution of the union, the majority vote shall be two-thirds of the total number of members of the union; and finally, in the case of a strike, the majority vote shall be two-thirds of the total number of members of the union or branch concerned.
.The Committee observes that Article , paragraph , of Convention No.  lays down that the public authorities shall refrain from any interference which would restrict or impede the lawful exercise of the right of the organisations "" to draw up their Constitutions and rules "", and that in accordance with Article  the acquisition of legal personality by an organisation shall not be made subject to conditions of such a character as to restrict the application of such provisions of the Convention as those contained in Article .
.On one occasion the Committee considered that legislation minutely regulating the procedure for internal trade union elections, the composition of its principal organs and the days of their meetings, the precise date for the annual assembly and the date when the terms of office of the officers should come to an end, was incompatible with the rights of the trade unions recognised by Convention No. . On another occasion the Committee admitted the Government's merely making specimen Constitutions available to organisations in process of creation without requiring them to accept an obligatory model, stating that this did not involve any interference with the right of organisations to draw up their Constitutions and rules in full freedom.
.In the present case the legal prescription of certain majority votes for the adoption of resolutions by the assembly of a trade union relates to a question of the highest importance for the life of the organisation and the rights of its members. The Committee considers that, in cases like this, involving basic matters relating to the existence and structure of a union and the fundamental rights of its members, the regulation by law of the majority votes for the adoption of the decisions involved does not imply interference by the authorities contrary to the Convention, provided that this regulation by law is not of such a nature as seriously to impede the running of a trade union in accordance with prevailing conditions, making practically impossible the adoption of the decisions proper to it, and provided that the purpose is to guarantee the right of members to participate democratically in the life of the union.
.Nevertheless, with regard to the majority vote required by law for the declaration of a legal strike (two-thirds of the total number of members of the union or branch concerned), non-compliance with which may entail a penalty by the administrative authorities going as far as dissolution of the union, the Committee recalls the conclusions of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations a concerning the application by the Government of Honduras of Convention No. , which it has ratified, to the effect that the legal provisions involved constitute "" an intervention by the public authorities in the activities of trade unions which is of a nature to restrict the rights of such organisations, contrary to Article  of the Convention "".
.With regard to the observation of the authorities contained in item (h), according to which boycott tactics must be eliminated from the by-laws, since such a procedure comes within the scope of the Penal Code as an illegal act, the Committee requests the Government to inform it of the specific penal provisions in force in Honduras under which the boycott is considered an illegal act, and in the meantime postpones the examination of this aspect of the case.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to take note of the observations furnished by the Government from which it would appear that the reasons for which legal personality has not been granted to the Authentic Trade Union Federation of Honduras are that it has not complied with certain formalities;(b) to take note of the present interim report of the Committee with regard to the remaining allegations, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report when it has received the information requested on the points referred to in paragraph  above.Geneva,  November .

.In Case No.  relating to Japan the Committee observed that the law and practice of a number of countries require absolute majorities of a union's membership -at least on a first ballot-for certain matters which affect the basic existence of a union (changes of Constitution and rules, dissolution, etc.), but that it is not the normal practice to require such majorities in the case of matters relating to the ordinary functioning of a trade union, such as elections. In cases of the latter kind it is the normally accepted principle that, provided all the members in good standing are enabled freely to exercise their right to vote, a simple majority of the votes cast shall, subject to any contrary rule voluntarily adopted by the union itself, be sufficient; any departure from this principle would mean that, in the absence of a system of compulsory voting, a union's activities would be paralysed unless an exceptionally high vote were cast on every occasion in order for a decision to be taken, a situation in which the law of the land would be such as to impair the rights accorded to organisations under Article  of Convention No. .
.It was in accordance with these considerations that the Committee, when examining the present case at its meeting in November , concluded, with respect to the majority votes required by section  of the Labour Code for certain matters other than strike action (see paragraph  above), that the requirements laid down did not imply interference by the authorities contrary to the Convention.
.With regard to the requirement of a two-thirds majority vote of the total membership for strike action, however, non-compliance with which might even entail the penalty of dissolution of a union by administrative authority, the Committee recalled the conclusions of the I.L.O. Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations concerning the application of Convention No.  by the Government of Honduras to the effect that the legal provisions involved constitute "" an intervention by the public authorities in the activities of trade unions which is of a nature to restrict the rights of such organisations, contrary to Article  of the Convention "".
.Since the Committee formulated that conclusion, further comments on the matter have been made by the Government in its communication dated  September .
.In its communication dated  September  the Government contends that the requirements as to special majorities do not imply "" previous authorisation "" for the formation of an organisation or interfere with its right to draw up its Constitution and rules.
.In the same communication the Government refers to the provision in section  of the Labour Code to the effect that a union concerned in an unlawful stoppage of work may be "" ordered to be dissolved if the authority or official issuing the declaration "" that the stoppage is unlawful "" so decides "". The Government states that this does not mean that a union can be dissolved by administrative decision, because, under section , it lies with the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare to decide whether resort shall be had to the provisions of section  () (d), according to which "" application may be made to the labour court to cancel the union's legal personality and to dissolve and liquidate the union itself ""; the competence of the labour court in this respect is also set forth in section . However, states the Government, there is some discrepancy between section  () (c) of the Code, which permits the suspension of an organisation's legal personality by administrative action, and Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), according to which workers' organisations shall not be liable to be dissolved or suspended by administrative authority. But, the Government explains, as the decree approving the ratification of the Convention was promulgated prior to the Code of  and has not been repealed, the provisions of the Convention are applicable and there has been no case in which the Ministry has, in fact, suspended the legal personality of any trade union.
.In this connection the Committee recalls that the I.L.O. Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, when examining these provisions in the legislation of Honduras, observed that section  () (c) of the Code was incompatible with Article  of the Convention.
.In all the circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the attention of the Government to the importance which the Governing Body attaches to the principles enunciated in Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Honduras, according to which workers' organisations shall have the right to draw up their Constitutions and rules and to organise their activities and the public authorities shall refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof; in Article , according to which workers' organisations shall not be liable to be dissolved or suspended by administrative authority; in Article , according to which the acquisition of legal personality shall not be made subject to conditions of such a character as to restrict the application of the provisions contained in the foregoing Articles; and in Article , according to which the law of the land shall not be such as to impair, nor shall it be so applied as to impair, the guarantees provided for in the Convention;(b) to draw attention to the view expressed by the I.L.O. Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations that the requirement of a two thirds majority vote of the total membership of the union or branch concerned before a lawful strike can be declared is not compatible with Article  of the said Convention, and that section  () (c) of the Labour Code, according to which the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare may suspend the legal personality of a trade union guilty of a contravention of the Code, is not compatible with Article  of the Convention;(c) to request the Government to be good enough to inform the Governing Body as to the steps it intends to take to bring its legislation in these respects into harmony with the provisions of the Convention;(d) to express the hope that the Government will now further review the case of the application for legal personality by the complaining organisation in the light of the foregoing considerations.
.The complaint is contained in a communication of  July  addressed directly to the I.L.O by the Authentic Trade Union Federation of Honduras (F.A.S.H.). It was forwarded by the I.L.O to the Government, which submitted its observations in a communication dated  August .
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communication the complainants, who state that they represent , workers and peasants, accuse the Head of the Government of infringing freedom of association by refusing to grant legal personality to F.A.S.H, although the legal requirements have been complied with and the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare has given its approval.
.In its reply the Government states that the reasons for which legal personality has not been granted to F.A.S.H are purely legal, since the organisers of the Federation have not complied with the requirements and conditions laid down in the Labour Code. In this connection the communication of the Government reproduces a decision of the Secretariat of State for Labour and Social Welfare, setting forth the reasons for which legal personality has not yet been granted to the Federation. According to this communication the Federation has been granted two months in which to make good the errors and omissions appearing in the documents submitted with its application for registration and recognition.
.According to the Secretariat of State referred to the observations made to the Federation relate to the following items:(a) omissions consisting in the absence of the numbers of the decisions recognising the legal personality of the affiliated unions and the numbers and dates of the issues of the official gazette in which they were published;(b) omission to record in the minutes the authorisations of the general meetings empowering the representatives of the affiliated unions to establish the Federation;(c) failure to comply with the requirement to submit a list of the provisional managing committee, showing personal data relating to its members;(d) omission to submit the certified copies of the articles of association and copies of the by-laws;(e) the use in the by-laws of the",-1,1964,Honduras
70,".This case has already been examined by the Committee at its sessions in November  and February . On those occasions interim reports were submitted, and these appear in paragraphs  to  of the th Report and in paragraphs  to  of the th Report of the Committee respectively.
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee notes the additional information sent spontaneously by the Government with its communication of  May , concerning the points to which the recommendations of the Committee set out in paragraph  (a), (b) and (c) of its th Report referred. Concerning the recommendation in paragraph  (d) the Committee observes that the authorities have recognised the legal personality of the complainant organisation, a matter which formed the subject of the complaint.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to take note of the Government's statement of  May  from which it appears that the competent authority has issued a decision recognising the legal personality of the complainant organisation;(b) to take note of the Government's statement that it will study the amendments required to bring Honduran legislation into conformity with the provisions of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), regarding the matters referred to in paragraph  of the th Report of the Committee;(c) to request the Government to be good enough to keep the Governing Body informed concerning the measures which it is adopting or considers adopting for the purposes mentioned in the preceding subparagraph.
.This case was examined by the Committee at its meeting in November , when it submitted an interim report in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, which was approved by the Governing Body at its st Session (March ).
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complaining organisation, representing , workers and peasants, alleges that the Head of the Government has infringed freedom of association by refusing to grant it legal personality, although the necessary legal requirements have been complied with and the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare has given its approval.
.At its meeting in November  the Committee had before it a communication from the Government dated  August , in which the Government stated that legal personality had not been accorded to the organisation because of errors and omissions appearing in the documents submitted with its application for registration and recognition and that the organisation had been granted two months in which to make good such errors and omissions and thus comply with the requirements of the Labour Code.
.The Government listed ten requirements with which the organisation had been called upon to comply. The Committee took the view that seven of these requirements, listed in detail in paragraph  of its th Report, were formal requirements which a government could properly lay down without this implying a violation of the principles of freedom of association.
.The other three items with respect to which the complaining organisation was called upon to take remedial action were- (a) infringement of the provisions of section  of the Labour Code in connection with the special majority votes prescribed for the adoption of certain resolutions; (b) prior verification by the General Inspectorate of Labour of observance by the constituent unions of the complaining federation of the legal quorums referred to in section  of the Labour Code; (c) elimination or replacement by other means of the boycott tactics referred to in its by-laws, such a procedure being an illegal act under the Penal Code.
.With regard to the last of the three points referred to above, the Committee decided to request the Government to be good enough to inform it of the specific penal provisions in force in Honduras under which the boycott is considered to be an illegal act.
.In a communication dated  September  the Government states that the boycott is not specified under general penal law, but that it must be regarded, in the light of the system underlying the legislation of Honduras, as an unlawful act. The Government states that by a boycott it means "" any act or procedure contrary to free competition in production, industry, commerce or a public service "" and therefore harmful to the public economy. In the light of this definition it considers that a boycott is at variance with article  of the Constitution whereby the State recognises and guarantees freedom of consumption, saving, investment, occupation, initiative, commercial, enterprise and other freedoms which may tend to strengthen the system of free trade and competition within the national territory. The Government adds that if these freedoms are guaranteed it is logical to suppose that any act which offended them would call for sanction and, specifically, that in civil law their infringement would justify applying for an injunction in relief.
.Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Honduras, guarantees the right of workers' organisations to draw up their Constitutions and rules without any interference by the public authorities which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof, while Article  of the Convention provides that, while such organisations shall respect legality in exercising their rights, the law of the land shall not be such as to impair, nor shall it be so applied as to impair, the guarantees provided for in the Convention. The question at issue with regard to boycotts turns not so much on Article  as on Article  of the Convention because, although there is some doubt as to precisely which legal provisions render them unlawful, the Government maintains that boycotts-a particular aspect of strike action-are prohibited by the law of the land. If such prohibition does not constitute a violation of Article  of the Convention, clearly an organisation cannot claim the right, under Article , to provide for something in its rules which contravenes that prohibition.
.The Committee has always applied the principle that allegations relating to the right to strike are not outside its competence in so far as they affect the exercise of trade union rights. It has also pointed out that the right of workers and their organisations to strike as a legitimate means of defending their occupational interests is generally recognised.
.The evidence before the Committee relates to the legal prohibition of only one particular aspect of strike action-the boycott. The complainants themselves have made no direct reference to it at all. The Committee observes, however, that the question of boycotts, whether primary or secondary, has led to considerable divergency in the legislation of several countries in which, as in Honduras, strike action in the general sense of a stoppage of work is not as such illegal. The boycott, in other words, is a very special form of action which in some cases may involve a trade union whose members continue their work and are not directly involved in the dispute with the employer against whom the boycott is imposed. In such circumstances the prohibition of boycotts would not appear necessarily to involve an interference with trade union rights. In the absence of any evidence from the complainants in the present case as to the nature of the boycotts objected to by the Government as being illegal, the Committee considers that the complainants have furnished no proof that their legal prohibition involves an infringement of Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or, consequently, that any infringement of Article  of the Convention results from the refusal of the registering authorities to accept the provisions on this matter written into its Constitution by the complaining organisation.
.The two other reasons for which the Constitution and rules of the complaining organisation have not been accepted by the competent authorities involve questions of greater substance. The question at issue, as the Committee observed at its meeting in November , is whether the fact that the requirements of section  of the Labour Code with respect to special majority votes and quorums for the adoption of specific resolutions must be complied with in the Constitution and rules of a trade union in order for it to be granted legal personality are compatible with the said Convention No. . Article  of the Convention provides that the acquisition of legal personality by an organisation shall not be made subject to conditions of such a character as to restrict the application, among other things, of the provision in Article  of the Convention according to which workers' organisations shall have the right to draw up their Constitutions and rules without interference by the public authority.
.Section  of the Labour Code requires that, for the approval of union rules and",1,1964,Honduras
71,"the continuance of the trade union movement or its social or economic functions, irrespective of political changes in the country "". It would therefore seem that States should be able, without prohibiting in general terms political activities of occupational organisations, to entrust to the judicial authorities the task of repressing abuses which might, in certain cases, be committed by organisations which had lost sight of the fact that their fundamental objective should be "" the economic and social advancement "" of their members.
.In these circumstances, with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the attention of the Government to:(i) the importance of ensuring that persons employed in the service of the State should enjoy the right to establish trade unions and to register them with a view to their lawful operation, this principle being laid down in Article  of Convention No. , ratified by Honduras, which provides that workers, without distinction whatsoever, shall have the right to establish organisations of their own choosing without previous authorisation;(ii) the importance which it has always attached to the principle laid down in Article  of Convention No. , ratified by Honduras, stating that workers shall enjoy adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment, such protection applying more particularly in respect of acts calculated to cause the dismissal of or otherwise prejudice a worker by reason of union membership or because of participation in union activities;(iii) the fact that, in the light of the statement contained in the  resolution concerning the independence of the trade union movement and of the opinion expressed by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, it is not appropriate to prohibit all political activities by occupational organisations in general terms but that the judicial authorities should be entrusted with the task of repressing abuses which might, in certain cases, be committed by organisations which had lost sight of the fact that their fundamental objective should be "" the economic and social advancement "" of their members;(b) in accordance with the comments in paragraph  above and reaffirming the importance it attaches to ensuring that trade union members arrested for political offences or for offences under ordinary law should be tried within the shortest possible period by an impartial and independent judicial authority, to request the Government to make specific observations concerning the reasons for the arrest of Mr. Salinas Rivera, and his present situation;(c) to request the Government to send its observations concerning the reasons for the dismissal of Miss Marina Barnica, Mr. Salinas Rivera and Mr. Meja Castro;(d) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will report further to the Governing Body when it has received the information requested from the Government.Geneva,  May .

.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that the case as a whole does not call for further examination.",1,1964,Honduras
73,"of the State in accordance with the provisions of the Labour Code.
.In its reply dated  February  the Government states that officials and employees of the public administration are in a relationship sui generis and cannot be identified with private workers; the former are not in an ""employment relationship"" with the State, since the State is not an employer, but they have to be protected by a special system of "" guarantees "", since their relationship is governed by statutes and regulations drawn up by the State. The Government goes on to say that there is no civil service in Honduras and therefore no officials or employees of the State are covered by public servants' regulations, there are only de facto employees of the State who do not yet enjoy de jure guarantees. As de facto employees they enjoy the rights recognised by the Labour Code, subject to special conditions, and will be covered by the Civil Service Act soon to be promulgated. The Government states that SINASEPH has no legal personality for the reasons stated above and that its existence is therefore irregular and without validity within either the national or international sphere.
.With regard to the violation of freedom of association alleged to be practised by the authorities against the members of SINASEPH, the Government states that it must not be forgotten that purely political activities, such as participation in electoral campaigns, agitation and acts of violence and subversion, do not, either in Honduras or abroad, come within the scope of lawful activities such as may be pursued by duly established trade unions; in no case are such activities lawful for de facto groups like SINASEPH. The only security measures or legal sanctions adopted by the authorities are of an individual character and in no way general or collective against any union or group of persons. The Government further states that Mr. Aristides Mejia Castro, who signed the complaint dated  November  as President of SINASEPH, was relieved of his functions as a public official on  August  by decision of the Secretariat for Foreign Relations.
.The Committee observes that under existing legislation employees of the official services are entitled to establish trade unions. However, from the explanations provided by the Government, this right would seem to have been suspended, since state employees still do not enjoy the guarantees to which they should be entitled, since they are de facto employees in the absence of a regular civil service in Honduras. Until such time as the Civil Service Act comes into force, it wilt not be possible to reach a satisfactory solution concerning the status of officials and public servants. This is why the complainant organisation would not have been able to obtain legal personality, since its existence is unlawful according to the Government's statement.
.The Committee has stated on more than one occasion that the purpose of the procedure for the examination of cases where violation of freedom of association is alleged is to promote respect for trade union rights, both de jure and de facto, and that the workers' right freely to constitute organisations of their own choice cannot be considered to exist until such time as it is fully recognised and observed both de facto and de jure.
.In view of the allegations made by the complainants and of the statement by the Government concerning the difference between officials and public employees on the one hand and private employees on the other, with regard to the character of their employment relationship, the Committee considers that it must draw the Government's special attention to the provisions of Article  of Convention No. , which Honduras has ratified, stating that workers and employers, without distinction whatsoever and without previous authorisation, shall have the right to establish and join organisations of their own choosing.
.The Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has already pointed out that "" the principle of freedom of association might very often remain a dead letter if employers and workers were required to obtain any previous authorisation to enable them to establish an organisation, be it authorisation concerning the formation of the trade union organisation itself, need to obtain discretionary approval of the Constitution or rules of the organisation, or, again, authorisation for taking steps prior to establishment of the organisation "". This does not mean that the founders of an organisation are freed from the duty of observing formalities as to publicity or other similar formalities which may be prescribed by law. However, such requirements must not be such as to be equivalent in practice to previous authorisation, or as to constitute such an obstacle to the establishment of an organisation that they amount in practice to outright prohibition. Even in cases where registration is optional, if such registration confers on the organisation the basic rights enabling it to "" further and defend the interests "" of its members, the fact that the authority competent to effect registration has discretionary power to refuse this formality leads to a situation that is not very different from that in cases where previous authorisation is required.
.The present case relates to public officials who established a trade union and applied for it to be registered and granted legal personality with a view to normal operation within the framework of the law. However, although there were no major formal obstacles to registration, according to the outline of events submitted to the Committee, the authorities did not register the union, nor did they consequently grant it legal personality without which the organisation cannot lawfully exist. In these circumstances the Committee must expressly emphasise, as it has on other occasions, the importance of ensuring that persons employed in the service of the State should be guaranteed the right to establish trade unions and to register them with a view to their lawful operation.
.With regard to the allegations concerning the arrest of Mr. Salinas Rivera and his dismissal from the post he previously occupied in the public service, and the dismissal of Miss Barnica, the Government has not given any specific explanation, merely referring to certain purely political activities which could not be lawfully pursued by duly established trade unions, let alone de facto groups such as SINASEPH.
.The Committee recalls, in the first place, that on many occasions in the past, where allegations that trade union leaders or workers had been arrested or detained for trade union activities have been met by governments with statements that the arrests or detentions were made for subversive activities, for reasons of internal security or for common law crimes, it has followed the rule that the governments concerned should be requested to submit further and as precise information as possible concerning the arrests or detentions and the exact reasons therefor. If, in certain cases, the Committee has concluded that allegations relating to the arrests or detentions of trade union militants did not call for further examination, this has been after it has received information showing sufficiently precisely and with sufficient detail that the arrests or detentions were in no way occasioned by trade union activities but solely by activities outside the trade union sphere, which were either prejudicial to public order or of a political nature. In all cases where trade unionists have been arrested for political offences or for offences under ordinary law the Committee has insisted on the importance of ensuring that such persons should be tried within the shortest possible period by an impartial and independent judicial authority.
.In the second place the Committee has always attached great importance to the provisions of Article  of Convention No. , according to which workers shall enjoy adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment, such protection applying more particularly in respect of acts calculated to cause the dismissal of or otherwise prejudice a worker by reason of union membership or because of participation in union activities.
.With regard to the Government's statement that "" purely political activities, such as participation in electoral campaigns ... do not, either in Honduras or abroad, come within the scope of lawful activities such as may be pursued by duly established trade unions; in no case are such activities lawful for de facto groups like SINASEPH "", the Committee refers to the comments by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations in . That Committee stated that if trade unions are prohibited in general terms from engaging in any political activities this may raise difficulties by reason of the fact that the interpretation given to the relevant provisions in practice may change at any moment and considerably restrict the possibility of action of the organisations. In this connection the Committee of Experts thought it useful to refer to the resolution adopted by the International Labour Conference at its th Session (Geneva, ) in which it stated that when trade unions undertake or associate themselves with political action this action shall not be "" of such a nature as to compromise",1,1964,Honduras
74,"I.L.O by a communication dated  September .
.The essential findings of this judgment, handed down on  July  by the Military High Court, are that the crime defined by section  (IV) of Act No. /, for which Mr. Riani had been sentenced in first instance, cannot be considered to have been committed if the accused has not in fact carried out activities clearly and deliberately intended to change the political and social order of the nation; that nevertheless incitement of the masses to direct action with the use of violence, the instigation to paralyse the public services, the preparation of such paralysis, contribution to bringing it about, or orders issued to achieve this end are in themselves offences that must be punished as such; and lastly that the first-instance judgment is accordingly modified, that the legislative basis of the offences committed is corrected and that the sentence on Mr. Riani is reduced from  to seven years' rigorous imprisonment.
.More particularly, the court considered that Mr. Riani, who was both a member of Parliament and a trade union leader, had taken advantage of his position and of a "" period of abnormal conditions due to the system of government introduced by the ex-President "" to publicly advocate direct action and violence with a view to overthrowing the established political and social order, that he had incited the masses to abusive and criminal strike action with a view to paralysing the public utility services, and that he had devoted himself to intense and violent political propaganda in his speeches, at meetings, through trade union circulars and at trade union demonstrations.
.In the view of the court all these actions, although they had been carried out in preparation for the major crime defined in section  (IV) of Act No. / (see paragraph  above), for which Mr. Riani had been sentenced in first instance, could not be held to be a first step in committing this crime and could not, therefore, be punished as such. These actions were, however, offences in themselves, and it was for having committed them and confessed to them that Mr. Riani was sentenced by the court to seven years' imprisonment under section  of the Military Penal Code.
.It seems clear, both from the explanations furnished by the Government and from the texts of judgments in the possession of the Committee, that the grounds for the sentence incurred by Mr. Riani do not lie in his trade union activities in the real sense of the term but rather in political activities exceeding, in the view of the court, the limits of normal trade union activities. The Committee considers that it should not and cannot pronounce on this view reached by the court or on the sentence imposed by the tribunal in accordance with the view it had formed.
.With regard to the procedure followed, the Committee has noted that, according to the explanations furnished by the Government, the Brazilian military courts form an integral part of the judicial system, of which the Military High Court is the oldest organ, and that they offer certain guarantees, such as the right to defence. The Committee nevertheless considers that such a judicial system assumes a special character when its decisions are applied to a civilian.
.Moreover, while it is in any event the duty of the Committee and the Governing Body to seek to ensure that the exercise of trade union rights is not infringed, this duty becomes especially imperative where trade union leaders are involved who are also members or deputy members of the Governing Body and where the measures applied to them have prevented them from performing their functions as such. Although Mr. Riani no longer has that status, he was, nevertheless, when the events giving rise to this case took place, a deputy member of the Governing Body.
.It is for these reasons, having regard to the considerations set forth in the two preceding paragraphs, that the Committee recommends the Governing Body to request the Government to be good enough to keep it informed of any change that may occur in the situation of Mr. Riani.
.With regard to the case as a whole the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to request the Government to be good enough to keep it informed of the situation of the trade union leaders named by the World Federation of Trade Unions in its communication of  December  who have not been released and concerning whom the Government has already furnished certain information in its communications dated  June  and  May ;(b) to take note of the release of the trade union leaders mentioned by the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unionists in its communication dated  October ;(c) to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that the arrest or detention of trade unionists against whom no grounds for sentence can subsequently be proved or whose detention has in fact lasted longer than the term of imprisonment to which they have been sentenced is liable to entail restrictions of trade union rights;(d) to note that, following the announcement of the Public Prosecutor that he favoured a reduction of the term of  years' imprisonment imposed in the first instance on Mr. Riani to a term of ten years, the judgment rendered on  July  by the Military High Court of Brazil has reduced the sentence to a term of seven years' imprisonment;(e) to emphasise again the importance of ensuring that, where trade unionists are accused of political offences or common law crimes, they should receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment by an impartial and independent judicial authority, attended by all the guarantees of normal judicial procedure;(f) to request the Government to be good enough to keep it informed of any change in the situation of Mr. Riani;(g) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will report further to the Governing Body when it has received the additional information requested of the Government.
.This case has been the subject of four interim reports by the Committee, contained respectively in paragraphs  to  of its st Report,  to  of its rd Report,  to  of its th Report and  to  of its th Report.
.The reply of the Government forwarding the text of the judgment of the court of first instance having been received by the Office only on  May , the Committee decided to adjourn its examination of this text until its next meeting and recommends the Governing Body to take note of the information already furnished by the Government, to note that the Government has stated that it will forward the judgment of the appellate court when it has been given, to request the Government to be good enough to furnish also the information indicated in subparagraphs (c) and (d) of paragraph  of the th Report of the Committee, cited in paragraph  above, and to adjourn the examination of the case until the further information requested from the Government has been received.
.This case has been the subject of three interim reports by the Committee, contained respectively in paragraphs  to  of its st Report, in paragraphs  to  of its rd Report, and in paragraphs  to  of its th Report.
.The case raised two series of allegations: one relating to the placing of trade union organisations under control, and the other to measures taken against trade union leaders.
.With regard to the case as a whole the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note, with regard to the allegations relating to the placing of trade union organisations under control, that the procedures for elections in the organisations formerly under control have continued since the approval of the th Report of the Committee by the Governing Body and to request the Government to be good enough to continue to keep the Governing Body informed of further developments with regard to this matter;(b) with regard to the particular case of Mr. Riani:(i) to take note of the Government's statement that, by a judgment of the Tribunal for the Fourth Military Region dated  December , Mr. Riani was found guilty of subversion contrary to public order and sentenced to  years' rigorous imprisonment;(ii) to note the Government's statement that Mr. Riani has appealed against this decision to the Military High Court;(iii) to note the Government's statement that the Brazilian military courts, consisting of the Military High Court and its lower courts, are an integral part of the Brazilian judicial system, of which the Military High Court constitutes the oldest organ, and that Mr. Riani, therefore, was tried by an "" impartial and independent judicial authority "" within the meaning attached to that terminology by the Committee on Freedom of Association;(iv) to observe that the Government has not acceded to the request made to it to furnish detailed information on the case of Mr. Riani and, in particular, the texts of",0,1964,Brazil
75,"a fair trial at the earliest possible moment, considered that before it could submit its final recommendations on the case it needed to know whether the action taken against the persons named by the World Federation of Trade Unions (W.F.T.U.) was in implementation of a sentence and, if so, by what authority sentence was pronounced.,
.The Committee consequently recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to be so good as to furnish it with the additional information indicated above, and this recommendation was approved by the Governing Body. This request was made to the Government by a letter dated  March , and the Government replied by a communication dated  March .
.The Government's reply consists of an extract from the records of the Registry Civil Court in Port-au-Prince, according to which, since the investigation into the activities of the persons named by W.F.T.U had shown that there were "" sufficient charges and evidence against them "", the examining magistrate decided, on  January , "" to remand the accused to the court of competent jurisdiction "".
.In the past the Committee has always followed the practice of not proceeding to examine matters which were the subject of pending national judicial proceedings offering all the guarantees of normal judicial procedure, which seems to be the case in the present instance, where such proceedings might make available information of assistance to the Committee in appreciating whether or not allegations were well founded. In many cases, moreover, the Committee has asked governments to communicate the texts of the judgments given and the grounds therefor.
.Accordingly, in conformity with its normal practice, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to request the Government to be good enough to communicate the text of the judgment relating to the persons in question, when it has been given, together with the grounds therefor, and meanwhile to postpone examination of the case.
.This case already came before the Committee at its th Session in November . The case consisted of two sets of allegations: one relating to the dissolution of the Inter-Union Federation of Haiti (U.I.H.) and the other referring to the arrest of trade union leaders and officials. The Committee submitted its final conclusions to the Governing Body in regard to the first set of allegations in paragraphs  to  and  (a) of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ). With respect to the second set of allegations the Committee felt it necessary to seek further information from the Government before submitting its final conclusions to the Governing Body, and made a recommendation to this effect to the Governing Body, which approved it. The paragraphs which follow deal only with the matters which remain outstanding.
.The complainants allege that, parallel with the action taken to dissolve U.I.H, the Government arranged for the arbitrary arrest of a number of trade union leaders and officials. The persons arrested included Mr. Ulrick Joly, President of the Federation, Messrs. Claude Franois and Lon Gabriel, members of the Executive Committee and presidents, respectively, of the cement and sugar workers' unions, Messrs. Alcius Cadet and Arnold Maisoneuve, of the boat-breakers' union, and the union officials Messrs. Prossoir and Guerrior.
.Noting that in the various communications it had addressed to the I.L.O the Government had failed to furnish any observations on this aspect of the case, and bearing in mind the fact that specific allegations of a rather serious character had been made, the Committee recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to be good enough to furnish its observations in this connection)
.This request was conveyed to the Government by a letter from the Director-General dated  November , to which the Government replied by a communication dated  December .
.In its reply the Government states that the inquiry carried out by the Haitian police into the activities of the persons named by the World Federation of Trade Unions has shown that for some time past they had been engaging in subversive activities with a view to overthrowing the Constitutionally established rgime. To be more precise, these persons, officials of the Inter-Union Federation of Haiti, acting on orders from political groups abroad, were waging a terrorist campaign characterised in the main by acts of aggression against representatives of the State, as for instance at Fort - Libert, where the local civil authorities narrowly escaped an ambush prepared for them by the leaders of U.I.H.
.When it examined the case at its November  session the Committee observed that it was quite clear from the explanations furnished by the Government, as well as from the text of the judgment ordering the suspension of the activities of U.I.H appended to the Government's observations, that that organisation had been engaging in political activities outside the framework of normal trade union activities. It now appears from the explanations furnished by the Government in its communication of  December  that the leaders of the organisation whose activities have been suspended are individually guilty of illegal acts of a political and not a trade union nature.
.However, while it mentions a police inquiry in its reply, the Government does not specify whether the action taken against these persons was the outcome of court proceedings or not.
.In view of the importance which the Committee has always attached to the observance of adequate judicial safeguards in cases where trade unionists are accused of political offences or unlawful acts-including the right of all detained persons to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment -the Committee considers that, before it can submit its final conclusions on the case, it needs to know whether the action taken against the persons named by W.F.T.U was in implementation of a sentence, and if so, by what authority sentence was pronounced.
.It therefore recommends the Governing Body to request the Government to be good enough to furnish the additional information indicated above, and pending receipt thereof to postpone examination of the case.
.A first complaint relating to the incidents alleged to have occurred in this case was submitted to the I.L.O on  January  by the Committee for Trade Union Co-ordination of Workers of Latin America. The Committee on Freedom of Association examined this complaint at its th Session held in Geneva in June  and found it irreceivable because it emanated from an international organisation of workers not having consultative status with the I.L.O and not having affiliates in the country concerned; it therefore was not communicated to the Government concerned.
.However, the Government of its own accord forwarded to the I.L.O, by a communication dated  January , a comprehensive collection of documents relating to the situation in respect of which the allegations were made by the above-mentioned organisation.
.The World Federation of Trade Unions (W.F.T.U.) in turn submitted a complaint on the same subject, by a communication dated  April . As this complaint emanated from an international organisation of workers having consultative status with the I.L.O and was therefore receivable, it was communicated on  May  to the Government for observations so as to comply with the procedural requirements, even though observations had already been furnished by the Government, as it were, in advance.
.The Government submitted a new lot of observations by a communication dated  June .
.In the following paragraphs consideration will be given, on the one hand, to the allegations contained in the complaint of the W.F.T.U, the only one to be receivable, and, on the other hand, to the observations contained in the communications of the Government dated  January and  June  respectively.
.Haiti has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but it has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.With regard to the case as a whole the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to decide, for the reasons indicated in paragraphs  and  above, that the allegations relating to the dissolution of the Inter-Union Federation of Haiti do not call for further examination;(b) to request the Government to be good enough to furnish its observations on the allegations relating to the arrest of the trade union leaders and officials mentioned by name in the complaint of the W.F.T.U dated  April ;(c) to take note of the present interim report, on the understanding that the Committee will submit a further report when it has received the supplementary information referred to in subparagraph (b) above.",0,1964,Haiti
76,"circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the allegations relating to the control of trade union organisations and the statement of the Government that a return to a normal situation is in progress, to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that the placing of trade union organisations under control may, according to the circumstances, entail a serious danger of restricting the right of workers' organisations to elect their representatives in full freedom and to organise their administration and activities, to express the hope that the removal of all control of trade union organisations will therefore take place in the near future and to request the Government to be good enough to keep it informed of progress made in this direction;(b) with regard to the allegations relating to measures taken against trade union leaders, to emphasise to the Government the importance it attaches to the accused trade unionists being tried promptly, to request the Government to be good enough to furnish the text of the judgments given and of the reasons adduced therefor, and to decide in the meantime to adjourn its examination of this aspect of the case.",0,1964,Brazil
77,"in the previous paragraph.
.The Committee would also like to have the Government's observations on the allegations concerning restrictions on the exercise of the right to strike made in Part III of the W.F.T.U's complaint (see paragraphs  to  above) and in particular on the scope of the legislative provisions mentioned by the complainant.
.It therefore recommends the Governing Body to request the Government to be good enough to supply the information in question.
.The Committee further recommends the Governing Body to request the Government to be goad enough to forward its observations on the allegations to the effect that restrictions have been imposed on the exercise of the right to bargain collectively (see paragraphs  to  above), and to specify the interpretation which the Government considers would be given to the legislative provisions mentioned by the complainant.
.Lastly, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to request the Government to be good enough to forward its observations on the allegations concerning discriminatory measures taken against dock and railway workers (see paragraphs  to ), and the "" training "" of trade union leaders (see paragraph  above).
.As regards the case as a whole the Committee accordingly recommends the Governing Body:(a) to request the Government to be good enough to furnish the information referred to in paragraphs  to ; and(b) to postpone its examination of the case until it is in possession of this information.
.This case has already been the subject of five interim reports by the Committee, contained in paragraphs  to  of its st Report,  to  of its rd Report,  to  of its th Report,  to  of its th Report and  to  of its th Report.
.The only part of the complaints still unsettled has two aspects: a general aspect dealing with the arrest or sentencing of trade union leaders and a specific aspect dealing with the case of Mr. Riani.
.With regard to the first aspect, two series of allegations have been made: one by the World Federation of Trade Unions to the effect that  trade union leaders had been arrested and the other by the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unionists to the effect that four trade union leaders had been sentenced to long terms of imprisonment (,  and ten years).
.With regard to the allegations of the World Federation of Trade Unions the Committee took note of the information furnished by the Government to the effect that, of the  trade union leaders named by W.F.T.U,  had been released without having had any charge brought against them,  were the subject of an inquiry but remained at liberty, nine were abroad, four had fled and three were in custody awaiting trial.
.The Committee therefore recommended the Governing Body to take note of the information furnished by the Government and to request the Government to be good enough to keep it informed of further developments regarding the persons concerned and, in particular, to furnish the texts of any judgments handed down and of the reasons adduced therein.
.In the various communications that it has since addressed to the I.L.O, the Government refers to the case of only one of the persons mentioned by W.F.T.U, namely Mr. Ziller, Vice-President of the National Confederation of Bank Employees (C.O.N.T.E.C.) and a member of the Executive Committee of W.F.T.U. The Government states that, since he has fled, he has been sentenced in his absence to  years' imprisonment, and encloses the text of the judgment handed down by the military tribunal of Belo Horizonte, which shows that he has been found guilty of crimes against national security.
.The Committee therefore recommends the Governing Body to request the Government to be good enough to keep it informed of the situation of the other trade union leaders named by W.F.T.U in its communication of  December  and not yet released, about whom the Government has already furnished certain information in its communication of  June .
.With regard to the allegations of the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unionists concerning the sentencing of the trade union leaders Antonio Faria Lopez, Fausto Drumond, Jos Boggione and Alberto Josh dos Santos, the Committee took note of the information furnished by the Government to the effect that the military tribunal of Belo Horizonte had tried these persons for crimes against national security and sentenced them to various terms of imprisonment. Having also noted, from the Government's information, that the accused had appealed to the Military High Court, the Committee recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to communicate to it the texts of the judgments of the court of first instance and of the appellate court.
.In a communication dated  May , the Government sent the Office the text of the first-instance judgment on the four trade union leaders referred to in the previous paragraph. Under this judgment Mr. Faria Lopez has been sentenced to  years' imprisonment, Mr. Drumond to  years' imprisonment, Mr. Boggione to  years' imprisonment and Mr dos Santos to ten years' imprisonment, all four for having attempted, with the material and financial aid of a foreign State or a foreign or international organisation, to overthrow the political and social order established by the Constitution.
.In another communication, dated  June , the Government stated that on appeal, the sentences of Mr. Faria Lopez, Mr. Drumond and Mr. Boggione had been reduced to one year by the Military High Court and that, having already served this term, these three persons had been released. Mr. dos Santos had been acquitted by the same tribunal on appeal and had also been released.
.Although the Government has not supplied the text of the appeal judgment referred to above, as it had been requested to do, the Committee considers that since the four trade union leaders involved are now at liberty, there would be no point in its pursuing the examination of this aspect of the case.
.Nevertheless, before recommending the Governing Body to take note of the release of the persons concerned, the Committee observes that one of them has been found innocent by the appeal court and that the other three have had their sentences reduced very considerably.
.In this connection the Committee wishes to recall that, in several earlier cases', it has pointed out that the detention by the authorities of trade unionists against whom no grounds for sentence can subsequently be proved is liable to impose restrictions on trade union rights. The case of Mr dos Santos provides an illustration of this situation. In the three other cases the reduction to one year of sentences originally set at  years for one of the persons concerned and  for the other two shows very clearly that the charges finally brought against them have no relation to those on which the original sentences were based. When it is realised that the arrest of the four persons concerned goes back to the month of March  and that the appeal judgment was handed down on  June , it is evident that detention prolonged in this way can impose restrictions on trade union rights.
.The Committee therefore recommends the Governing Body to take note of the release of the trade union leaders mentioned by the Latin American Confederation of Christian Trade Unionists but to point out to the Government that the arrest or detention of trade unionists against whom no grounds for sentence can subsequently be proved or whose detention has in fact lasted longer than the term of imprisonment to which they have been sentenced is liable to impose restrictions on trade union rights.
.It will be recalled that the particular case of Mr. Riani had two aspects. Firstly, as Mr. Riani was a trade union leader and measures had been taken against him, the Committee and the Governing Body had to determine whether his case involved an infringement of trade union rights. Secondly, a special question arose by reason of the fact that, at the time when the events giving rise to the complaint took place, Mr. Riani was a deputy member of the I.L.O. Governing Body and the measures taken against him prevented him from performing his functions in that capacity.
.As regards the second point, the Committee has already formulated its comments, which have been approved by the Governing Body.
.With regard to the first point, the position was that Mr. Riani had been sentenced to  years' rigorous imprisonment by the Tribunal of Military Justice of the Fourth Military Region for subversion contrary to public order. The Committee noted at its May  session that the Government had furnished the text of the judgment handed down by the said court, and that Mr. Riani had appealed. The Public Prosecutor had announced that he favoured a partial revision of the judgment and a sentence of ten years' rigorous imprisonment instead of one of  years. The Government had stated that it intended to furnish the text of the appeal judgment. This text was sent by the Government to the",0,1964,Brazil
78," of its th Report. All the foregoing were approved by the Governing Body.
.Following its latest examination of the case in May , the Committee first of all recommended the Governing Body, as it had done on a previous occasion, to ask the Brazilian Government to keep it informed of the situation of the trade union leaders named by the W.F.T.U in its communication of  December  who had not been released. The Committee pointed out that the Government had already given some information about those persons in its communications of  June  and  May .
.The Committee then recommended the Governing Body to ask the Government to send its observations on several allegations made by the W.F.T.U in a communication dated  November . These were analysed in detail by the Committee in paragraphs  to  of its th Report.
.The above two requests for information were transmitted to the Government by letter dated  June . The Government replied in a communication dated  January .
.With regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to decide, for the reasons set out in paragraphs  to ,  to ,  to ,  to ,  to  and  to  of the present report, that the allegations analysed in those paragraphs do not call for further examination on its part;(b) as regards the allegations relating to the arrest and sentencing of trade union militants, trade union leaders and workers, to go on record deploring the Government's failure to co-operate in elucidation of the facts on this aspect of the case by providing, as requested, evidence in support of its assertion that the reasons for the conviction of the persons in question did not lie in their trade union membership or activity, since that failure makes it impossible for the Committee on Freedom of Association and the Governing Body to reach informed conclusions on this aspect of the case;(c) as regards the allegations relating to the "" training "" of trade union leaders, to express the opinion that, while trade union training deserves encouragement, it is for the unions themselves to take charge of such training, which can of course take advantage of any material or moral assistance which the Government may offer to them;(d) as regards the allegations of restrictions on the exercise of the right to strike, since allegations respecting the right to strike lie within the Committee's competence in so far as they affect the exercise of trade union rights, to ask the Government to be good enough to provide it with information of the character indicated in paragraphs  and  above, as well as any other information which the Government may think fit to provide regarding the allegations analysed in paragraphs  to  of the Committee's th Report;(e) to ask the Government to be good enough to send its observations on the allegation that the Bank Employees' Union of the State of Guanabara has been forbidden to hold its elections, and on the allegations of abuses by certain "" controllers "" appointed to supervise trade unions;(f) to take note of the present interim report, on the understanding that the Committee will report again when it has received the additional information to which reference is made in subparagraphs (d) and (e) above.
.This case has already been the subject of six interim reports by the Committee contained in paragraphs  to  of its st Report,  to  of its rd Report,  to  of its th Report,  to  of its th Report,  to  of its th Report and  to  of its rd Report.
.Following its last examination of this case, the Committee put forward its final conclusions regarding most of the elements in the case. Only one allegation remained in suspense, and the Governing Body, on the Committee's recommendation, requested the Government to be so kind as to keep it informed of the situation of the trade union leaders who had not been freed who were mentioned by name by the World Federation of Trade Unions in its communication of  December  and regarding whom the Governing Body noted that the Government had already supplied certain information in its communications of  June  and  May .
.As approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ), the Committee's conclusions were brought to the notice of the Government by a letter dated  November , in particular the request for additional information mentioned in the previous paragraph.
.Since then, in a communication dated  November , received on  December , the World Federation of Trade Unions made a series of new allegations of which some revert to aspects of the case already dealt with by the Committee whereas others represent new factors. The text of these allegations has been transmitted to the Government for its observations in a letter dated  December .
.In its last communication the W.F.T.U first of all recalls that, in April and December , it submitted complaints protesting against the measures taken by the Brazilian Government after the "" military coup d'tat "" of April , quoting allegations regarding imprisonment without judicial warrant of trade union leaders and militants, torture inflicted on victims of repression, the sacking of trade union premises and, in general, the basing of relations between the Government and the workers on terror.
.The W.F.T.U goes on to affirm that the two years which followed the change of rgime merely confirmed the obvious intention of the authorities to do away with even the appearance of trade union freedoms and democratic rights. The complainant contends that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Brazilian Constitution of  and the ordinary laws have become a dead letter.
.The complainant then makes a series of specific allegations which will be examined separately in the paragraphs which follow.
.As the Government has not replied to this request the Committee recommends the Governing Body to repeat it.
.In its communication dated  November  (eighth paragraph of Part I of its complaint) the W.F.T.U lists  trade unionists alleged to have been arrested and sentenced to various terms of imprisonment (see paragraph  above).
.These individuals include Mr. Riani, Mr. Ziller, Mr. Drumond, Mr. Boggione, Mr dos Santos and Mr. Farias Lopes, whose cases have already been examined by the Committee. Other names quoted by the W.F.T.U in its complaint of  November  had been mentioned by it earlier in its communication dated  December .
.Nevertheless, the names of ten convicted persons appear for the first time, viz. Mr. Ireneu Semionato, Mr. Joao Firmino Luzia, Mr. Antonio Chamorro, Mr. Alfonso Delelis, Mr. Jos Araujo Placido, Mr. Arthur Avalone, Mr. Augusto Vicente, Mr. Jos Molinidio, Mr. Luis Firmino Lima and Mr. Manuel Loureno. The Committee would like to have the Government's observations on these cases and, in particular, would like to know the reasons why these individuals were arrested and sentenced to terms of imprisonment. It therefore recommends the Governing Body to request the Government to be good enough to supply it with this information.
.The Committee likewise recommends the Governing Body to request the Government to be good enough to forward its observations on the allegations made by the W.F.T.U to the effect that  miners of Morro Velho, also listed by name (see th paragraph of Part I of the W.F.T.U's communication and paragraph  above), were threatened with trial by military courts for going on strike; that  workers listed by name at the National Motor Factory were being kept in preventive custody pending trial by a military court for going on strike (see th and th paragraphs of Part I of the W.F.T.U's communication and paragraph  above); and that  workers at the Ishikawagi plant, some of them also listed by name, had similarly been threatened with trial by a military court for taking part in a strike (see st paragraph of Part I of the W.F.T.U's communication and paragraph  above).
.As regards the allegations made by the W.F.T.U in Part II of its complaint, the Committee would like to have the Government's observations on the following points: the allegation concerning an ""ideological attestation"" which according to the complainants is required from candidates for election to trade union office (see paragraphs  to  above); the allegation regarding the prohibition on the holding of trade union elections by the Bank Employees' Union of the State of Guanabara (see paragraph  above), the allegation regarding the suspension and threat of dissolution of the Brazilian Dockworkers' Union (see paragraph  above); the allegation regarding the presence of members of the Political Police at trade union meetings (see paragraph  above); and the allegation regarding the abuses committed by some of the "" controllers "" appointed to supervise the trade unions (see paragraph  above).
.The Committee accordingly recommends the Governing Body to request the Government to be good enough to forward its observations on the points mentioned",0,1964,Brazil
79,"of the trade unions concerned but by the administrative authority and not, it would seem, because of infringement of specific provisions of the trade union rules or of the law, but because the said administrative authorities had considered these trade union leaders unsuitable to maintain "" discipline "" in their unions. Measures of this kind appear obviously incompatible with the principle that trade union organisations have the right to elect their representatives freely and to organise their administration and activities.
.Furthermore, as regards the allegations concerning "" ideological attestations "", the Committee recalls that at its February  Session , when examining certain allegations according to which an "" ideological attestation "" was required from candidates for posts as trade union officials, the Committee had before it observations supplied by the Government according to which the requirement of an ideological attestation had been abolished by Brazilian legislation. In these circumstances the Committee considered that there would be no point in pursuing its examination of this aspect of the case.
.In its observations, the Government now refers to Ministerial Instruction No.  of  January , whose section , clause (e), requires candidates to make a written statement promising to observe faithfully the Constitution and the law, and to respect the constituted authorities and comply with their decisions. Furthermore, under clause (f) of the same section, candidates are required to supply an attestation that they are of good previous character and entitled to full political rights.
.The Committee has always considered that it was not competent to examine allegations of a purely political nature, but it has also considered that it should examine measures of a political nature taken by governments in so far as they may indirectly affect the exercise of trade union rights. In the case of the regulations quoted by the Government, which are expressly applied to the election of trade union leaders, it is evident that a person who has been deprived of his political rights cannot be elected to trade union office. Consequently the Committee considers that it would be desirable to know the reasons for which, in accordance with the legislation of the country, persons may be deprived of their political rights and whether there is any possibility of appeal against measures of this kind.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the Government's attention to the importance of the generally recognised principle that workers' organisations should have the right to elect their representatives freely and to organise their administration and activities, and that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof;(b) to draw the attention of the Government also to the fact that when the internal acts of trade unions infringe legislative provisions or trade union rules, it is of the utmost importance that, in order to guarantee an impartial and objective procedure, control should be exercised by the relevant judicial authority;(c) to request the Government to supply the supplementary information referred to in paragraph  above.
.With regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the new allegations made in this case on restrictions of the right to strike, in view of the fact that allegations concerning the right to strike are within the competence of the Committee in so far as they affect the exercise of trade union rights, and subject to the considerations contained in paragraph  above, to decide that this aspect of the case calls for no further examination on its part;(b) as regards the allegations concerning restrictions on the right to bargain collectively, to request the Government to supply further information as to the number of collective contracts that have come into force without any amendment of the clauses concerning wages, and the number of cases where the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare or the labour courts have declared such clauses null and void or ordered their amendment, indicating the grounds on which these decisions have been based;(c) as regards the allegations concerning restrictions on the right to elect trade union representatives freely:(i) to draw the Government's attention to the importance of the generally recognised principle that workers' organisations should have the right to elect their representatives freely and to organise their administration and activities, and that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof;(ii) to draw the Government's attention also to the fact that when the internal acts of trade unions infringe legislative provisions or trade union rules, it is of the utmost importance that, in order to guarantee an impartial and objective procedure, control should be exercised by the relevant judicial authority;(iii) to request the Government to indicate the reasons for which, under the legislation of the country, persons may be deprived of their political rights (a penalty which prevents such persons from being candidates in trade union elections), and whether there is any possibility of appeal against such measures;(d) to take note of this interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report as soon as it has received the supplementary information requested from the Government in subparagraphs (b) and (c) (iii) of this paragraph.
.This case has already been the subject of eight interim reports by the Committee, appearing in paragraphs  to  of its st Report, paragraphs  to  of its rd Report, paragraphs  to  of its th Report, paragraphs  to  of its th Report, paragraphs  to  of its th Report, paragraphs  to  of its rd Report, paragraphs  to  of its th Report, and paragraphs  to  of its rd Report. All these reports have been approved by the Governing Body.
.The Committee last considered this matter at its session in February , after which no more than three series of allegations remained outstanding, all the others having been the subject of final conclusions by the Committee. The following paragraphs will be devoted entirely to these three series of allegations. They are allegations concerning restrictions on the right to strike, a ban on trade union elections by the Bank Employees' Union of the State of Guanabara, and abuses of which "" controllers "" appointed to supervise union affairs are said to have been guilty.
.In connection with each of these three series of allegations, the Committee and, later, the Governing Body have requested the Government to furnish its observations or further information. The Government was informed of these requests by a letter dated  March  and replied in a communication dated  April .
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body, with regard to the case as a whole:(a) to decide, while expressing its concern as to the fact that there are still organisations subject to supervision, that for the reasons set forth in paragraph  above there is no point in further consideration of the alleged ban on elections by the Bank Employees' Union of the State of Guanabara;(b) as regards alleged abuses by "" controllers "" appointed to manage trade union affairs:(i) to urge the Government to ensure that the relevant legislation is strictly applied in the event of abuse by persons responsible for the affairs of trade unions subject to supervision;(ii) subject to this reservation, to decide that this aspect of the case calls for no further consideration;(c) as regards the restrictions alleged to have been put on the right to strike, bearing in mind the principle that allegations concerning this right, in so far as they relate to freedom of association, can properly be considered by the Committee:(i) to recall the importance of the principle that unions must be entitled to meet, without let or hindrance, in their own premises, without prior authorisation and free from any official supervision;(ii) to invite the Government, for the reasons set forth in paragraphs  and  above, to consider amending its legislation with an eye to eliminating that clause in section  of Act No.  of  which makes it possible for the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare to be represented in trade union plenary meetings by a delegate entitled to take the floor;(iii) to express the view that section  of Act No.  of , mentioned in paragraph  above, which has the effect of preventing strike action after the tribunal has given its judgment, does not seem to offer the guarantees necessary for it not to limit seriously the possibilities of action of organisations in the defence and promotion of the interests of their members.
.This case has already been the subject of seven interim reports by the Committee, contained in paragraphs  to  of its st Report, paragraphs  to  of its rd Report, paragraphs  to  of its th Report, paragraphs  to  of its th Report, paragraphs  to  of its th Report, paragraphs  to  of its rd Report and paragraphs  to",1,1964,Brazil
80,"previous allegations, already examined by the Committee, concerning the ideological attestation said to be required of trade union leaders. At that time-states the complainant organisation-the Director-General of the National Labour Department categorically denied such allegations, which prevented the Committee on Freedom of Association from making a more thorough examination of this question. The WFTU repeats that trade unions do not have the right to elect their representatives freely. More specifically, it states that since Ministerial Instruction No.  was issued by the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare on  February , no doubt has remained as to the requirement of an ideological attestation in order to be elected to posts of trade union leadership or even to retain trade union office. The leaders of many organisations, who had been elected and were carrying out their functions, have been deprived by the authorities of their rights and accused of not being fit to guarantee discipline within the trade union organisations in accordance with the social order in force.
.In the introductory part of the Ministerial Instruction quoted by the complainants, it is stated, among other considerations, that Institutional Act No.  of  December  provides for the adoption of measures to ensure order, security, peace and political and social harmony within the country; that trade union organisations play an important part in the pursuit of these objectives since, by their very nature, they co-operate with the authorities; that for this reason and by virtue of their ultimate objective, trade union organisations should have different leaders and representatives from those who, although elected and holding office, do not fulfil the necessary conditions to guarantee internal discipline in accordance with the social order in force and that it is the duty of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare to ensure that law and order are maintained so that a satisfactory solution may be found to the problems in the field of trade union activities. The operative part contains a decision to relieve of their functions the regular and substitute members of the bureau, and of the managing and representative bodies of twenty trade unions. In the case of three of these unions (Union of Petroleum Extraction Workers, State of Bahia; the Union of Building and Furnishing Workers of Maring, State of Paran; and the Union of Workers in the Metallurgical, Metalworking and Electrical Engineering Industries of Maring, State of Paran), the Ministerial Instruction does not name the persons relieved of their functions; as regards the other unions, the names of one or more persons are given.
.In its observations, the Government gives a comprehensive explanation, of a general nature, in which it states that there are no restrictions on trade union elections and that the removal from office of trade union leaders or of a union executive by means of government intervention has been provided for by law for more than twenty-five years. The Government adds that this occurs when such leaders, taking advantage of their position, mismanage the union funds or commit acts constituting a threat to the security of the nation or of any group, thus misusing the prerogatives conferred upon them by the Constitution of the country or by the Consolidation of Labour Laws. The Government mentions various provisions of national legislation concerning the exercise of the right to associate, freedom of expression, etc., and restrictions on the exercise thereof. It also quotes a number of judgments pronounced by Brazilian labour courts, stating that these courts "" have repeatedly proclaimed to be Constitutional the provisions of the Consolidation relating to the organisation and functioning of industrial associations, as well as insisting upon the legitimacy of state intervention as practised by the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare whenever such associations have disregarded or infringed the provisions of the Constitution or of the law by which they are bound "".
.As regards the Ministerial Instruction of  February , the Government states that the preamble of the Instruction itself gives the reasons for the removal from office of "" an insignificant number "" of trade union leaders; furthermore there was no intervention, but replacement by lawfully appointed substitutes, in view of the fact that it is the duty of the Brazilian authorities to ensure that calm, social peace and order are maintained in industrial associations, so that the problems of the working class can be tackled and settled. The goal of the agitators and subversive elements is exactly the opposite: to prevent these problems from being settled in order to undermine the foundations of social peace in Brazil, so as to discredit the public authorities and create unrest throughout the country.
.According to the Government, the accusation relating to an ideological attestation is unfounded. The provisions of the relevant text of ordinary legislation, Ministerial Instruction No.  of  January , are as follows so far as the requirements to be met by candidates are concerned:Section . An application for the registration of a list of candidates may be made by any of the candidates on the said list; it must be submitted in triplicate to the president in office.Paragraph . The application must be accompanied by the following information and documents with respect to each candidate:(a) full name, parentage, state of origin (in Brazil), marital status and address;(b) social security registration number;(c) name of the establishment or undertaking in which he carries out his occupation or activity, if he is an employee or an employer;(d) documentary evidence as to the length of time he has been carrying on his activity or occupation and information as to the length of time he has been a member of the industrial association in question, calculated in both cases up to the date of the poll;(e) a handwritten statement by each of the persons on the list (the handwriting and the signatures being certified to be theirs) promising to observe faithfully the Federal Constitution and the laws of the country and to respect the duly constituted authorities and comply with their decisions;(f) an attestation that they are of good previous character and entitled to full political rights..The Committee has already examined, in previous stages of this same case, the question of the principle concerning government control of trade union organisations. At its February  Session, after examining certain allegations concerning the control of a number of trade union organisations' and the Government's observations on a return to a normal situation, the Committee recommended the Governing Body, inter alia, to draw the Government's attention to the fact that the placing of trade union organisations under control entails a serious danger of restricting the rights of workers' organisations to elect their representatives and to organise their administration and activities. In these circumstances, the Committee does not consider it necessary to re-examine this question of principle.

In these circumstances, the Committee does not consider it necessary to re-examine this question of principle.
.With regard to the allegations concerning the Ministerial Instruction of  February , the Government does not dispute the authenticity of the text supplied by the complain ants and apparently confirms it. It appears, from the Government's observations, that the removal from office of trade union leaders, which affected twenty trade unions, did not involve the procedure of government control referred to previously by the Committee, but, according to the Government, resulted from the duty of the authorities to maintain calm, social peace and order within industrial associations.
.In other previous cases, the Committee has expressed the view that removal from trade union office by an administrative authority is a procedure which might give rise to abuses or to infringement of the generally recognised right of organisations to elect their representatives in full freedom and to organise their administration and activities. This principle is embodied in Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), which also provides that the public authorities shall refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof. Moreover, in connection with the control of the internal acts of a trade union, if such acts infringe legislative provisions or trade union rules, the Committee has considered that "" it is of maximum importance that, in order to guarantee an impartial and objective procedure, control should be exercised by the relevant judicial authority"".
.In the present case the trade union leaders were removed from office not by the decision of members",-1,1964,Brazil
81,"to strike as a legitimate means of defending their occupational interests is generally recognised. Nevertheless, in various cases the Committee has declined to examine allegations concerning strikes that were not of an occupational character or which were intended to coerce the government on a political question.
.Assuming that the penalty mentioned by the Government or similar penalties apply or may be applied to any strike declared solely in order to promote or defend the workers' occupational interests, such a situation would be contrary to the generally recognised principle referred to in the preceding paragraph. The Committee can only observe in this respect that this is not proved by the scant evidence contained in the allegations in question or in the text of section  of the Legislative Decree of  referred to by the Government.
.Subject to the considerations expressed in paragraph  above, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that this aspect of the case calls for no further examination on its part.Allegations concerning Restrictions on the Right to Bargain Collectively
.The WFTU alleges that the subordination of the judiciary to the executive as a result of the suspension of the safeguards of judges' independence under Institutional Act No. , has turned the labour courts into bodies for supervising the application of the wage ceilings fixed by the Government. It adds that, contrary to a statement previously made to the Committee on Freedom of Association, referred to in paragraph  of the rd Report, serious restrictions are placed on the right to negotiate in Brazil. The WFTU gives as an example the case of workers in the sugar and textile industries of Sao Paolo (December ) who had obtained a  per cent wage rise, only to have it reduced to  per cent by the Higher Labour Court (TST) because the initial percentage exceeded the ceiling fixed by the Government.
.The Government states that Act No.  is in no way connected with wage policy or labour courts. The policy concerning wage readjustments is defined in Act No.  of , which is designed to keep new wages at the level of average real wages over the past twenty-four months, plus the prescribed increment to offset inflation and an additional sum based on the rise in productivity. The Government has also ordered the review of previous wages adjustments.
.Furthermore the Government states that collective agreements are reached between industrial associations in the economic and occupational categories whenever, under the terms of the law, it is in their mutual interest to establish new conditions of work for the entire category represented. Collective contracts, on the other hand, are signed between the trade union for an occupational category and an undertaking, with a view to establishing new conditions valid only within that undertaking and for a specified period not exceeding two years. Brazil is one of the first States to have embodied in one legislative text the advantages conferred upon workers. This explains the restrictions upon the right to conclude collective agreements, which are used only in very special cases. The Government says, nevertheless, that collective contracts exist in many branches of activity, particularly in commerce.
.The Government states that a reduction may be made in a wage increase only when, under the procedure laid down for labour justice, the court of first instance has awarded, without any justification, a percentage increase higher than the ceiling fixed by the official body responsible for orienting the Government's wage policy. Brazil has had a positive policy in this respect for more than twenty years: not only must a conciliation phase take place before a wage increase is submitted for consideration to the judicial authorities concerned with labour questions, but the increase must be tied to the indices showing the rise in consumer prices (rise in the cost of living) as compiled by a specialised body after a survey. There is nothing to prevent workers and employers, through their representative organisations, from agreeing upon increases in excess of the rate fixed, provided that the agreement is approved by the judicial authorities concerned with labour questions or recognised by the official bodies and that the increases will not lead to a rise in the prices of goods or services.
.The Committee notes that the new allegations, based on concrete examples, made by the WFTU refer to the ceiling imposed on wage increases that may be granted under collective contracts. These allegations, and the Government's observations, reveal that trade unions can and do bargain with employers over wages, and also that the law provides that wage increases may not exceed the ceilings established by the Government; according to the latter this system has been applied in the country for many years. The Government also states that in determining wage adjustments, account is taken of factors such as the cost of living, inflation, productivity increases and the possible impact on prices.
.It should be pointed out, firstly that the restriction thus imposed on collective bargaining and the powers consequently conferred on the government authorities and labour courts appear to apply only to the provisions relating to wages, and that the notions of "" approval by the labour courts "" and "" recognition by official bodies "" do not seem to apply to the other matters covered by the contract. The former text of section  of the Consolidation of Labour Laws seemed to establish a requirement equivalent to previous authorisation for a collective contract to come into force in its entirety, since it was required to be approved by the competent authority and since, as pointed out by one writer, the Minister could refuse his approval, thus leaving the contract without legal validity. The same writer points out that this problem was overcome when Legislative Decree No.  of  February  came into force because since then, for the contract to become valid, the parties have had to send a copy to the Ministry of Labour and the instrument has come into force three days after being deposited with the Ministry. The new wording of Title VI of the Consolidation of Labour Laws (section ) embodies this amendment of  and provides that the purpose of depositing contracts is "" for registration and filing "".
.A study of section  of the Consolidation of Labour Laws reveals that any provision in a collective agreement or collective contract which directly or indirectly conflicts with any ban or rule forming part of the Government's economic and financial policy, or the wage policy currently in force, shall be null and void and not be capable of enforcement before any public authority or government department; the fact that the provision is null and void shall be declared, either automatically or on application by any party concerned, by the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare or by a labour court in proceedings brought before it. Section  provides that the validity of any clause increasing or adjusting wage rates shall, if it implies any increase in the prices or rates controlled by any public authority or government department, be subject to prior consideration by such authority or department and to an explicit statement on its part as regards the possibility of increasing the prices or rates concerned.
.The Committee considers it necessary to recall that, under the terms of Article  of Convention No. , ratified by Brazil, "" measures appropriate to national conditions shall be taken, where necessary, to encourage and promote the full development and utilisation of machinery for voluntary negotiation between employers or employers' organisations and workers' organisations, with a view to the regulation of terms and conditions of employment by means of collective agreements "". In various cases in the past the Committee has emphasised that the right of workers' organisations to bargain freely with employers with respect to conditions of work constitutes an essential element in freedom of association, and that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which might restrict the trade unions' right to seek, through collective bargaining or other lawful means, to improve the living and working conditions of those whom the trade unions represent, or impede the lawful exercise of this right.
.In the present case it may be understood from the Government's observations that, when justifiable grounds exist, agreements between organisations representing workers and employers respectively may, in certain circumstances, provide for increases in excess of the rates fixed.
.In these circumstances, with a view to continuing its examination of this aspect of the case in full knowledge of the facts, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to request the Government to supply further information on the number of collective contracts that have come into force without changes in the clauses concerning wages, and the number of cases in which the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare or the labour courts have declared such clauses to be null and void, or ordered their amendment, indicating the grounds on which such decisions have been based.Allegations concerning Restrictions on the Right to Elect Trade Union Representatives Freely
.The WFTU refers to its",0,1964,Brazil
82,".On the last occasion when the Committee submitted an interim report on this case to the Governing Body, it had reached its final conclusions on certain allegations concerning restrictions on the exercise of the right to strike which had been submitted by the World Federation of Trade Unions in a communication dated  May .
.As regards the outstanding allegations concerning restrictions on the right to bargain collectively and the right to elect trade union representatives freely, the Committee had recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to provide supplementary information (th Report, paragraph  (b) and (c) (iii)). In a communication dated  October  the Government supplied certain further information on the outstanding aspects of the case.
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In all these circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the allegations concerning restrictions on the right to bargain collectively, to draw the attention of the Government to the considerations set forth in paragraph  above, and to request the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to keep the matter under review in its examination of reports supplied periodically under article  of the Constitution of the ILO;(b) with regard to the allegations concerning restrictions on the right to elect trade union representatives freely, to point out to the Government the fact that any interference by the authorities in the right of workers' organisations freely to elect their representatives, to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes would be incompatible with the principles of freedom of association and that Institutional Act No.  of  should not be applied in such a manner as to infringe those principles.
.The Committee has already made nine reports on this case to the Governing Body, all of which have been approved by the latter.
.On the last occasion when the Committee examined the case, at its May  Session, it submitted to the Governing Body, in paragraphs - of its th Report, its final conclusions on three series of allegations which had remained outstanding.
.Nevertheless, in a communication dated  May , the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) presented fresh allegations. The text of this communication was passed on to the Government, which sent its observations on the matter in a communication dated  November .
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations now presented by the WFTU are connected with other former allegations already examined in this case in respect of strikes, collective bargaining and the election of trade union leaders. The Committee has already submitted to the Governing Body its conclusions on these previous allegations but the WFTU states that "" the situation in Brazil in the early months of  "" differed from that prevailing at the time when it lodged its complaint in . The WFTU states that there has been a further outbreak of repression against the trade union organisations.
.In various earlier cases the Committee considered that it could not reopen a case which it had already examined in substance and on which it had submitted final recommendations to the Governing Body, except where new evidence was produced and brought to its notice)
.In the present case the Committee is examining the new evidence submitted by the complainants in respect of which the Government has furnished its observations.Allegations concerning Restrictions on the Exercise of the Right to Strike
.In their communication of  May , the complainants state that "" the new wording of the National Security Act "" puts strikes into the category of acts against the security of the State, which means that workers who have recourse to a strike can be accused of an offence which comes under the jurisdiction of a military court.
.In its observations of  November , the Government points out that the right to strike is embodied in article , clause , of the Federal Constitution, with the exception, as provided in article , paragraph , of the ban on strikes in the public services and in essential activities, as defined by law. The Government states that restrictions of this type appear in the legislation of many countries and it goes on to quote the text of various sections of Act No. , of , whereby the above-mentioned Constitutional right is regulated.
.The Government refers to a statement made in  by the Ministry of Labour and to certain provisions of sections  and  of the Consolidation of Labour Laws in respect of the lawful purposes and conditions for the operation of industrial associations. It goes on to add: "" It follows that a Brazilian industrial association may represent occupational or economic interests but never party political, philosophical or religious interests. In consequence the autonomy of an industrial association has to be exercised within the framework of the law, which sets the bounds beyond which an industrial association may not go if it is to keep within its terms of reference and abide by its aims. This means that freedom of association, or any other freedom accorded to groups or citizens, must not be confused with sovereignty or with anarchy, and must not be used as a pretext for infringing the rights of others, whether they be of an individual, of the community or of the Nation itself."" The Government quotes the opinions of various writers on different aspects of relations between industrial associations or trade unions and the State and on the subordination of group and individual interests to the general good.
.In another paragraph of its observations, the Government makes the following statements. As regards national security, the measures adopted by the Government-which alone was competent-were of a general nature and applied to all Brazilians without exception. These were domestic measures which might be taken by any country. Far from impairing individual freedoms, they protect them. As regards industrial associations, Legislative Decree No.  of  March  provides in section  that any person promoting a strike or lockout resulting in the paralysis of public services or essential utilities, with a view to bringing pressure to bear on the authorities of the Republic, shall be liable to a penalty of from two to six years' imprisonment.
.The Committee recalls that amongst the allegations connected with the right to strike which it has already examined in this case, and on which it has previously submitted its conclusions to the Governing Body, were allegations made by the WFTU concerning the threat to workers who went on strike of being summoned before military courts.
.At its February  Session, the Committee pointed out that, according to the Government's statement (in a communication dated  January ), the right to strike of Brazilian workers is guaranteed by the Constitution and regulated by Act No.  of , "" which does not set up any military court to repress strikes or judge those engaging in them "". The Government had stated that offences connected with strikes are judged by ordinary penal courts. At the same session the Committee referred to other statements made by the Government to the effect that military courts form part of the Brazilian judiciary; to the effect that penal sanctions apply only in the event of abuses in the exercise of the right to strike such as exceed the limits of labour-management relations and affect social order; and to the effect that other kinds of strikes may include sabotage, or activities such as may constitute an attack on national security. In conclusion, taking into account the formal denial of the Government and the fact that the complainants spoke only of the "" threats "" to which the said workers were exposed, and not of the actual appearance of the said workers before military courts, the Committee considered that "" sufficient evidence of infringement of trade union rights ... had not been adduced "" and recommended the Governing Body to decide that this aspect of the case called for no further examination.
.In the new complaint from the WFTU which the Committee is examining, the complainants refer to the provision of a "" newly worded "" National Security Act. The Government confines itself to indicating the penalty which, under the Legislative Decree of , is applicable to any person who promotes a strike which results in the paralysis of public services or essential activities, for the purpose of bringing pressure to bear on the authorities of the Republic.
.The Committee has always applied the principle that allegations relating to the right to strike are within its competence in so far as concerns the exercise of trade union rights. It has pointed out in many earlier cases that the right of workers and their organisations",-1,1964,Brazil
83,".The complaint of the Latin American Confederation of Christian Trade Unionists (C.L.A.S.C.) is contained in a communication dated  August  and that of the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions in a communication dated  August . On  August  I.F.C.T.U sent a new communication containing additional information. After these had been forwarded to it, the Government sent its replies on  November  and  March . The allegations before the Committee relate especially to the provisions of the existing legislation and to their application in practice.
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee notes that the case involves two aspects of the same problem, which derives fundamentally from the legislation in force in the Dominican Republic respecting collective disputes and strikes. One is the criminal aspect and the other is the purely industrial aspect, though both are closely related.
.With regard to the industrial aspect the Committee points out that on a previous occasion it was called upon to examine the legislation of the Dominican Republic on collective labour disputes and the right to strike) Notwithstanding certain amendments to that legislation, the Committee notes that the rules applied are basically the same. On that occasion the Committee had felt that the cumulative effect of the various provisions applicable in this matter, especially the provision that a trade union must, before declaring a strike, satisfy the government authorities of the economic character of the dispute, a provision which may well become indistinguishable in practice from a requirement of prior government authorisation, amounts to a denial of the right to strike, and for that reason recommended the Governing Body to draw the Government's attention to the desirability of its giving further consideration to the matter.
.On the other hand, with a view to stating still more clearly its observations on the relevant legislation, the Committee finds it necessary to point out that, under section  of the Labour Code, one of the requirements to be satisfied before a strike may be declared is that one of the parties to the dispute has not appointed arbitrators after the administrative conciliation procedure. In such event, according to section , the arbitrators may be nominated ex officio, i.e. a dispute may be taken to arbitration in any case. However, as section  seems to imply, a strike declared after the commencement of arbitration proceedings would be illegal. On the other hand, according to section , the award, once given, has the effect of a collective agreement and its application is compulsory. Taken together, these provisions may be interpreted as absolutely prohibiting the right to strike.
.The Committee has always maintained the principle that allegations respecting the right to strike are within its competence in so far, but only in so far, as they affect the exercise of trade union rights and has pointed out on a number of occasions that workers and their organisations are usually granted the right to strike as a legitimate means of defending their occupational interests. In this connection the Committee has emphasised the importance it attaches, where strikes are prohibited or are subject to restrictions, in essential services, to the establishment of adequate safeguards to protect the interests of the workers, who are thus deprived of an essential means of defending their occupational interests, and has pointed out that such restrictions should be accompanied by adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures, in which the parties concerned may participate at every stage, and that the awards given should in all cases be binding on both parties. The Committee explained in this connection that these principles do not apply to the absolute restriction of the right to strike, but to the restriction of that right in the essential services or in the civil service, in which case adequate guarantees should be provided to safeguard the interests of the workers s
.The Committee observes that in a report sent by the Government of the Dominican Republic on the application of Convention No.  it is stated that all the requirements and formalities which the Labour Code imposes on trade unions before a strike may be declared are purely for the information of the Secretariat of State for Labour, which allows them to use its good offices in an endeavour to achieve a settlement through conciliation, and that the requirements are never laid down with the idea that the Secretariat should come to any kind of decision as to whether the workers do in fact wish to strike or not, or as to the nature of the strike, such decisions falling exclusively within the competence of the labour courts. The Government adds that there has been no case where workers have been restricted in their freedom to determine whether or not to strike, although they have been notified on many occasions that they must follow the procedure laid down in the Labour Code if the strike is to be declared lawful.
.The Committee feels that the legal provisions cited seem to admit of the interpretation that it is possible to prohibit the exercise of the right to strike in all cases by declaring a strike illegal, even though this is done by a court. It is also possible that the existence of seemingly contradictory provisions respecting the right to strike might give rise to uncertainty.
.The Committee accordingly recommends the Governing Body to draw the Government's attention once again to the desirability of re-examining the provisions governing strikes in the light of the considerations set forth in paragraphs  and  above, so as to establish sufficiently simple and speedy procedures prior to a strike and thereby ensure that workers are not, in practice, deprived of one of the essential means at their disposal for furthering their demands.
.With regard to the criminal aspect of this case the Committee notes that, under the legislation in force, persons found guilty of promoting an illegal strike are liable to imprisonment for a period between  days and six months, as prescribed in Act No. . In this connection the Committee notes that, according to the information furnished by the Government, the persons concerned were sentenced for offences under this Act only, and that fines were imposed having regard to substantial extenuating circumstances.
.The Committee therefore recommends the Governing Body, while noting that the accused persons are not being detained and that they have merely been fined, to draw the Government's attention to the fact that the restrictive nature of the provisions governing strikes and the possible consequence of the procedure to be followed before a strike may be declared appear to make it possible for strikers to be liable in all cases to penal sanctions, which would imply a violation of the provision of Convention No.  that "" the law of the land shall not be such as to impair, nor shall it be so applied as to impair, the guarantees provided for "" in the Convention (Article , paragraph ), and especially the right of workers' p organisations to "" organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes "" (Article ).
.In all the circumstances, while reaffirming the principle that allegations respecting the right to strike are within its competence, in so far-but only in so far-as they affect the exercise of trade union rights, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the Government's attention once again to the desirability of re-examining the provisions respecting strikes in the light of the considerations set forth in paragraphs  and  above, so as to establish a simplified procedure prior to the declaration of a strike and thereby ensure that the workers are not deprived in practice of one of the essential means at their disposal for furthering their demands;(b) while noting that the accused persons are not being detained and that they have merely been fined, to draw the Government's attention to the fact that the restrictive nature of the provisions governing strikes and the possible consequence of the procedure to be followed before a strike may be declared appear to make it possible for strikers to be liable in all cases to penal sanctions, which would imply a violation of the provisions of Convention No.  that "" the law of the land shall not be such as to impair, nor shall it be so applied as to impair, the guarantees provided for "" in the Convention (Article , ), and especially the rights of workers' organisations to "" organise their paragraph administration and activities and to formulate their programmes "" (Article ).",-1,1964,Dominican Republic
84,".This case has already been examined by the Committee at its th, th, th and nd Sessions, held respectively in November , February , May  and February , on which occasions interim reports were presented to the Governing Body, which approved them. At its February  session the Committee examined the only allegation remaining outstanding, which related to the arrest of trade union leaders and militants.
.The complainants alleged that the Government had arbitrarily arrested a number of trade union leaders and militants. Among the persons arrested, it was stated, were Messrs. Ulrick Joly, President of the Inter-Union Federation of Haiti-which had been dissolved - Claude Franois and Lon Gabriel, members of the Executive Committee of the organisation mentioned and presidents of the cement and sugar unions respectively, Messrs. Alcius Cadet and Arnold Maisoneuve, of the Dockers' Union, and the trade union leaders Messrs. Prossoir and Guerrior.
.At its February  session the Committee took note of a statement by the Government to the effect that if the persons concerned were not discharged as an act of mercy before the verdict of the court by which they were to be tried, a copy of the text of the judgment pronounced by the court should be communicated to the Committee. The Committee accordingly recommended that the Governing Body request the Government to be good enough to let the Governing Body know whether the persons mentioned by the complainants had or had not been discharged as an act of mercy and, if they had not, to communicate the text of the judgment or judgments delivered, with the text of the grounds therefor.
.In a communication dated  February  the Government states that the persons concerned, who had been imprisoned for subversive activities, had, before the court pronounced judgment, been discharged in consequence of a general act of mercy on the part of the President of the Republic and that they had all been released.
.In these circumstances the Committee, considering that it would be purposeless to pursue the matter further, recommends the Governing Body to decide that the case does not call for further examination.

.At its May  Session the Committee took note of an extract, furnished by the Government, from the minutes of the Registry of the Port-au-Prince Civil Court, which indicated that, as the preliminary inquiry undertaken into the activities of the persons mentioned by name by W.F.T.U had shown that there were "" sufficient charges and evidence against them "", the examining magistrate had decided on  January  "" to remand the accused to the court of competent jurisdiction "".
.In these circumstances the Committee recommended the Governing Body to ask the Government to be good enough to communicate to it the text of the judgment concerning the persons concerned, when this had been delivered, and of its grounds.
.The Governing Body approved this recommendation at its nd Session, on  May , and the complementary information mentioned in the preceding paragraph was requested from the Government in a letter dated  June , to which the Government replied by a communication dated  September .
.In this communication the Government states that no police measures have ever been taken against a workers' organisation or its members when their activities have been limited to genuine trade union action. However, it states that when under cover of trade union activities individuals receiving orders from abroad take it upon themselves to upset the established social order, it is necessary, in the common interest, to take the appropriate legal measures against them.
.As regards the case of the members of U.I.H, continues the Government, all persons who were found by the inquiry to have had nothing to do with the subversive plots of the Executive Committee of U.I.H have been released, the only ones detained being "" those caught red-handed in collusion and complicity with enemies organising the invasion of the national territory "".
.The Government goes on to state that no action has as yet been taken under the order (mentioned in paragraph  above) made on  January  by the examining magistrate "" because under the fundamental laws the accused are judged each in turn by the criminal assizes held every year under an order of the senior judge of the civil court "". The Government adds that "" if the accused are not discharged as an act of mercy before the court's verdict, the Secretariat of State will have pleasure in sending you, by way of complementary information, a copy of the text of the judgment as soon as it has been pronounced "".
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to take note of the information provided by the Government, to request the latter to be good enough to let the Governing Body know whether the persons mentioned by the complainants have or have not been discharged as an act of mercy and, if not, to communicate the text of the judgment or judgments delivered, with the text of the grounds therefor.
.This case already came before the Committee at its th and th Sessions, in November  and February  respectively. The case consisted of two sets of allegations: one relating to the dissolution of the Inter-Union Federation of Haiti and the other to the arrest of trade union leaders and militants. The Committee submitted its final conclusions to the Governing Body with regard to the first set of allegations in paragraphs  to  and  (a) of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ). With respect to the second set of allegations the Committee felt it necessary at both the November  Session and the February  Session to seek further information from the Government before submitting its final recommendations to the Governing Body, and made a recommendation to this effect to the Governing Body, which approved it. The paragraphs which follow deal only with the allegations which remain outstanding.
.The complainants allege that, parallel with the action taken to dissolve the Inter-Union Federation of Haiti (U.I.H.), the Government arranged for the arbitrary arrest of a number of trade union leaders and militants. The persons arrested included Mr. Ulrick Joly, President of U.I.H, Messrs. Claude Franois and Lon Gabriel, members of the Executive Committee of the said organisation and presidents of the cement and sugar workers' unions, respectively, Messrs. Alcius Cadet and Arnold Maisoneuve, of the boat-breakers' union, and, lastly, union officials Messrs. Prossoir and Guerrior.
.In its observations the Government stated that the inquiry carried out by the Haitian police into the activities of these persons had shown that for some time past they had been engaging in subversive activities with a view to overthrowing the Constitutionally established rgime. To be more precise, these persons, militants of U.I.H, acting on orders from political groups abroad, were waging what was clearly a terrorist campaign, including the organisation of acts of aggression against representatives of the State, as, for instance, at Fort-Libert, where the local civil authorities narrowly escaped an ambush prepared by the leaders of U.I.H.
.When it examined the case at its November  Session the Committee observed that it was quite clear from the observations submitted by the Government and from the text of the judgment ordering the suspension of the activities of U.I.H, which was appended to the Government's observations, that that organisation, as such, had been engaging in activities exceeding the bounds of normal trade union activities. At its session of February  the Committee considered, in the light of the additional explanations furnished by the Government, that the leaders of the organisation whose activities have been suspended, seemed to have been guilty, as individuals, of illegal acts of a political and not a trade union nature.
.Noting, however, that, while it mentioned a police inquiry in its observations, the Government did not specify whether the action taken against the persons concerned had been the outcome of court proceedings or not, the Committee, recalling the importance it has always attached to the observance of adequate judicial safeguards in cases where trade unionists are accused of political offences or unlawful acts, including the right of all detained persons to receive",0,1964,Haiti
85,"its meeting held in May , when it submitted the interim conclusions contained in paragraphs  to  of its rd Report, which was approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session (May-June ). In that report the Committee submitted its definitive conclusions and recommendations concerning two series of allegations: (a) those relating to the imprisonment of the trade union leader Reinaldo Gonzlez and (b) those relating to the dissolution of employers' organisations. Thus the only allegations consideration of which has remained in suspense are those put forward by I.C.F.T.U concerning the detention of trade union officials; in this connection the Government was asked to supply detailed information (see paragraph  of the aforesaid report).
.In a communication dated  November , transmitted by the Permanent Delegation of Cuba in Geneva on  December , the Government answered that request for information.
.Cuba has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the  trade union officials on whose situation the Government has supplied information, to emphasise to the Government, as it has already done previously, the importance which it attaches to the principle that accused trade unionists, like all other persons, should be entitled to the safeguards of normal judicial procedure;(b) to invite the Government to co-operate by furnishing, as soon as possible, detailed information concerning the present situation of the trade union officials in question and of those referred to in paragraphs  and  above, as well as the texts of the judgments handed down in each instance and their grounds; and meanwhile to postpone consideration of the case;(c) to take note of the present interim report of the Committee, it being understood that the Committee will report further to the Governing Body when the information referred to in subparagraph (b) above has been received.
.In accordance with the practice which it has followed in certain earlier cases, the Committee has found it convenient to consolidate and consider together the three cases relating to Cuba, which concern the complaints presented by the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions (I.F.C.T.U.), the Economic Corporations of Cuba (in exile) and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (I.C.F.T.U.).
.Cuba has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.With regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:",-1,1964,Cuba

Mr. Ral Alberto Garcia, a member of the executive of the Federation of Wage-Earning and Salaried Telephone Employees of the Argentine Republic, was charged on  December  with intimidation of the public. He was subsequently released, and his case was finally dismissed on  December .
.Finally, the Government declares that at the present time there is not a single person held in custody in Argentina on political or trade union grounds, and that all the police and legal action referred to was taken on account of offences against public order or common law offences.
.It would appear from the information supplied by the Government that the  trade union leaders indicted in connection with the adoption of the Battle Plan were charged purely with the offence provided for in section  of the Penal Code, namely incitement to commit an offence, and not with breaches of state security, as has been alleged in the complaint. The Committee notes that these persons, whose detention was ordered during the initial proceedings, have now been released without prejudice to the pursuance of their case.
.With regard to the three trade unionists mentioned in paragraph  above, who were arraigned individually, the Committee observes that although all three have been released, two of them, Messrs. Luduea and Kristoff, appear to be still subject to the jurisdiction of the criminal courts for the offences with which they have been charged. It is not clear whether these offences have any connection with the acts imputed to the  trade unionists mentioned earlier, and the Committee would therefore be grateful if the Government would inform it as to the exact nature of the offences with which Messrs. Luduea and Kristoff are charged and to keep it informed of any new development with respect to the legal position of these trade unionists.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body, while taking note of the Government's statement in its communication of  March  to the effect that at the present time nobody is held in custody in Argentina on political or trade union grounds, and that the trade union leaders indicted in connection with the adoption of the C.G.T's Battle Plan were charged purely with incitement to commit an offence, to request the Government to be good enough to keep it informed of any new development with respect to the situation regarding the proceedings concerning these officials, and to take note of this interim report, on the understanding that the Committee will report further when it has received the additional information to be requested from the Government in pursuance of paragraph  above.
.This case was examined previously by the Committee at its th Session (May ), when it submitted an interim report, which appears in paragraphs  to  of its rd Report, approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session.
.In paragraph  of this report the Committee, having examined the allegations of the complainants and the reply of the Government, set forth certain recommendations and a request for information in the following terms:With regard to the case as a whole the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the allegations relating to non-attendance by the Argentine Workers' delegation at the th Session of the International Labour Conference, to decide that there would be no object in continuing to examine this aspect of the case;(b) as regards the allegations relating to interference by public authorities in the finances of trade unions, to take note of Argentine legislation on the supervision of administration of trade union property and funds, to call the Government's attention to the considerations set out in paragraphs  to  above, and to invite it to re-examine the said legislation in the light thereof, particularly as regards the reference of the results of administrative audits to a law court so as to ensure due process of law and, if appropriate, application of sanctions by the court;(c) to take note of the present interim report, on the understanding that the Committee will report further to the Governing Body when it has received the information from the Government referred to in paragraph  above..The Government sent additional information in a communication dated  August .

.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In view of the foregoing the Committee recommends the Governing Body to take note of this interim report, on the understanding that the Committee will submit a further report when it has received the information it has decided to request from the Government, as indicated in paragraph  above.
.The complaints by the General Confederation of Labour (C.G.T.) are contained in communications dated  May, ,  and  June and  September , all of which were sent directly to the I.L.O. They describe alleged violations of trade union rights in Argentina. The above communications were transmitted to the Government, which sent its observations by letter dated  November .

87,"With reference to the detention of a number of trade union leaders on the Huayllamba estate the Government declared that the labour problem which had arisen had already been settled and that it was the subsequent conduct of the trade union which had brought about the intervention of the police authorities.
.In these circumstances the Committee considered that the elements submitted by the Government in its reply were not sufficient to enable the situation to be evaluated in the light of the allegations presented by the complainants; consequently it recommended the Governing Body to decide to request the Government to be good enough to furnish its detailed observations on the various events mentioned in the complaint, including the precise reasons for the intervention of the authorities in the Huayllamba estate case and to decide in the meantime to postpone further examination of this case until the information requested and the observations concerning the complaint presented on  December  had been received.
.In this latter communication C.L.A.S.C alleged that Mr. Hugo Espinosa, a C.E.D.O.C leader, had been arrested on  December  and was being held incommunicado. At the same time two other leaders, Luis Cajas and Teodoro Reinoso, had also been arrested, although they had subsequently been released. The complaint also dealt with a number of problems affecting the peasants of Chimborazo province, where the attitude of the civil and military chief had prevented them from organising and insisting on their rights, which included payment of over four years' back wages.
.The Government has not yet sent in its observations on these allegations. Nor has it made any observations concerning the allegations relating to the arrest of the trade unionists Francisco Checa, Carlos Aroca, Pedro Moreno Rocha, Carlos Idovro Vergara and Mesias Zamora Prez mentioned in the complaint dated  November .
.However, the Government forwarded two letters dated  and  April  concerning the allegations relating to events on the Huayllamba estate.
.In these letters the Government stated in the first place that a number of peasants on the estate had been arrested for alleged infringement of property rights; as soon as an investigation was made into the case the peasants concerned were immediately set free without having been in any way ill-treated by the police authorities. In the second place the Government explained that the claim by the workers on the Huayllamba estate was for grazing land for their animals, since they considered that they did not have enough to support their livestock. This claim was rejected by the landowner, but the dispute was settled on  October  when an agreement was signed in the presence of the labour inspector. A copy of this agreement was also forwarded by the Government.
.In all the circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with respect to the allegations relating to intervention by the authorities in the dispute on the Huayllamba estate, to note that the persons who were arrested have been set free and that the dispute itself has been settled following the signing of an agreement between the parties and to decide therefore that no purpose would be served by continuing its examination of this aspect of the case;(b) with respect to the allegations relating to the arrest of union leaders Francisco Checa, Carlos Aroca, Pedro Moreno Rocha, Carlos Idovro Vergara, Mesias Zamora Prez, Hugo Espinosa, Luis Cajas and Teodoro Reinoso, and similarly with respect to the allegations relating to infringements of trade union rights in Chimborazo province, to request the Government once more to furnish its observations at the earliest possible date;(c) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report as soon as it has received the Government's observations on the matters referred to in subparagraph (b) above.Geneva,  May . (Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.
.The first complaint from the Latin American Confederation of Trade Unionists (C.L.A.S.C) is contained in a communication dated  November . It was transmitted to the Government, and the latter communicated its observations on  January . The complainants presented a new complaint, together with additional information concerning the first, by a communication dated  December , with regard to which the Government has not yet furnished its observations.
.Ecuador has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  November  C.L.A.S.C declares that the Ecuadorian Confederation of Catholic Workers (C.E.D.O.C) is being systematically subjected to discrimination and persecution which constitute an infringement of freedom of association. In September  trade union leaders Francisco Checa and Carlos Aroca were imprisoned in Machachi after they had been apprehended attending a meeting of peasants convened to found a peasants' league for that locality. At approximately the same time in Naranjito trade unionists Pedro Moreno Rocha, Carlos Idovro Vergara and Mesias Zamora Prez were incarcerated for distributing leaflets to peasants with the aim of convening a meeting to found another peasants' league. At a later date, in the province of Chimborazo, the civil and military chief of the area imprisoned a number of peasant leaders for forming a trade union on the Huayllamba estate and campaigning for their rights; he also threatened the C.E.D.O.C leaders in the province, sending a telegram to C.E.D.O.C reading as follows: "" Owner Huayllamba estate settled problems fairly. Demagogic party campaign you are conducting cannot be tolerated in any circumstances. Extremist agitators in your service will be treated as they deserve."" The complainants conclude their communication by declaring that the Ministry of Labour is pursuing a policy which is especially discriminatory against C.E.D.O.C, and that in some areas the authorities prohibit trade union meetings and have also abolished the right to strike.
.In its reply dated  January  the Government declares that C.E.D.O.C has never been subjected to any discrimination whatsoever, nor have its leaders been persecuted. This organisation enjoys the same safeguards for pursuing its trade union activity as the other workers' associations formed in compliance with the law and recognised by the Government. Furthermore, the Government rejects the allegation that a military chief used force to defend the estate owners. The Huayllamba estate case was finally settled by the intervention of an official sent by the Director-General of Labour, and the agreement between employer and agricultural workers was signed. Unfortunately, the trade union backed by C.E.D.O.C, deviating from its specific objectives, engaged in incitement to violence and thus brought about the subsequent intervention of the police authorities after the labour aspect of the problem had been solved.
.The Committee observes that the Government in its reply makes no reference to the specific allegations contained in the complaint regarding the imprisonment of Francisco Checa, Carlos Aroca, Pedro Moreno Rocha, Carlos Idovro Vergara and Mesias Zamora Prez. With reference to the detention of a number of trade union leaders at the Huayllamba estate the Government declares that the labour problem which had arisen had already been settled and that it was the subsequent conduct of the trade union which had brought about the intervention of the police authorities.",0,1964,Ecuador
88,"fundamental objective should be the economic and social advancement of their members "".
.On the other hand the Committee deplores the fact that, in spite of repeated requests' for precise information concerning the detention of the other trade unionists mentioned in the complaint, the Government has once again restricted itself to stating in its communication of  February , referring to only two of the cases of arrest, that both the trade unionists concerned had infringed the provisions of the Penal Code, without throwing more light on the exact nature of the alleged offences with which these persons are charged, and that no judicial proceedings seem to have been taken against them.
.Although these two trade unionists, Messrs. Checa and Aroca, have been released at some time after the date on which the complaint was lodged, in view of the importance it has always attached, in all cases where trade unionists are detained for political offences or common law crimes, to the principle that the persons concerned should be tried with all the safeguards of regular judicial procedure, at the earliest possible moment and by an impartial and independent judicial authority, the Committee, in accordance with the practice it has followed hitherto in similar cases, recommends the Governing Body to draw the Government's attention to the dangers that measures for the detention of trade unionists might entail for freedom of association if such measures are not accompanied by proper judicial safeguards, and to the fact that every government should make it a rule to ensure respect for human rights and, in particular, the right of every detained person to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment by an impartial and independent judicial authority.""
.With respect to the other three trade unionists, Messrs. Espinosa, Cajas and Reinoso, whose arrest has also been alleged by the complainants, the Government has not submitted any information up to the present.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note that the trade unionists Pedro Moreno Rocha, Carlos Idovro Vergara, Mesias Zamora Prez, Francisco Checa and Carlos Aroca have been released;(b) to draw the Government's attention, however, to:(i) the importance the Committee has always attached to the opinion of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to the effect that trade unions should not be prohibited in general terms from engaging in any political activities, and that the judicial authorities should be entrusted with the task of repressing abuses which might be committed by organisations which had lost sight of the fact that their fundamental objective should be "" the economic and social advancement "" of their members;(ii) the dangers that measures for the detention of trade unionists might entail for freedom of association if such measures are not accompanied by proper judicial safeguards, and the fact that every government should make it a rule to ensure respect for human rights and, in particular, the right of every detained person to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment by an impartial and independent judicial authority;(c) to request the Government once again to forward, as a matter of urgency, its precise observations concerning the alleged detention of Messrs. Hugo Espinosa, Luis Cajas and Teodoro Reinoso, indicating further the present situation of these persons before the law;(d) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will report further when it has received the additional information from the Government, as indicated in subparagraph (c) above.
.This case was examined by the Committee at its sessions in February and May  when it made interim reports. In the rd Report, approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session (May ), the Committee made definitive recommendations on allegations relating to the intervention of the authorities in a conflict which had arisen on the Huayllamba estate. In the present report the Committee examines the remaining allegations, which relate to the detention of a number of trade union officers and to the infringement of trade union rights by the authorities in the province of Chimborazo.
.The original complaint was submitted by the Latin American Confederation of Christian Trade Unionists (C.L.A.S.C.) on  November . It was then forwarded to the Government, which sent in its observations on  January .

.By a communication dated  December  the Government supplies a copy of a report submitted by the Court Martial Judge at the Military Base of Puerto Barrios to the Chairman of the Judiciary on  August  which refers to the case of Mr. Paz Muralles. In the report it is stated that on  April  Messrs. Josh Nery and Federico Guillermo Padilla Garcia were assaulted, murdered and robbed in the town of Los Arrates, it being alleged that the perpetrators of this deed were one of the bands of rebels who roam around pillaging the mountain regions in that area, and who, according to evidence given before the examining magistrate, were acting on the advice of and in close collaboration with the trade unionist Paz Muralles and  local peasants, for which reason the latter have been taken into custody and brought to trial before the Military Tribunal at Puerto Barrios. The report adds that during the trial none of the accused has been able to disprove the evidence which justified their being held in provisional custody on charges of murder and robbery in an isolated spot, and that the trial is still in progress, having reached its final phase, on the conclusion of which sentence will be passed.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to take note of the Government's statement to the effect that the trial is still in progress and to request the Government once again to be good enough to forward the text of the judgment and the grounds on which it is based as soon as it is available, and meanwhile to postpone examination of the case.
.The complaint is contained in a communication dated  October  transmitted to the I.L.O by the Secretary-General of the United Nations. It was then forwarded to the Government, which sent its observations on  December .
.Guatemala has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complaint alleges that Mr. Eustaquio Paz Muralles, peasant leader of the Guatemalan Social Federation of Christian Peasants, has been subjected to unjust and pro longed imprisonment. The Latin American Confederation of Christian Trade Unionists (C.L.A.S.C.) requests intervention by the I.L.O to secure his release.
.In its reply the Government states that it obtained a statement from the Secretary-General of the Guatemalan Social Federation of Christian Peasants, Mr. Adolfo Antonio Hernndez Contreras, to the effect that in October  Mr. Paz Muralles was elected Disputes Secretary of the Federation, a post which he held until April  when he was elected to the Advisory Council of the Guatemalan Christian Democratic Party and left the Executive Committee of the Federation; he is now indicted for the murder of the brothers Padilla Garcia. The Government maintains that this occurrence has nothing to do with freedom of association and that the case of Mr. Paz Muralles is the sole responsibility of the courts.
.In previous cases where allegations that trade union leaders or workers have been arrested or detained on account of trade union activities have been met by governments with statements that the arrests or detentions were made for subversive activities, for reasons of internal security or for common law crimes, the Committee has always followed the rule that the governments concerned should be requested to submit further information as precise as possible concerning the arrests or detentions and the exact reasons therefor. If in certain cases the Committee has concluded that allegations relating to the arrest or detention of trade union militants did not call for further examination, this has been after it has received information from the governments concerned showing in a sufficiently clear and detailed way that the arrests or detentions were in no way occasioned by trade union activities but solely by activities outside the trade union sphere which were either prejudicial to public order or of a political nature.
.Moreover, in the past the Committee has always followed the practice of not proceeding to examine matters which were the subject of pending national judicial proceedings offering all the guarantees of normal judicial procedure where such proceedings might make available information of assistance to the Committee in appreciating whether or not allegations were well founded.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to request the Government for a copy of the judgment in the case of Mr. Eustaquio Paz Muralles, together with the grounds on which it is based, and meanwhile to postpone examination of the case.",0,1964,Guatemala

The only aspect of this case which remains outstanding concerns the fate of three trade unionists on whose alleged detention the Government had failed until recently to forward its observations.
.Case No.  concerns a complaint presented to the I.L.O by the Ecuadorian Federation of Christian Trade Unions (C.E.D.O.C.) on  March  in which allegations were made concerning the imposition upon workers' organisations of certain obligations which the complainants considered to constitute an infringement of freedom of association. In a letter dated  March  the International Federation- of Christian Trade Unions declared its support for the aforementioned complaint. The C.E.D.O.C supplied further information in a letter dated  March . The texts of all three of these communications were duly transmitted to the Government.
.Case No.  concerns a complaint presented to the I.L.O by the Latin American Peasant Federation (F.C.L.) by a letter dated  March , followed by a further letter from the same organisation dated  April . The complaint alleged that legal personality had been refused to a workers' organisation, that trade unionists had been imprisoned and that trade unions had been wrongfully compelled to comply with certain obligations.

.In these circumstances, and with regard to these cases as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to take note of the Government's statement according to which nobody is in prison today in Ecuador on account of his trade union activities;(b) to decide, for the reasons stated in paragraphs  and  above respectively, that no useful purpose would be served by continuing the examination of the allegations relating to the imprisonment of trade unionists, and that the allegation relating to the refusal to grant legal personality to a workers' organisation, mentioned by the complainants, does not call for further examination;(c) to take note of this interim report, on the understanding that the Committee will report further when it has received the observations requested from the Government by the Committee in paragraph  above.
.The last time the Committee examined this case was at its meeting in November , and on that occasion it submitted a provisional report which appears in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its rd Session (November ). The present report refers only to the allegations whose examination remained in suspense, i.e. those referring to the arrest of trade union leaders in connection with which more complete information was sought from the Government, pursuant to paragraph  (b) of the th Report.
.Ecuador has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In two communications, dated  November and  December , the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unionists complained of the arrest of eight officials of the Ecuadorian Federation of Catholic Workers. Francisco Checa and Carlos Aroca are alleged to have been apprehended and imprisoned in September  while they were attending a meeting of peasants convened to found a peasants' league; Pedro Moreno Rocha, Carlos Idovro Vergara and Mesias Zamora Prez were imprisoned for distributing leaflets to peasants with the aim of convening a meeting to found another peasants' league. It was also alleged that the trade union leader Hugo Espinosa, who was held incommunicado, and the trade union leaders Luis Cajas and Teodoro Reinoso were imprisoned but that the latter two were subsequently released.
.After examining the case in its entirety at its meetings held in February and May , the Committee recommended the Governing Body to ask the Government for its observations respecting the alleged imprisonment, since no observations had been received up to that time. By a communication dated  August  the Government declared, without giving any more precise details, that the arrest referred to had been carried out for infringement of specific provisions of the penal legislation which had no connection with trade union activities. On re-examining the case at its meeting held in November , the Committee noted that in similar cases it had always followed the rule that the governments concerned should be requested to submit further and as precise information as possible concerning the arrests or detentions and the exact reasons therefor. It also noted that, if in certain cases the Committee had concluded that allegations relating to the arrests or detentions of trade union militants did not call for further examination, this had been after it had received information from the governments showing sufficiently precisely and with sufficient detail that the arrests or detentions were in no way occasioned by trade union activities but solely by activities outside the trade union sphere which were either prejudicial to public order or of a political character. Finally, in paragraph  (b) of its th Report, the Committee again recommended the Governing Body to reiterate to the Government its request to send more complete information on this aspect of the case, including an account of the offences with which each of the trade unionists had been charged and the result of the prosecutions commenced in this respect.
.This recommendation was approved by the Governing Body and transmitted to the Government, which replied by a communication dated  February . The Government stated in its reply that the arrest of Messrs. Checa and Aroca was due to blatant infringements of specific provisions of the penal legislation of Ecuador. The authorities responsible for applying the appropriate penalty, however, had been conciliatory enough to order the release of these men with the very purpose of avoiding the distortion of the reasons for their arrest. The Government declared in this connection that the fact of being a trade union official did not entitle anyone to devote himself to overthrowing public order on the pretext of organising workers' unions. As regards the arrest of Messrs. Moreno Rocha, Hidrovo Vergara (called Idovro Vergara by the complainants) and Zamora Prez, the Government stated that, according to the information supplied by the authorities dealing with each case, the arrest was due to these persons having been found distributing subversive leaflets with no printer's mark and disturbing political order in the district, particularly among the country people; the three men were released after signing a declaration before the authorities, binding them to take no part in political activities which in the opinion of the Government have no connection with trade unionism. The distribution of leaflets with no printer's mark is an offence punishable under section  of the Penal Code with imprisonment of from three months to one year and a fine of from  to  sucres.
.With respect to the last-mentioned three trade unionists, the Committee noted the Government's declaration that the arrest had been made in respect of an offence punishable under the Penal Code. However, in view of what had been said by the Government concerning political activities in connection with the trade unionists' acts, the Committee thought it necessary to bear in mind the opinion expressed by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations which states that "" provisions prohibiting trade unions in general terms from engaging in any political activities ... may raise difficulties by reason of the fact that the interpretation given to them in practice may change at any moment and restrict considerably the possibility of action of the organisations. In this connection the Committee thinks it useful to make reference to the resolution adopted by the International Labour Conference at its th Session (Geneva, ) in which it is stated, among other things, that when trade unions undertake or associate themselves with political action, this action shall not be of such a nature as to compromise the continuance of the trade union movement or its social or economic functions, irrespective of political changes in the country It would therefore seem that States should be able, without prohibiting in general terms and a priori all political activities by occupational organisations, to entrust to the judicial authorities the task of repressing abuses which might, in certain cases, be committed by organisations which had lost sight of the fact that their",1,1964,Ecuador
91,".The complaint by the Peruvian Workers' Confederation is contained in a letter dated  June . This was transmitted to the Government, which sent its observations by letter dated  October .
.Peru has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants refer in their communication to three decrees issued by the Government in connection with a long-drawn-out labour dispute in the banks. They allege that the decrees constitute a breach of the Forced Labour Convention,  (No. ), that they infringe the protection due to trade union officers, and that they restrict the right to strike.
.The complainants transmit the text of the above decrees with a commentary. Presidential Decree No.  of  May  lays down the number of hours to be worked by bank employees and states that in case of non-compliance the employee's contract can be terminated. According to the complainants, the decree is an infringement of the principle of employment stability and of the provisions on this subject in force in Peru; it is also alleged to infringe the rule of immunity of union officers by its very wide definition of the ground for dismissal, which enables the banks to decide who shall represent the union. Decree No.  of  May  also lays down a timetable for bank employees and again states that non-compliance by employees will be a ground for dismissal. According to the complainants this decree is an infringement of Convention No. .
.Lastly, Decree No.  of  May  declares the strike called by the Bank Employees' Federation of Peru to be unlawful and authorises the banks to terminate the contracts of employees who do not return to work within a specified period. In its preamble the decree refers to the strike called by the Federation for  May ; it says that this was the last of a series of actions taken by the Federation and attributed by it to problems of terms of employment; but that a statutory procedure for the solution of such problems is in existence and must be complied with. According to the complainants this decree also, by declaring a strike to be illegal, violates Convention No. .
.In its reply of  October  the Government reviews the dispute between the Bank Employees' Federation and the banks regarding hours of work. The Federation, it says, decided unilaterally on a change in hours, which the banks did not accept. After several attempts at conciliation had failed to bring about an agreement, the Government issued Resolution No.  of  April  prescribing a certain timetable, but this was not accepted by the Federation. The bank employees then deserted their work before the prescribed hours had been completed, whereupon the banks closed their doors.
.At this juncture, the Government continues, Presidential Decree No.  of  was issued: it supplemented the previous measure and permitted sanctions (the dismissal of the employee) to be imposed in case of non-compliance. The employees' response was to take such steps as "" going slow "" and "" working to rule "", which precluded any kind of overtime. The Government consequently intervened again by issuing Presidential Decree No. , which endorsed the hours of work previously laid down but provided for a break of  minutes; it also settled the question of overtime. However, the employees did not give way, but called a strike for an indefinite period-this time to obtain the reinstatement of the dismissed personnel; that was defiance of a public authority which had defined the position of the parties in law and stated their respective rights and obligations. The consequence was the issue of Presidential Decree No. , which declared the strike unlawful. The Government adds that the aims of the Federation now evidently exceeded any strictly trade union objective.
.The Government also says that the declaration rendering the strike unlawful was of a transitory character, involving no present problem. Indeed, according to the documentation sent by the Government, the Bank Employees' Federation called off the strike on  July  and began to negotiate with the banks on the reinstatement of all the dismissed personnel.
.The Committee observes that, although the complainants allege a breach of Convention No. , the complaint is in fact directed against two decrees which permit the dismissal of such bank employees as do not comply with certain prescribed hours, and a third which declares a strike to be unlawful and permits the dismissal of those employees who do not return to work. The complainants further allege infringement of trade union rights (particularly regarding protection for union officers) and of the right to strike. The Committee has therefore considered the complaint to be within its terms of reference, namely to examine allegations that freedom of association or trade union rights have been infringed.
.As regards the first two decrees the Committee finds that they prescribe certain times for performance of banking operations and that such times are part of the terms of employment of the banks' employees. The dismissals authorised in these decrees are for failure to comply with the said terms of employment. The fact that the dismissal may be applied, inter alia, to the officers of the union if they do not keep to the established hours of work certainly does not mean that principles and provisions relating to freedom of association have been infringed.
.As regards the third decree the Committee observes that this declares unlawful the strike called by the Bank Employees' Federation in order to obtain the reinstatement in their jobs of certain employees who had been dismissed. The preamble to the decree describes the strike as the last of a series of actions taken by the Federation and attributed by it to problems of terms of employment, but adds that a statutory procedure for dealing with such problems is in existence and must be complied with.
.The Committee has always been guided by the principle that allegations relating to the right to strike are within its competence so far as they affect the exercise of trade union rights. The Committee has also considered that the right to strike as a legitimate means of defence of their occupational interests is generally recognised, provided that the right is exercised with due regard to temporary restrictions placed thereon (e.g. suspension of strikes during conciliation and arbitration procedures and, in the case of essential services, due notice of the intention to strike which is normally required in such services).""
.The Committee now observes that the Presidential Decree of  March  and others supplementing it apply to labour disputes in Peru and lay down a procedure for their settlement: this starts with direct discussion between workers and employers, continues with a conciliation stage in which the authorities are to take part, and culminates with arbitration. It does not appear from the documents at the Committee's disposal that the above procedure was followed in the present case; indeed, the Government's reply and the preamble to Decree No.  appear to indicate the contrary. Moreover, it would seem that the strike was directed against the dismissals decided on by the employers, in virtue of the authority given in Decrees Nos.  and , because of non-compliance with certain terms of employment applying in the banks.",-1,1964,Peru
92,"judgment, this offence was committed when the accused, at a date not specified in the judgment, entered the dwelling of a third party, breaking the padlock, and stealing a shirt and some bedclothes. Mrs. Ada Gonzlez Gallo was sentenced to  years' imprisonment, for complicity, with eight other persons, in acts which, according to the Council of War, constituted offences against the state authorities and against the stability and unity of the nation, and arson, defined and made punishable by section  (paragraph ), taken in conjunction with section , sections  (paragraph A) and  of the Code of Social Defence as amended by Acts No.  of  July  and No.  of  January . In the judgment it is stated to have been proved that Ada Gonzlez Gallo was among persons selected by the "" forces of regression "" for the destruction of workplaces, industrial plant, etc., belonging to the nation, and especially a particular department store in Havana, which was set fire to by a co-accused. Mr. Jorge Blanco Ferrando was sentenced, with others, to nine years' rigorous imprisonment, having been accused of belonging to an organisation, not identified in the judgment, dedicated to various counter-revolutionary activities such as the distribution of propaganda, the sale of bonds, carrying arms and explosives and hiding fugitives. The judgment states that some days before  April , the date of an armed invasion of the Cuban territory, the accused were engaged in great activity to facilitate the invasion. The Council of War considered that these acts constituted an offence against the state authorities, defined by section  (paragraph ) of the Code of Social Defence as amended by Act No. .
.According to another of the judgments, Mrs. Sara Carranza Astiastegui (called Sara Carranza Arriastegui by the complainants) was sentenced to  years' rigorous imprisonment for having committed an offence against the unity and stability of the nation, defined by section  of the Code of Social Defence as amended by Act No. . The Council of War declared it to have been proved that this person and the other accused belonged to an organisation styled "" Movement of  November "", to which it attributes the execution of the plans of various foreign organisations and governments. The judgment declares it to have been proved that Sara Carranza Astiastegui was the national finance co-ordinator of this organisation and that as such she "" received considerable sums from abroad which were distributed to the unit chiefs for their expenses "".
.The judgments referred to in the two preceding paragraphs stated that the additional penalties inflicted on the accused include confiscation of all of their goods. The judgments also indicated that the accused were defended by a number of counsel, whose names are listed.
.With respect to Mr. Arnaldo Muller Sotolongo, the Government stated that this person was sentenced to nine years' rigorous imprisonment by the revolutionary court of the district of Havana, by a judgment dated  April , on the charge of offences against the unity and stability of the nation, arson and wilful damage. The case in question was the same as that relating to the sentencing of Mr. Reinaldo Gonzlez, considered by the Committee under Case No. .
.The Government repeated what it had said earlier regarding the national provisions on jurisdiction and competence, the penal provisions and procedural safeguards applied. It added that in all cases the accused participated directly in the commission of serious and sufficiently distinct acts, defined and made punishable under legislation promulgated prior to the offence, and that the activities in question had nothing in common with trade union militancy and activities.
.With respect to the seven other persons on whom additional information was requested, the Government stated that in spite of its wishes and the zeal displayed by the competent officials, it was not able to submit any information on these cases and repeated its earlier observation on the need for further information or concrete antecedents in order that the cases might be identified.
.With regard to the five persons in respect of whom the Government has now sent information, the Committee observes that their situation is similar to that of those other persons on whose sentences the Government provided the information examined by the Committee at its meeting in February . These five persons were in fact judged in a public hearing before revolutionary courts or Councils of War by virtue of penal provisions quoted in the respective judgments, and sentenced to various terms of imprisonment. In all these cases the alleged facts on which the sentences were passed, as emerges from the information and the texts of the judgments submitted by the Government, do not appear to bear any relation to trade union activities. From the Government's observations it seems that these cases too were conducted in accordance with the exceptional procedure laid down in the  Act governing trials in the Republic of Cuba under arms, owing to the fact that the offences of which these persons had been accused were regarded as "" counter-revolutionary "".
.As in Case No.  already mentioned, and earlier in this same case, the Committee again recalled in this respect that in cases where it has established that an exceptional procedure is being followed, it had always reiterated the importance it attached to the observance in such circumstances of all the guarantees afforded by due legal process. In the cases in point, it emerges from the information submitted by the Government that the persons concerned were able to employ the services of defence counsel, but it did not appear that they enjoyed safeguards such as appeals for re-evaluation and appeals against the sentences imposed.
.With regard to the seven persons whom the Government states it cannot identify, the Committee notes that, according to the text of the complaint as communicated to the Government, the trade union leaders in question are Luis Miguel Linsuain, General Secretary of the Gastronomic Federation of Oriente Province, who was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment; Alberto Garcia, General Secretary of the National Medical Federation, sentenced to  years' imprisonment; Antonio Dagas, Deputy General Secretary of the Cuban section of the Spanish trade union organisation National Confederation of Labour (C.N.T.), imprisoned in La Cubana fort; Leandro Barreras, member of the Executive Board of the National Federation of Sugar Workers; Norberto Abreu, Secretary of the Federation of Printing and Allied Trades; Carmen Mndez Linares, employee of the Confederation of Cuban Workers (C.T.C.), sentenced to  years' imprisonment; and Juan Manuel Reines, sentenced to ten years' imprisonment for being an officer of the trade union section of the clandestine movement.
.The Committee duly appreciates the grounds on which the Government declares itself unable to supply any information regarding the situation of the persons listed in paragraph  above. Nevertheless, in order to be able to formulate its conclusions with respect to the allegations concerning them and the request of the complainants for the setting up of a fact-finding committee, the Committee would be grateful to the Government if it would communicate any information which it might be possible to obtain by additional investigation in this matter and, in any case, be good enough to specify as quickly as possible whether the persons in question are or are not in fact being detained or serving prison sentences in Cuba, and, if so, to communicate the grounds for their detention or sentence and the texts of the judgments passed in respect of them.
.Under these circumstances, as regards the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to take note of the information submitted by the Government in respect of five of the  trade union officers whose situation has been examined in this case since the approval of the th Report of the Committee, from which information it appears that the said persons have been sentenced to various terms of imprisonment by virtue of facts and penal provisions which have no connection with trade union activities;(b) to draw the attention of the Government once again, however, having regard to the exceptional procedure followed in the present cases, to the importance it attaches to the principle that trade unionists, like all other persons, should be entitled to the safeguards of normal judicial procedure;(c) to request the Government to be good enough to supply information concerning the seven remaining trade unionists of the  listed in the complaint, which it might obtain by additional investigation in the matter, and, in any case, to state as quickly as possible whether these seven persons are or are not in fact being detained or serving prison sentences in Cuba, and, if so, to communicate the grounds for their detention or sentence and the text of the judgments passed with respect to them;(d) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a new report once it has received the additional information requested of the Government in subparagraph (c) above.
.The Committee considered these three cases together at",-1,1964,Cuba
93,".The last time the Committee examined this case was at its session in November , when it submitted to the Governing Body an interim report, contained in paragraphs  to  of its th Report. The report was approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ).
.Guatemala has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee recalls that in the complaint dated  October  the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions had alleged that Mr. Eustaquio Paz Muralles, the leader of the Guatemalan Federation of Peasants, had been unjustly held in prison for a considerable time. The Government stated in reply that, according to information received from the Federation of Peasants, Mr. Paz Muralles had left his post in the said organisation in April  to take up a position in a political party, and that he was in fact on trial for the murder of two people.
.In accordance with the practice followed by the Committee in similar cases in which pending proceedings might make available information of assistance to it in appreciating whether or not allegations were well founded, the Committee, when it examined the case in February , recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to supply a copy of the judgement pronounced in the case against Muralles and the grounds on which it was based. This recommendation was approved by the Governing Body at its session in March , and it was subsequently forwarded to the Government.
.On  December  the Government transmitted a copy of a report, dated  August of the same year, which had been submitted by the Court Martial Judge of the Military Base of Puerto Barrios. The said report stated that on  April  Federico Guillermo Padilla Garcia and his brother Jos Nery were attacked, robbed and murdered, and it named as perpetrators of the act a group of persons who were thought to have been aided by Mr. Paz Muralles. All concerned were then in custody and their cases were being dealt with by the Military Court of Puerto Barrios. The report added that during the investigations, which were now in their final phase, not one of the accused had been able to refute the evidence justifying his detention.
.Accordingly, at its session in February , the Committee decided to request the Government once again to forward the text of the judgement and the grounds on which it was made as soon as it became available, and meanwhile to postpone its examination of the case.
.Since that session, despite repeated requests, the Government has failed to forward the information. The Committee re-examined the case at its session in November  and, as no information had been received from the Government, it recommended the Governing Body to request, as a matter of urgency, the text of the judgement and the grounds on which it was made.
.Finally, the Government forwarded, on  March , the information that had been requested.
.The text of the judgements forwarded by the Government shows that Mr. Paz Muralles was tried, with some other persons, in courts of first and second instance, and was acquitted in both for lack of conclusive evidence. The proceedings began on  May , and judgement in the first instance was pronounced on  June , and in the second instance on  August . In the latter, amnesty Decree No.  was applied and a definitive ruling was given that no case could be found against the accused on the charge of having participated in subversive activities. The court ordered that the defendants should be released from custody.
.In February  the Committee submitted to the Governing Body an interim report on this case, which is contained in paragraphs  to  of its th Report.$
.Guatemala has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee recalls that the complaint related to the imprisonment of the leader of the Guatemalan Social Federation of Christian Peasants, Mr. Paz Muralles. The Government stated, in reply to the allegation, that Muralles was on trial for murder and maintained that this fact had nothing to do with freedom of association.
.In accordance with the practice followed by the Committee in similar cases in which pending proceedings might make available information of assistance to it in appreciating whether or not allegations were well founded, the Committee, when it first examined the case in February , recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to supply a copy of the judgement pronounced in the case against Mural les and the grounds on which it was based. The Government subsequently, in December , transmitted a copy of a report submitted by the Court Martial Judge of the Military Base of Puerto Barrios to the Chairman of the Judiciary on  August . This report referred to the case against Muralles and stated that the trial was still in progress, having reached its final phase, on the conclusion of which sentence would be passed.
.The Committee, accordingly, at its session in February , recommended the Governing Body to request the Government once again to be good enough to forward the text of the judgement and the grounds on which it was based as soon as it became available. Since that date, despite repeated requests, the Government has not supplied the information which the Committee requires to enable it to reach definitive conclusions in this case.
.In these circumstances, the Committee wishes to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and, if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments for their part should recognise the importance, for the protection of their own good name, of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to such detailed factual charges as may be put forward. In the present case, as in all cases involving pending judicial proceedings, the Committee has requested a copy of the judgement in the case against Mr. Paz Muralles and the grounds upon which it is based since it considers that this information will be of assistance in determining whether or not the allegations are well founded.
.In all these circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee accordingly recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the Government's attention to the considerations set out in paragraph  above; and(b) in view of the fact that it is more than five years since the text of the judgement was requested, to ask the Government, as a matter of urgency, to forward the said text and the grounds on which it is based, and meanwhile to postpone its examination of the case.
.This case has already been before the Committee at its th Session (February ), when the Committee submitted to the Governing Body an interim report in paragraphs  to  of the Committee's st Report. At its th Session (May ) the Committee decided to postpone examination of the case as it had still not received the text of the judgment pronounced in the case against Mr. Eustaquio Paz Muralles, which had been requested from the Government.
.By a communication dated  December  the Government supplied information as to the stage reached in these proceedings.
.Guatemala has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its complaint, dated  October , the Latin American Confederation of Christian Trade Unionists (C.L.A.S.C.) alleged that Mr. Paz Muralles, leader of the Guatemalan Social Federation of Christian Peasants, had been subjected to unjust and prolonged imprisonment.
.In its reply the Government stated that, according to a statement made by the General Secretary of the Guatemalan Social Federation of Christian Peasants, Mr. Paz Muralles had resigned his post as Disputes Secretary of the Federation in April  to take up office in a political party, and that he was now on trial for the murder of two persons. The Government maintained that this fact had nothing whatsoever to do with freedom of association.
.In accordance with the practice followed by the Committee in similar cases in which pending proceedings might make available information of assistance to it in appreciating whether or not allegations were well founded, the Committee recommended the Governing Body in paragraph  of its st Report to decide to request the Government to supply a copy of the judgment pronounced in the case against Mr. Eustaquio Paz Muralles and the grounds on which it was based, and meanwhile to postpone examination of the case.

94,".This case was examined previously by the Committee at its sessions in May , November  and May , when it submitted interim reports which appear in paragraphs  to  of its rd Report,  to  of its th Report and  to  of its th Report, approved respectively by the Governing Body at its nd, rd and th Sessions (May-June , November  and May ).
.In those reports the Committee submitted its final conclusions with respect to some of the allegations made by the complainants, part of which refer to proceedings against trade union officers in connection with the approval and execution of a "" Battle Plan "" on the part of the General Confederation of Labour (C.G.T.) in .
.However, in paragraph  of its th Report, the Committee asked the Government to inform it of the exact nature of the offences with which two trade unionists, Mr. Felipe Ernesto Luduea and Mr. Carlos Kristoff, were charged, these persons having been mentioned in a communication from the Government dated  March . The Committee's request was conveyed to the Government by a letter dated  June , and the latter's observations were notified to the I.L.O by a communication dated  September  from the Permanent Mission of the Argentine Republic in Geneva.
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Government states that Mr. Felipe Ernesto Luduea was arrested on the public thoroughfare on  March , being found to have in his possession four sticks of gelignite and two lead detonators. The arrest took place in the presence of three witnesses, who signed the police report of confiscation and later testified in court. The judge of the criminal court of the first instance issued an indictment under sections  and bis of the Penal Code, but the case was suspended on  April  and Mr. Luduea was released the same day. As regards Mr. Kristoff the Government states that as a result of a dispute in the plumbers' union various occurrences took place which made it necessary for the police to intervene. Several persons, whose names are supplied by the Government, were brought before courts of summary jurisdiction or criminal courts on charges such as violation of freedom to work, causing bodily injury, damaging the mains of a building in construction and the discovery of eight sticks of gelignite, a detonator and a fuse on trade union premises. In one of these trials, which began on  September , Mr. Kristoff and others were charged with violation of freedom to work and causing bodily injury. In the case against Mr. Kristoff who, according to the Government, already has a police record and has previously been tried for anarchical and terrorist activities, a suspension was ordered on  November  and confirmed by the Appeals Court.
.The Government states that the proceedings against Mr. Luduea and Mr. Kristoff have no relation whatsoever to the detention of trade union leaders in connection with C.G.T's "" Battle Plan "".
.This case was examined previously by the Committee at its meetings in May  and November , when it submitted interim reports which appear in paragraphs  to  of its rd Report and in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, approved respectively by the Governing Body at its nd and rd Sessions (May  and November ).
.In those reports the Committee submitted its final conclusions with respect to some of the allegations made by the complainants, and the only aspect of the case which remains outstanding is that relating to proceedings against trade union officers. The present report therefore deals only with this point.
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.A summary of the allegations of the General Confederation of Labour (C.G.T.) with regard to proceedings against trade union officers will be found in paragraphs  and  of the Committee's rd Report. It is alleged in substance that on the initiative of the Government criminal proceedings were started against that organisation, with a request for a sentence of imprisonment on all its officers and the closing of its offices, because the C.G.T had approved a "" Battle Plan "" comprising social, economic and political objectives. Since its claims were going unheeded, the C.G.T had decided to start the occupation of factories in order to back up its demands. As a result the chairmen and general secretaries of over  organisations were charged with breaches of state security and incitement to commit offences. The detention was ordered of  union leaders.
.In its reply of  November  the Government stated (see paragraph  of the rd Report) that the execution of the so-called Battle Plan involved the commission of offences under the Penal Code, including dispossession of property and the unlawful detention of members of the staff of the undertakings concerned. The Government argued that such action had been taken not in consequence of a labour dispute with the undertakings in question but as part of a political plan. The Government pointed out that none of the trade union leaders against whom proceedings had been initiated had been kept in custody.
.In paragraph  of its rd Report the Committee recalled that it had always applied the principle that allegations respecting the right to strike were not outside its competence in so far as they affected the exercise of trade union rights. It had also pointed out that the right of workers and their organisations to strike as a legitimate means of defending their occupational interests was generally recognised. The Committee had, however, also held that the restriction of political strikes and strikes to coerce the government or the community to recognise certain action was not an infringement of trade union rights.
.The Committee observed that in the present case the object of the strike was to exert pressure on the Government and so oblige it to proceed to certain measures of an economic, social and political character, and that, moreover, the movement was accompanied by the occupation of a number of establishments and the prevention in some cases of free movement on the part of senior employees of the undertakings concerned. The Committee concluded that the proceedings entered against the trade unionists involved did not justify the allegation that trade union rights had been infringed. Nevertheless, since the complainants had also alleged that the principal officers of over  unions had been charged with security offences and that these various cases were now before the courts, the Committee requested the Government to inform it of the exact character of the offences with which the said trade union officers were charged, and to keep it posted about any new development in this connection.
.When the case came before it again at its November  meeting, the Committee observed that in referring to this aspect of the case in its communication of  August  the Government had confined itself to stating that it had asked the judicial authorities for the relevant information. The Committee therefore decided to repeat its previous request and to postpone examination of this aspect of the case pending receipt of the additional information requested from the Government.
.By a communication dated  March  the Permanent Mission of the Argentine Republic in Geneva forwarded the Government's reply to the request for further information. The Government begins by supplying certain details with regard to the proceedings against the  trade union leaders indicted in connection with the adoption of the Battle Plan, on which the Committee has already commented in its rd Report (see paragraph  above). The information now supplied by the Government includes the names of the officials in question and makes it clear that they were charged with incitement to commit an offence, which is an offence under section  of the Penal Code, in that they were responsible for the forceful measures agreed upon at the meetings of the C.G.T held on  and  January . The Government also states that, although a judge had ordered the detention of the accused in December , they were all subsequently released without prejudice to the pursuance of their case.
.The Government also gives information with regard to the proceedings against three other trade unionists. Mr. Felipe Ernesto Luduea, Trade Union Secretary of the Peronist Revolutionary Movement, who had held office with the Santa Cruz branch of the Naval Dockyard and Tanker Building Workers' Union, was charged in March  with infringement of section  of the Penal Code, which prescribes penalties for various acts of a terrorist nature. A provisional stay of proceedings was granted in April . Mr. Carlos Kristoff, Deputy Secretary of the Plumbing, Sewage, Waterworks and Allied Workers' Union, was charged in September  with interference with freedom to",-1,1964,Argentina
95,".These three cases were last examined by the Committee at its session in November  (th Report, paragraphs  to ), when the Committee submitted to the Governing Body an interim report containing the Committee's conclusions on certain aspects of the case which remained outstanding at that time. The Committee also recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to supply additional information concerning certain other aspects of the case (paragraph  (b) and (c) of the th Report).
.The aspects of the case concerning which the Committee recommended the Governing Body to request additional information were the trial or exile of certain trade unionists in , and the events which occurred in  during which workers were killed. In particular, the Committee had noted that certain trade unionists, namely Mr. Lechin Oquendo, Mr. Quispe, Mr. Pimentel and Mr. Reyes, who had been charged with common law offences, were awaiting trial, and the Government was requested to supply information on the results of the proceedings instituted against these four persons. The Government was also requested to inform the Governing Body, as soon as possible, of the position before the law of the trade unionists who, according to the complainants, were exiled in , as well as on their possibility of legally re-entering the country. The Committee had occasion, at its session in February  (th Report, paragraphs  to ) to examine the case concerning Mr. Lechin Oquendo in the context of Case No. , since the Government had supplied certain information regarding this person. It will be recalled that the Committee, in view of the information received, recommended the Governing Body to decide that, subject to the further examination of the proceedings against Mr. Lechin Oquendo in the present cases, this aspect of the case did not call for further examination. As regards the events of  in which workers were killed, the Committee recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to keep it informed of the results of the judicial investigation ordered by the Government and to supply the text of the judgment in the case against Mr. Chacn (a trade union leader against whom proceedings were instituted in respect of various offences), together with the grounds for this judgment.
.At its various sessions since November  the Committee adjourned its examination of these cases since the Government had not supplied all the information requested.
.Bolivia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In a communication addressed to the Director-General of the ILO by the Government dated  December , the Government stated that the revolutionary government which came into power on  September  adopted certain measures which were of relevance in assessing the trade union situation. These measures, the Government stated, were as follows: (a) no persons were in prison for reasons of political or trade union activities; (b) the Chancellery of the Republic had been instructed to authorise ambassadors to issue visas to any citizens now outside the country for political reasons and wishing to return; (c) the Minister of the Interior had also received instructions to expedite the trials of any persons against whom legal proceedings had been instituted under previous regimes.
.The Committee feels bound to express its concern that in spite of repeated requests to the Government for information concerning the cases of Mr. Lechin Oquendo, Mr. Quispe, Mr. Pimentel, Mr. Reyes and Mr. Chacn, this information has not yet been communicated by the Government. The Committee likewise expresses its concern that the Government has so far failed to supply the information requested concerning the outcome of the judicial investigation into the events of June  in which workers were killed. In the absence of such information, the Committee finds itself unable to reach definitive conclusions regarding these aspects of the complaints. The Committee wishes to recall in this connection that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact. This purpose cannot readily be achieved unless co-operation is obtained from both complainants and governments in the communication of information either to substantiate or refute specific allegations, thus enabling the Committee to arrive at definitive conclusions in each case.
.Furthermore, the Committee wishes to recall that on several occasions it has emphasised the importance which it attaches to the principle of prompt and fair trial by an independent and impartial judiciary in all cases, including cases in which trade unionists are charged with political or criminal offences which the government considers have no relation to their trade union functions. The Committee also points out that the communication of the texts of judgments given in such cases and the grounds on which these are based provide useful information enabling the Committee to reach its conclusions in full knowledge of the facts.
.In all the circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to take note of the Government's statement that instructions have been given authorising ambassadors to issue visas to any citizens now outside the country for political reasons and wishing to return;(b) to draw the attention of the Government to the principles expressed in paragraph  above regarding the observance of the right of trade unionists to receive a prompt and fair trial, and the communication of the texts of judgments to the Committee;(c) to express serious regret that, in spite of repeated requests for information concerning Mr. Lechin Oquendo, Mr. Quispe, Mr. Pimentel, Mr. Reyes and Mr. Chacn, as well as the results of the judicial investigation into the events of June  in which workers were killed, this information has not been received, which prevents the Committee from reaching definite conclusions regarding these aspects of the case;(d) to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that the purpose of the whole procedure of the Committee on Freedom of Association is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and that this purpose cannot be readily achieved unless co-operation is obtained both from complainants and governments in the communication of information either to substantiate or to refute specific allegations, thus enabling the Committee to arrive at definitive conclusions in each case.
.These three cases have already been examined at previous meetings of the Committee, when it submitted to the Governing Body a number of interim reports containing the Committee's conclusions on various aspects of the questions raised.
.This report refers only to those aspects which are still outstanding and on which the Governing Body, at the Committee's recommendation, had requested certain additional observations and information from the Government.
.In a communication dated  July  the Government replied to these requests.
.Bolivia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In these circumstances, with regard to these cases as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the allegations concerning the dissolution of trade unions, to note the information supplied by the Government, according to which, on the one hand, the provision-called in question by the complainants-whereby sabotage was included in the grounds for dissolving trade unions has been repealed, and, on the other hand, by virtue of a decree of  trade union organisations can only be dissolved through a court, and to decide that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination;(b) with regard to the allegations concerning the arrest or exile of trade unionists in :(i) to note the fact that Mr. Ortiz, against whom legal action was being taken, was released under an amnesty;(ii) to reaffirm the importance which it attaches to ensuring adequate safeguards in order to prevent compulsory residence measures from being used as a means of impairing the free exercise of trade union rights;(iii) to note the information supplied by the Government according to which the majority of the persons named in the complaints had neither been arrested nor imprisoned and only Mr. Lechn Oquendo, Mr. Quispe, Mr. Pimentel and Mr. Reyes are awaiting trial, charged with common law offences, and to request the Government to be good enough to keep it informed of the results of the proceedings instituted against these four persons;(iv) to request the Government to be good enough to inform it as soon as possible of the position before the law of the trade unionists who, according to the complainants, were exiled in , as well as on their possibilities of legally re-entering the country;(c) with regard to the allegations concerning the events of June , in which workers were killed, to request the Government to be good enough:(i) to keep it informed of the results of the judicial investigation as soon as this has been concluded;(ii) to supply the text of the judgment in the case against Mr. Chacn, together with the grounds for this judgment, as",0,1965,Bolivia (Plurinational State of

.The Committee has found it convenient to deal in a single paper with these three cases concerning Bolivia, in which, following the Committee's submission of certain conclusions to the Governing Body in earlier reports which were approved, certain allegations' are still outstanding and additional information on them has been sought from the Government.
.As regards Cases Nos.  and , the Government furnished certain information in a letter dated  August .
.Bolivia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but not the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.With regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the allegations concerning the assault on Mr. Juan Lechin Oquendo (August ), to decide, for the reasons stated in paragraph  above, that no useful purpose would be served by continuing its examination of these allegations;(b) with regard to the compulsory residence measures, to emphasise to the Government in general terms the importance it has always attached to the need for accompanying the compulsory residence procedure with all necessary safeguards, so that it cannot be used as a means of impairing the free exercise of trade union rights;(c) with regard to the allegations concerning the arrest and exile of trade unionists in :(i) to take note of the Government's statement that Mr. Orlando Capriles Villazn is now at liberty and Mr. Arturo Crespo is provisionally at liberty;(ii) to note that Mr. Juan Alberto Ortiz is under arrest and awaiting trial by the ordinary courts and to request the Government to be good enough to forward a copy of the judgment together with the grounds adduced therein, once it is given;(iii) to request the Government once more to be good enough to give details as early as possible concerning the offences which, according to an earlier statement by the Government, led to the arrest and exile of Mr. Juan Lechin Oquendo, together with information concerning the present position before the law of the persons listed in paragraph  above and to be good enough, should the individuals concerned be under arrest, subjected to a compulsory residence order or in exile, to state the exact nature of the actions which led to these measures being taken and the outcome of any judicial proceedings instituted in their case;(d) to request the Government to be good enough to specify as early as possible the provisions now in force concerning the dissolution of trade unions and, should sabotage still be a ground for dissolution, the penalties now in force in the country with respect to that offence;(e) to take note of this interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report when it has received the information requested in subparagraphs (c) and (d) of this paragraph.
.The Committee considers that it would be useful and convenient to deal in a single document with these two cases referring to Bolivia, which it now has under examination. Case No.  deals with the assault that, according to a complaint by the Bolivian Workers' Confederation, was made in August  on Mr. Juan Lechn, head of this Confederation. Case No.  deals with the complaints made by the Bolivian Workers' Confederation and the World Federation of Trade Unions concerning alleged repressive measures taken in May  by the Military Junta against trade union organisations and leaders.
.Bolivia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but not the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.With regard to the cases as a whole the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) in respect of the allegations relating to the assault committed in August  on Mr. Juan Lechn Oquendo, while deploring that, in spite of the numerous requests addressed to it by the Committee, the Government has sent no information since April  concerning the judicial proceedings instituted against those responsible for the assault, to request the Government to be good enough to furnish the necessary information as soon as possible;(b) in respect of the allegations concerning the events of May :(i) to take note of the statements by the Government that Mr. Juan Lechn Oquendo was arrested and deported on account of criminal acts punishable under the Penal Code;(ii) to request the Government to be good enough, having regard to the principles enunciated in paragraph  and  above, to inform it of the exact nature of the offences with which Mr. Juan Lechn Oquendo was charged and to state whether he was tried on those charges before an impartial and independent judicial authority;(iii) to request the Government to be good enough to furnish specific observations on the alleged detention or exiling of the trade unionists named in the complaint of the Bolivian Workers' Confederation dated  July  and that of the World Federation of Trade Unions dated  December ;(iv) to request the Government to be good enough to state whether the political amnesty declared by the Decree of  May  affects Mr. Lechn Oquendo and the other trade unionists referred to in clause (iii) above or not and, if it does, to state how this measure has affected the exercise by these persons of their trade union rights;(c) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report when it has received the information to be requested of the Government in accordance with subparagraphs (a) and (b) (ii), (iii) and (iv), of this paragraph.",-1,1965,Bolivia (Plurinational State of

.The Confederation's letter dated  July  was accompanied by copies of four presidential decrees: No.  dated  May , No.  dated  May  and Nos.  and  dated  June .
.In all the circumstances, and having regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the Government's attention to the fact that the provisions of Decrees Nos. ,  and  referring to intervention by the public authorities at the different stages of the procedure of electing trade union officials are incompatible with the guarantees to which trade unions are entitled under the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), which has been ratified by Bolivia, and to suggest therefore that the Government should consider amending them so as to enable workers' organisations to elect their representatives freely, the public authorities being obliged to refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof;(b) to draw the Government's attention to the fact that the provisions of Decrees Nos. ,  and  preventing the re-election of trade union officials and attaching other conditions to their election (being actively employed by the undertaking concerned, and not having been sentenced for an offence) are inconsistent with the right guaranteed by the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), to all workers to elect their representatives in full freedom, and to suggest in consequence that the Government examine the possibility of amending these provisions so as to enable workers' organisations to elect their representatives in full freedom;(c) to draw the Government's attention to the importance it has always attached to the principle that workers and employers should have the right to establish and to join organisations "" of their own choosing "", as laid down by Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), which has been ratified by Bolivia, and to suggest in consequence to the Government that it consider amending Decree No.  to bring it into line with the aforementioned principle;(d) to draw the Government's attention to the fact that the provision of Decree No.  preventing the forming of proper trade unions in recently established undertakings is not in keeping with the principle laid down by Article  of Convention No.  that all workers should have the right to establish organisations of their own choosing, and to suggest that its amendment be considered so as to enable all workers to establish their own organisations in accordance with the aforementioned principle;(e) to request the Government to inform the Committee as to what are the exact provisions in force in the country as regards penal sanctions for sabotage, and to decide in the meantime to postpone examination of this aspect of the case;(f) to bring the foregoing conclusions to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.Geneva,  November .

98,".The Committee examined this case at its meetings in May , February  and November , when it submitted to the Governing Body three interim reports contained, respectively, in paragraphs  to  of the Committee's nd Report, in paragraphs  to  of its th Report and in paragraphs  to  of its th Report.
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee observes that, since the employers' and workers' organisations did not attend the meeting convened to elect members of the permanent conciliation and arbitration board of the Department of Francisco Morazn, this body has apparently not been set up. Nevertheless, the Committee also notes that, in accordance with section  of the above-mentioned Regulations governing the appointment of workers' and employers' representatives to conciliation and arbitration boards, approved by government decision in compliance with section  of the Labour Code, if for any reason the meeting does not take place or is not attended by the majority of workers' or employers' delegates, or by both at the same time, the parties concerned will be deemed to have conferred their powers on the government delegate to elect representatives to the boards, or else the election will be undertaken by the minority present. The Committee cannot help emphasising the importance which the application of this provision seems to have in view of the role attributed by law to the conciliation and arbitration boards in undertaking the procedure which is a prerequisite to the declaration of a lawful strike.
.Furthermore the Committee recalls that in accordance with section  of the Labour Code, as amended, special conciliation and arbitration boards can be set up on a non-permanent basis, merely functioning when necessary if disputes arise in some of the different branches of industry or groups of occupations. It appears from the Government's communication that special boards of this kind have been set up on certain occasions. In this connection the Committee notes a further element, namely that in accordance with section  of the above-mentioned Regulations, this text also governs the special boards affected, in that their members can be appointed directly by the government delegate when complications arise with regard to the meeting at which such members should be elected. The Committee therefore considers that there is thus an additional means of setting up conciliation and arbitration boards which may participate in the procedure to be followed prior to the calling of a lawful strike.
.In these circumstances, having regard to the principle stated in paragraph  that when temporary restrictions are placed on the right to strike during conciliation and arbitration proceedings, such proceedings should be adequate, impartial and speedy, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to draw the Government's attention to the importance it attaches to the implementation, as soon as possible, of the provisions considered above, and to decide that this case calls for no further examination.
.The Committee examined this case previously at its meetings in May  and February , when it submitted to the Governing Body the two interim reports contained, respectively, in paragraphs  to  of the Committee's nd Report and paragraphs  to  of its th Report.
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.With regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to take note that the trade unionists Julio Csar Villalta Matamoros and Carlos Alberto Reyes Pineda were arrested by order of the judge, released on bail, and brought to trial, that they were assisted by an advocate, and that an acquittal was decided upon, and accordingly to decide that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination;(b) to request the Government once again to supply the information referred to in paragraph ;(c) to take note of this interim report, on the understanding that the Committee will submit a further report when it has received the additional information requested of the Government in clause (b) of this paragraph.
.The Committee examined this case at its meeting in May  when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body as contained in paragraphs  to  of the Committee's nd Report.
.In paragraph  of that report the Committee, before continuing its examination of the case, recommended the Governing Body to ask the Government for further information. The Governing Body having approved that recommendation, the request for additional information was conveyed to the Government, which replied by a communication dated  November .
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.With regard to the case as a whole the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) in respect of the allegations relating to the annulment of the resolutions of a trade union assembly, to decide, in view of the additional information supplied by the Government and reproduced in paragraph  above, that this aspect of the case does not call for further consideration;(b) in respect of the allegations relating to the strike by the Rio Lindo Textile Mill Workers' Union, to request the Government to be good enough to specify what measures it has taken or intends to take to establish the conciliation and arbitration boards called for by the law before a strike may lawfully be declared;(c) in respect of the allegations relating to the strike called by the Central Federation of Unions of Free Workers of Honduras, to decide, for the reasons set forth in paragraphs  and  above, to request the Government once again to supply as soon as possible additional information concerning the precise reasons which led to the arrest and trial of the trade unionists Mr. Julio Csar Villalta Matamoros and Mr. Carlos Alberto Reyes Pineda for offences against the security of the State, to keep it informed of the results of the trial, and to communicate the text of the judgments given together with the grounds therefor;(d) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report when it has received the information requested of the Government in subparagraphs (b) and (c) above.
.The complaint from the Central Federation of Unions of Free Workers of Honduras (FECESITLIH) is contained in a direct communication to the I.L.O dated  September . It was transmitted by a letter dated  October  to the Government, which sent its observations by a communication dated  January .
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.With regard to the case as a whole the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) in respect of the allegations relating to the strike by the Rio Lindo Textile Mill Workers' Union:(i) to draw the attention of the Government once again to the importance which it attaches to the opinion expressed by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations mentioned in paragraph  above;(ii) to draw the attention of the Government to the importance which it has always attached to the principle that, when temporary restrictions are placed on the right to strike such as, for example, refraining from strikes during conciliation and arbitration proceedings, such proceedings should be adequate, impartial and speedy, and to request the Government to be good enough to furnish the text of the amendments to sections  and  of the Labour Code relating to the establishment of conciliation and arbitration boards;(b) in respect of the allegations relating to the strike called by FECESITLIH, to draw the Government's attention to the importance which it attaches to the opinion expressed by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, namely that the provision of the Labour Code denying the right to strike to federations and Confederations is not compatible with Article  of Convention No. , and to request the Government to be good enough to supply the additional information mentioned in paragraphs  and  above and to reply to the allegations mentioned in paragraph ;(c) in respect of the allegations relating to the annulment of the resolutions of a trade union assembly, while again drawing the Government's attention to the principle that, when it is necessary to control the internal acts of a trade union, it is of maximum importance that, in order to guarantee an impartial and objective procedure, such control should be exercised by the relevant judicial authority, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to request the Government to inform it as soon as possible as to the present situation with regard to the procedure for the registration of the Executive Committee of FECESITLIH, and to enclose the text of",1,1965,Honduras

100,"two or more industrial undertakings.
.According to the complaint, the workers of the undertakings Productos Industrializados de la Madera and Molduras de Pino, located in the city of Parral, state of Chihuahua, formed the "" First of May "" Industrial Trade Union of Timber and Allied Workers and applied on  October  to the competent public authorities with a view to obtaining legal status; to that end, they produced the documentation required by law. In a first verbal reply, the authorities are alleged to have promised to grant the legal status applied for. The undertaking [sic], according to the complainants, adopted two different attitudes: publicly, it summoned its workers on that same day to advise them that the undertaking was glad to accept the proposals; while privately it sent a management group to the provincial capital to meet the undertaking's lawyer, who drew up a collective agreement between the C.T.M. Timber and Allied Workers' Union (a trade union which the workers concerned in this case had never recognised) and an industry called Inversiones Mineras del Norte, S.A., owned by the lawyer of the undertaking. In order to ensure the success of this manoeuvre, a group of workers trusted by the undertaking was enrolled in the aforesaid trade union. Once this had been done, the employers dismissed six workers whom they paid off fully in accordance with the law, but with an evident change of attitude.
.During the following few days, the complainants state, a change of front was also shown by the authorities, who were no longer prepared to recognise the newly formed trade union and gave as their reason imperfections of presentation, such as mistakes in spelling, drafting, etc. The workers reacted to this by organising a public demonstration to demand recognition of their legitimate trade union. On  October  the authorities officially communicated their decision to refuse the application of the "" First of May "" union on the grounds that section , subsection III, of the Federal Labour Law provided that the formation of an industrial trade union was subject to the essential requirement that its members should be persons "" engaged in the same occupation, trade or speciality, and in this particular case the workers do not fulfil the above requirements, since they do work which does not require specialisation in its performance "".
.The complainants go on to state that on the following day,  October , the employers sent  workers away from their work. The police immediately surrounded the premises of the undertaking to prevent the workers from approaching. At the same time a trade union was organised, under the control of the undertaking, which agreed to sign an agreement behind the workers' backs. All this provoked a further protest from the workers who, on  October, organised a fresh demonstration, claiming recognition of their real trade union and the reinstatement of their co-workers who had been dismissed.
.In its communication dated  May  the Government answers that the complaint in question was formulated by workers employed by two undertakings, Industrias Forestales Mexicanas and Molduras de Pino, S.A., both located in the town of Parral, and who had formed the "" First of May "" Industrial Trade Union of Timber and Allied Workers. The application for registration of that union having been rejected by the Conciliation and Arbitration Board of Parral, the trade union appealed against the Board's ruling to the First District Court of Chihuahua; the case came before the court as Dossier /, No. .The Government attaches the text of the judge's ruling handed down on  February , which grants a writ of relief, inter alia, on the grounds that section , subsection III, of the Federal Labour Law provides precisely the opposite of what is affirmed in the ruling of the Conciliation and Arbitration Board of Parral. In the preambular clauses of his ruling the judge also states that, by refusing the application for registration, the aforesaid Board violated the guarantee provided for workers under articles ,  and , subparagraph XVI, of the Mexican Constitution.
.The Government states that, since the trade union appealed for Constitutional protection of its rights, this being the means of legal redress against acts of violation which it considered had been committed against it, and since the legal reparation sought for was obtained, the complaint has become null and void.
.Concerning the allegations regarding the rejection of the "" First of May "" trade union's application for registration, the Committee observes that the complaint seems to imply that the Conciliation and Arbitration Board had been guided in issuing its ruling by an attitude of partiality towards the employers. However, the elements of information provided by the complainants in connection with this point in particular are extremely vague, so that it is difficult to investigate the grounds for such an insinuation. Consequently, the Committee takes note of the Government's observations, according to which the competent judge issued a ruling, subsequent to the presentation of the complaint to the I.L.O, protecting the said trade union against the decision of the administrative authority to reject its application for registration. However, with a view to obtaining fuller information concerning this aspect of the case, the Committee considers it necessary to request the Government to confirm whether, in compliance with the court ruling, the "" First of May "" trade union has been registered.
.Furthermore, the Government has not made any observations concerning other points raised in the complaint, in connection with the measures said to have been taken by the employers, after the application for registration by the ""First of May"" trade union, to hinder the establishment of that union. These points refer to the dismissal of six workers, the sending of another  workers away from the workplace and the signing of two collective agreements behind the backs of the workers concerned. The complaint does not show clearly how the first of these two agreements is related to the questions raised in the allegations, since it is supposed to have been signed between a third undertaking and another trade union. The second collective agreement, however, is alleged to have been signed by at least one of the two undertakings which employ the members of the "" First of May "" trade union, the other signatory being a trade union allegedly organised and controlled by the undertaking.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to take note of the information supplied by the Government in its communication of  May , according to which the competent judge issued the writ of relief requested by the "" First of May "" Industrial Trade Union of Timber and Allied Workers against the administrative decision rejecting its application for registration;(b) to ask the Government to be good enough to confirm whether, in compliance with the court ruling, the trade union in question has been registered;(c) to ask the Government to be good enough to furnish observations respecting the allegations mentioned in paragraph  above, which refer to the dismissal of six workers and the fact that  more workers were sent away from their workplace by the undertakings mentioned in the complaint, because of their trade union activities; the establishment of a trade union controlled by the employers; and the signing of collective agreements behind the workers' backs;(d) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will report further to the Governing Body when it has received the information requested from the Government in subparagraphs (b) and (c) above.Geneva,  November .

101,".This case has already been examined by the Committee at its meeting in November , when it submitted to the Governing Body an interim report contained in paragraphs  to  of its th Report.
.Mexico has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but has not ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants allege that the workers of the undertakings Industrias Forestales Mexicanas and Molduras de Pino S.A., both located in the town of Parral, who had formed the "" First of May "" Industrial Trade Union of Timber and Allied Workers, had their application for registration rejected by the Conciliation and Arbitration Board of Parral, although this application was supported by the documentation required by law, on the pretext that the members of the new trade union were not engaged in the same occupation, trade or speciality. The complainants maintain that this decision infringed the provisions of section  of the Federal Labour Law which, according to them, permits the establishment of industrial trade unions by individuals in various occupations, trades or specialities, who carry on their work in two or more industrial undertakings.
.In its observations the Government stated that the trade union had appealed to the First District Court of Chihuahua against the ruling given by the Conciliation and Arbitration Board of Parral. The Government enclosed the text of the judge's ruling handed down on  February , which granted the appeal on the ground particularly that section , subsection III, of the Federal Labour Law provided precisely the opposite of what was affirmed in the ruling of the Conciliation and Arbitration Board of Parral. In the preambular clauses of his ruling the judge also stated that, by refusing the application for registration, the aforesaid Board had totally ignored, to the detriment of the workers, the guarantees contained in articles ,  and , subsection XVI, of the Mexican Constitution.
.Following its examination of the case at its meeting in November , the Committee noted the Government's observations according to which the competent judge issued, after the presentation of the complaint to the I.L.O, a ruling requested by the union which cancelled the decision of the administrative authority rejecting the union's application for registration. With a view to obtaining fuller information concerning this aspect of the case, the Committee considered it necessary to request the Government to be good enough to confirm whether, in compliance with the court ruling, the "" First of May "" trade union had been registered, and the Committee made a recommendation to the Governing Body to this effect.
.This recommendation having been approved by the Governing Body, the Government was accordingly requested, by a letter dated  March , to supply the information in question. The Government replied by a communication dated  May .
.In this communication the Government states that the ruling pronounced on appeal by the First District Judge of Chihuahua has been fully executed and that consequently the Conciliation and Arbitration Board of Parral has registered the "" First of May "" Industrial Trade Union of Timber and Allied Workers. The Government attached to its communication a certified copy of the trade union's certificate of registration.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.
.The complainants also alleged that a collective agreement was drawn up between the C.T.M. Timber and Allied Workers' Union and an undertaking called Inversiones Mineras del Norte S.A.; they allege, furthermore, that another agreement was signed without the workers' knowledge.
.When it examined the case at its meeting in November , the Committee found that the complaint did not show clearly how the first of these two agreements was related to the questions raised in the allegations, since it was supposed to have been signed between a third undertaking and another trade union. The Committee noted, however, that the second agreement was alleged to have been signed by at least one of the two undertakings employing the members of the "" First of May "" trade union, the other signatory, according to the complainants, being a trade union allegedly organised and controlled by the undertaking.
.Noting that the Government had not submitted any observations on these aspects of the case, the Committee recommended the Governing Body to request the Government, to be good enough to furnish its observations thereon.
.In its communication of  May  the Government states that most of the workers in the undertakings in question had already joined a trade union which was a member of the Confederation of Mexican Workers (C.T.M.). It adds that the latter had already "" signed a collective agreement with the undertaking before the formation of the First of May trade union.""
.In view of the explanations furnished by the Government and because of the somewhat vague nature of the allegations, the Committee considers that the complainants have not proved that there was any infringement of freedom of association involved in these facts and it therefore recommends the Governing Body to consider that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.
.The complainants further allege that six workers were dismissed by their employers. As the Government did not refer to this aspect of the case in its original observations, the Committee, at its meeting in November , recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to furnish a reply on the allegation in question.,
.In its communication of  May  the Government states emphatically that in general it cannot be held responsible for employers' attitudes towards their workers. It adds that, in any case, Mexican legislation offers a very wide range of legal measures enabling anyone who considers that his rights in respect of an employment relationship are being infringed to appeal to the courts in order to obtain justice.
.The Government goes on to state that  workers (and not six as the complainants had said) who were members of the "" First of May "" trade union were dismissed on  October ; the Government gives the names of the persons concerned. It continues by pointing out that these workers appealed against the dismissal, that the appeal was heard on  March  by the Conciliation and Arbitration Board of Parral and that the ruling given by this court absolved the undertaking of all responsibility.
.The Government ends by stating that neither the workers nor the trade union lodged an appeal against this judgment. "" It must therefore be concluded "", the Government states, "" that from the legal point of view this ruling is accepted.""
.The Committee wishes to point out, as it has when examining previous cases', that in view of the nature of its responsibilities, it cannot consider it is bound by any rule that national procedures of redress must be exhausted, such as applies, for instance, to international claims tribunals. It must however have regard, in examining the merits of a case, to the fact that a national remedy before an independent tribunal, the procedure of which offers appropriate guarantees, has not been pursued.
.In the present case it appears that neither the persons concerned nor the trade union took advantage of the opportunities of appeal open to them and that they have not therefore tried - as they could have done - to secure redress of the wrongs which they claim to have suffered.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to consider that this aspect of the matter does not call for further examination.
.In view of the foregoing, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide, for the reasons given in paragraphs  and , ,  and  above, that the case as a whole does not call for further examination.
.In a communication dated  November  the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions submitted a complaint against the Government of Mexico for alleged violations of freedom of association. The complaint was forwarded to the Government, which sent its observations to the I.L.O by a communication dated  May  from the Permanent Delegation of Mexico in Geneva.
.Mexico has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but has not ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants allege that for some time government officials, together with employers and even some trade unionists, have been making numerous attacks on freedom of association. Although Mexico has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), certain representatives of the Government persist in hindering and even preventing the free operation of the trade union movement, which is contrary to Mexican federal law. The complainants quote in this connection the provisions of part of section  of the relevant legislation concerning the formation of industrial trade unions. According to the law, such unions may be formed by individuals in various occupations, trades or specialities, who carry on their work in",-1,1965,Mexico
102,".By a communication dated  May  the Latin American Confederation of Christian Trade Unionists (C.L.A.S.C.) lodged a complaint alleging violation of freedom of association by the Government of Paraguay. This communication was transmitted to the Government, which sent its observations on  August .
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but not the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.C.L.A.S.C alleges that Mr. Efigenio Fernndez, General Secretary of the Christian Workers' Association (C.C.T.), was arrested on  May  after protesting on behalf of C.C.T against the arrest of Mr. Fulgencio Bareiro Rodas, Executive Secretary of C.L.A.S.C for the Atlantic region. The complaint states that Mr. Bareiro Rodas was arrested in connection with a telegram he had received from an organisation of Cuban workers in exile, that Mr. Fernndez was still under arrest at the time of the complaint and that no news had been received of him since his arrest.
.With regard to Mr. Bareiro Rodas, Executive Secretary of C.L.A.S.C for the Atlantic region, the Government explains in its communication of  August  that his arrest was ordered with a view to investigating the wording of a telegram he had received referring to "" mobilisation of organisations "". The Government believed that this expression might be interpreted in the sense of a rising by the trade unions with a view to overthrowing the established order. The Government further states that Mr. Bareiro Rodas was immediately released and it quotes the wording of the telegram, which was sent from Caracas and was signed by Mr. Eduardo Garcia, who is Executive Secretary of C.L.A.S.C for the Caribbean region according to the information available to the International Labour Office. The wording of the telegram as quoted by the Government is as follows:Please mobilise C.L.A.S.C organisations in zone to demand stoppage indiscriminate bombardment Dominican civilian population guarantee human rights and restoration of democracy and liberty and prevent unilateral intervention by United States.
.The Committee believes it may understand that as soon as the authorities were convinced that the telegram was not intended for the purpose originally suspected they immediately released Mr. Bareiro Rodas. The text as transcribed does not relate specifically to trade union matters but rather to political action in regard to which the Committee is not competent.
.In these circumstances the Committee, considering that the evidence submitted does not show that the measures taken by the authorities with regard to Mr. Bareiro Rodas constitute violation of freedom of association, recommends that the Governing Body decide that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.
.With regard to Mr. Fernndez the Government states that he was arrested on the grounds of contempt of authority, as described in section  of the Penal Code, and was released on  May .
.Since the complainants state that Mr. Fernndez was arrested on  May , he would seem to have been under arrest for some ten days. The Committee concludes that the charges referred to in the previous paragraph were not maintained.
.In numerous cases in the past the Committee has pointed out that in all cases in which trade union leaders are preventively detained these measures may involve a serious interference with the exercise of trade union rights; that it would appear necessary that they should be justified by a serious emergency; that, unless accompanied by adequate judicial safeguards applied within a reasonable period, they are open to criticism; and that it should be the policy of every government to ensure that human rights are properly safeguarded, particularly the right of all detained persons to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment. The Committee has also pointed out that the detention by the authorities of trade unionists concerning whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found is liable to involve restrictions of trade union rights.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to note that Mr. Fernndez has been released and to decide, therefore, while pointing out to the Government that the detention of trade unionists concerning whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found is liable to involve restrictions of trade union rights, that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.
.In view of the above, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the arrest of Mr. Fulgencio Bareiro Rodas, to note that this trade union leader has been released, and to decide, for the reasons stated in paragraph  above, that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination;(b) as regards the arrest of Mr. Efigenio Fernndez, to note that this trade union leader has been released, and to decide, therefore, while pointing out to the Government that the detention of trade unionists concerning whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found is liable to involve restrictions of trade union rights, that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.",-1,1965,Paraguay
103,".The complaint of the Trade Union Federation of Panama Workers is contained in a communication dated  June  and forwarded directly to the ILO. The complainants were informed by a letter dated  July  of their right to submit further information in support of their complaint, but they did not avail themselves of this opportunity. The complaint was forwarded on  July  to the Government, which presented its observations thereon in a communication dated  September .
.Panama has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants allege, though in general terms, that most employers, particularly where there are large numbers of workers, as in large national and foreign undertakings like the CONOCO Oil Refinery or the Chiriqui Land Company, tolerate the existence of trade unions only so far as they are subjected to their will and that in this way they flagrantly violate the trade union rights of the workers, with the consent of the authorities.
.The complainants also allege, without giving details, that the active members and officers of the trade unions are the subject of reprisals and that their names are entered on "" black lists "".
.Finally, the complainants call on the ILO to put pressure on the Government to ensure respect for freedom of association in the country.
.The Government states in its observations that the National Constitution embodies the right to form trade unions and ensures freedom of association to all "" salaried employees, wage earners, professional workers and employers of all classes "". It indicates that when it happens that the legislative provisions in the field are violated, the administrative labour authorities are "" prompt to deal with any such problems, making use, when necessary, of the means that the law empowers them to employ "".
.The Government continues by stating that the law protects in particular the members and officers of trade unions and adds that section  of the Labour Code, which is relevant to the question, is constantly applied by the administrative labour authorities and by the labour court. The Government quotes section  of the Code which is as follows:Members of industrial associations which are in process of formation and members of the committees of management of such associations and trade union delegates, to whom section  () of this Code refers, shall not be dismissed, their conditions of employment shall not be altered for the worse, and they shall not be transferred to other establishments of the same undertaking or to a different municipality without the authorisation of a competent judge subject to the statutory conditions. This right shall be extended for a period of one year after a worker has ceased to be a member of the committee of management, having completed the period for which he was appointed, and for three months after he has completed his period as a trade union delegate.
.The Government then asserts categorically that the allegation that the trade union organisations are subservient to the employers with the consent of the labour authorities is entirely without foundation. In this connection it points out that the organisations to which the complainants seem to refer are powerful ones, the Oilworkers' Union and the Workers' Union of the Chiriqui Land Company each having over , members, and have signed with the undertakings collective agreements whose terms are very often more favourable than the provisions of the national labour legislation.
.The Committee notes that the Government supplies detailed observations in reply to the allegations of the complainants. It also notes that these allegations are framed in very general terms. There is, indeed, no precise fact to support their assertion that the trade unions are subservient to the employers; nor is there any example of the alleged reprisals taken against active members and officers of the trade unions or of their being put on "" black lists "".
.In these circumstances, and taking into account the fact that the complainant organisation did not supply further information in support of its complaint, although it had been offered the opportunity to do so, the Committee considers that the complainants have not proved their contentions and therefore recommends the Governing Body to decide that this case, which dates from , does not call for further examination.",-1,1965,Panama
104,".The complaint was submitted by a letter dated  March  from the Postal, Telegraph and Telephone International (P.T.T.I.). The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (I.C.F.T.U.) supported the complaint in a letter dated  March .
.Ecuador has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.P.T.T.I's complaint contains detailed allegations respecting acts of interference by the public authorities in the affairs of the National Federation of Telecommunications Employees (FENETEL), which is affiliated to the complaining organisation. Among these acts mention is made of a ministerial order dated  April  ordering changes in the by-laws of the Federation and dissolving its executive committee; the imposition of a new committee sponsored by the Telecommunications Company; the suspension of the payment of members' contributions to the executive committee of the Federation; the expulsion of that committee from the Federation's headquarters and the transfer of its property to the "" company union ""; interference with a congress held in October , and the dismissal from his job of the General Secretary of the Federation, Mr. Jos Maria Larco Vera. The complainants also allege that on  February  a warrant was issued for the arrest of Mr. Larco Vera. The complaining organisation requests the intervention of the I.L.O to secure withdrawal of this warrant, put an end to the Government's acts of interference in the internal affairs of the Federation and ensure recognition of the dissolved executive committee.
.At its November  session, the Committee, observing that the Government's answer dated  May  did not specifically refer to the allegations made by the complainant, requested the Director-General to obtain the relevant further information and meanwhile adjourned further examination of the case. This decision was notified to the Government in a letter dated  November . At its February  session the Committee decided once again to postpone examination of the case, as it still had not received the additional information requested from the Government. The Government was informed of this decision by a letter dated  March .
.By a communication dated  March  the Government forwarded a copy of a letter signed by Mr. Jos Benitez Coli, President of FENETEL, and sent to the Regional Director of P.T.T.I on  March . The signatory of this letter, emphasising that FENETEL was functioning normally and was protected by the guarantees afforded under the law and that the good relations which existed between that organisation and P.T.T.I had been re-established, requested the latter organisation to withdraw its complaint. The Government therefore asked that the case be closed.
.At its May  session the Committee, not having received any communication from the complaining organisation as to whether or not it intended to withdraw its complaint, observed that the withdrawal of a complaint raised a procedural point which the Committee had already been called upon to examine in the past. In Case No.  (Greece) the Committee had expressed the view that the desire shown by a complaining organisation to withdraw its complaint, while constituting a factor to which the greatest attention must be paid, was not in itself sufficient reason for the Committee to cease automatically to proceed with the examination of the complaint. It considered in this respect that it should be guided by the conclusions approved by the Governing Body in  and  with regard to two representations submitted by the Madras Labour Union for Textile Workers and by the Socit de Bienfaisance des Travailleurs de l'Ile Maurice, in accordance with article  of the Constitution of the Organisation (now article ). The Governing Body at that time established the principle that, from the moment that a representation was submitted to it, it alone was competent to decide what effect should be given to it, and that "" the withdrawal by the organisation making the representation is not always proof that the representation is not receivable or is not well founded "". The Committee considered that, in implementing this principle, it was free to evaluate the reasons given to explain the withdrawal of a complaint and to investigate whether they appeared sufficiently plausible to lead one to believe that the withdrawal was made in complete independence.
.Under these circumstances the Committee considered it advisable, before proceeding with the examination of the case, to request the complaining organisation to be good enough to state how the matter stands and indicate whether it desires to maintain its complaint or, if not, what reasons it has for not wishing the matter to be pursued further. The Committee, therefore, requested the Director-General to seek this additional information from P.T.T.I, adjourning in the meantime its examination of the case. This decision was communicated to P.T.T.I by a letter dated  June .
.In a communication dated  September  P.T.T.I states that the problem of FENETEL to which the complaint relates has been satisfactorily settled thanks to the intervention of the Regional Office of the complaining organisation, and that, moreover, the Government against which the complaint was made is no longer in power. In these circumstances the complaining organisation considers that it would be purposeless to examine the matter further. It expresses regret, however, that the procedure for the consideration of complaints of violation of freedom of association submitted to the I.L.O. "" is such as to rule out in practice the possibility of the I.L.O making an impact at the right time "" in situations such as that which arose in the case of FENETEL.
.The Committee considers that the reasons given by P.T.T.I for withdrawing the complaint are sufficient to justify it in closing the matter. Further, as the complaint was presented by an international organisation, it can be confidently presumed that the decision to withdraw it has been taken in complete independence. As regards the views expressed by the complainant with respect to the existing procedure for the examination of complaints of violations of trade union rights submitted to the International Labour Organisation, it is difficult to see in which precise context those views are presented. In any case, the expression of these views does not appear to add any new allegations to the complaint concerning which the Committee is called upon to give its opinion.
.In the circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that the case does not call for further examination.",1,1965,Ecuador
105,".This case, which goes back to , was previously examined by the Committee at its sessions in November , November  and May . On these occasions the Committee submitted to the Governing Body, which approved them, three interim reports which appear in paragraphs - of the Committee's th Report, paragraphs - of its rd Report and paragraphs - of its th Report respectively.
.Following its last examination of the case, the Committee had submitted its final conclusions on all the allegations except one, which related to acts of terrorism said to have been perpetrated against certain trade union organisations. It is this last allegation that will be dealt with in the following paragraphs.
.Guatemala has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).Allegations relating to Acts of Terrorism Perpetrated against Trade Union Organisations
.In a communication dated  May  the Autonomous Trade Union Federation of Guatemala (FASGUA) referred in general terms to the repression to which trade unionism in Guatemala had been subjected since . The complainants stated that trade union leaders had been imprisoned, tortured and murdered. As a concrete example they stated that on the morning of  May  "" our workers' union was the victim of an attack which practically destroyed our offices and seriously endangered the lives of hundreds of peasants who, having attended a general assembly on the previous evening, were sleeping in the FASGUA building "". They added that, in the situation then prevailing in the country, they were prevented from carrying out their trade union activities normally by clandestine organisations which, they maintained, threatened the lives of the trade union leaders; in some cases these threats are alleged to have been carried out since "" several peasants' and workers' leaders "" had been murdered.
.The Committee, which had the case before it at its session in May , noted that the Government had not submitted its observations on this aspect of the case and recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to furnish the said observations. The Government complied with this request in its communication dated  January .
.In its observations, the Government states firstly that the state bodies and institutions are constantly on the alert in order to protect the free exercise of the prerogatives and rights of the trade union organisations of the country and of their members, "" as is proved by the fact that their respective programmes are freely implemented "". The Government specifies that, for its part, the FASGUA is perfectly free to carry out its activities in the various occupational sectors and that, in the matters with which it deals, it enjoys the same treatment as other trade union organisations as far as the various administrative services and labour courts are concerned.
.The Government goes on to refer to the gravity of the country's present situation as a result of the activities of terrorist groups acting outside the law and threatening the institutions and law and order. It nevertheless states that it is doing everything possible to defend the institutions, that it has strengthened the services responsible for maintaining law and order and that it is carrying out its duties normally with the co-operation of employers' and workers' organisations.
.As regards the allegations themselves, the Government indicates firstly that nothing in them points to any responsibility or guilt, whether by action or omission, that could be imputed to the state bodies or institutions. It also points out that the said allegations consist essentially in generalities "" and that there is no precise information on any of the alleged facts and no one is identified as having been the victim of any sort of offence whatsoever"".
.The Government concludes by stating that after making investigations, it has been unable to find evidence of any of the incidents alleged by the complainants.
.The Committee has to recognise that, as is pointed out by the Government, the allegations made by the FASGUA are of a very general nature and that they seem to bear on information often going back over a long period. Apart from the reference to an attack on the offices of the FASGUA-where it is not specified whether it was supposed to have been made by the authorities or by terrorist groups-no precise information is given nor any person identified. The Committee notes furthermore that the Government states that the inquiries made have not enabled it to establish whether the alleged incidents actually took place.
.Although the information available to the Committee reveals a disturbed situation, of which the Government is not unaware, it does not make it possible to establish whether the latter has actually infringed freedom of association, either actively or by omission.
.In these circumstances, in view of the fact that the events referred to by the complainants mostly go back a long way and, above all, considering that the complainants have provided no evidence for what they maintain, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that the case calls for no further consideration on its part.
.This case, in which the original complaint goes back to , was previously examined by the Committee at its November  and November  sessions. On these occasions, the Committee submitted to the Governing Body the interim reports appearing in paragraphs  to  of its th Report and paragraphs  to  of its rd Report. These interim reports were approved by the Governing Body.
.In paragraph  of its rd Report the Committee recommended the Governing Body to request the Government once again to send its specific observations on an aspect of the case that was still awaiting examination, namely the alleged detention of nine trade unionists who had been named in the complaint. The rd Report of the Committee was approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ).
.In a letter dated  May  the Autonomous Trade Union Federation of Guatemala (FASGUA) submitted further allegations of infringements of trade union rights in that country. The text of the allegations was forwarded to the Government with a letter dated  June . At its November  and February  sessions, the Committee postponed consideration of the case as a whole because it had not received the observations of the Government on these further allegations.
.Guatemala has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In these circumstances, with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) for the reasons stated in paragraph  above, to decide that there would be no point in continuing to examine the allegations concerning the detention of trade unionists in May ;(b) to ask the Government to be good enough to supply its observations on the allegations mentioned in paragraph  above as soon as possible;(c) to take note of this interim report, on the understanding that the Committee will submit a further report when it has received the supplementary observations requested of the Government.
.The Committee examined this case at its st Session (November ), when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body which is contained in paragraphs  to  of the th Report of the Committee; that report was approved by the Governing Body at its rd Session (November ).
.In that report the Committee submitted its final recommendations concerning part of the allegations made in the complaint. The allegations whose examination was postponed referred to the detention of trade union leaders.
.Guatemala has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In part of the complaint, which is dated  May , the complainants allege that on the occasion of the May Day celebrations in  the following members of the Executive Committee of the Autonomous Trade Union Federation of Guatemala (FASGUA) were arrested and are still in prison: Miguel Valdez Girn, Gilberto Barillas and Francisco de Jesus Mayn. The same applies to a number of former leaders or active members of the organisation, including Antonio Ovando Snchez, Marco Aurelio Garcia Benavente, Arturo Hernndez, Elfego H. Garcia, Alberto Bautista, Juan Lemus and others. Messrs. Valdez Girn, Mayn and Ovando Snchez were alleged to have already been arrested previously, in accordance with "" security measures "" taken under special legislation by which the Government can detain persons for up to six months without trial.
.When examining the case at its November  session the Committee observed that the Government had not made observations referring specifically to these allegations. In fact, the Government's reply dated  June  contained only general statements concerning the autonomy of the judiciary, the impossibility of arresting anyone who had not committed an offence and the fact that the functions of trade union leadership did not exempt any person from compliance with the laws of the land",-1,1965,Guatemala
106,"or from the jurisdiction of the courts which were competent to judge actions punishable by law. The Government also stated that it would ask the appropriate authorities for clarification on the points mentioned in the complaint.
.The Committee pointed out in paragraph  of its th Report that one of the principles laid down under the procedure for examining allegations concerning alleged infringements of trade union rights is that when detailed allegations are submitted the Committee cannot be satisfied with replies from governments which confine themselves to comments of a general character. Consequently, the Committee made the following recommendation to the Governing Body in paragraph  (b) of that report: with respect to the complainants' allegations that as a result of the parade on May Day this year a number of trade unionists were arrested and that legislation is in force in Guatemala-and has been applied to three trade unionists-which makes it possible to keep persons under arrest for up to six months without trial, to note that the Government will ask the appropriate authorities to supply the information needed to ascertain the truth about the complaint and to request the Government to be good enough to forward, as soon as possible, its specific observations on these allegations, giving details, in particular about the position of the trade unionists whose names are listed in paragraph  above.
.In a communication dated  July  the Government states that the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare has ascertained that none of the violations complained against by the Autonomous Trade Union Federation of Guatemala has been committed and that it therefore categorically rejects the charges made concerning freedom of association.
.From the brief communication from the Government mentioned in the above paragraph, it would appear that the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare has carried out an inquiry into the circumstances complained of. However, the communication does not contain the specific information which the Government was asked to supply in paragraph  (b) of the th Report, quoted in paragraph  above. It should be stressed that this aspect of the case brings it within the category of cases which the Governing Body considers to be urgent, and that the Government's attention was drawn to this fact when the complaint was communicated to it.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to request the Government once again to be good enough to forward the observations requested in paragraph  (b) of the th Report of the Committee as a matter of urgency;(b) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report on this case to the Governing Body when it has received the observations and information to be requested from the Government as indicated in subparagraph (a) above.
.The complaint by the Autonomous Trade Union Federation of Guatemala (FASGUA) was submitted in a letter dated  May . This letter was duly forwarded to the Government, which sent in its observations on  June . The complainants have not made use of the right to submit additional information in support of their complaint.
.Guatemala has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complaint alleges that although the Government authorised the May Day celebrations in the capital two days before the event, it prohibited them in the rest of the country. The complainants state that the authorisation given to FASGUA to hold a parade and a meeting in the capital was in fact worthless because the parade took place under the control of the police who, on the pretext that elements hostile to the Government and unconnected with the workers' organisations were distributing printed May Day greetings to the workers, broke up the parade and arrested the main trade union leaders. The following were arrested and are stated to be still in prison: Miguel Valdez Girn, Gilberto Barillas and Francisco de Jess Mayn, members of the executive committee of FASGUA; and Antonio Ovando Snchez, Marco Aurelio Garcia Benavente, Arturo Hernndez, Elfego H. Garcia, Alberto Bautista, Juan Lemus and others, former leaders or active members of the organisation. The arrest of Miguel Valdez Girn, Francisco de Jess Mayn and Antonio Ovando Snchez was alleged to have taken place only a few days after their release from prison, where they had been held in accordance with "" security measures "" taken under special legislation, by which the Government can detain citizens for up to six months without trial.
.In its observations dated  June  the Government states that since its installation it has laid down and strictly followed the principle that all citizens should be guaranteed their legal rights and it has at no time, not even when the democratic institutions of the country were threatened, pursued any aim other than that of safeguarding public order and well-being. The Government adds that it has had to cope with a number of difficult situations, such as the criminal attacks in which several of its officials have died, among them the former Deputy Minister of National Defence, but even so it has never taken repressive action.
.The Government states that the complaint is unfounded. The May Day parade this year was carried out without any hindrance and no restrictions were placed on it. As regards the arrest of trade union leaders the Government states generally that the Guatemalan Constitution safeguards the autonomy of the judiciary and courts and that nobody is arrested in Guatemala unless he has committed an offence. It points out that the functions of trade union leadership do not exempt any person from compliance with the laws of the land or from the jurisdiction of the courts which are competent to judge unlawful actions, and that while the Government collaborates with the trade union movement it cannot grant privileged legal status to trade union leaders who so far forget their responsibilities as to engage in unlawful acts. The Government concludes that it will ask the appropriate authorities for details concerning the allegation and that, if the I.L.O wishes, it will forward particulars of the charges against the individuals in question.
.In various earlier cases the Committee has stated that the right to call public meetings, especially on May Day, is an important aspect of trade union rights.
.The Committee observes that, in reply to the complainants' allegation that the Government allowed May Day to be celebrated in the capital but not in the remainder of the country, the Government replies that in fact no restriction was imposed. The complainants have not submitted any evidence, nor have they availed themselves of their right to submit additional information in support of their complaint. Accordingly, the Committee considers that no useful purpose would be served by continuing its examination of this allegation.
.In these circumstances and for the reasons given in the preceding paragraph, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to take note of the Government's statement that no restriction was imposed on the celebration of May Day this year and to decide that no useful purpose would be served by continuing its examination of this aspect of the case.
.As regards the complainants' allegations that as a result of the May Day parade a number of trade unionists, nine of whom are named in the complaint, were arrested, and that the legislation in force in Guatemala, under the heading of security measures, makes it possible to keep persons under arrest for six months without bringing them to trial and that three trade unionists (see paragraph  above) have been held by virtue of these powers, the Committee observes that the Government's reply appears to refer to these allegations only indirectly.
.One of the principles laid down under the procedure for examining allegations concerning the breach of trade union rights is that, when detailed allegations are submitted, the Committee cannot be satisfied with replies from governments which confine themselves to comments of a general character. In this case the Committee welcomes the Government's statement that it will ask the appropriate authorities to supply the information needed to ascertain the truth about the complaint.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to take note of the fact that the Government intends to ask the appropriate authorities to supply the information needed to ascertain the truth about the complaint and to ask the Government to be good enough to forward, as soon as possible, its specific observations on the allegations referred to in the previous paragraph with, in particular, precise information concerning the position vis--vis the courts of the following trade unionists: Miguel Valdez Girn, Gilberto Barillas, Francisco de Jess Mayn, Antonio Ovando Snchez, Marco Aurelio Garcia Benavente, Arturo Hernndez, Elfego H. Garcia, Alberto Bautista and Juan Lemus; and to decide to postpone its examination of this aspect of the case until it has received these specific observations and details from the Government.

.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.At its session in May  the Committee had recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to forward its observations concerning one aspect of the complaint which remained outstanding, namely the allegations relating to the presence of police at trade union meetings. In this connection, the complainants had alleged that, to hold a trade union meeting, permission must be obtained from the police, who send an agent to attend the meeting and demand a copy of the minutes. In support of this allegation, the complainants supplied a copy of an application made on  January  by the Union of Printing Trade Workers of Paraguay to the Chief of Police of Asuncin, requesting permission to hold its ordinary General Assembly.
.Since May  the Committee has repeatedly postponed its examination of the case as no observations on this outstanding aspect of the case have been received from the Government. At its session in May  the Committee took note of a communication from the Government indicating that the matter in question was under examination by the competent national authorities. No observations, however, have yet been received from the Government on this matter.
.In these circumstances, the Committee wishes to draw attention to the fact that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact and that, if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments for their part will recognise the importance, for the protection of their own good name, of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to such detailed factual charges as may be put forward. In the present case, the complainants have presented allegations which, in the opinion of the Committee, are sufficiently substantiated to warrant further inquiry. Such detailed allegations against a government should be met by detailed observations by the government concerned, in order to enable the Committee to reach definitive conclusions thereon. The Committee can only regret that, despite repeated requests, no reply on the allegations remaining outstanding has yet been received from the Government, thereby preventing the Committee from reaching conclusions in this case.
.With regard to the substance of the allegations, the Committee has frequently recalled that freedom from government interference in the holding and proceedings of trade union meetings constitutes an essential element of trade union rights and the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof. A situation in which prior permission was required for the holding of a trade union meeting, the presence of the police at such meetings and the requirement to furnish copies of the minutes of such meetings would clearly be incompatible with this principle.
.In the circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to regret that, despite the many requests made since , the Government has not transmitted its observations concerning the allegations relating to the presence of police at trade union meetings;(b) to draw the attention of the Government to the considerations expressed in paragraph  above;(c) to draw the attention of the Government to the principle that freedom from government interference in the holding and proceedings of trade union meetings constitutes an essential element of trade union rights and the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof; and(d) to draw the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to this case.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions dated  May . It was transmitted to the Government by a letter dated  May . At its meetings in May , November  and February  the Committee repeatedly postponed examination of the case as no observations had been received from the Government.
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but not the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.With regard to the case as a whole the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) in respect of the allegations relating to the registration of the Union of Salary and Wage Earners in Commerce:(i) to take note of the fact that the organisation in question has been registered since the complaint was submitted;(ii) to draw the Government's attention none the less to the importance which should be attached to the provisions of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Paraguay, to the effect that workers' organisations shall have the right to draw up their Constitutions and rules and to formulate their programmes, and that the public authorities shall refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof (Article  of the Convention), and to the principle that the right of workers to establish freely organisations of their own choosing (Article  of the Convention) cannot be considered to exist until such time as it is fully recognised and observed both de facto and de jure;(b) in respect of the allegations relating to the presence of police at trade union meetings, to request the Government to be good enough to forward its observations upon these allegations;(c) to take note of the present interim report on the understanding that the Committee will report further on receipt of the observations to be requested from the Government under subparagraph (b) of this paragraph.",1,1965,Paraguay
109,".These three cases were last examined by the Committee at its session in November  (th Report, paragraphs  to ), when the Committee submitted to the Governing Body an interim report containing the Committee's conclusions on certain aspects of the case which remained outstanding at that time. The Committee also recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to supply additional information concerning certain other aspects of the case (paragraph  (b) and (c) of the th Report).
.The aspects of the case concerning which the Committee recommended the Governing Body to request additional information were the trial or exile of certain trade unionists in , and the events which occurred in  during which workers were killed. In particular, the Committee had noted that certain trade unionists, namely Mr. Lechin Oquendo, Mr. Quispe, Mr. Pimentel and Mr. Reyes, who had been charged with common law offences, were awaiting trial, and the Government was requested to supply information on the results of the proceedings instituted against these four persons. The Government was also requested to inform the Governing Body, as soon as possible, of the position before the law of the trade unionists who, according to the complainants, were exiled in , as well as on their possibility of legally re-entering the country. The Committee had occasion, at its session in February  (th Report, paragraphs  to ) to examine the case concerning Mr. Lechin Oquendo in the context of Case No. , since the Government had supplied certain information regarding this person. It will be recalled that the Committee, in view of the information received, recommended the Governing Body to decide that, subject to the further examination of the proceedings against Mr. Lechin Oquendo in the present cases, this aspect of the case did not call for further examination. As regards the events of  in which workers were killed, the Committee recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to keep it informed of the results of the judicial investigation ordered by the Government and to supply the text of the judgment in the case against Mr. Chacn (a trade union leader against whom proceedings were instituted in respect of various offences), together with the grounds for this judgment.
.At its various sessions since November  the Committee adjourned its examination of these cases since the Government had not supplied all the information requested.
.Bolivia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In a communication addressed to the Director-General of the ILO by the Government dated  December , the Government stated that the revolutionary government which came into power on  September  adopted certain measures which were of relevance in assessing the trade union situation. These measures, the Government stated, were as follows: (a) no persons were in prison for reasons of political or trade union activities; (b) the Chancellery of the Republic had been instructed to authorise ambassadors to issue visas to any citizens now outside the country for political reasons and wishing to return; (c) the Minister of the Interior had also received instructions to expedite the trials of any persons against whom legal proceedings had been instituted under previous regimes.
.The Committee feels bound to express its concern that in spite of repeated requests to the Government for information concerning the cases of Mr. Lechin Oquendo, Mr. Quispe, Mr. Pimentel, Mr. Reyes and Mr. Chacn, this information has not yet been communicated by the Government. The Committee likewise expresses its concern that the Government has so far failed to supply the information requested concerning the outcome of the judicial investigation into the events of June  in which workers were killed. In the absence of such information, the Committee finds itself unable to reach definitive conclusions regarding these aspects of the complaints. The Committee wishes to recall in this connection that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact. This purpose cannot readily be achieved unless co-operation is obtained from both complainants and governments in the communication of information either to substantiate or refute specific allegations, thus enabling the Committee to arrive at definitive conclusions in each case.
.Furthermore, the Committee wishes to recall that on several occasions it has emphasised the importance which it attaches to the principle of prompt and fair trial by an independent and impartial judiciary in all cases, including cases in which trade unionists are charged with political or criminal offences which the government considers have no relation to their trade union functions. The Committee also points out that the communication of the texts of judgments given in such cases and the grounds on which these are based provide useful information enabling the Committee to reach its conclusions in full knowledge of the facts.
.In all the circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to take note of the Government's statement that instructions have been given authorising ambassadors to issue visas to any citizens now outside the country for political reasons and wishing to return;(b) to draw the attention of the Government to the principles expressed in paragraph  above regarding the observance of the right of trade unionists to receive a prompt and fair trial, and the communication of the texts of judgments to the Committee;(c) to express serious regret that, in spite of repeated requests for information concerning Mr. Lechin Oquendo, Mr. Quispe, Mr. Pimentel, Mr. Reyes and Mr. Chacn, as well as the results of the judicial investigation into the events of June  in which workers were killed, this information has not been received, which prevents the Committee from reaching definite conclusions regarding these aspects of the case;(d) to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that the purpose of the whole procedure of the Committee on Freedom of Association is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and that this purpose cannot be readily achieved unless co-operation is obtained both from complainants and governments in the communication of information either to substantiate or to refute specific allegations, thus enabling the Committee to arrive at definitive conclusions in each case.
.These three cases have already been examined at previous meetings of the Committee, when it submitted to the Governing Body a number of interim reports containing the Committee's conclusions on various aspects of the questions raised.
.This report refers only to those aspects which are still outstanding and on which the Governing Body, at the Committee's recommendation, had requested certain additional observations and information from the Government.
.In a communication dated  July  the Government replied to these requests.
.Bolivia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In these circumstances, with regard to these cases as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the allegations concerning the dissolution of trade unions, to note the information supplied by the Government, according to which, on the one hand, the provision-called in question by the complainants-whereby sabotage was included in the grounds for dissolving trade unions has been repealed, and, on the other hand, by virtue of a decree of  trade union organisations can only be dissolved through a court, and to decide that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination;(b) with regard to the allegations concerning the arrest or exile of trade unionists in :(i) to note the fact that Mr. Ortiz, against whom legal action was being taken, was released under an amnesty;(ii) to reaffirm the importance which it attaches to ensuring adequate safeguards in order to prevent compulsory residence measures from being used as a means of impairing the free exercise of trade union rights;(iii) to note the information supplied by the Government according to which the majority of the persons named in the complaints had neither been arrested nor imprisoned and only Mr. Lechn Oquendo, Mr. Quispe, Mr. Pimentel and Mr. Reyes are awaiting trial, charged with common law offences, and to request the Government to be good enough to keep it informed of the results of the proceedings instituted against these four persons;(iv) to request the Government to be good enough to inform it as soon as possible of the position before the law of the trade unionists who, according to the complainants, were exiled in , as well as on their possibilities of legally re-entering the country;(c) with regard to the allegations concerning the events of June , in which workers were killed, to request the Government to be good enough:(i) to keep it informed of the results of the judicial investigation as soon as this has been concluded;(ii) to supply the text of the judgment in the case against Mr. Chacn, together with the grounds for this judgment, as",0,1965,Bolivia (Plurinational State of

The only point that remained to be dealt with was an allegation to the effect that the undertaking had coerced a leader of the complainant trade union to resign from office.
.Since the Government had not sent its observations on this particular aspect of the matter, the Committee had recommended the Governing Body, in paragraph  (d) of its th Report, to request the Government to be so good as to send those observations. After the Governing Body had approved the th Report, this request was conveyed to the Government, which answered by a communication dated  January .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants allege in their communication of  July  that Mr. Belforth Quesada Rojas had been subjected to pressure by the Compaia Bananera de Costa Rica to resign from his post as records and correspondence secretary of the trade union.
.In its additional observations dated  January  the Government stated that it appeared from the report and documents it had obtained from the undertaking in question that Mr. Quesada Rojas's resignation was in no way the result of coercion. The Government attached a photocopy of the statement signed by the persons concerned to the effect that he had resigned of his own free will from membership and office in the trade union and that at no time had he been threatened or coerced by the company.
.In the circumstances, taking into account the detailed information supplied by the Government, from which it would appear that the trade union leader named in the complaint had resigned of his own free will, and in view of the fact that the complainants have not supplied further elements of information in support of their allegation that such resignation was a result of coercion by the undertaking, in violation of freedom of association, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that this remaining aspect of the case does not call for further examination.
.The complaint is contained in a communication dated  May  from the General Secretary of the Costa Rica Banana Company Workers' Union (SITRACOBA). The complaining organisation supplied additional information by a second communication dated  July . Both these communications were transmitted to the Government, which replied by two communications dated  September and  October .
.Costa Rica has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.With respect to the case as a whole the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the allegations relating to intervention by the authorities and by representatives of the employers in union meetings, to draw the attention of the Government, as it has already done in a number of earlier cases relating to Costa Rica, to the importance which it attaches to the right of plantation workers to hold trade union meetings on the estates; to express its concern that the recommendations previously made do not appear to have led to the adoption of specific measures to ensure that all plantation workers can exercise the right in question, and to request the Government to be good enough to keep it informed as to the provisions it adopts or plans to adopt to this effect;(b) with regard to the allegation relating to the dismissal of Messrs. Luis Prez Madrigal, Victor Barrantes Gamboa and Juan Rafael Montes Crdenas, to decide, for the reasons indicated in paragraph  above, that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination;(c) with regard to the allegations relating to the dismissal of trade union leaders and members, to draw the Government's attention to the importance which should be attached to the provisions of Article l of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), which has been ratified by Costa Rica; to take note of the Government's statement to the effect that a Bill concerning this matter is now under study, and to express the hope that appropriate measures will be brought into force as soon as possible to protect workers against any act of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment; and to bring these conclusions to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations;(d) with regard to the allegation that pressure was brought to bear on Mr. Belforth Quesada Rojas to make him give up his post with the union, to request the Government to be good enough to furnish its observations on this particular point as soon as possible;(e) to take note of the present interim report, on the understanding that the Committee will report further to the Governing Body when it has received the observations to be requested from the Government under subparagraph (d) above.",1,1965,Costa Rica

In that report the Committee presented its conclusions and its final recommendations with regard to certain of the allegations, postponing examination of one allegation on which it had not received the Government's observations. The present report refers exclusively to that allegation.
.Colombia has not ratified either the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its complaint dated  September  the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions (I.F.C.T.U.) stated that, as a result of the police measures adopted by the Government in its aim of preventing freedom of action for the trade union movement, there were very few trade union meetings that could be held in Colombia without the presence of government secret agents.
.By a communication dated  February  the Government categorically rejects the suggestion that such measures have been adopted and states that it is without any foundation. It further states that the number of trade union organisations is increasing every day and that the Government in no way impedes their activities; there are over , first-level trade unions in the country, some  federations and two major labour Confederations which have collaborated with the Government, on a basis of autonomy and independence, in planning social policy, and these bodies are stated to be performing their functions normally and fully.
.When it examined another aspect of the same case in its th Report, the Committee pointed out that in a considerable number of cases it had stated that the right of trade unions to meet freely in their own premises, without need for prior authorisation and without supervision by the public authorities, constituted a fundamental element in freedom of association.
.In the present case the Committee observes that the complainants have couched their allegation in general terms without providing details or evidence in support. The Committee therefore recommends the Governing Body, noting the Government's statement referred to in paragraph  above, to decide that it would be purposeless to pursue further the examination of this aspect of the case.
.By a communication dated  August  the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions (I.F.C.T.U.) presented a complaint against the Government of Colombia alleging infringement of freedom of association. Following transmission of this communication to the Government, the latter furnished its observations by a communication dated  August . In a further communication, dated  September , the complainant organisation submitted additional information in support of its complaint. At its st Session (November ) the Committee decided to adjourn examination of the case, since it had not received the Government's observations on the new information supplied by the complainants.

.Colombia has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In these circumstances, and with respect to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the allegations of anti-union discrimination by an undertaking in the process of reducing its staff, to note that, according to the Government's investigation, no workers enjoying trade union privileges were dismissed; furthermore, it seems that for the purposes of dismissal, general criteria were observed which were applicable to all workers, whether or not they were union members;(b) with regard to the alleged dismissal of a woman worker because of her membership of a union, and in view of the information supplied by complainants and the Government, to inform the latter of the importance which the Governing Body attaches to the principle mentioned in paragraph  above;(c) subject to this principle, to decide that the allegations mentioned in subparagraphs (a) and (b) above do not call for further consideration.
.This case was considered by the Committee at its meeting in May , when it submitted to the Governing Body its interim conclusions on the case contained in paragraph  of its th Report. The Governing Body approved these recommendations at its th Session (June ).
.Certain of the allegations were the subject of a final recommendation by the Committee. The following paragraphs refer only to the allegations which remained outstanding.
.By a communication dated  May  the Government furnished its observations on certain of the allegations in the complaint. Subsequently, by a communication dated  August , the Government supplied certain information requested by the Governing Body.
.Colombia has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee considers that the complainants have not furnished the proof necessary to support the allegation relating to the anti-union attitude of the Ministry of Labour and its local offices. Accordingly, it recommends the Governing Body to decide that this particular allegation does not call for further examination.
.As none of the Government's communications have dealt with the other allegations of anti-union discrimination by the firm of Hermega referred to in paragraph  of its th Report, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to request the Government to be good enough to furnish its observations thereon.
.In these circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to decide, for the reason stated in paragraph  above, that the allegations relating to the anti-union attitude of the Ministry of Labour and its local offices do not call for further consideration;(b) with regard to the allegations relating to Legislative Decree No.  of  April :(i) to draw the Government's attention to the fact that a restrictive provision such as that contained in this decree may sometimes constitute a considerable restriction of the potential activities of trade unions and hence run counter to the generally accepted principles of freedom of association;(ii) to suggest to the Government that it may care to reconsider the provisions of sections  and  of the decree in question in the light particularly of the above principle and to request the Government to be good enough to inform the Governing Body of the action it intends to take in this connection;(c) to request the Government to be good enough to inform the Governing Body in due course as to the outcome of the inquiry into the allegations of violations of trade union rights in the dismissals by the firm of Hermega;(d) to request the Government to be good enough to furnish its observations on the allegations relating to anti-union discrimination on the part of the firm of Hermega referred to in paragraph  of its th Report (with the exception of the aspect of the case dealt with in paragraphs  to  above);(e) to take note of this interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report once it has received the observations and additional information requested in subparagraphs (b), (c) and (d) above.

.Panama has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants allege that freedom of association has been violated in the city of David in the province of Chiriqui, to the detriment of the Union of Wage-Earning and Salaried Employees of the Slaughterhouse of David (Chiriqui), established at the end of November . For no other reason than membership in the above-mentioned trade union, ten workers were unjustly dismissed, seven on  December  and the other three at the beginning of January .
.The complainants consider that these dismissals violate the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and section  of the Panamanian Labour Code. They quote the text of that section, according to which members of industrial associations which are in the process of formation, members of the executive committees of existing industrial associations and other trade union representatives designated in the Code may not be dismissed, their conditions of employment may not be altered for the worse, nor may they be transferred to other establishments of the same undertaking or to a different municipality without the authorisation of the competent judge. This protection shall be extended for one year after the worker ceases to be a member of the executive committee or three months after he completes his period of service as a trade union representative.
.The Government attaches to its communication dated  August  two reports concerning this case, communicated by the Ministry of Labour, Social Welfare and Public Health. It appears from these documents and the enclosures that on  December , having been informed by a local inspector that the owners of the Chiriqui Slaughterhouse had dismissed a group of workers who were members of the trade union which was at that time being formed, the Inspector-General of Labour ordered the undertaking to reinstate them immediately in accordance with the provisions of section  of the Labour Code. At the same time the Inspector-General sent a telegram to the labour judge at David, denouncing the infringement and requesting him to take immediate steps to prevent the violation of workers' rights. In spite of the intervention of the General Labour Inspectorate and the labour judge the undertaking persisted in its attitude; the Inspector-General therefore repeated, in a telegram dated  December , the order to reinstate the workers and pay the wages due to them. On that same day the Inspector-General informed the National Assembly, at the latter's request, of the steps taken.
.As the undertaking persisted in its attitude, seven workers who had been dismissed on  December  took proceedings against their employer and won their case, proving, among other things, that at the time of their dismissal the undertaking's representative knew that they were members of the trade union then being formed. In the judgment dated  July  the judge sentenced the undertaking to reinstate the seven workers mentioned and pay the wages due for the intervening period. With reference, however, to three other workers who had been dismissed on  December  and had also brought an action against the undertaking, the judge concluded that their membership in the trade union then being formed was not known to the employer at the time of their dismissal; the judgment therefore absolved the undertaking from further responsibility. These three workers appealed against the judgment but failed to carry their appeal through, so that the Higher Labour Court declared the appeal invalid.
.The Government sent the complete text of the court rulings mentioned, with the reasons adduced therein and the text of a resolution dated  August  by the Ministry of Labour, Social Welfare and Public Health, recognising the legal status of the Union of Wage-Earning and Salaried Employees of the Chiriqui Slaughterhouse.
.The allegations submitted to the Committee for examination do not appear to raise any points requiring examination in connection with the provisions of the Freedom of Association and the Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), referred to by the complainants, but rather in connection with the provisions of Article , paragraph  (b), of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), which has also been ratified by Panama. Under that Article the adequate protection which workers shall enjoy against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment shall apply more particularly in respect of acts calculated to cause the dismissal of a worker by reason of union membership or because of participation in union activities.
.In this case the Government has provided detailed information from which it appears that very soon after the first dismissals the authorities took steps to apply the provisions of national law that prohibit the dismissal of members of a trade union in the process of formation without the authorisation of the judge. The case having been submitted to the competent judge through the normal labour court procedure, judgments were delivered ordering the reinstatement of seven of the dismissed workers and the payment of the wages due to them since the date of their dismissal. Concerning the three other workers in question, the documents in the case do not show that their membership in the trade union in the process of formation had been notified within the required time to the representatives of the undertaking; having lost the case before the court of first instance, they did not carry through their appeal before the higher court.
.In these circumstances, and in view of the fact that the matter of the dismissals complained of has been dealt with through the normal labour court procedure in accordance with the national trade union legislation, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.",-1,1966,Panama
114,"this behaviour was a veritable rebellion against the law itself, since it aimed at damaging the vital interests of the nation in open opposition and rebellion against the authority which the State exercises solely with a view to protecting those interests.
.Lastly, the Government states that Act No.  recognises, among the rights appertaining to trade union organisations, that of non-intervention in their management and administration on the part of the authority responsible for enforcing the law. However, the rights so recognised refer only to lawful activities. The Government takes the view that the principles stated must also apply to international agreements, the ratification of which should not oblige a State to emasculate its own action in re-establishing law and order. The taking over of the trade union decreed by the Government was duly analysed by the national labour courts, in both the first and second instance, as a result of the appeal lodged by the persons concerned; the National Chamber of Labour unanimously voted "" that the provisions of Decree No. / be promulgated in full "". The Government quotes part of the ruling of the Chamber of Labour, which states that the new system of regulation of dock work is a vital part of the economic policy of the Government and has direct repercussions at both national and international level on the development of activities of prime importance to the State such as import and export trade. In the opinion of the Chamber of Labour, the measures decreed by the Government were necessary to safeguard the activities threatened by the strike and the international boycott promoted by the trade union; they were taken in order to overcome the serious emergency in which the country had been placed by the trade unions.
.The Government also attached to its reply various comments published by Argentine newspapers, some of which stress the national economic difficulties caused by the poor operation of the ports and the advantage to the country of accelerating the loading and unloading of ships, etc.
.With regard to the allegations concerning police interference in the trade union meeting held on  December  and the arrest of other persons besides Mr. Eustaquio Tolosa, the Committee notes from the Government's observations that the action of the police was restricted to arresting Mr. Tolosa. Since the complainants have not supplied particulars regarding the other persons they claim were arrested, the Committee therefore considers that there would be no purpose in proceeding further with the examination of these particular allegations.
.As regards the arrest of Mr. Tolosa, it appears from the information supplied by the Government that it was made in compliance with court orders issued in connection with two criminal trials, the first initiated in  and the second based on criminal offences with which Mr. Tolosa was charged in connection with the labour dispute to which the complaints refer.
.In the past the Committee has always followed the practice of not proceeding to examine matters which were the subject of pending national judicial proceedings offering all the guarantees of normal judicial procedure, where such proceedings might make available information of assistance to the Committee in appreciating whether or not allegations were well-founded. In many cases the Committee has requested governments to communicate the text of the judgments given and their grounds.
.Consequently the Committee feels it is necessary, before proceeding with its examination of this particular aspect of the matter, to request the Government to be good enough to furnish the text of the judgments given in the case of Mr. Tolosa and the reasons adduced therefor.
.Moreover, the Committee has always stressed the principle that allegations relating to the right to strike are not outside its competence, in so far as they affect the exercise of trade union rights. It has also pointed out that the right of workers and their organisations to strike as a legitimate means of defending their occupational interests is generally recognised. In cases where it is observed that restrictions are placed on strikes in essential services, the Committee has always emphasised the importance it attaches to the establishment of adequate guarantees for workers thus deprived of the possibility of protecting their occupational rights s and observed that such restrictions should be made subject to impartial and rapid conciliation and arbitration procedure in all stages of which the interested parties can take part.
.In the present case the complainants state that the strike called by the workers and which led the Government to issue a decree taking over the United Argentine Dockers' Union (S.U.P.A.) was motivated by the Government's having legislated to modify the working conditions of dockers. The Government, for its part, states that the aforesaid working conditions had from the beginning been established by law and not by collective agreement and that the changes decreed, which did not exceed the scope authorised by the general labour laws, were indispensable for the vital interests of the country. The taking over of S.U.P.A was designed to protect those same vital interests, which were threatened by the strike and the international boycott promoted by the trade union. Argentine courts of the first and second instance had authenticated the validity and legitimacy of the take-over decree.
.The Committee notes the explanations supplied by the Government in connection with the dockers' dispute. It would appear, however, that one of the trade unions concerned, the United Argentine Dockers' Union, is still under government control at present and it is not clear whether or not there is any intention of reviewing the matters under dispute through conciliation or arbitration procedure in all stages of which the interested parties can take part, in accordance with the principles set forth in paragraph  above. The Committee would be glad to receive additional information from the Government in this connection.
.Moreover, no observations have as yet been received from the Government concerning other aspects of the case which were raised in the complaint of the International Transport Workers' Federation, namely the allegations to the effect that the Government had refused to examine the proposals originally put forward by the workers; that an agreement reached with the Labour Secretary after the strike had begun had been broken; and that anti-trade union repressive measures, including the recruitment of strike breakers, had been taken against the workers participating in the strike (see paragraph  above).
.Nor have any observations been received from the Government concerning the other complaints and additional information supplied by the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions, the World Federation of Trade Unions, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, and the International Metalworkers' Federation, which are mentioned in paragraph  above and refer inter alia to government interference with a number of workers' organisations, besides the taking over of the S.U.P.A as already stated.
.Bearing in mind the principles set forth in paragraph  above and the provision contained in Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), according to which workers' organisations are entitled to elect their representatives in full freedom, organise their administration and activities, and formulate their programmes, and the public authorities must refrain from any interference which would restrict that right or impede the lawful exercise thereof, the Committee feels it is necessary, before proceeding with its examination of the case and formulating further conclusions, to have the observations of the Government on the points raised in paragraphs ,  and  above.
.In these circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:",0,1966,Argentina
115,".This matter was considered by the Committee at its session in February , when it submitted an interim report theron, in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, which was approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (February-March ).
.In that report the Committee submitted its final conclusions on some of the allegations made in the complaints, but requested the Government to furnish its observations on other aspects of the case. The following paragraphs deal only with those aspects still outstanding.
.In a communication dated  April  the Government sent the additional observations which it had been asked to supply.
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its telegram dated  February  the National Confederation of Free Workers (CONATRAL) alleged, without providing any particulars, that the rights of the free and democratic trade union organisations in the Dominican Republic were being violated by political mobs with aims foreign to Dominican culture and tradition and that trade unionists had been murdered. "" Our bases "", the telegram also stated, "" are destroyed with impunity, our principles violently strangled; terror, menace and death are methods regularly used to bring about our destruction; political alliances join to eliminate us.""
.In two communications, of  and  February , the Inter-American Regional Organisation of Workers (of the I.C.F.T.U.) (O.R.I.T.) expressed support for the complaint brought by CONATRAL and said that the latter organisation had been attacked by extremist groups in an effort to impose upon it attitudes and positions, which, in the opinion of the O.R.I.T, would in no way contribute to re-establishing the atmosphere of peace and tranquillity so badly needed by the Dominican Republic. The same extremist groups were said to have taken their revenge by means of a bomb attack on CONATRAL headquarters.
.The Independent Union of Labourers, in part of its communication dated  March , alleged that in the country there was no respect for the most elementary rights of free trade unions and that mobs taking orders from political parties attacked anybody not sharing their ideas. In a communication of  May  the same organisation supplied additional information in the form of a newspaper article which had appeared in San Juan (Puerto Rico) on  March . This article reported statements by an "" Inter-Union Committee of Dominican Trade Union Leaders in Exile "" to the effect that democratic and anti-Communist trade union leaders from Santo Domingo were arriving daily in Puerto Rico, fleeing from brutal persecution by the "" red mob "", whose activities the provisional Government had not prevented. The Independent Union of Labourers added that both its own General Secretary and other high-level officers of the free and democratic trade union movement were being persecuted and turned out of their jobs by "" mobs ""; and also that the Sugar Corporation had been handed over to a political party, so that party members only could obtain employment there.
.At its sessions in May and November , and in February , the Committee postponed consideration of these allegations, as it had not received the Government's observations.
.In a communication dated  April  the Government forwards the comments made on this matter by the Ministry of Labour. According to the latter the allegations made by CONATRAL merely reflect the disquiet and anxiety felt by those persons in CONATRAL who were involved in political manoeuvres alien to the purposes of the organisation and as a result of the serious crisis that the Dominican Republic had lived through following the revolutionary outbreak of  April , which gave rise to a military occupation by forces of the Organisation of American States. "" A proof of this assertion "", continues the Ministry of Labour, "" is that, once order had been re-established and the country had returned to normal, this workers' organisation had not even the vaguest reasons for complaint concerning its stability and development.""
.The Ministry goes on to say that, the situation being as described above, if any trade union leader left the country (and the Ministry had no knowledge of any such departure), it would have been of his own free will.
.The Ministry finally states that the allegations of discrimination in employment engaged in by the Sugar Corporation are undoubtedly attributable to the same reasons, which no longer hold good.
.The Committee observes that the allegations made by the complainants seem to have referred to events occurring during an obviously abnormal period, as a result of serious political convulsions, and the consequences thereof, as far as the allegations are concerned, have now been surmounted. In addition, the complaints are formulated in very general terms, and the complainants did not make use of their right to submit fuller details in support of their allegations relating to the violation of trade union rights.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.
.The complaints are contained in five communications which were sent directly to the I.L.O, namely a telegram from the National Confederation of Free Workers (CONATRAL) dated  February , two letters from the Inter-American Regional Organisation of Workers of the I.C.F.T.U. (O.R.I.T.) dated  and  February , and a letter from the Independent Union of Labourers dated  March . The last-named organisation sent further information regarding its complaint by letter of  May .
.Each of the above communications was transmitted to the Government, which replied in a communication dated  October  and received in the Office too late to be examined by the Committee at its meeting in November of that year.
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its telegram dated  February  CONATRAL alleged, without giving any particulars, that the rights of the free and democratic trade union organisations in the Dominican Republic were being violated by political mobs with aims foreign to Dominican culture and tradition and that trade unionists had been assassinated. The telegram also says: "" our bases are destroyed with impunity, our principles violently strangled; terror, menace and death are methods regularly used to bring about our destruction; political alliances join to eliminate us ""; and it alleges the support of , Dominican workers.
.In its communication of  February , which was corrected by another dated  February , O.R.I.T expressed its support for CONATRAL's complaint and stated further that CONATRAL had been "" attacked by extremist groups in an effort to impose upon it attitudes or positions "" which, in the opinion of O.R.I.T, "" will in no way contribute to re-establish the atmosphere of peace and tranquillity so badly needed by the Dominican Republic "". The same extremist groups were said to have "" avenged themselves on CONATRAL by means of a bomb attack on its headquarters "". O.R.I.T asked the I.L.O to make representations to the provisional Government informing it of the workers' situation and so to give them the assistance which, according to CONATRAL's complaint, they required.
.The Independent Union of Labourers, for its part, appended to its communication of  March  the text of a letter which, it said, it had sent to the provisional President of the Republic, asking for compensation for the damage suffered by the union during the recent civil war (including the sack of its offices and co-operatives) and subsequently since the provisional Government took office. The union hoped that the I.L.O would "" take note of the fact that in this country there is no respect for the most elementary rights of free trade unions and that mobs taking orders from political parties attack ... any person not sharing their ideas"". It also asked the I.L.O to send a representative ""to see for himself the constant and flagrant violation of all the International Labour Conventions "". On  May  the Independent Union of Labourers sent, as additional information, the text of a newspaper article which had appeared at San Juan (Puerto Rico) on  March : this reported statements by an "" Inter-Union Committee of Dominican Trade Union Leaders in Exile "" to the effect that "" democratic and anti-communist trade union leaders from Santo Domingo "" were arriving daily in Puerto Rico, having - the statement alleged - fled from brutal persecution by the "" red mob "", whose activities the provisional Government had not prevented. The union added that both its own General Secretary and other high-level officers of the free and democratic trade union movement were being persecuted and turned out of their employment by the "" mobs ""; and also that the Sugar Corporation had been handed over to a political party so that only members of the party could obtain employment there.
.In its reply of  October  the Government transcribes the observations of the",-1,1966,Dominican Republic
116,"to urge the Government once again to lift the suspension of the trade union status and end the takeover of the unions still affected, and to keep the Committee informed in this respect;(b) as regards the allegations relating to collective bargaining and compulsory arbitration:(i) while taking note of the legislation enacted by the Government with respect to collective bargaining, as well as the temporary and emergency nature this legislation is said to have, to reaffirm that the right of free collective bargaining is a fundamental trade union right for all employees who are not covered by the safeguards provided by civil service regulations;(ii) in view of the implications for the standard of living of the workers of the fixing of wages by the Government, by-passing the collective bargaining process, and of the Government's wage policy in general, to draw attention to the importance it attaches to the promotion of effective consultation and co-operation between public authorities and workers' and employers' organisations in this respect, in accordance with the principles laid down in the Consultation (Industrial and National Levels) Recommendation,  (No. ), for the purpose of considering jointly matters of mutual concern with a view to arriving, to the fullest possible extent, at agreed solutions.
.The Committee considered this case at its sessions in May and November  and February, May and November , when it submitted to the Governing Body the interim reports contained in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, paragraphs  to  of its st Report, paragraphs  to  of its rd Report, paragraphs  to  of its th Report and paragraphs  to  of its th Report, all of which were approved by the Governing Body.
.In paragraph  of its th Report the Committee made a number of recommendations to the Governing Body, some of which were to the effect that the Argentine Government should be requested to supply the information and observations for which it had been asked in order to permit further examination of the allegations. These recommendations were forwarded to the Government, which replied in three communications dated ,  and  January .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee observes that this reply by the Government appears to refer only to the allegations mentioned in paragraph  above. The Government justifies its take-over of the unions concerned on the ground that they had departed from their occupational aims, and declares that the measures in question were designed to allow a normal situation to be restored, for which purpose it intended to call new elections of union officers.
.The Committee notes that, despite the time which has elapsed and the repeated requests made to the Government, the latter has not yet brought to an end those measures to take over unions which were still in force. The Committee considers that in the interval which has elapsed-in the case of the United Argentine Dockers' Union, more than two years-a return to a normal situation and the election of new officers could have been ensured.
.As regards the other allegations referred to in paragraphs , ,  and  above, the Government has not supplied the information for which it has repeatedly been asked. The Government has thus failed to provide a good deal of the evidence on which the Committee was relying in order to be able to formulate its conclusions with a full knowledge of the facts.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the allegations relating to the taking over of various trade union organisations and the suspension of their trade union status, to draw the Government's attention to the fact that, despite the time which has elapsed and the repeated requests made to it, the Government has not yet brought to an end those measures to take over unions which were still in force, and to take note of the Government's statement that it intends to keep the Committee informed, within the briefest possible period, on the return to a normal situation by the unions taken over;(b) as regards the allegations relating to interference by the authorities in the affairs of the CGT, the measures directed against union leaders and members, and compulsory arbitration and collective bargaining:(i) to regret the failure on a number of occasions to supply the information requested on which the Committee was relying in order to formulate its conclusions on the said allegations with a full knowledge of the facts;(ii) to draw the Government's attention once more to the importance of Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), which states that workers' and employers' organisations shall have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom, to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes, while the public authorities shall refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede its lawful exercise; and to the principle laid down in Article  of the Convention that workers' and employers' organisations shall not be liable to be dissolved or suspended by administrative authority;(iii) to draw the Government's attention to the fact that the right of free collective bargaining is a fundamental trade union right for all employees who are not covered by the safeguards provided by civil service regulations; and that if, as part of its stabilisation policy, the Government considers that wage rates cannot be settled freely through collective bargaining, this restriction should be imposed as an exceptional measure and only to the extent that is necessary, without exceeding a reasonable period, and that it should be accompanied by adequate safeguards to protect workers' living standards.
.In these circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the allegations relating to the detention of the trade union official, Eustaquio Tolosa, to express its satisfaction at the decision to reduce his sentence, a decision in which the Committee's conclusions were taken into account, and at the fact that Mr. Tolosa has now been released;(b) with regard to the allegations relating to the taking over of various trade union organisations and the suspension of their trade union status, to draw the Government's attention to the fact that, despite the time which has elapsed and the repeated requests made to it, the Government has not yet brought to an end those measures to take over unions which were still in force, and to take note of the Government's statement that it intends to keep the Committee informed, within the briefest possible period, on the return to a normal situation by the unions taken over;(c) with regard to the allegations relating to interference by the authorities in the affairs of the CGT, measures directed against union leaders and members and compulsory arbitration and collective bargaining:(i) to regret the failure on a number of occasions to supply the information requested on which the Committee was relying in order to formulate its conclusions on the said allegations with a full knowledge of the facts;(ii) to draw the Government's attention once more to the importance of Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), which states that workers' and employers' organisations shall have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom, to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes, while the public authorities shall refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede its lawful exercise; and to the principle laid down in Article  of the Convention that workers' and employers' organisations shall not be liable to be dissolved or suspended by administrative authority;(iii) to draw the Government's attention to the fact that the right of free collective bargaining is a fundamental trade union right for all employees who are not covered by the safeguards provided by civil service regulations; and that if, as part of its stabilisation policy, the Government considers that wage rates cannot be settled freely through collective bargaining, this restriction should be imposed as an exceptional measure and only to the extent that is necessary, without exceeding a reasonable period, and that it should be accompanied by adequate safeguards to protect workers' living standards.
.The Committee previously considered this case at its sessions in May and November  and February and May , when it submitted to the Governing Body the interim reports contained in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, paragraphs  to  of its st Report, paragraphs  to  of its rd Report, and paragraphs  to  of its th Report, all of which were approved by the Governing Body.
.In paragraph  of its th Report, the Committee made certain recommendations, some of which were to request the Government of Argentina to supply further information. These recommendations were communicated to the Government in",0,1966,Argentina
117,"a letter dated  June : the Government replied in a letter forwarded by the Permanent Mission of the Argentine Republic to the international organisations in Geneva on  September .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In these circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the detention of Mr. Eustaquio Tolosa:(i) to take note of the judgment at second instance against Mr. Tolosa, in proceedings in which the offence provided for in Act No.  of  was under consideration for the first time in Argentina;(ii) to reaffirm the principles contained in the Consultation (Industrial and National Levels) Recommendation,  (No. ), which states that measures appropriate to national conditions should be taken to promote effective consultation and co-operation between public authorities and employers' and workers' organisations, as well as the standard expressed in Article  of Convention No. , which provides that any organisation, federation or Confederation shall have the right to affiliate with international organisations of workers or employers;(iii) to request the Government to be good enough to keep it informed of any new developments with regard to Mr. Tolosa, and in particular of any pardon which might be decided upon;(b) with regard to the allegations relating to the measures to take over various trade union organisations and to suspend their trade union status, and with regard to the other allegations outstanding, to regret that the Government has not supplied the information and observations requested, and to urge the Government to be good enough to send this information as soon as possible, in order to permit the further examination of these allegations;(c) to take note of this interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report on the case once it has received the information referred to in the preceding subparagraph.
.The Committee examined this case previously at its sessions in May and November  and February , when it submitted to the Governing Body interim reports thereon, which are contained respectively in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, paragraphs  to  of its st Report and paragraphs  to  of its rd Report. These three reports were approved by the Governing Body.
.In paragraph  of its rd Report the Committee made a number of recommendations of the Governing Body on various aspects of the case, some of which involved requesting certain additional information from the Government. Once the Governing Body had given its approval, these recommendations were brought to the notice of the Government in a letter dated  March .
.After the report mentioned in the previous paragraph had been approved, additional information was received from the International Transport Workers' Federation (I.T.F.) on  March , from the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions on  April , and from the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions of Transport Workers on  April . The communications were transmitted to the Government.
.The Government furnished its observations and additional information through the Permanent Mission of the Argentine Republic accredited to the international organisations at Geneva on  March and  April .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In these circumstances, with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the detention of Mr. Eustaquio Tolosa:(i) to take note of the verdict against him;(ii) to call the Government's attention to the principles set forth in paragraph ;(iii) to request the Government to be good enough to keep it informed of any new developments in the case of Mr. Tolosa, especially as regards any appeal against the sentence, and, in case of an appeal, to forward a copy of the decision by the court concerned;(b) with regard to the measures to take over various trade union organisations and to suspend their trade union status, in view of the circumstances mentioned above in paragraph :(i) to take note of the information supplied by the Government to the effect that it has restored the trade union status of the Textile Workers' Union and the Metal Workers' Union;(ii) to urge the Government once more to repeal as soon as possible the measures still in force to suspend and take over certain trade unions and to request the Government to keep it informed about the measures it has taken or proposes to take to this end;(c) to take note of this interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report on the case when it has received the information requested from the Government in clauses (a) and (b) of this paragraph and in paragraph  above.
.The Committee examined this case previously at its meetings in May and November , when it submitted to the Governing Body interim reports thereon which may be found, respectively, in paragraphs  to  of the Committee's th Report and in paragraphs  to  of its st Report. Both reports have been approved by the Governing Body.
.In paragraph  of its st Report the Committee made recommendations to the Governing Body in respect of a number of aspects of this case, some of which were to the effect that the Government be requested to supply additional information on specific points. As soon as these recommendations had been approved by the Governing Body they were brought to the attention of the Government by a letter dated  November .
.By a communication dated  December  from the Permanent Mission of the Argentine Republic in Geneva the Government has forwarded certain observations and information respecting some of the allegations which remain outstanding. This report will deal exclusively with the matters referred to by the Government in this communication.
.Argentina has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In these circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the detention of the trade union official, Eustaquio Tolosa, bearing in mind the importance attached to the strict observance of the basic principles of freedom of association and particularly the importance of the principle of prompt and fair trial, to request the Government to be good enough to inform it as soon as possible as to the likelihood of a judgment on the case being pronounced shortly concerning Mr. Tolosa or the possibility of his being released pending such judgment;(b) with regard to the allegations relating to the dock dispute of , to decide, without prejudice to the other conclusions set forth in paragraph  (c) of the Committee's st Report, that the allegation that most of the port workers of Buenos Aires have been deprived of their employment for having acted in defence of their trade union interests does not call for further examination;(c) with regard to the allegations relating to measures to suspend the trade union status of various workers' organisations:(i) to draw the Government's attention once again to the views set forth in paragraphs  and  above;(ii) to express once again the hope that those of the measures taken in February and March  to suspend trade union status which are still in force will be rescinded in the near future, and request the Government to be good enough to keep it informed as to the action it has taken or proposes to take to this end;(d) to take note of the present interim report, on the understanding that the Committee will report further when it has received the additional information requested from the Government in paragraph  of its st Report and in subparagraphs (a) and (c) of this paragraph.
.The Committee examined this case previously at its meeting in May , when it submitted to the Governing Body an interim report contained in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, which was approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (June ).

.In these circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) for the reasons expressed in paragraphs ,  and  above respectively, to decide that the allegations concerning the interference of the Government in the  Congress of the C.G.T, the Civil Defence Act and various points mentioned in general terms in the C.G.T complaint do not call for further examination;(b) with regard to the arrest of the trade union leader, Eustaquio Tolosa:(i) to take note of the Government's statement that proceedings are continuing before a court of ordinary jurisdiction in connection with the prosecution brought against Mr. Tolosa for having contravened section  of Act No. ;(ii) to take note that, in the meantime, Mr. Tolosa continues to be under preventive detention by virtue of the writ issued by the judge in the case and confirmed by the appeals court;(iii) to draw the Government's attention to the importance which the Governing Body has always attached to the principle of prompt and fair trial, mentioned in paragraph  above, and to request the Government to be good enough to keep the Governing Body informed of Mr. Tolosa's situation, and to be good enough to send the text of the judgment, as well as the grounds adduced therein, once it has been given.(c) with regard to the  dock dispute:(i) to take note of the declaration by the Government that it does not intend to maintain its control of the United Argentine Dockers' Union indefinitely and that it will rather endeavour to ensure that the organisation in question is shortly able to operate normally;(ii) to express the hope that the necessary measures will be adopted as soon as possible and to ask the Government to keep it informed of developments in this connection;(iii) to draw the attention of the Government to the importance that it has always attached, where restrictions are placed on the right to strike in essential services, to the subjection of such restrictions to impartial and rapid conciliation and arbitration procedures, in all stage of which the parties concerned can take part;(iv) to take note of the statement by the Government that the emergency measures have been lifted and that work in the port of Buenos Aires has been entirely restored to normal;(v) to request the Government nevertheless to be good enough to reply to the allegation that most of the port workers of Buenos Aires have been deprived of employment for having acted in defence of their trade union interests;(d) with regard to the measures to take over various trade union organisations or to suspend their trade union status:(i) to take note that the Government has rescinded section  of Resolution No. /, which suspended the authorisation to retain dues and contributions on behalf of and that the Railway Workers' five trade union organisations, Union has recovered its legal status;(ii) with regard to the measures to suspend trade union status, to point out again to the Government, for the reasons expressed in paragraphs  to  above, the importance of the provision in Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), which has been ratified by Argentina, to the effect that workers' organisations shall not be liable to be dissolved or suspended by administrative authority;(iii) to request the Government to be good enough to explain whether a legal appeal against a resolution suspending trade union status has suspensory effect;(iv) with regard to the decrees to take over various trade union organisations and the measures to freeze their bank accounts, to draw the attention of the Government once more to the importance of the provisions of Article  of Convention No.  relating to the right of workers' organisations to elect their representatives in full freedom, to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes, and to point out to it also the importance, where trade unions violate legal or statutory provisions, of ensuring that control is exercised by the judicial authorities with a view to guaranteeing an impartial and objective procedure;(v) to express the hope that the measures referred to in clauses (ii) and (iv) of this subparagraph that are still in force will be rescinded in the near future and to ask the Government to be good enough to keep it informed of any developments in this connection;(e) to take note of this interim report, it being understood that the Committee will present a new report on the aspects of the case that are still pending when it has received the additional information mentioned in points (b) (iii), (c) (ii) and (v), (d) (iii) and (v) of this paragraph and the additional information requested by the Committee in paragraphs ,  and  of the present report.
.The complaints are contained in a number of communications to the I.L.O from the organisations and on the dates mentioned below: International Federation of Christian Trade Unions ( December ), Argentine Trade Union Movement (A.S.A.) ( February ), Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions ( March ), World Federation of Trade Unions ( March ), International Transport Workers' Federation ( April ), and International Confederation of Free Trade Unions ( May ), with reference to and in support of two communications sent to the I.L.O on  March and  April  by the International Metalworkers' Federation, which is associated with the I.C.F.T.U. Additional information and further allegations have been submitted by the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions (in a communication dated  April ), the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions (three communications dated  April,  April and  May ) and the International Metalworkers' Federation ( May ). All these communications were transmitted to the Argentine Government as they were received.
.The allegations relate mainly to the arrest of a trade union leader, to legislative provisions changing the standards governing work in the docks and the resulting labour dispute and to various measures of interference, suspension of trade union status and freezing of bank accounts stated to have been adopted by the Government in the case of several trade union organisations mentioned in the complaints, etc.
.The Government submitted its observations on certain aspects of the case by a communication dated  May .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  December  the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions (I.F.C.T.U.) alleges that on  December  armed police burst into a trade union meeting and that as a result more than  persons were placed under arrest and many were wounded. The Argentine Trade Union Movement, in its communication of  February , alleges that the Government unilaterally enforced new labour standards for dockers by a decree, No. , which violated previous agreements, without having consulted the trade unions concerned (United Argentine Dockers' Union (S.U.P.A.), Dock Coalworkers' Union, Shipping Agents and Inspectors' Union, Stevedore Foremen's Association) and that the leaders of the S.U.P.A were removed from office by a decree of  October  and replaced by a civil servant. The A.S.A. adds that the police broke up a general meeting of the S.U.P.A on  December  and arrested its General Secretary, Mr. Eustaquio Tolosa.
.The Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions, in its communication of  April , alleges that Decree No.  increased permitted hours of work in unhealthy occupations, reduced the number of workers on each shift, altered the method of calculating wages for work on public holidays, Saturday afternoons, etc. On  October , according to the complainants, the Economic Affairs and Labour Secretary informed the representatives of the union that conditions of work in ports were to be modified by legislation and that the new port authority would issue new labour regulations; the union, having requested that the enforcement of the new measures be postponed and that it be allowed to take part in framing the new regulations, was informed on the following day that on  October the new regulations would come into force. The L.A.C.F.T.U goes on to state that the trade union lodged an appeal with the President of the Republic and on  October asked for  days to discuss the new labour regulations and other points, only to be told that "" the law has already been enacted and laws do not call for discussion "". On  October S.U.P.A declared a general strike and on the same day the Government declared it to be "" outside the scope of lawful trade union activities "" and appointed a naval officer as the responsible head of the union, whose premises were occupied by the armed forces.
.The International Transport Workers' Federation (I.T.F.), in its complaint of  April , made detailed allegations",0,1966,Argentina
119,"dates of expiry of the various collective agreements.
.The Committee observed that the legal provisions in question appeared to raise questions that should be examined in the light of certain generally recognised principles respecting freedom of association and, in any case, in the light of that contained in Article  of Convention No. -ratified by Argentina-to the effect that "" measures appropriate to national conditions shall be taken, where necessary, to encourage and promote the full development and utilisation of machinery for voluntary negotiation between employers or employers' organisations and workers' organisations, with a view to the regulation of terms and conditions of employment by means of collective agreements "". The Committee, observed, however, that the provisions of Act No.  were intended to remain in force only until  December .
.In view of the fact that the observations of the Government had been expressed in general terms and concerned only part of the allegations relating to collective bargaining, the Committee postponed consideration of these allegations and requested the Government to be good enough to report on specific cases in which Act No.  was applied, and also to send the text of Acts Nos.  and .
.With its communication of  February , the International Federation of Chemical and General Workers' Unions, acting on behalf of its affiliated organisation, the Glass and Allied Industries Trade Union of Argentina (Sindicato Obrero de la Industria del Vidrio y Afines de la Argentina) forwarded the text of Act No.  of , alleging that the Government was prohibiting collective bargaining, in violation of Act No.  respecting collective agreements and ILO Convention No. . Under the terms of Act No.  a general wage increase was granted, the collective agreements in force were extended until  December  and Acts Nos.  and  were ordered to remain in force until the same date.
.The Government supplied the information requested of it on  May . According to its communication, Act No.  provided for increases in the basic remuneration established by the collective agreements due to expire in  and kept the agreements in force until  December . This Act, according to the Government, formed an instrument of economic policy to supplement the other measures adopted in the field of budgets, taxation, exchange, customs and finance with a view to the urgent stopping of the inflationary spiral. Act No.  was an emergency measure adopted in view of the prevailing economic situation. The Government went on to state that the Act in question had been replaced by Act No.  of  December , in order to prolong the emergency rules made necessary by the economic conditions the country was going through. The new Act maintained the temporary suspension of the system of concluding collective agreements-which would be re-established as soon as the Act expired on  December -and provided for a general increase in wages.
.With regard to Act No.  the Government states that under it a Technical Advisory Commission on Wage Policy had been set up to be responsible for the study, analysis and assessment of measures to establish a co-ordinated and harmonious wage policy with respect to the central administration, state undertakings, decentralised bodies and private public service undertakings covering the whole national territory or whose activities exceeded the boundaries of a province. Every plan for modifying the pay of the staff of the above-mentioned establishments must be submitted in advance to this Commission, which would issue the instructions to be followed with respect thereto.
.As for the application in practice of Act No.  respecting compulsory arbitration, the Government stated that arbitration awards had been issued in four cases, concerning commercial employees, textile workers, tram workers and workers in the meat industry.
.The Government concluded by declaring that all these Acts are emergency measures whose sole effect had been a temporary suspension of collective bargaining in regard to the fixing of wages. It was the Government's intention to re-establish the system of Act No.  respecting collective agreements as soon as economic conditions permitted. In the Government's view the legislation referred to above did not infringe either Convention No.  or any principle connected with freedom of association.
.Since this communication from the Government further legislative provisions in this connection have been enacted and have been brought to the Committee's knowledge. Mention may be made first of all of Decree No.  of  August  and Act No.  of  September . These texts authorise the re-negotiation of the collective agreements kept in force under Acts Nos.  and . The agreements re-negotiated in accordance with these provisions shall remain in force from  January  to  December . The negotiations must be completed within  days. If agreement cannot be reached, the authority may refer the matter to compulsory arbitration in accordance with the provisions of Act No. , which is now to remain in force until  December . While this Act provides that the parties may be compelled to go to arbitration where the dispute "" is of such a character as to affect the economic activity, productivity, development and progress of the nation and/or the security and well-being of the community "", these terms are so broad that they give the impression that the authority can submit to arbitration practically all cases in which it has not been possible to reach agreement.
.The Committee has also taken note of the enactment of other provisions relevant to the same subject. Act No. , already mentioned, provides for a certain increase in the prevailing minimum living wage, and Decree No.  of  September  does the same with respect to various family allowances. Act No.  of  September  prohibits the reflection in prices of higher costs resulting from the negotiation of new collective agreements, except in certain cases. Lastly, Decree No.  of the same date provides for the setting up of a National Prices and Wages Advisory Board, tripartite in composition, and with advisory and informatory functions, which will be required to publish an annual report analysing and forecasting trends in prices and wages.
.The Government has more recently, on  October , introduced further measures affecting collective bargaining. Acts Nos.  and , promulgated on that date, grant a general increase in the pay of all workers in private employment from  November  and provide for a further increase from I March , to remain in effect until  December . The Government may readjust pay rates from  January  if there is evidence of a decline in the value of real earnings, to be determined on the basis of the annual report to be submitted by the National Prices and Wages Advisory Board. Collective bargaining must exclude all matters pertaining to the fixing of wages. The wage increases granted must not be reflected in prices, with certain exceptions.
.The Committee observes that, according to the Government's declarations, the restrictive measures adopted in respect of collective bargaining are emergency measures and the resultant suspension of the provisions of Act No.  respecting collective agreements is only temporary. From the terms of the more recent legislation it is evident that these too are temporary measures, although it is worthy of comment that the restrictions imposed on collective bargaining as far as wages are concerned are to remain in force for a prolonged period lasting until the end of .
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body, while taking note of the legislation enacted by the Government with respect to collective bargaining, as well as of the temporary and emergency nature this legislation is said to have, to reaffirm that the right of free collective bargaining is a fundamental trade union right for all employees who are not covered by the safeguards provided by civil service regulations. Furthermore, in view of the implications for the standard of living of the workers of the fixing of wages by the Government, by-passing the collective bargaining process, and of the Government's wage policy in general, the Committee also recommends the Governing Body to draw attention to the importance it attaches to the promotion of effective consultation and co-operation between public authorities and workers' organisations in this respect, in accordance with the principles laid down in the Consultation (Industrial and National Levels) Recommendation,  (No. ), for the purpose of considering jointly matters of mutual concern with a view to arriving, to the fullest possible extent, at agreed solutions.
.In these circumstances, with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the allegations relating to measures to take over various trade union organisations and to suspend their trade union status:(i) to take note of the measures taken to restore the trade union status of the Telephone and Telecommunications Workers' Union of the Republic of Argentina (FOETRA) and the Tucumn Sugar Industry Workers' Union (FOTIA) and annulling the suspension of the trade union status of the Buenos Aires branch of that Federation;(ii)",-1,1966,Argentina
120,".The complaint is contained in a communication dated  May  addressed to the Director-General by the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions (I.F.C.T.U.). The text of the complaint was transmitted to the Government by a letter dated  May .
.At its th Session (June ) the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, which is contained in paragraph  of the th Report, requested further observations and information from the Government concerning the two aspects of the case that were left pending, these being the complainants' allegations concerning two trade union, leaders, Mr. Amadeo Vanegas and Mrs. Lidia Madariaga.
.The Government has replied to this request by a letter dated  December .
.Nicaragua, in October , ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In these circumstances, and regarding the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that, subject to the principle mentioned in paragraph  above, the case does not call for further examination.
.The complaint is contained in a communication dated  May  addressed to the Director-General by the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions (I.F.C.T.U.). The text of the complaint was transmitted to the Government by a letter dated  May  to enable it to submit its observations.
.Besides the complaint of the I.F.C.T.U, which is admissible under the procedure in force since the complaining organisation is an international Organisation having consultative status with the I.L.O, several other complaints referring to the same occurrences have been received from trade union organisations operating in countries other than Nicaragua. On the recommendation of the Committee the Governing Body decided that these additional complaints could not be received under the procedure in force because they emanated from national organisations of workers in countries other than the one to which the complaints relate and having no direct interest in the matters raised in the allegations. The decisions of the Governing Body concerning the complaints dismissed as irreceivable were conveyed to the Government at the proper time.
.Concerning the complaint submitted by the I.F.C.T.U, the Committee, at its meeting held in November , took note of a communication from the Government announcing the future submission of the observations for which it had been asked and decided to post pone it; consideration of the case until such time as it should have received those observations. At its meeting held in February  the Committee again postponed its examination of this matter to the following session, since the Government's observations contained in its communication dated  February  had been received too late.
.Nicaragua has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  May  the I.F.C.T.U alleges that Mr. Amadeo Vanegas, a leader of the Independent Trade Union Movement of Nicaragua (MOSAN), went to the locality of Santa Rosa del Pen in order to hold a meeting with the workers of a chalk quarry. Upon his arrival he was detained by the local police in accordance with alleged orders from their superiors. The complainants add that Mr. Vanegas was taken on foot to the town limits of Santa Rosa del Pen, where he was released, and that a member of MOSAN, Lidia Madariaga, who had witnessed the unlawful detention of Mr. Vanegas, followed him in order to see what happened and approached him after he had been released. "" Shortly after "", the I.F.C.T.U goes on to state, "" Lidia Madariaga was found dead on the road back to Santa Rosa del Pen, with her skull crushed in."" The complainants refer to the lack of safeguards for trade union rights and add that the facts they report are a flagrant violation of the Constitution and international standards of the I.L.O.
.In its communication dated  February  the Government referred to the previous communications from the Director-General informing it of the Governing Body's decision that various complaints connected with this case were irreceivable on the basis of the recommendation made by the Committee on Freedom of Association and in accordance with the procedure in force.
.The Government further stated that the police and judicial authorities had investigated the circumstances of the death of Mrs. Lidia Madariaga and had ascertained that it was an ordinary crime passionnel and in no way connected with trade union matters; the murderer had been tried and sentenced. The Government added that it was refraining from sending the documents connected with the case "" because the complaints lodged had been deemed irreceivable ""; it had therefore considered the matter as closed and any subsequent request as being out of order.
.In view of this last statement the Committee wishes to point out that, in connection with the present case, the Government had been requested to supply its observations concerning the complaint lodged by the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions on  May  (see paragraphs  and  above). The communications recalling the Government's attention to this request referred expressly to the complaint of the I.F.C.T.U which is the only text that has been transmitted to the Government for that purpose, being a receivable complaint in accordance with the procedure in force. Consequently, the fact that the Committee should have considered inadmissible other complaints relating to the same case does not prevent it from continuing its examination of the allegations made by the I.F.C.T.U.
.These allegations refer, first and foremost, to the action of the police who, by detaining and forcibly conducting Mr. Amadeo Vanegas away from his destination, prevented him from holding a meeting with a group of workers. The Government does not refer specifically in its observations to this aspect of the matter.
.As regards the death of Mrs. Lidia Madariaga which, according to the complainants seemed to have been the result of her trade union activities, the Government states that this crime had nothing to do with trade union matters and that the criminal had been tried and sentenced. The Government further states that it has not sent any documents relating to the judgments because it considered the examination of the case by the Committee as closed.
.The Committee, however, considers it appropriate to point out, as it has done in many previous cases, that it has regularly followed the practice, when called upon to examine matters which were the subject of national judicial proceedings, of requesting the governments concerned to furnish the text of the judgments pronounced and the grounds adduced therein, where it considered that this information would be of assistance to it in appreciating whether or not allegations were well founded.
.In these circumstances, before proceeding with its examination of the case, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to request the Government to be so good as to send its observations concerning the allegations to the effect that the trade union leader, Mr. Amadeo Vanegas, was detained and conducted outside the city limits by the police of Santa Rosa del Pen because he had tried to hold a meeting with a group of workers;(b) for the reasons set forth in paragraph  above, to request the Government to be good enough to furnish the text of the judgment pronounced on the murderer of the trade unionist Mrs. Lidia Madariaga, together with the grounds adduced therein;(c) to take note of this interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report once it has received the observations and additional information referred to under subparagraphs (a) and (b) above.",1,1966,Nicaragua
121,".These cases were considered by the Committee at its session in February , when it submitted to the Governing Body its interim conclusions in paragraphs  to  of its rd Report, approved by the Governing Body at its st Session (February-March ).
.In a communication dated  March  the Government sent certain additional observations, which had been requested by the Committee.
.Ecuador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations still to be examined refer to two separate questions: first, that workers' organisations have been obliged to provide the authorities with certain information, and secondly, that the rules of a workers' organisation have been amended by order of the Ministry of Social Welfare and Labour.
.As regards the first question, the complainants alleged that by order of the Director-General of Labour (December ) all the workers' organisations had been compelled under threat of punishment to submit to the authorities, within a peremptory time-limit, a list of their members, a list of the members of the managing committees, and certified copies of the proceedings of the last general assembly and ordinary session held. In the complainants' opinion this demand constituted interference by the authorities in the affairs of trade union organisations, in violation of freedom of association.
.In its communication dated  March  the Government claims that the action taken by the Ministry of Social Welfare and Labour does not constitute a violation of trade union rights, since the aim had been to draw up full statistics of the workers' and employers' organisations in the country.
.In view of the Government's reply, and of the fact that the complainants have submitted no further information in support of their claim that the demand for the information in question constituted interference by the authorities in the affairs of trade union organisations, the Committee considers that this particular aspect of the allegations does not call for further consideration.
.The complainants also supplied a copy of a letter from the Ministry of Social Welfare and Labour to a trade union transmitting to it a copy of the "" amendments to the rules of this trade union "". Some of the amendments, which were apparently approved in  by Ministerial Order No. , appeared merely to involve points of form or wording; but one of them provided for the insertion of a clause in the rules whereby the union is required to forward annually to the Ministry a series of documents, namely a copy of the minutes of the last general assembly, with the names of those present, a copy of the General Secretary's report, as approved by the assembly, a copy of the Treasurer's report, etc. Failure to do so within the  days following the statutory date for the election of the new executive committee would result in the trade union's being deemed to have gone into liquidation.
.At its session in February  the Committee observed that the Government had not furnished its observations on this aspect of the matter, but pointed out the importance that the Governing Body had always attached to the principle that workers' organisations should be free to draw up their Constitutions and rules and to organise their administration and their activities, and that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which might restrict that right or impede the lawful exercise thereof.
.On the basis of the evidence supplied by the complainants the Committee pointed out that amendment of a trade union's rules by ministerial order, in respect of matters which appear not to have been confined to points of pure form but to have also involved the insertion in these rules of provisions of substance which might jeopardise the very existence of the union, appeared incompatible with the aforementioned principle.
.Nevertheless, before submitting its final conclusions, the Committee requested the Government, in paragraph  of its rd Report, to be good enough to forward its observations on this aspect of the case.
.In its communication dated  March , as in its original reply, the Government failed to furnish its observations on this point.
.According to the Labour Code of Ecuador, in order for a workers' organisation to be granted legal personality it must be governed in accordance with rules approved by the Ministry of Social Welfare and Labour (section ), such approval being required for registration (section ). Section  of the Code lists ten subjects which trade union rules must deal with if they are to be approved. There is only one subject in this list with regard to which the Code specifies the purport of the statement which is to be included in the rules-namely a statement to the effect that any collective action of a political or religious kind is forbidden. In respect of none of the remaining nine subjects-which appears to leave the organisations concerned adequate freedom in drafting their statutes-is there anything relating to the submission of reports to the authorities.
.In the absence of fuller information, and particularly of the Government's comments, the Committee finds it difficult to decide the extent to which, in practice, the Minister exercises the power conferred on him by the Code to approve trade union rules. The Committee has only the example referred to by the complainants and not denied by the Government, which would appear to show that the power may be exercised in a discretionary manner and not exclusively with regard to points of form but also with regard to points of substance.
.Accordingly, the Committee wishes to point out that the principle mentioned in paragraph  above is incorporated in Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), Ecuador's ratification of which was registered on  May . With regard to this standard the Committee of Experts on the Application of the Conventions and Recommendations has pointed out that the right of organisations freely to draw up their own Constitutions and rules appears to be considerably restricted in countries, for instance, where the rules must be submitted for previous approval by the authorities, whose power of decision does not appear to be limited by any specific rules.
.In these circumstances, and with regard to the two cases as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to decide, for the reasons set forth in paragraph  above, that the allegations relating to the submission by trade union organisations in general of certain information, as demanded by the authorities, do not call for further examination;(b) with regard to the amendments made by the authorities to the rules of a trade union, to draw the Government's attention, for the reasons set forth in paragraphs  to  above, to the importance of the standard contained in Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Ecuador, according to which workers' and employers' organisations shall have the right to draw up their Constitutions and rules and the public authorities shall refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof.
.The Committee has deemed it appropriate to examine together the three cases relating to Ecuador which it has before it.
.Case No.  has been examined by the Committee at a number of previous meetings, the last occasion being in May , when it submitted to the Governing Body a further interim report which is to be found in paragraphs  to  of the Committee's th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (May ). The only aspect of this case which remains outstanding concerns the fate of three trade unionists on whose alleged detention the Government had failed until recently to forward its observations.
.Case No.  concerns a complaint presented to the I.L.O by the Ecuadorian Federation of Christian Trade Unions (C.E.D.O.C.) on  March  in which allegations were made concerning the imposition upon workers' organisations of certain obligations which the complainants considered to constitute an infringement of freedom of association. In a letter dated  March  the International Federation- of Christian Trade Unions declared its support for the aforementioned complaint. The C.E.D.O.C supplied further information in a letter dated  March . The texts of all three of these communications were duly transmitted to the Government.
.Case No.  concerns a complaint presented to the I.L.O by the Latin American Peasant Federation (F.C.L.) by a letter dated  March , followed by a further letter from the same organisation dated  April . The complaint alleged that legal personality had been refused to a workers' organisation, that trade unionists had been imprisoned and that trade unions had been wrongfully compelled to comply with certain obligations. The texts of both these communications were duly transmitted to the Government.
.By a communication dated  November  the Government has forwarded certain observations and information concerning the allegations mentioned in paragraphs  and  above.
.Ecuador has not",1,1966,Ecuador
122,"ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but it has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In these circumstances, and with regard to these cases as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to take note of the Government's statement according to which nobody is in prison today in Ecuador on account of his trade union activities;(b) to decide, for the reasons stated in paragraphs  and  above respectively, that no useful purpose would be served by continuing the examination of the allegations relating to the imprisonment of trade unionists, and that the allegation relating to the refusal to grant legal personality to a workers' organisation, mentioned by the complainants, does not call for further examination;(c) to take note of this interim report, on the understanding that the Committee will report further when it has received the observations requested from the Government by the Committee in paragraph  above.",-1,1966,Ecuador
123,".The complaints, sent from Miami (United States), are contained in a letter dated  February , signed by Mr. Reinaldo Pico Ramn, General Secretary of the Cuban Transport Workers' Revolutionary Organisation (in exile) (O.R.T.), and in a letter dated  March  from the Economic Corporations of Cuba (in exile). In another letter, of March , the O.R.T supplied further information in support of its complaint. These three letters were transmitted to the Government by a communication dated  May .
.At its meetings in May and November  and February  the Committee, not having received the observations requested from the Government, decided to adjourn its examination of the case.
.By letters dated  June,  November and  December  the O.R.T made further allegations, of which the Government was also informed.
.The Government furnished its observations in a communication dated  April  transmitted by the Cuban Permanent Delegation in Geneva.
.At its meeting in May  the Committee decided to adjourn its examination of the case until its next meeting.
.Cuba has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  February  the O.R.T denounces the inhuman treatment to which thousands of imprisoned workers are subjected and the absence of freedom of association which, according to the complainants, prevents the Cuban workers from electing their representatives freely. With regard to itself, the O.R.T states that it is composed of exiled Cuban workers from the transport sector and is affiliated with the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unionists (C.L.A.S.C.). In its later communications the O.R.T cites specific acts and statements by the government authorities, which, it asserts, prove its allegations to be well founded.
.The complaint of the Economic Corporations of Cuba (in exile), dated  March , states that the Government only defends state interests and openly attacks the right to organise, abolishing the normal type of employer or management system and substituting the State as sole employer. The complainants also state that in Cuba a system of compulsory labour has been established, contravening, inter alia, the right to free collective bargaining. In Cuba, they add, the workers used to have a say in the negotiations for wage fixing, either directly or in collective agreements or through their representatives on the tripartite minimum wage boards. In , however, the complainants allege, these committees were abolished by the Government, which in  "" prohibited wage fixing by collective agreement, this power remaining from thereon in the hands of the State "". In  and  the Government is said to have established the Communist system of "" wage categories "". The complainants also state that the above-mentioned measures contravene International Labour Conventions on forced labour, minimum wages, etc.
.In its reply of  April  the Government questions the right of the two complainant organisations to submit complaints to the I.L.O regarding alleged violations of freedom of association, but has nevertheless supplied detailed observations on some of the points raised.
.Rejecting the receivability of the complaint made by the Economic Corporations of Cuba (in exile), the Government repeats the arguments by which, in Case No. , it opposed the Committee's examination of another complaint by the same organisation. The Government considers it necessary also to draw attention to "" the highly suspect representation made after so long by the complainant organisation or members thereof in favour of the development and protection of trade union rights and social gains achieved by the workers..."". It considers that the complainants are pursuing mere propagandist objectives and aim at bringing about a return to the situation which prevailed before the establishment of the present social and economic system.
.With regard to the complaints presented by the O.R.T, the Government again refers to its previous arguments, when it defined its position "" on allegations of this kind which have no connection with the defence of the trade union movement in our country but, on the contrary, constitute an endeavour to raise to the international plane matters of internal and ideological policy and even mere cases of common criminal law"". The Government considers it necessary to establish, firstly, "" the true character of the complainant organisation, the circumstances surrounding its championing of the matter and the motives of its promoters "". The Government states that the O.R.T is not a national, still less an international, industrial association enjoying consultative status. Nor, the Government states, is this a matter of activities carried on outside Cuban territory by an organisation which might once have existed in Cuba. According to the Government, the allegations emanate from a new entity whose members are neither de facto nor de jure Cuban transport workers which, in the Government's opinion, precludes them from referring to themselves as an industrial association "" for the purposes set forth in I.L.O. Conventions Nos.  and  "". The Government goes on to declare that the O.R.T is totally unconnected with the interests of the transport workers and their legitimate organisations, which have a membership in Cuba of more than , workers.
.The Government considers it proper that the Governing Body and the Committee on Freedom of Association should not regard themselves as bound by any national definition of an industrial association but maintains that such an approach does not entitle them to attribute at will the character of industrial association to any association whatsoever, regardless of its object, nature and the manner of its establishment, since this would open the way to action of universal scope incompatible with the Constitutional provisions which define the competence of the International Labour Organisation.
.With regard to the substance of the questions raised by the Economic Corporations of Cuba (in exile), the Government rejects as "" completely and utterly false "" the version given by the complainants of certain facts and of certain labour or social legislation. The Government states that since it came to power on  January  no Constitutional or legal provision has been adopted to prohibit strikes, nor is bargaining with regard to contracts, either individually or collectively, proscribed or obstructed, nor has the wage system been organised to the detriment of the workers' interests.
.With regard to the substance of the questions raised by the O.R.T, the Government also rejects the version of the facts given in the complaint.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to draw the Government's attention to the importance which the Governing Body has always attached to Article  of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), which Cuba has ratified, according to which measures shall be taken for the full development and utilisation of machinery for voluntary negotiation, and, subject thereto, to decide that the allegations presented in this case do not call for further examination.",-1,1966,Cuba
124,".The complaint presented by the Staff Union of the Puno Tourist Hotel is contained in a communication dated  October  (received on  April ). The text of this communication was transmitted to the Government in a letter dated  April  and the Government forwarded its observations in a communication dated  August .
.Peru has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), as well as the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants allege that a set of claims which they presented was declared irreceivable, as it stood, by the Cuzco office of the Directorate of Labour so long as it had not been established that the complainant organisation was a registered trade union.
.The complainants state that, since they were not registered, they were obliged to follow a more complicated procedure than would have been necessary for a registered trade union, where only the signatures of the union leaders are required for a claim to be presented. In accordance with the law, the complainants were obliged to have their claim signed by  per cent plus one of their members.
.In the view of the complainants, such an attitude on the part of the authorities constitutes an infringement of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), which has been ratified by Peru. The complainants explain their position in this respect as follows: "" Following Legislative Resolution No.  of  December , adopted by the Peruvian Congress, the aforesaid Convention was ratified; it was put into force as a Peruvian law, and since it was promulgated by the Supreme Decree of  May  trade unions are no longer obliged to apply for official recognition, as was necessary before the Convention was applied "".
.In its observations the Government states that none of the rights guaranteed by Convention No.  was infringed by the Cuzco authorities. The inquiries made, the Government continues, reveal that the authorities in question were not exceeding their powers in demanding that this group of workers observe the provisions of Supreme Decree No.  ( May ), governing the application of Convention No.  in Peru, so as to legalise both the submission of their claim and the agreement which these workers might reach with their employers with regard to an improvement in wages and other working conditions.
.Since the complainants had not observed the above provisions, the Government continues, they were required to produce a petition signed by  per cent plus one of the workers on whose behalf they were acting, in accordance with section  of the Supreme Decree dated  March .
.Once this procedure was complied with, the Government states, the claims went through the stages of direct negotiation and conciliation and, as the parties had renounced their right to submit the case to arbitration, the matter was finally resolved by a decision of the labour authorities.
.By virtue of this decision-the text of which has been supplied by the Government there was "" a general increase of six soles in the wages paid to the staff of the Puno Tourist Hotel, with retroactive effect from the date of the submission of the claim; back payment resulting from the application of the increase is to be made within  days "" of the date of the decision. Finally, as the General Secretary of the trade union has, in agreement with the other officers of his union, withdrawn in writing all the other points in the claim, this matter "" should now be considered as finally settled "".
.From the complainants' allegations, the Committee notes firstly that it is not clear in what way Convention No.  is alleged to have been infringed. The complainants mention the fact that their trade union was not considered to be registered. It is true that if prior permission for the establishment or functioning of a trade union were required from the public authorities as a condition for the granting of registration, this would undeniably constitute an infringement of the Convention. This, however, does not seem to have been the case, for examination of the text of Supreme Decree No.  of  May  (sections  to ) shows that the registration of trade unions consists solely of a formality in which there is no question of infringing guarantees laid down by the Convention.
.The information at the Committee's disposal seems to indicate that the complainant trade union omitted to register in accordance with the provisions of Supreme Decree No.  and that it therefore had only a de facto existence. This being so, the authorities considered the complainants not as a "" trade union "" in the true sense of the term but rather as a "" group of workers "" within the meaning of section  of the Supreme Decree of  March , which is still in force. It is by virtue of this section that the authorities required  per cent plus one of the workers concerned to sign the claim, whereas if the trade union had been registered, as it was free to have been, the signatures of the trade union officers would have sufficed.
.Noting, however, that the complainants do not appear to have experienced any difficulty in collecting the number of signatures required, and that the matter was finally settled in a manner satisfactory to them, the Committee considers that it should recommend the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.",-1,1966,Peru
125,".This case was examined by the Committee for the first time at its session in October , when it submitted to the Governing Body an interim report, which is contained in paragraphs  to  of its rd Report. This report was approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ).
.In these circumstances, while maintaining its observations contained in subparagraph (c) of the text quoted in paragraph  above, the Committee, in view of the fact that the events referred to in this case date back to  and primarily because it would appear that the accused has regained his liberty, considers that no useful purpose would be served in pursuing the matter and therefore recommends the Governing Body to decide that the case does not call for further examination.
.In a letter dated  March  sent directly to the I.L.O the Latin American Peasant Federation declared, in very general terms and without providing further details, that violent reprisals had been taken against the leaders of the Agrarian Trade Union Movement, an affiliate of the complaining organisation, and that Mr. Dario Cabrera Trillo had been assaulted; the nature of the assault was not specified.
.Before transmitting the complaint to the Government of Peru the Director-General notified the above-mentioned organisation, by a letter dated  April , that any additional information it wished to submit in support of its complaint should be sent within one month's time. The complainants sent no further communication within the time stated.
.In another communication, dated  May , the Latin American Peasant Federation submitted concrete allegations concerning the detention of the trade union leader mentioned above, which were conveyed to the Government by a letter dated  May ; the Government answered by a communication dated  June  from the Permanent Delegation of Peru in Geneva.
.Peru has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communication dated  May  the complainants state that Dario Cabrera Trillo, a rural trade union leader, was detained by the Military Intelligence Service of Peru on  May , as he was going to the airport to travel to Mexico in order to attend a meeting of the Latin American Peasant Federation. According to the complainants, Mr. Cabrera Trillo was held incommunicado in the Control and Safety Section of that service until  May. It was not the first time that this trade union leader had suffered persecution at the hands of the police, since he had already been publicly pointed out in newspaper reports as a "" communist leader who sows discord among rural workers ""; the real reason why he was persecuted, however, was because of his energetic action on behalf of the organisation and defence of the rights of Peruvian rural workers. The complainants asked the I.L.O to make representations to the Government of Peru in order to obtain his release.
.In its reply dated  June  the Government first refers in general terms to the existence of a state of law in Peru, guaranteed by the Constitution. It affirms that the country's judicial organisation guarantees the full and normal exercise of Constitutional rights, including those of petition, assembly and free movement, as well as habeas corpus when any one of those rights is violated. The system operated within an organised order under which individuals and institutions exercised their rights and fulfilled the obligations laid on them by civilised life and the respect due to the State. Any person charged under criminal law was assured, inter alia, of the right to be tried in accordance with pre-existing laws and the right of defence.
.In the specific case of the rural trade union leader Mr. Daro Cabrera Trillo the investigations carried out by the Government had, according to the latter, established beyond all doubt his persistent action as an agitator in the Satipo region and his participation in the revolutionary left-wing movement which was responsible for beginning the guerilla war in Peru; he was therefore placed at the disposal of the Second Police Section, which operated under a code that had been established for many years and amply guaranteed the right of defence.
.The Committee points out that in many previous cases, where allegations that trade union leaders or workers have been arrested or detained on account of trade union activities have been met by governments with statements that the arrests or detentions were made for subversive activities for reasons of internal security or for common law crimes, the Committee has always followed the rule that the governments concerned should be requested to submit further information as precise as possible concerning the arrests or detentions and the exact reasons therefor. If in certain cases the Committee has concluded that the allegations relating to the arrest or detention of active trade unionists do not call for further examination, this has been after it has received information from the governments showing in a sufficiently clear and detailed way that the arrests or detentions were in no way occasioned by trade union activities but solely by activities outside the trade union sphere which were either prejudicial to public order or of a political nature.
.The Committee further points out that in past cases in which the matters raised have been the subject of proceedings before a national judicial authority it has followed the practice, considering that the decisions given might make available information of assistance to it in appreciating whether or not allegations were well-founded, of requesting governments to communicate the text of the judgments given and the grounds adduced therein.
.Lastly, the Committee has always insisted, in all cases where trade union leaders have been detained either for political offences or for common law offences, on the importance it attaches to the right of all detained persons to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment by an impartial and independent judicial authority.
.In the present case the complainants allege that Mr. Cabrera Trillo was arrested because of his trade union activities and the Government replies that the arrest was motivated by his activities aimed at disturbing public order and armed subversion and that he had been brought to trial before the Second Police Section, whose procedural rules, it states, guarantee the right of defence.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to take note of the Government's communication dated  June , from which it appears that the trade union leader, Mr. Dario Cabrera Trillo, who according to the complainants had been detained on  May , was placed at the disposal of the Second Police Section on a charge of agitation and participation in a guerilla movement;(b) to request the Government to be good enough to specify, as soon as possible, the exact nature of the offences with which Mr. Cabrera Trillo is charged and keep it informed of the outcome of the trial, supplying the text of the court verdict and the reasons adduced therein as soon as it is handed down;(c) to draw the attention of the Government to the importance it has always attached to the principle of prompt trial by an independent and impartial judiciary in all cases, including cases in which trade unionists are charged with political or criminal offences;(d) bearing in mind the principle referred to above, to request the Government to be good enough to specify the procedural rules applied by the Second Police Section;(e) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will report further to the Governing Body when it has received the additional information requested from the Government under subparagraphs (b) and (d) above.",0,1966,Peru
126,"ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but it has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In these circumstances, and with regard to these cases as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to take note of the Government's statement according to which nobody is in prison today in Ecuador on account of his trade union activities;(b) to decide, for the reasons stated in paragraphs  and  above respectively, that no useful purpose would be served by continuing the examination of the allegations relating to the imprisonment of trade unionists, and that the allegation relating to the refusal to grant legal personality to a workers' organisation, mentioned by the complainants, does not call for further examination;(c) to take note of this interim report, on the understanding that the Committee will report further when it has received the observations requested from the Government by the Committee in paragraph  above.",-1,1966,Ecuador
127,".These cases were considered by the Committee at its session in February , when it submitted to the Governing Body its interim conclusions in paragraphs  to  of its rd Report, approved by the Governing Body at its st Session (February-March ).
.In a communication dated  March  the Government sent certain additional observations, which had been requested by the Committee.
.Ecuador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations still to be examined refer to two separate questions: first, that workers' organisations have been obliged to provide the authorities with certain information, and secondly, that the rules of a workers' organisation have been amended by order of the Ministry of Social Welfare and Labour.
.As regards the first question, the complainants alleged that by order of the Director-General of Labour (December ) all the workers' organisations had been compelled under threat of punishment to submit to the authorities, within a peremptory time-limit, a list of their members, a list of the members of the managing committees, and certified copies of the proceedings of the last general assembly and ordinary session held. In the complainants' opinion this demand constituted interference by the authorities in the affairs of trade union organisations, in violation of freedom of association.
.In its communication dated  March  the Government claims that the action taken by the Ministry of Social Welfare and Labour does not constitute a violation of trade union rights, since the aim had been to draw up full statistics of the workers' and employers' organisations in the country.
.In view of the Government's reply, and of the fact that the complainants have submitted no further information in support of their claim that the demand for the information in question constituted interference by the authorities in the affairs of trade union organisations, the Committee considers that this particular aspect of the allegations does not call for further consideration.
.The complainants also supplied a copy of a letter from the Ministry of Social Welfare and Labour to a trade union transmitting to it a copy of the "" amendments to the rules of this trade union "". Some of the amendments, which were apparently approved in  by Ministerial Order No. , appeared merely to involve points of form or wording; but one of them provided for the insertion of a clause in the rules whereby the union is required to forward annually to the Ministry a series of documents, namely a copy of the minutes of the last general assembly, with the names of those present, a copy of the General Secretary's report, as approved by the assembly, a copy of the Treasurer's report, etc. Failure to do so within the  days following the statutory date for the election of the new executive committee would result in the trade union's being deemed to have gone into liquidation.
.At its session in February  the Committee observed that the Government had not furnished its observations on this aspect of the matter, but pointed out the importance that the Governing Body had always attached to the principle that workers' organisations should be free to draw up their Constitutions and rules and to organise their administration and their activities, and that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which might restrict that right or impede the lawful exercise thereof.
.On the basis of the evidence supplied by the complainants the Committee pointed out that amendment of a trade union's rules by ministerial order, in respect of matters which appear not to have been confined to points of pure form but to have also involved the insertion in these rules of provisions of substance which might jeopardise the very existence of the union, appeared incompatible with the aforementioned principle.
.Nevertheless, before submitting its final conclusions, the Committee requested the Government, in paragraph  of its rd Report, to be good enough to forward its observations on this aspect of the case.
.In its communication dated  March , as in its original reply, the Government failed to furnish its observations on this point.
.According to the Labour Code of Ecuador, in order for a workers' organisation to be granted legal personality it must be governed in accordance with rules approved by the Ministry of Social Welfare and Labour (section ), such approval being required for registration (section ). Section  of the Code lists ten subjects which trade union rules must deal with if they are to be approved. There is only one subject in this list with regard to which the Code specifies the purport of the statement which is to be included in the rules-namely a statement to the effect that any collective action of a political or religious kind is forbidden. In respect of none of the remaining nine subjects-which appears to leave the organisations concerned adequate freedom in drafting their statutes-is there anything relating to the submission of reports to the authorities.
.In the absence of fuller information, and particularly of the Government's comments, the Committee finds it difficult to decide the extent to which, in practice, the Minister exercises the power conferred on him by the Code to approve trade union rules. The Committee has only the example referred to by the complainants and not denied by the Government, which would appear to show that the power may be exercised in a discretionary manner and not exclusively with regard to points of form but also with regard to points of substance.
.Accordingly, the Committee wishes to point out that the principle mentioned in paragraph  above is incorporated in Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), Ecuador's ratification of which was registered on  May . With regard to this standard the Committee of Experts on the Application of the Conventions and Recommendations has pointed out that the right of organisations freely to draw up their own Constitutions and rules appears to be considerably restricted in countries, for instance, where the rules must be submitted for previous approval by the authorities, whose power of decision does not appear to be limited by any specific rules.
.In these circumstances, and with regard to the two cases as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to decide, for the reasons set forth in paragraph  above, that the allegations relating to the submission by trade union organisations in general of certain information, as demanded by the authorities, do not call for further examination;(b) with regard to the amendments made by the authorities to the rules of a trade union, to draw the Government's attention, for the reasons set forth in paragraphs  to  above, to the importance of the standard contained in Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Ecuador, according to which workers' and employers' organisations shall have the right to draw up their Constitutions and rules and the public authorities shall refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof.
.The Committee has deemed it appropriate to examine together the three cases relating to Ecuador which it has before it.
.Case No.  has been examined by the Committee at a number of previous meetings, the last occasion being in May , when it submitted to the Governing Body a further interim report which is to be found in paragraphs  to  of the Committee's th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (May ). The only aspect of this case which remains outstanding concerns the fate of three trade unionists on whose alleged detention the Government had failed until recently to forward its observations.
.Case No.  concerns a complaint presented to the I.L.O by the Ecuadorian Federation of Christian Trade Unions (C.E.D.O.C.) on  March  in which allegations were made concerning the imposition upon workers' organisations of certain obligations which the complainants considered to constitute an infringement of freedom of association. In a letter dated  March  the International Federation- of Christian Trade Unions declared its support for the aforementioned complaint. The C.E.D.O.C supplied further information in a letter dated  March . The texts of all three of these communications were duly transmitted to the Government.
.Case No.  concerns a complaint presented to the I.L.O by the Latin American Peasant Federation (F.C.L.) by a letter dated  March , followed by a further letter from the same organisation dated  April . The complaint alleged that legal personality had been refused to a workers' organisation, that trade unionists had been imprisoned and that trade unions had been wrongfully compelled to comply with certain obligations. The texts of both these communications were duly transmitted to the Government.
.By a communication dated  November  the Government has forwarded certain observations and information concerning the allegations mentioned in paragraphs  and  above.
.Ecuador has not",1,1966,Ecuador
128,"concerning developments in this dispute. It begins by stating that when the dockers' unions learned of the Government's intention of issuing new labour laws and regulations they submitted a memorandum on dockers' problems in which they emphasised the need to create a national port policy and expressed their willingness to co-operate for that purpose. As the Government refused to consider this offer of conciliation and co-operation, the dockers' unions declared a strike. Mr. Tolosa left the country for Montevideo to secure his personal safety and direct the strike from there.
.According to the I.T.F, the Government continued to maintain an intransigent attitude even though the dockers' unions had offered a solution including, among other points, the lifting of government control of the union, postponement of the enforcement of the new laws for  days, the creation of a tripartite committee of employers', workers' and government representatives to study the application of the new laws and the submission of any unresolved matters to arbitration.
.The I.T.F states that on  October it sent its member unions a circular requesting "" the fullest possible manifestation of international solidarity in an effort to assist the Argentine dockers "". At the same time a cable was sent to President Ongania "" notifying him of the possibility of international action and offering him the assistance of the I.T.F in mediation and negotiation "". In order to ensure that the Government had a true picture of the interest of the I.T.F in the dispute, Mr. Medrano, I.T.F. Director in Latin America, met various Argentine authorities including the Labour Secretary, who told him that if the dockers accepted the new regulations on working conditions temporarily a tripartite committee would be set up to consider the matter. After consulting with the unions, Mr. Medrano drafted the terms of a solution and submitted it to the Labour Secretary, who informed him that the Transport Secretary would have to be consulted before the Government could give a reply. Finally, after further meetings were held, the Labour Secretary, the I.T.F states, accepted a text, a copy of which is attached to its communication.
.The checkers' and foremen's unions agreed unanimously to accept the solution and return to work on  December. A delegates' conference of S.U.P.A was convened for Sunday,  December, which it was confidently expected would end the strike. When the delegates had assembled, the police arrested Mr. Tolosa on the grounds that he had left the country without permission; he was subsequently released on bail but re-arrested on a charge of acts harmful to the Argentine economy and finally released on  December.
.Still according to the I.T.F, the unions decided, once Mr. Tolosa was free, to return to work on  December on the basis of the agreement reached with the Secretaries of Labour and Transport, but when the men reported for work they were prevented from entering the dock area by the police and the military. The strike thus became a lockout, which the complainant organisation affirms is proof of the Government's intention to impose unilaterally its own conditions of work on the trade unions. It also affirms that the Government tried to force the acceptance of strike breakers in the docks and allow only sufficient regular dockers to be registered to make up the number required for the working of the port. The figures proposed by the captain in charge of the port were as follows:Strike breakers	Regular dockers	TotalForemen			Checkers			Dockers	,		,
.These figures, the complainants say, show strike breakers were greatly in the majority, leaving most of the port workers of Buenos Aires without employment because they had acted in defence of their legitimate trade union rights.
.In the meantime, a further warrant having been issued for Mr. Tolosa, he decided to give himself up on  January  and has been in prison ever since.
.Lastly, the complainants state that despite several further approaches made by the Regional Director to the authorities and those made by a joint I.C.F.T.U.-I.T.F mission, the Government maintained its attitude. The complainants state that the facts set forth constitute infringements of I.L.O. Conventions Nos.  and , since the Government has: taken steps to modify conditions of work in ports without prior consultation with the unions concerned; refused to consider any proposals submitted by the dockers' unions and in particular the memorandum on dockers' problems; appointed an official to take charge of the dockers' union (S.U.P.A.); recruited strike breakers; arrested the General Secretary of S.U.P.A, Mr. Eustaquio Tolosa, on  December  just as he was about to chair a meeting of his union, and again on  January ; locked out dockworkers, thereby victimising them for having taken part in a campaign ordered by their union; failed to honour the agreement reached by the representative of the complainant organisation and the Labour and Transport Secretaries.
.In its reply dated  May  to the allegations put forward by the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions and the Argentine Trade Union Movement, the Government states that in connection with the dockers' strike, Mr. Tolosa, who was on trial for his activities in the so-called Plan of Action of the C.G.T of , left the country without the necessary court authorisation to settle in Montevideo, where he began promoting the notion of an international boycott of Argentine ships and planes.
.The Government goes on to say that after an agreement had been reached which was to be examined by a union meeting on  December , Mr. Tolosa returned to Argentina. When this came to the knowledge of the judge who was conducting the proceedings, he ordered Tolosa to be arrested by virtue of section  of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Federal Capital which stipulates that, in order to be released on bail, a person standing trial shall undertake to obey any summons emanating from the judge and to have a fixed place of residence from which he may not absent himself without the knowledge and authorisation of the judge; a breach of this provision is sufficient to cause the accused to be imprisoned again.
.The Government supplies the text of a report by the federal police showing that the arrest was made in execution of an order from a national federal judge of the Criminal and Correctional Court of First instance in connection with Case No. / against various persons on charges of sedition and other offences. The report states that the arrest was made before the meeting convened by the leaders of the S.U.P.A began and that Mr. Tolosa complied with the order given by the police officer; although a few hot-heads tried to oppose his arrest, no one else was arrested and nobody was wounded or hurt.
.From various press cuttings supplied by the Government it would appear that legal proceedings were subsequently taken against Mr. Tolosa before another court for a breach of section  of Act No. , which makes an Argentine citizen liable to imprisonment if he promotes economic or political measures against the interests of the State by any means whatsoever.
.With regard to the dockers' dispute, the Government supplies the following information. With a view to achieving full operation of the country's ports, rational regulation of dock work and the elimination of a wastage of human and material resources that was detrimental to the community, the President of Argentina exercised the powers conferred on him by the Statute of the Argentine Revolution to approve Acts Nos.  and  and Decree No. . The Government supplies the text of all these provisions.
.The Government states that in this way dock work is brought within the scope of the general legislation regarding hours of work, days of rest and holidays which is applicable to all workers in the country. These measures modified the previous system which had also been set up unilaterally by the State (Legislative Decree No. / and Decree No. /) and distorted the principle of equality. In spite of these exceptional measures to regulate it, work in ports was constantly being perturbed by disputes arising out of futile motives and which led to an exorbitant rise in the cost of labour, so much so that the ports of Argentina became the most expensive in the world, particularly Buenos Aires which earned the name of "" dirty port "", with a resultant increase in freight rates. Act No.  and regulations thereunder lay down essential standards to enable port work to be brought back into the scope of the general labour law as already established.
.The Government takes the view that there has been no breach of any international agreement, any canon, standard or principle of social justice, or any prior collective agreement with the trade union organisations.
.It goes on to state that the Acts and decree in question were no sooner promulgated than the S.U.P.A declared a strike for the express purpose of paralysing port activities and solicited, through its representatives, the support of foreign trade unions in boycotting Argentine ships and planes and all the goods carried by them. According to the Government,",2,1966,Argentina
129,"Ministry of Labour on the request made by the Independent Union of Labourers to the President of the Republic for compensation for damage suffered by the union. According to the Ministry, since many persons had suffered losses owing to the civil war, the provisional Government had established a Commission for War Damage Compensation, which had been carefully examining and assessing all such complaints; the Independent Union of Labourers should therefore send its complaint of damage to the Commission.
.As regards the alleged constant violation of the International Labour Conventions, the Government states that these allegations are untrue.
.As regards the allegations concerning the damage suffered by the Independent Union of Labourers, it is difficult to appreciate, on the basis of the information provided by the complainants, to what extent this question is related to the exercise of trade union rights in the precise sense of that term. In any case the Government states that there is a commission specially established to examine all complaints such as that put forward by the Independent Union of Labourers. For the above reasons the Committee considers that these particular allegations do not call for further examination on its part.
.As for the allegations of violation of the International Labour Conventions, the Committee observes that they are expressed in very general terms and that the complainants do not make any precise statement as to which of the Conventions are at issue. The Government replies that these allegations are unfounded.
.Nevertheless, the Committee notes that the Government has not sent its observations on the following: (a) the assassination of trade unionists, the destruction of trade union "" bases "" and the other acts of persecution alleged by CONATRAL in its letter of  February ; (b) the acts of pressure on CONATRAL and the terrorist attack on that organisation's headquarters which are alleged by O.R.I.T in its letter of  February ; and (c) the circumstances which have obliged many trade union officers to leave the country, the acts of persecution and personal violence against the General Secretary of the Independent Union of Labourers and other officers, and the discrimination in respect of employment alleged to be practised by the Sugar Corporation (matters raised in the letter from the Independent Union of Labourers dated  May ). Accordingly, before continuing its examination of the case, the Committee considers it necessary to ask the Government to be good enough to furnish its observations, as a matter of urgency, on the allegations with which the present paragraph deals.",0,1966,Dominican Republic
130,"above, that no useful purpose would be served by pursuing the examination of the allegations of the Union of Temporary Workers of Petrleos Mexicanos relating to the arrest of six trade unionists in August , the arrest of Mr. Aristeo Barrios Morales and the attempted arrest of the trade union leader, Gabriel Rivera Rios;(b) to decide, for the reasons stated in paragraph  above, that the allegation of interference by Petrleos Mexicanos in the S.T.T.P.M does not call for further examination;(c) to take note of this interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report when it has received the observations requested from the Government in accordance with paragraph  above.
.The complaints are contained in a communication of  July  addressed to the I.L.O by the Union of Temporary Workers of Petrleos Mexicanos, of Poza Rica, Veracruz. In three subsequent communications, of  September,  December and  December , the same organisation sent additional information on the case. In a communication of  August  support for the said complaints was expressed by the Union of Workers in the Industry of Prawns, Shellfish and Refrigerated Products in General of the Port of Coatzalcoalcos and the Industrial Workers' Union of the Federal Zone and Free Ports of the City of Coatzalcoalcos.
.All these communications were transmitted to the Government, which sent detailed observations on the case annexed to the communication of  November  from the Mexican Delegation to the International Organisations in Geneva, and the additional information annexed to the communication of  January  from the same permanent delegation.
.Mexico has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but has not ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the main, the complaints and additional information presented by the complainants reproduce and amplify various allegations relating to the position of temporary workers in the Mexican petroleum industry, allegations which constitute Case No. , which the Committee had before it at its meeting in February . On that occasion the Committee recommended the Governing Body to decide to dismiss the complaint because, among other reasons, allegations of infringements of freedom of association made in the case mentioned by a professional organisation (The Federation of Workers' Revolutionary Organisations) were couched in such vague terms that it was impossible to examine the question on its merits; further, that organisation did not avail itself of the possibility open to it of submitting additional information; and, finally, various other communications were not receivable under the procedure in force.
.In accordance with a decision of the Governing Body, in all cases in which a complaint refers to exactly the same infringements of trade union rights as those on which the Committee has already given a decision, the procedure is not automatically set in motion, but the Director-General is authorised to refer the complaint in the first place to the Committee for a decision as to whether action should be taken or not. Nevertheless, when the allegations, even though they are based in general on the same facts as complaints rejected in an earlier case, are presented in a more precise or more detailed manner than on the first occasion, the Committee has expressed the opinion that the new allegations cannot be rejected on principle but must be examined by the Committee. That is the case with the allegations submitted by the Union of Temporary Workers of Petrleos Mexicanos, which the Committee is examining in the present report.Allegations relating to the Application of Closed Shop or Union Security Clauses
.In their communications of  July and  September  the complainants allege that the exclusion clause (section  of the Federal Labour Law) and the collective labour contract in force between the state undertaking Petrleos Mexicanos and the Petroleum Workers' Union of the Republic of Mexico prevent freedom of association and the exercise by temporary and permanent workers of the right to form other unions "" because they are immediately dismissed and denied the right to return to work in the industry "". In particular, the leaders of the complainant union are alleged to be on a "" black list "" of workers with whom a contract is not to be made. Vacancies are alleged to be sold "" to the highest bidder "", with the result that workers are put forward to fill them who have never worked for the undertaking, to the detriment of temporary workers and contrary to the latter's right to priority under section , subsection I, of the Federal Labour Law. According to the complainants, under clause  of the collective agreement the undertaking would be - obliged to dismiss without further explanation workers whose dismissal was requested by the union which signed the agreement.
.Further, the national labour courts are said to have ceased since  to apply the provisions of section , subsection , of the said law (the rule whereby a written labour contract should state its duration, or whether it is for an indefinite period, etc.). The complain ants state that when the contract does not clearly specify the time, or special or unusual work which has to be done, it should be regarded as being for an indefinite period (permanent); and they add that since  the labour courts have ceased to apply that rule on the pretext that the collective agreement takes precedence. In that way they have given verdicts confirming the termination of the work contracts of certain workers whose names are submitted.
.The complainants also accuse Petrleos Mexicanos of deducting from the temporary workers' pay the amount of the trade union subscriptions in favour of the trade union which signed the collective agreement, in spite of the fact that the temporary workers are not, according to them, members of the said union. They maintain that the latter, when intervening in the granting of contracts to temporary workers, does not do so as their representative union but as an intermediary or contractor between them and the undertaking. In an annex to the complaint the complainants quote a provision of the Statutes of the Union of Petroleum Workers of the Republic of Mexico, according to which only those temporary workers are recognised as supernumerary members who were registered as such up to  November , although in the case of the retirement or death of a supernumerary member one of his relations can be admitted on the same basis.
.In such circumstances, according to figures given for April , , temporary workers doing daily work for Petrleos Mexicanos are stated to lack the right to form unions, to make contracts freely either collectively or individually, to be granted recognition of seniority in their work, the acquisition of pension and social welfare rights, participation in the savings fund, help in the education of their children and other benefits which are given to workers with a permanent contract.
.In their communication of  July  the complainants request the intervention of the I.L.O with the Mexican Government with a view to obtaining recognition and registration of the Union of Temporary Workers of Petrleos Mexicanos, and recognition of the right to make, as representative of the temporary workers, a collective contract with the undertaking. They also request such intervention with a view to the reinstatement in permanent jobs of  workers named in the complaint, whose dismissal was confirmed by the courts (see paragraph  above).
.In its observation of  November  the Government refers, in the first place, to the system of law prevailing in the country, deriving from the Constitution and the laws promulgated in conformity with it, such laws and contracts concluded between parties in conformity with them governing relations between individuals and the State and between individuals themselves. It goes on to cite various regulations of the Federal Labour Law whereby every employer who employs workers belonging to a trade union is obliged to conclude with the latter, when requested, a collective contract; but if there are various unions in one and the same undertaking, the collective contract has to be made with the union with the greatest number of workers in the business (section ). The collective contract must be in writing and deposited with the Federal Conciliation and Arbitration Board (section ). The provisions of the collective contract cover all persons working in the undertaking, even if they are not members of the union which made the contract (section ). The clause in collective contracts whereby the employer undertakes only to accept workers who are trade union members is legal (section ).
.The Government points out that the Petroleum Workers' Union of the Republic of Mexico has been registered since , and signed the first collective contract with the state undertaking, Petrleos Mexicanos, in . That agreement has been revised since then, the last revision having taken place in . Clause  of the contract lays down that "" in cases of definite vacancies or definite newly created posts ... the employer",1,1966,Mexico
131,"a view to reaching definitive conclusions, to have the text of the sentences pronounced on the persons named in paragraphs  and  above.
.With regard to the persons whose names appear in paragraph  above, the Committee wishes to recall that in all cases in which trade unionists have been detained, either for political offences or for common-law crimes, the Committee has emphasised the importance it attaches to the right of trade unionists, like all other persons, to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment by an impartial and independent judicial authority. The Government denies that the persons in question were acting as trade unionists in the circumstances leading to their arrest and indictment. Nevertheless, the Committee considers that it would be desirable to request the Government to be good enough to report on the stage reached in the trials in question and the rules of procedure applied by the military courts and also to communicate the text of the sentences handed down with respect to these persons as well as the motives adduced therein.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to take note of the statement by the Government concerning the grounds for the detentions and to decide that the allegations relating to the detention of the persons named in paragraph  above do not call for further examination. It further recommends the Governing Body to request the Government to be good enough to supply the additional information indicated in paragraphs  to  above.
.With respect to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) subject to the principle set out in paragraph  above and for the reasons expressed in paragraphs  and , to decide that the allegations relating to acts of repression and discrimination against certain trade union organisations and to infringement of trade union privilege do not call for further examination;(b) with regard to the allegations relating to the detention of trade union leaders:(i) to take note of the statements by the Government that the measures in question have been taken on the grounds of criminal offences or subversive activities;(ii) for the reasons expressed in paragraph  above, to decide that the allegations relating to the detention of the persons named in paragraph  do not call for further examination;(iii) for the reasons expressed in paragraph  above, to request the Government to be good enough to send the text of the sentences passed on the four persons named in paragraphs  and ;(iv) with regard to the five persons whose trials are pending before military courts and whose names appear in paragraph  above, and for the reasons expressed in paragraph , to request the Government to be good enough to inform it of the rules of procedure applied by these military courts and on the stage reached in the trials in question and also to communicate the text of any sentences that may have been handed down;(v) to request the Government to be good enough to furnish its observations on the measures that are alleged to have been taken against the two persons named in paragraph  above;(c) to take note of this interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report when it has received the additional information requested from the Government in subparagraph (b) (iii), (iv) and (v) of this paragraph and the confirmation requested by the Committee in paragraph  above.
.The complaint is contained in a communication dated  June  sent to the I.L.O by the Sole Confederation of Venezuelan Workers (C.U.T.V.). By a communication dated  June  the World Federation of Trade Unions expressed its support for the said complaint. The text of both communications was transmitted to the Government, which replied by letter dated  November .
.Venezuela has not ratified either the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In addition to some general references to social and economic problems which are said by the complainants to afflict the mass of the population (unemployment, high cost of living, etc.), the text of the complaint presented by C.U.T.V and its appendices contain a number of allegations in support of its claim that the "" unofficial workers' movement "" in Venezuela has been repressed, persecuted and ill-treated. According to the complainants this policy of repression of the "" workers' and people's movement "" has manifested itself in many ways, not being confined to police coercion but involving also the systematic violation of the Constitution, basic legal procedure in courts and human rights. Some of the allegations concern the arrest, trial and ill-treatment of a large number of persons, whose names are given. According to the complainants some of these persons are politicians, students, "" peasants "" or ordinary citizens, while others are trade union members or officials. Other allegations accuse the authorities of engaging in acts of repression and discrimination against C.U.T.V and its affiliated unions and restricting the right to strike and to bargain collectively.
.Those allegations which refer specifically to alleged infringement of freedom of association are examined separately below, together with the Government's comments upon them.Allegations relating to Acts of Repression and Discrimination against Certain Trade Union Organisations
.C.U.T.V's complaint alleges that there have been constant raids by the police without judicial authority on trade union premises, like that which took place at the central headquarters of C.U.T.V in , when the police seized files and other property of the organisation. The same is said to have happened repeatedly at the offices of regional federations in the states of Lara, Zulia, Monagas and Carabobo, and on the premises of trade unions in various parts of the country. Even at workplaces the workers are constantly supervised and threatened by police officers attached to the staff of undertakings under agreements between the authorities and the employers. In this way discriminatory action is taken against members of the trade unions belonging to C.U.T.V, who, as soon as they are identified as such, are dismissed. For their part, the labour inspectorates and other authorities set up for the purposes of conciliation and arbitration in labour-management disputes and to ensure the enforcement of the law and the safeguarding of workers' rights, far from carrying out these functions, impede the activities of trade union organisations which do not support the Government and join forces with the employers to damage the interests of the workers.
.In its reply of  November  the Government rejects the complainants' allegation that a policy of repression and persecution of the "" unofficial workers' movement "" has been pursued in Venezuela. To show the falsity of this assertion to the effect that an institutional and democratic government, voted into office under the Constitutional procedure, resorts to force or illegality, it is enough, according to the Government, to observe the simple fact that the very organisation making the complaint was established and legally approved in , being composed of four federations which in their turn covered  trade unions. In the procedure for the legal approval of trade unions no kind of discrimination is applied or tolerated. All organisations that have complied with the conditions required by the Labour Act and the regulations issued under it have been legally approved within the period laid down by law. Between  and  legal approval was given to , trade unions. There is likewise no truth in the assertion that the labour inspectorates and other bodies concerned with labour matters fail to carry out their functions and join forces with the employers. Labour officials of all grades enjoy the confidence and the gratitude of both sides in labour relations. The Government carries out programmes to improve the qualifications of these officials and the efficiency of the services.
.The Committee observes that in its reply the Government categorically denies that the authorities resort to force or unlawful action against workers' organisations, that any form of discrimination is practised in connection with the legal approval of trade unions or that bias is shown by labour officials. However, the Government makes no comment on the allegations in the complaint concerning the raiding of trade union premises, police intervention at workplaces or the dismissal of workers for the sole reason, according to the complainants, that they belong to unions affiliated to C.U.T.V. Consequently, before proceeding with its examination of this aspect of the case, the Committee considers that the Government should be requested to furnish its observations with respect to the three points mentioned.Allegations relating to the Right to Strike and to Bargain Collectively
.It is stated in the complaint that although the right to strike is confirmed in the Constitution and in the Labour Act it has in practice been suppressed, since the Government does not allow strikes by the organisations affiliated to C.U.T.V, or even by the unions belonging to the pro-government labour Confederation. In another part of the complaint it is asserted that the collective bargaining",0,1966,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
132,"of the courts"".
.The Committee wishes to recall the importance it has always attached in all cases, including those where trade unionists are accused of political or common law offences that the Government considers to be unconnected with their trade union duties, to the principle that the persons concerned should receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment by an impartial and independent judicial authority. Where the information received by the Committee has made it clear that the persons concerned were tried by the competent judicial authorities with all the safeguards of normal judicial procedure, and sentenced for offences unconnected with their trade union activities or outside the scope of normal trade union activities, the Committee has considered that the cases in question did not call for further examination. Nevertheless, the Committee has insisted that the question as to whether the matter in respect of which sentences have been imposed is to be regarded as a matter relating to a criminal offence or as a matter relating to the exercise of trade union rights is not one which can be determined unilaterally by the government concerned, but that it is incumbent upon the Committee to decide this in the light of all the information, and in particular in the light of the text of the judgment.
.With regard to the trial and sentence of Mr. Esguerra, the Committee has examined carefully the comments and information furnished by the Government, especially the text of the judgment. The Committee is of the opinion that the acts said to have been committed by Mr. Esguerra which led to his being found guilty of the offence of fraud are clearly quite outside the scope of any trade union activity.
.The situation is not the same in the case of the acts on account of which he was found guilty of attempted homicide. These involved the intervention of Mr. Esguerra in an act of protest by workers and trade union officials in support of labour claims. The action he took consisted, first, in inducing these workers to stage a hunger strike, in which they were quite willing to participate. Later Mr. Esguerra is said to have tried to prevent the participants in the strike from abandoning it or from being given food and assistance, thus endangering their lives. As a result, according to the judgment, it was necessary for the forces of public order to intervene in order that the strikers might be taken to hospital. Nevertheless, the Committee also observes that the Government earlier supplied information (communication of  January ) to the effect that "" seven persons took part in a hunger strike at the doors of the United Nations office but lack of food was endangering their health and this induced them to give up the strike and seek medical treatment "". Of these seven persons, "" six were taken at their own request by staff of the Social Welfare Directorate to the general hospital in Mexico City. The remaining person preferred to go to a private clinic. ""
.Since an appeal has been lodged with the High Court of Justice against the judgment whereby sentence was pronounced, concerning which the Government has not yet supplied the promised information, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to adjourn examination of the case and request the Government to be good enough to forward the text of the judgment pronounced by the court in question together with the grounds adduced therefor.
.The last report to the Governing Body in respect of this case, which was examined by the Committee at its session in February , is contained in paragraphs  to  of its rd Report.
.That report, which the Governing Body approved at its st Session (February-March ), contained the Committee's definitive conclusions with regard to some of the allegations made in this case, namely those relating to the imprisonment of a number of trade unionists and to interference by the undertaking "" Petrleos Mexicanos "" in the affairs of the Union of Temporary Workers of Petrleos Mexicanos (STTPM).
.In the report in question the Committee also requested the Government to furnish its observations on other allegations made by the IFCTU in a communication dated  January . In reply to that request the Government made certain comments in a communication transmitted to the ILO on  September  by the Permanent Delegation of Mexico in Geneva, and brought to the Committee's attention at its session in November .
.In its communication of  January  the IFCTU requested the ILO to approach the Mexican Government as a matter of urgency with a view to securing the release of a trade unionist who had been arrested and imprisoned "" for his trade union activities "". The person in question was said to be Mr. Rubn Carlos Esguerra, a leader of the STTPM, who, with some of his colleagues, had been sent to the Lecumberri prison.
.In its observations the Government declared that "" since the so-called Union of Temporary Workers of Petrleos Mexicanos appears to have submitted no new information or facts concerning the complaint in question which could substantially change the previous situation, the Government considers that there is no need for presenting new observations and hopes that the interim decision referred to previously will be made definitive "".
.After examining the case at its session in November  the Committee expressed its regret that the Government's reply made no reference at all to the specific allegation in the IFCTU's communication of  January  concerning in particular the imprisonment of Mr. Esguerra, and requested the Government to be good enough to forward its observations on this aspect of the case.
.This request having been transmitted to the Government by a letter dated  November , the Government replied by a communication dated  January .
.In its reply the Government states that since accusations had been made against Mr. Esguerra and others of offences defined in and punishable under the Penal Code, the Public Prosecutor undertook an investigation of the alleged facts and found that there were grounds for the institution of the appropriate criminal proceedings.
.The Government continues by indicating that in these circumstances Mr. Esguerra and those accused with him were prosecuted within three days of their arrest-the time limit during which, under the Constitution, a person may be detained without being charged. Mr. Esguerra was formally charged with attempted murder and fraud; the other persons involved in this affair were charged with either fraud or threats, or both.
.The Government then states that in view of the separation of powers the Executive Power can do nothing to have the accused persons sentenced or acquitted by the judiciary. Nevertheless, the Government says that it is in a position to state that the trial in question is taking place under conditions which afford all the guarantees of normal judicial procedure, as laid down in article  of the Federal Political Constitution.
.In conclusion the Government indicates that the trial is expected to end shortly and states that it will communicate to the ILO the text of the judgment as soon as it is handed down.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to take note of the Government's statement to the effect that the text of the judgment pronounced in the case in question will be communicated to the ILO; in accordance with its constant practice, the Committee further recommends the Governing Body to request the Government to communicate at the same time the text of the grounds adduced for the judgment in question; lastly, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to adjourn examination of the case pending receipt of the information referred to above.
.This case was already examined by the Committee at its session in February . On that occasion the Committee submitted to the Governing Body the conclusions contained in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, which was approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (June ).
.In this report the Committee presented its final conclusions on two aspects of the case with regard to the application of closed shop or union security clauses in the petroleum industry and the supposedly biased attitude of a government official.
.In two communications dated  and  January  from the Permanent Delegate of Mexico to the international organisations in Geneva, the Government furnished its observations on the remaining aspects of the case and on new allegations made by the Union of Temporary Workers of Petrleos Mexicanos (S.T.T.P.M.).
.In a communication dated  January  the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions submitted a complaint with regard to the case, the text of which was sent to the Government in a letter dated  February .
.Mexico has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but has not ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In these circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to decide, for the reasons given in paragraph ",0,1966,Mexico
133,"strike of their own accord. In any event, any opposition by Mr. Esguerra to the wishes of the participants to interrupt the strike would constitute an obvious overstepping of his authority, the seriousness of which, from a penal standpoint, would be a matter for the judicial authorities to determine in the light of the circumstances of the case.
.The Committee observes that Mr. Esguerra has been tried by the normal judicial authorities, that they have applied the procedure generally applicable to such cases, that he was assisted by counsel and that he availed himself of his right of appeal-an avenue still open to him in respect of the ruling of the higher court if he considers that the Constitutional guarantees were not applied to him.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to take note of the present report, to draw the Government's attention to the foregoing remarks and to request the Government to keep it informed of any further developments in this case.
.The last report to the Governing Body in respect of this case, which was examined by the Committee at its session in May , is contained in paragraphs  to  of its th Report.
.Since that report was submitted a communication has been received from the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) dated  June  and one from Mr. Rubn Carlos Esguerra dated  July . Both have been transmitted to the Government, which so far has not forwarded its observations on them.
.In another connection, on  February , the WCL sent a communication containing fresh allegations relating to certain events said to have taken place in Lecumberri Prison, of which a number of prisoners, including trade unionists, were the victims. The Government has forwarded its observations in this respect by a communication dated  August .
.With regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to decide, as regards the allegations relating to events said to have occurred in Lecumberri Prison, in view of the explanations given in paragraphs  and  and bearing in mind that the complaint is couched in very general terms without any more specific information being furnished by the complainants in substantiation of their allegations, that these allegations do not call for further examination;(b) with regard to the allegations relating to the imprisonment of Mr. Esguerra:(i) to draw the Government's attention once again to the importance attached by the Committee to the principle of a speedy and fair trial in all cases, including those where trade unionists are accused of political or common-law offences that the Government considers to be unconnected with their trade union duties;(ii) to request the Government to forward its comments and the information asked for as soon as possible;(c) to take note of the present interim report, on the understanding that the Committee will report again as soon as it is in possession of the comments and information requested from the Government in pursuance of clause (b) (ii) above.
.The last report to the Governing Body in respect of this case, which was examined by the Committee at its meeting in February , is contained in paragraphs  to  of its th Report.
.Since that report was submitted a series of communications have been received from Mr. Rubn Carlos Esguerra and his defending counsel and from the Mexican Government. The communications from Mr. Esguerra are dated  September and  October , that from his defence counsel is dated  November  and those from the Government were dispatched on  June and  September  and  January and  March .
.The Committee recalls that at the time it examined this case at its meeting in February  Mr. Esguerra, who had been acting as a trade union representative, and a number of other persons were undergoing trial, the former having been charged with attempted murder and fraud. According to a communication from the World Confederation of Labour dated  January , Mr. Esguerra had been arrested on account of his trade union activities. Since the Government had stated that the trial was expected to end shortly and that it would supply the text of the judgment, the Committee recommended the Governing Body to take note of this statement and request the Government to communicate at the same time the text of the grounds adduced for the judgment in question, adjourning examination of the case pending receipt of this information.
.On  June  the Government announced that sentence had been passed on Mr. Esguerra and promised to forward the text of the judgment. This it did on  September .
.According to the text of the judgment Mr. Esguerra was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment for fraud and attempted homicide. The offence of fraud consisted in having received money from a group of workers in return for a promise-which was not kept that he would secure employment for them with the Petrleos Mexicanos undertaking. The offence of attempted homicide consisted in having induced a number of workers and trade union officials to stage a hunger strike in support of their claims at the entrance to the United Nations Mexico City office building, and having subsequently prevented them, against their will (according to their own later statements), from abandoning the strike. The judgment states that an analysis of the evidence leads to the conclusion that, while it is true that these persons participated voluntarily and deliberately in the hunger strike to which they were induced by Esguerra, the offence of attempted homicide arose when those participating in the strike, finding themselves in danger of death, tried to abandon it and were prevented from doing so by Mr. Esguerra. Not only did he fail to give them food and assistance when they so requested and which they were unable to obtain for themselves, but he deliberately prevented food and help being given them by others. In the end, thanks to the intervention of the police, the workers in question were taken to hospital for treatment.
.Mr. Esguerra appealed against this sentence to the High Court of Justice. According to a communication from the Government dated  January  the hearing of the appeal was to take place on  January. The Government stated that it would keep the Committee informed of any further developments in the case. To date no such information has been received from the Government.
.On  September  Mr. Esguerra wrote directly to the ILO to complain of the treatment he was receiving in prison, alleging in particular that his lawyers were being prevented from visiting him. In a further communication dated  October  Mr. Esguerra again emphasised the difficulties he was having in briefing his defence counsel. He added that the witnesses who had testified against him (the persons who had participated in the hunger strike) had done so because pressure was brought to bear on them by the authorities while they were in hospital. In his view it was a political trial. On  November  one of his defence counsel, Mr. Snchez Ramirez, wrote to the ILO stating that he had requested copies of certain items of evidence in Mr. Esguerra's trial in order to prepare his defence, but that his request could not be met as the documents in question were no longer on the file.
.These various communications were transmitted to the Government, which sent a reply on  March . The Government's communication is very detailed and the Committee takes note of the explanations given therein. As regards specifically the question of Mr. Esguerra's defence counsel, the Government states that Mr. Esguerra has always been able to communicate with those persons appointed for his defence and legally accredited; only on two occasions was one of his counsel refused entry to the prison on account of the fact that-no doubt due to an oversight-he was unable to produce his credentials. There was never any difficulty with the visits of the official counsel for the defence. When Mr. Esguerra designated further counsel for his defence, only one of them (Mr. Snchez Ramirez) requested credentials, which were granted. The Government makes no reference in its communication to the allegations made by Mr. Snchez Ramirez in his letter of  November .
.With regard to Mr. Esguerra's comments on his trial, the Government declares them to be personal and biased. The Government adds that it does not consider it to be one of the ILO's duties to act as the highest instance to solve legal matters arising is the courts of member countries. It states: "" If a defendant is charged with an offence provided for and classified in the Penal Code, and is given all the necessary guarantees to present his defence, and if, furthermore, the proceedings instituted do not relate to genuine trade union activities, the ILO should in all cases refrain from intervention in the court's activities since, under the rule of law practised in Mexico, even the other powers of the Federal Union may not intervene in the functioning",0,1966,Mexico
134,".The last report to the Governing Body in respect of this case, which was examined by the Committee at its session in November , is contained in paragraphs  to  of its th Report. That report contains a further analysis of the situation of Mr. Rubn Carlos Esguerra as concerns the sentence imposed upon him by a court of first instance for the offence of attempted homicide. An appeal against this sentence had been lodged with the High Court of Justice of the Federal District and Territories, and for this reason the Committee adjourned its examination of the case. Mr. Esguerra bad made certain comments upon the court proceedings with respect to which the Government had not yet forwarded its observations.
.The Committee recalls that this case arose out of Mr. Esguerra's participation in an act of protest by workers and trade unionists in support of labour claims. The action he had taken had consisted, firstly, in inducing these workers to stage a hunger strike, in which they participated voluntarily. Later, Mr. Esguerra was said to have tried to prevent the participants in the strike from abandoning it or from being given food and assistance, thus endangering their lives. As a result, according to the judgment sentencing him for attempted homicide in respect of these persons, it had been necessary for the police to intervene in order that the strikers might be taken to hospital. Nevertheless, the Committee also observed that the Government had earlier supplied information (communication of  January ) that "" seven persons took part in a hunger strike at the doors of the United Nations offices, but lack of food was endangering their health and this induced them to give up the strike and seek medical treatment "". Of these seven persons, "" six were taken, at their own request, by staff of the Social Welfare Directorate to the general hospital in Mexico City. The remaining person preferred to go to a private clinic "".
.On  January  Mr. Esguerra sent a further communication in which he stated that the High Court had sentenced him upon appeal, and he made comments upon this sentence. This communication was transmitted to the Government which, in its turn, sent two communications, dated  February and  April , the latter containing the text of the judgment rendered by the High Court.
.Mr. Esguerra claims that the Federal Security Directorate forced him, by violent means, to sign a statement, that his accusers failed to appear before the trial judge and submitted no evidence against him, that the verdict was based mainly on the charges made by three persons who had asserted that the accused had compelled them to continue the hunger strike but who in fact had not even taken part in the strike, and that the court completely ignored the fact that the accusers, in their evidence, had given a false address so that they could not be found.
.In its first communication the Government gives the assurance that Mr. Esguerra enjoyed the guarantees provided by the Federal Political Constitution to every accused person and that he was tried by an impartial, independent and previously constituted court, which applied provisions of a general nature. The sentence pronounced by the High Court could be challenged by invoking the Constitutional guarantees. The Government goes on to state that it "" recognises the high office of the ILO as guardian of the workers' interests on a world-wide scale but it does not believe that its functions include the reviewing of judgments pronounced by the tribunals of its member countries since this would obviously impinge upon the sovereignty of those Members and would place the workers in a situation of unfair advantage over other nationals by being permitted to resort to a body not available to others "". In its second communication the Government gives a summary of the trial and of the evidence upon which the verdict was based, stating that, in its opinion, the Committee on Freedom of Association will have fully carried out its duty in ascertaining that Mr. Esguerra enjoyed all the legal guarantees and that the sentence is based on the legal provisions applicable to criminal offences.
.The Committee considers that while it is inconsistent with the principles of freedom of association for public authorities to deprive trade union officials of their freedom in order to put a stop to their trade union activities, this in no way implies that these authorities should refrain from using the powers legally vested in them for the purposes of maintaining public order in cases where trade union officials commit acts which are offences under national law. The Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Mexico, confers no immunity upon such officials, and even stipulates that workers and their organisations, like other persons, shall respect the law of the land. Nevertheless, the Committee also considers that in cases where a trade union official is imprisoned or sentenced it is incumbent upon the Committee to ascertain the reason or justification for such a measure. In this connection, the Committee wishes to recall the statement already made in an earlier report on this same case to the effect that it is its practice not to pursue its examination of a complaint where it is clear from the information received that the persons concerned have been tried by the competent judicial authorities with all the safeguards of normal judicial procedure, and sentenced for offences unconnected with their trade union activities or outside the scope of normal trade union activities.
.Bearing these considerations in mind, the Committee has examined the text of the judgment of the High Court, from which the following facts emerge. According to the statements made at the public prosecutor's office by the workers who took part in the hunger strike staged in front of the United Nations building in Mexico City and by welfare officers who examined these persons during the strike, Mr. Esguerra objected to the persons concerned being taken to hospital despite the fact that they were in a severely weakened state-overriding their own wishes in this respect. Finally, it was necessary for the police to intervene to overrule Esguerra and ensure that the strikers were taken to hospital, where they were given the medical attention they needed. In the writ of appeal, counsel for Mr. Esguerra alleges that these statements cannot be accepted as evidence because they were not made before the examining magistrate, even though they were countersigned by the public prosecutor's office, and that Mr. Esguerra's accusers did not appear before the judge for a confrontation with him. He further declares that even if these statements were to be declared admissible, they would not constitute evidence of the offence with which Mr. Esguerra has been charged, since his objection to any interruption of the strike was in any case purely verbal. He points out in this respect that it does not appear from the evidence "" that the accused prevented the injured parties from taking nourishment by any physical means, and they were free to abandon the strike at any moment, since there was nothing to stop them from leaving the part of the public thoroughfare where the hunger strike was being staged "".
.In the judgment the court overrules the objections of counsel for the defence with regard to the procedure followed, declaring that the statements made by the plaintiffs and by the officials of the Department of Health and Welfare at the public prosecutor's office are entirely admissible as evidence under the terms of section  of the Code of Criminal Procedure, and that the confrontations did take place in accordance with the terms of subsection  of section  of that Code. As regards this last point, the Committee observes that the provision in question is worded as follows: "" Where one of the persons between whom confrontation is to take place cannot be found, or resides within the jurisdiction of another court, the confrontation shall be suppletory, the statement of the person absent being read out to the person present, note being taken of any disparities between the said statement and the evidence given by the person present "".
.With regard to the trial and the judgments pronounced, the Committee wishes to point out the following. On the one hand, it appears clear from the documentary information available that the persons who took part in the hunger strike and the officials of the Department of Health and Welfare did not appear before the trial judge and were not confronted with the accused. The former had given a false address to the public prosecutor's office and then disappeared. On the other hand, the sentence is based on the fact that the accused prevented the participants in the strike from interrupting it, thus endangering their lives. Nevertheless, all this occurred in a public place and it is not clear to what extent his opposition could really have prevented them from abandoning the",0,1966,Mexico
135,".The Committee considered Case No.  at its sessions in May and November , February, May and November  and March , when it submitted to the Governing Body the reports contained, respectively, in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, paragraphs  to  of its st Report, paragraphs  to  of its rd Report, paragraphs  to  of its th Report, paragraphs  to  of its th Report and paragraphs  to  of its th Report, all of which were approved by the Governing Body.
.In paragraph  of its th Report the Committee submitted its final conclusions to the Governing Body in respect of the various allegations examined, in the following terms:
.In these circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the allegations relating to the detention of the trade union official, Eustaquio Tolosa, to express its satisfaction at the decision to reduce his sentence, a decision in which the Committee's conclusions were taken into account, and the fact that Mr. Tolosa has now been released;(b) with regard to the allegations relating to the taking over of various trade union organisations and the suspension of their trade union status, to draw the Government's attention to the fact that, despite the time which has elapsed and the repeated requests made to it, the Government has not yet brought to an end those measures to take over unions which were still in force, and to take note of the Government's statement that it intends to keep the Committee informed, within the briefest possible period, on the return to a normal situation by the unions taken over;(c) with regard to the allegations relating to interference by the authorities in the affairs of the CGT, measures directed against union leaders and members and compulsory arbitration and collective bargaining:(i) to regret the failure on a number of occasions to supply the information requested on which the Committee was relying in order to formulate its conclusions on the said allegations with a full knowledge of the facts;(ii) to draw the Government's attention once more to the importance of Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), which states that workers' and employers' organisations shall have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom, to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes, while the public authorities shall refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede its lawful exercise; and to the principle laid down in Article  of the Convention that workers' and employers' organisations shall not be liable to be dissolved or suspended by administrative authority;(iii) to draw the Government's attention to the fact that the right of free collective bargaining is a fundamental trade union right for all employees who are not covered by the safeguards provided by civil service regulations; and that if, as part of its stabilisation policy, the Government considers that wage rates cannot be settled freely through collective bargaining, this restriction should be imposed as an exceptional measure and only to the extent that is necessary, without exceeding a reasonable period, and that it should be accompanied by adequate safeguards to protect workers' living standards.
.These conclusions were transmitted to the Government, which supplied information in three communications dated  May,  September and  October .
.In the meantime, the International Federation of Chemical and General Workers' Unions had sent a communication dated  February  containing allegations of infringement of trade union rights in Argentina in connection with collective bargaining. The Government has not yet forwarded its observations on this complaint, which has been recorded as Case No. . Since the allegations relate to one of the aspects examined in Case No. , the Committee has decided to amalgamate the two cases and deal with them together.
.Argentina has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).Allegations relating to Measures to Take Over Various Trade Union Organisations and to Suspend Their Trade Union Status
.At its session in March  the Committee referred to the allegations relating to the taking over of various trade union organisations and the suspension of their trade union status which it had examined at earlier sessions. The Committee recalled on this occasion the Act of the Argentine Revolution concerning the taking over of trade unions and the various statements by the Government to the effect that it was hastening the process of a return to normal in the trade union movement, and drew attention to the time which had elapsed since the taking over of the unions still deprived of their status and to the importance of such a return to normal if these organisations were to exercise their rights under Convention No.  to elect their representatives in full freedom and to organise their administration and activities.
.The Committee had before it a communication dated  January  from the Government in which it indicated that the basis for the measures to take over trade unions was the need to promote the process of reorganisation of the unions concerned and their return to a normal situation in accordance with the aims pursued by the Government of the Argentine Revolution. The letter went on to say that all the organisations taken over had been engaging in activities outside their powers. As their voting lists were restored to normal, the Government intended to call elections and allow the unions to revert to their normal operation. The Government again stated, as it had done to the Committee on previous occasions, that these measures were not directed against the exercise of trade union rights. On the contrary, the Government hoped to count on the participation of the workers in the task of reconstructing the country. But if this participation was to be effective and fruitful, the unions must abide by the law and carry out specifically occupational activities, and their leaders must be genuinely representative. Accordingly, it was of cardinal importance that such organisations should bring their Constitutions into line with the legislation in force. The Government concluded by stating that it would keep the Committee informed, within the briefest possible period, on the return to a normal situation by the unions taken over.
.At its meeting in May  the Committee had already pointed out that in some cases the Government had lifted the suspension of the status of certain unions, such as the Textile Workers' Union and the Metal Workers' Union, but it had not done so in the case of other unions which had been deprived of their status at the same time and for the same reason.
.The Government has appended to its communications of  September and  October  copies of Resolutions Nos.  and  of  August , restoring the trade union status of the Telephone and Telecommunications Workers' Union of the Republic of Argentina (FOETRA) and annulling the suspension of the trade union status of the Buenos Aires branch of that Federation, and a copy of Resolution No.  restoring the trade union status of the Tucumn Sugar Industry Workers' Union (FOTIA).
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to take note of the measures taken in respect of the trade union organisations mentioned in the preceding paragraph, and to urge the Government once again to lift the suspension of the trade union status and end the takeover of the unions still affected, and to keep the Committee informed in this respect.Allegations relating to Collective Bargaining and Compulsory Arbitration
.At its session in November  the Committee examined a number of allegations made by the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions to the effect that Act No.  of  respecting compulsory arbitration eliminated the right to strike and the provisions of Act No.  that respected collective agreements and violated the relevant international standards. The General Confederation of Labour of the Argentine Republic had mentioned the same Act in its communication. The FOETRA, for its part, had stated that by virtue of Act No.  referring to private concerns, and Act No.  referring to the public sector, "" the joint agreements on collective bargaining have been abolished "".
.With regard to Act No.  respecting compulsory arbitration, the Government, which had supplied the text, had explained that the Act owed its existence to the need to seek appropriate formulae to settle labour disputes that might affect vital national interests and delay the process of recovery to which the Argentine Revolution was committed. As for Act No. , the Government had denied that it constituted a violation of freedom of association and stated that its purpose was to harmonise and co-ordinate the economic recovery of the country and at the same time to ensure the workers a genuine wage by means of graded increases fitting in with the",0,1966,Argentina

137,".The Committee examined this case at its meetings in February and November  and most recently at its meeting in November . In this connection it submitted to the Governing Body the interim reports contained in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, paragraphs  to  of its st Report, and paragraphs  to  of its th Report. The Governing Body approved these reports at its sessions in February-March , November  and November  respectively.
.Venezuela has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but since the last time the Committee examined the case it has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The first of the complainants supplied the names of thirty persons who, they claimed, had been arrested as a result of the Government's policy of repression against part of the trade union movement. The complainants stated that those arrested were national or regional leaders of the Sole Confederation of Venezuelan Workers (CUTV).
.In its first reply the Government stated that none of the persons named by the complainants had been detained for carrying on lawful activities, whether connected with trade unionism or not; most of them had never been trade union leaders and had been sentenced for offences under civil and military law in proceedings before judges on whom the Government had exerted no influence.
.In accordance with the practice which it has constantly applied in cases where allegations that trade union leaders or workers have been arrested or detained on account of their trade union activities have been met by governments with statements that the arrests had been made on the grounds of subversive activities, for reasons of internal security or owing to offences under ordinary law, the Committee recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to indicate the exact reasons for these arrests, to state whether each of the persons concerned had been brought to trial on the charges made against them, and to communicate the results of the legal proceedings in each case.
.On the basis of the information supplied by the Government in reply to this and subsequent requests the Committee presented its final conclusions with regard to all the persons mentioned in the complaint, except the following: Messrs. Pardo Lugo, Reyes Bidau, Gutirrez, Landaz, Puche Ferrer, Colorado, Acosta, Farias, Scott Power, Casique and Luis Marcano.
.According to information provided by the Government some of these persons had been arrested on several occasions between  and December  on the grounds of subversive activities or in connection with inquiries relating to such activities. For example, the Government stated that Mr. Scott Power had been arrested in April  in connection with inquiries into incitement to disorder and extremist agitation, and that Mr. Pardo had been arrested in February , in  and in December  on grounds connected with the disturbance of public order or for the investigation of subversive activities.
.In its st Report the Committee recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to confirm whether all of these persons had been released. In the absence of any reply by the Government the recommendation was repeated in the th Report.
.On  February  the Government sent a communication stating that, in accordance with verbal information provided by Mr. Cruz Villegas, President of the Sole Confederation of Venezuelan Workers, his organisation's complaint had been withdrawn verbally by its representatives at a meeting at the ILO's headquarters in Geneva, which explained why there was no document containing formal withdrawal of the complaint.
.Following this communication the Sole Confederation of Venezuelan Workers and the World Federation of Trade Unions were requested on repeated occasions to send whatever information they might consider pertinent concerning any decision taken by them with regard to the complaint and to state the grounds therefor. The Committee observes that no reply has been received to date from the complainant organisations.
.In these circumstances, in view of the time which has elapsed since the occurrence of the events concerning the persons mentioned in paragraph  above and in the absence of any information from the complainant organisations in reply to the repeated requests addressed to them, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that the case as a whole does not call for any further examination.
.The Committee previously considered this case at its sessions in February and November , when it submitted to the Governing Body the interim reports contained in paragraphs  to  of its th Report and paragraphs  to  of its st Report, which were adopted by the Governing Body at its th Session (February-March ) and th Session (November ) respectively.
.In a communication dated  July , the Government of Venezuela supplied the additional information requested from it in connection with certain aspects of the case which are still outstanding.
.Venezuela has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In these circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note that, according to the texts of the judgments supplied by the Government, Messrs. Torres, Ojeda and Blanco were sentenced for activities considered as offences of rebellion, which do not seem to have had any connection with trade union activities, and to decide, for the reasons set forth in paragraph  above, that this aspect of the case calls for no further examination.(b) to note that the sentence passed by the ordinary courts on Mr. Granda was quashed by the court to which the matter was subsequently referred and to decide, for the reasons set forth in paragraph  above, that this aspect of the case calls for no further examination;(c) to take note of the Government's statement that the cases against Messrs. Arrieti, Galndez, Villaparedes, Lucker Ruiz and Mrquez Findol, before courts martial for acts considered as offences of rebellion have been discontinued, and to decide, for the reasons set forth in paragraph , that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination;(d) to decide, for the reasons set forth in paragraphs  and , that there would be no point in continuing its examination of the allegations relating to Messrs. Arrieta and Carmona Natera;(e) to request the Government to be good enough to confirm whether the persons mentioned in paragraph  above, who, according to a previous statement by the Government, had been detained at different times, are at present at liberty;(f) to take note of this interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report once it has received the information requested from the Government in subparagraph (e) above.
.The Committee examined this case previously at its session in February , when it submitted to the Governing Body an interim report contained in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, which was approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (February-March ).
.By a communication dated  May  the Government replied to the request made in paragraphs ,  and  of the th Report for additional information on certain aspects of the case.
.Venezuela has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee therefore observes that, of the persons about whom the Government has provided information, some have been released; others have been detained, temporarily it appears, though it is not clear whether they are all at present free, and others have been sentenced (one of them by an ordinary criminal court) for offences the precise nature of which is indicated by the Government, or are detained at the disposal of the military courts on grounds that the Government also indicates precisely.
.With respect to the persons whose names appear in paragraph  above, who were released and one of whom, Mr. Juan Pablo Crespo, according to the complainants, later died, the Committee considers that there would be no point in continuing its examination of the allegations relating to their detention.
.On the other hand, with respect to the persons whose names appear in paragraph  above, the Committee would be grateful if the Government would be good enough to confirm whether they are all at liberty.
.Moreover, in paragraph  of its th Report, relating to the present case, the Committee recalled that in matters that were the subject of judicial proceedings, where the Committee had considered that such proceedings might make available information of assistance to it in appreciating whether or not allegations were well founded, it had always followed the practice of requesting the governments concerned to supply the texts of the judgments given and the grounds adduced therein. Accordingly, in view of the contradiction existing between the statements of the complainants and those of the Government concerning the grounds for the detentions, the Committee considers that it would be desirable, with",1,1966,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
138,"undertakes to fill them ... with members of the union ""; clause  stipulates that temporary vacancies are to be filled in accordance with the regular promotion procedure, and the lowest posts with staff allocated by the union, etc. Under the provisions of the law and the contract, whenever Petrleos Mexicanos need workers they ask the Petroleum Workers' Union of the Republic of Mexico for them. The Government states that all temporary workers (whose number in fact exceeds the figure given by the complainants) have been engaged on the proposal of that trade union, in conformity with the collective contract, and that they all enjoy legal and contractual social welfare benefits.
.The Government goes on to state that the complainants do not number  persons, and, on the assumption that they work for the undertaking as temporary workers, their engagement could only have occurred on the proposal of the Union of Petroleum Workers of the Republic of Mexico.
.It is not correct, says the Government, that the exclusion clauses applying to engagement and dismissal (clauses  and  of the collective agreement), agreed in conformity with sections  and  of the Federal Labour Law, prevent freedom of association, since they pose no obstacle to the formation of other organisations, membership of such organisations, or the drafting of their statutes, etc. Such clauses, far from limiting freedom of association, establish solid bases, in the Government's view, for defending the collective interest and strengthening the trade unions. It is not correct, the Government continues, that temporary workers are dismissed or that they are denied the right of returning to work in the industry. At the same time, the unions which they may form must be without prejudice to third parties, and the undertaking cannot accept staff other than that proposed to it by the union which signed the collective agreement, of which the exclusion clause, being legal, must be respected, in accordance with the principle laid down in Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ). The provisions of the Federal Labour Law, relating to the individual rights of workers (for example the priority indicated in section , subsection , of the Federal Labour Law), are only applicable when such workers do not belong to a union and are not protected by a collective agreement; when that is the case, the provisions having preferential application are those of the collective agreement and those of the law to which reference has been made, in accordance with the rulings of the Supreme Court of Justice. The part of the complaint in which the union which signed the collective agreement is alleged to sell vacancies to the highest bidder raises a point of which the Mexican Government says it has no cognisance.
.As regards the application of section , subsection III, of the law, the Government indicates that, for the same reasons of legal validity of the exclusion clause and the rulings of the Supreme Court, that part of the allegations which refers to this matter is refuted. Moreover, Petrleos Mexicanos always state in their labour contracts either their duration, or the fact that they are for an indefinite period.
.The Government goes on to say that if Petrleos Mexicanos did deduct trade union subscriptions from some members of the complainant union (which is not recognised by the undertaking), it was because those workers were engaged on the proposal of the union which signed the collective agreement and which had requested the undertaking to make such deductions in accordance with clause  of the agreement. On the other hand, it is not certain that the Petroleum Workers' Union of the Republic of Mexico acted as an intermediary in the engagement of temporary workers. In conformity with the exclusion clauses the union proposes both permanent workers and temporary workers, and the undertaking is not authorised to investigate whether the persons proposed are members of the union or not.
.In its conclusions the Government affirms that the complainants have not suffered any suppression of freedom of association and that no concrete example has been given of any infringement of any provision of Convention No. . In point of fact the matters forming the subject of the complaint (validity of the collective agreement and application of the exclusion clauses) are connected rather with the questions dealt with in the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), which has not been ratified by Mexico.
.Finally, in its communication of  January , the Government transmits the complete text of the ruling handed down by Special Group No.  of the Federal Conciliation and Arbitration Board on  November , a ruling involving, inter alia, the striking-off the Register of the Union of Temporary Workers of Petrleos Mexicanos, Local  (of Minatitln, Veracruz), which was registered on  January . The writ petitioning that the said union be struck off the Register was taken out by the Petroleum Workers' Union of the Republic of Mexico on the grounds that, among other considerations, the petroleum industry is entrusted exclusively to a decentralised state undertaking (Petrleos Mexicanos), whose collective agreement with the petitioning union contains an exclusion clause which prevents any legal possibility of the existence of another union in the said industry. In the preamble to the findings of the Conciliation and Arbitration Board it is stated that of the  persons on the membership roll of the defendant union only  were identified, and of them, only three were found to be working in the undertaking in March , so that the requirement of the law whereby a union in an undertaking must have at least  members working in the said undertaking was not fulfilled. The Conciliation and Arbitration Board appears also to have accepted the argument in the petition to the effect that the existence of the exclusion clause prevents the formation of a new union in connection with the undertaking. Further, the Conciliation and Arbitration Board decided that it should reject the plea put forward by the Union of Temporary Workers of Petrleos Mexicanos, Local  (of Minatitln), to the effect that it should be recognised as having the right to make collective contracts with the undertaking and be paid a sum representing the union contributions previously deducted.
.Recapitulating the main points, the Committee notes that the Mexican petroleum industry is a state monopoly under a decentralised undertaking (Petrleos Mexicanos), which has signed a collective agreement with the Petroleum Workers' Union of the Republic of Mexico, an agreement which establishes in favour of that union certain trade union protection or exclusion clauses in relation to the engagement of workers and the deduction of contributions. The complainants state that they represent workers engaged on a non-permanent basis to work in the undertaking, who, according to them, are not members of the union which signed the collective agreement (nor can be, as the latter has practically closed its register to all temporary members) and that consequently they should have the right to form their own union, entitled to make collective agreements with the undertaking, and to have the exclusive right of collecting trade union subscriptions from their members. The complainant organisation has not submitted statistics of the number of its members who work in the undertaking, and only mentions the total number of temporary workers. The Government refers to the legislation in force, under which the undertaking must make the collective agreement with the union which has the largest number of workers in the business, the collective contract being valid for all persons working in the undertaking, even if they are not members of the union which signed it, and the exclusion clause being expressly permitted as regards the engagement of workers. At the same time the union of temporary workers, of which the registration as a company-based union was cancelled by the Federal Conciliation and Arbitration Board, appears to be distinct from the organisation which submitted the complaint for examination by the Committee. The complainant organisation in this case in fact appears to indicate that it did not obtain its registration, but it fails to submit further details on this particular point (for example whether it presented an application and if so with what result).
.The Committee is thus really confronted with a conflict between unions over the right to represent the temporary workers or some of them. According to the Government engagement of these workers is carried out in conformity with the exclusion clause for which provision is made in the collective agreement; and the deduction of union subscriptions, if it is made in respect of some workers who belong to the complainant organisation, is based on another protection clause in the same agreement. Of the remaining allegations made by the complainants, one (on the application of section , subsection I, of the Federal Labour Law) is connected with the precedence of the exclusion clauses over the general provisions of the law and should therefore be considered in conjunction with the",-1,1966,Mexico
139,"main question.
.Another of the allegations refers to the failure of the Courts to recognise the permanent character of certain individual labour contracts-a matter which in itself does not appear to raise any question relating to the exercise of trade union rights proper. Finally, the allegation with regard to the trafficking said to take place in connection with vacant posts appears to concern the orthodoxy of the procedures followed in the management of its affairs by the trade union which signed the collective agreement, a matter which would appear to be the concern of the members of that union-who, in any case, have the right to require respect, on the one hand, for the union statutes should they be infringed, and, on the other, for the principle laid down in paragraph  of Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), whereby workers and their organisations are obliged to respect legality.
.In the past the Committee has had to examine cases where the deduction of union contributions and other forms of union protection were instituted, not in virtue of the legislation in force but as a result of collective contracts or established practice existing between both parties. In such cases the Committee declines to examine the allegations made, basing its reasoning on the statement which appears in the report of the Committee on Industrial Relations, appointed by the International Labour Conference in , according to which the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), can in no way be interpreted as authorising or prohibiting union security arrangements, such questions being matters for regulation in accordance with national practice. In adopting the Committee's report the Conference adhered to this point of view.
.In the present case, from the facts submitted by the Government, it appears that the monopoly granted to the Petroleum Workers' Union of the Republic of Mexico as regards the proposing of new workers, and the clause which provides for deduction of trade union contributions from workers in the undertaking on behalf of the said union, were not the result of legislation but were embodied in a collective agreement.
.In these circumstances, for the reasons indicated in paragraphs  to  above, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that these allegations do not call for further examination.Allegations relating to the Attitude of a Public Official
.In their communication of  July  the complainants accuse the Under-Secretary of Labour and Social Welfare of failing to ensure the implementation of the Federal Labour Law, and mention in this connection the case of two workers who submitted a request to the Federal Conciliation and Arbitration Board. No final rulings on their cases have been made although eight years have passed. They also mention the case of another worker, whose file was, "" for no reason, and incorrectly, transferred to the city of Jalapa "".
.In its reply the Government states that the accusation made with regard to the said Under-Secretary is false and, moreover, has no connection with questions dealt with in the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ). It adds that the Federal Conciliation and Arbitration Board is an autonomous jurisdictional body, which cannot be influenced in its rulings by outside officials.
.The Committee considers that the complainants have not submitted, in respect of the allegations in question, the truth of which is denied by the Government, any proof that they in themselves raise any matter connected with the exercise of trade union rights.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that these allegations do not call for further examination.Other Allegations
.In its communication of  December  the Union of Temporary Petroleum Workers states that on  December  agents of the federal police tried to arrest Gabriel Rivera Rio, President of the union's Committee of Honour and Justice, on the basis of a charge made by the Petrleos Mexicanos to the effect that the said trade union member belonged to an "" international Trotskyist quartet "". Further, in their communication of  December , the same complainants state that the Petrleos Mexicanos had offered members of the complainant union the lowest positions on the staff with the object of "" solving the problem submitted to the I.L.O."". They add that this proposal, which is said to form part of the tactics employed by the undertaking to the detriment of the said members, was inacceptable in view of the fact that those workers had more than ten years' seniority in the industry and had specialised in their jobs, and if they accepted the lowest places they would have to start again as general labourers.
.The two communications mentioned in the preceding paragraph were communicated to the Government by letters dated  and  December  respectively.
.Up to the present no observations have been received from the Government regarding the allegations mentioned in paragraph  above.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to request the Government to be good enough to furnish its observations on the allegations in question.
.With regard to the case as a whole the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to decide, for the reasons mentioned in paragraphs  to  and  above, that the allegations relating to the application of closed shop or union security clauses and to the attitude of a public official do not call for further examination;(b) to request the Government to be good enough to furnish its observations on the other allegations referred to in paragraph  above;(c) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report when it has received the observations to be requested from the Government in accordance with subparagraph (b) above.Geneva,  February . (Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.",-1,1966,Mexico
140,"system is applied more and more infrequently, due to the undisguised opposition of employers and Government, who are supported by those trade union organisations which have gone over to the side of the Government.
.The Government replies to these allegations, which are couched in extremely general terms and unsubstantiated by specific examples, by explaining that the small number of strikes recorded is due to the efficiency of the conciliation procedure. The Government points out that one of the most important strikes to occur in the country was organised by C.U.T.V itself in , at which time the Ministry of Labour was only too anxious to lend its good offices for conciliation purposes, and the Government took no action which would interfere with the rights of the workers. As for collective bargaining, the Government states that during the past eight years , collective agreements have been signed, including  in  and  in , all of which is claimed to prove the falsity of the allegations that there has been a reduction in the number of collective agreements signed in the country.
.Considering that the complainants have not supplied specific information in substantiation of their claims with respect to alleged restriction of the right to strike and to bargain collectively, which are couched in extremely general terms and which are denied by the Government, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.Allegations relating to the Infringement of Trade Union Privilege
.The complainants claim that there has been infringement of the privileges conferred on members of the committees of federations, trade unions and works committees by the labour legislation and by collective agreements to protect them from arbitrary and unjust dismissal. They add that in countless cases not only have employers dismissed trade union leaders who should be protected by these privileges but the labour authorities themselves have condoned this practice in their subsequent rulings, which are nearly always in favour of the employers.
.In its observations the Government does not refer specifically to this aspect of the case. Consequently, before proceeding with its examination thereof, the Committee considers that the Government should be requested to be good enough to forward its observations with respect to this point.Allegations relating to the Detention of Trade Union Leaders
.The complainants allege that the unlawful detention of trade union leaders, militant workers and peasants is a common daily occurrence, which clearly shows the nature of the Government's policy of repression against the country's democratic and independent trade union movement. The aims of this policy are to sow terror among the workers, undermine their capacity for resistance and weaken the organisations they have formed for their economic defence. At present there are more than , political prisoners in various prisons throughout the country, the great majority being manual workers, salaried employees, students and peasants. Among the numerous national and regional leaders of C.U.T.V alleged by the complainants to be held in prison mention is made of Eloy Torres, Luis Felipe Ojeda, Julio Cabello, Eleazar Diaz Rangel, Efrain Blanco, Samuel Guidn, Aura Gamboa, Gustavo Villaparedes, Leoncio Granda, Humberto Arrieti and Justo Rafael Galindez. Eloy Torres is said by the complainants to be a former official of the Venezuelan Confederation of Workers and one of the founders of C.U.T.V, as well as being a member of the General Council of the World Federation of Trade Unions. He is alleged to have been summarily tried before a military court and sentenced to more than eight years' penal servitude in May . He is now serving a sentence of rigorous imprisonment on the island of Tacarigua.
.Repressive measures are said to have also been taken against other national and regional leaders of C.U.T.V, such as Horacio Scott Power, President of C.U.T.V, detained without trial for two months in ; Carlos Arturo Pardo, a member of the executive of C.U.T.V, arrested upon his return from the VIth Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions in Warsaw and taken to the concentration camp of Cachipo, where he was subjected to physical ill-treatment; and Jos Marcano, a member of the national secretariat of C.U.T.V and President of the National Federation of Salaried Employees of Venezuela, detained without trial on ten separate occasions. Others detained include Messrs. Mximo Gutirrez, Johnny Bid, Carlos Farias, Marco Aurelio Alegria, Manuel Luckert, Jess Mrquez, Fidias Marcano, Hctor Landez, Julio Casique, Eli Sal Puchi, Nicols Colorado, Vladimir Acosta and Luis Marcano.
.Another national C.U.T.V leader, Mr. Juan Pablo Crespo, is alleged to have been arrested by the police as he was about to leave for abroad to undergo medical treatment. Some time later he was released, and he subsequently died in Moscow. The complaint also mentions the case of Mr. Luis Emiro Arrieta, another C.U.T.V leader who died in prison in Caracas after two years' detention. In addition, a press cutting is appended to the complaint referring to the disappearance since  September  of Donato Carmona Natera, "" trade union leader in the building sector and militant revolutionary "": the General Directorate of Police announced first of all that he was in solitary confinement, later that he had been released and finally that "" the files would be carefully gone over "".
.Mention is also made in the complaint of numerous other persons alleged to have been detained, but on the complainants' own admission these are political leaders, students or ordinary citizens whose connection with the trade union movement is not established in the complaint.
.According to the Government, this part of the complaint deals with questions unconnected with labour. The Government adds that none of the persons named by the complainants has been detained for carrying on lawful activities, whether connected with trade unionism or not. Most of the persons referred to have never been trade union officials. They have, however, been charged, tried and sentenced for proved offences under civil and military law in proceedings before judges on whom the Government has exerted no influence. The Government carries out to the letter the duties imposed on it by the Constitution and by the law of the land. It has dealt vigorously, but without overstepping the bounds of the law, with persons outside the trade unions who, acting not as trade unionists but as active agents of subversion, have endeavoured to undermine the Constitution and the law.
.The Committee recalls that on many occasions in the past, where allegations that trade union leaders or workers had been arrested or detained for trade union activities have been met by governments with statements that the arrests or detentions were made for subversive activities, for reasons of internal security or for common-law crimes, it has followed the rule that the governments concerned should be requested to submit further and as precise information as possible concerning the arrests or detentions and the exact reasons therefor. The Committee also recalls that if, in certain cases, it has concluded that allegations relating to the arrest or detention of trade union militants did not call for further examination, this has been after it has received information showing sufficiently precisely and with sufficient detail that the arrests or detentions were in no way occasioned by trade union activities but solely by activities outside the trade union sphere, which were either prejudicial to public order or of a political nature. Finally, the Committee recalls that in matters which were the subject of judicial proceedings, where the Committee considered that such proceedings might make available information of assistance to the Committee in appreciating whether or not allegations were well founded, it has always followed the practice of requesting the governments concerned to supply the texts of the judgments given and the grounds adduced therein.
.In consequence, before proceeding further with its examination of this aspect of the case, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to request the Government to be good enough to furnish as quickly as possible detailed observations with respect to the alleged detention of the persons whose names are given in paragraphs ,  and  above, together with the exact reasons therefor; to state whether each of these persons has been brought to trial on the charges which have been laid against him, and to communicate the results of any legal proceedings which have been initiated in this connection.
.In these circumstances, with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the allegations relating to the right to strike and to bargain collectively, to decide, for the reasons set forth in paragraph  above, that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination;(b) with regard to the allegations relating to acts of repression and discrimination against certain trade union organisations and the allegations relating to the infringement of trade union privilege, to note that the Committee considers it necessary to request the Government to be good enough to furnish its observations on each of the matters referred to in paragraphs  and  above;(c) with regard to the allegations relating",0,1966,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
141,".The complaint by the Workers' Trade Union of the Colombian National University was made in a communication sent directly to the I.L.O and dated  September . The text was transmitted to the Colombian Government, which sent its observations in a letter dated  October .
.Colombia has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants base their complaint on the following assertions: created in , the Workers' Trade Union of the Colombian National University has since that date steadily fought to secure acceptance of its claims and to obtain the right of collective bargaining. A first collective agreement was signed after claims had been filed in , and a second in . In December  the union submitted further claims, but the then Rector declined to accept them on the grounds that the workers represented by the union were public employees and as such were not entitled to make claims or sign collective agreements. The resulting dispute was settled in August  to the union's satisfaction, and a third collective agreement was concluded. The latest collective agreement was signed in , after negotiations between the parties about claims submitted by the union in November .
.The complainants allege that, since this last agreement was due to expire on  December , they submitted further claims on  December , but that the Rector of the university informed the union that he did not intend to engage in negotiations on these claims, on the grounds that university employees were not entitled to bargain collectively. The complainants further state that this position was corroborated by the Minister of Labour in an opinion dated  December .
.The complainants conclude by declaring that the Government's attitude overrides a long-standing, hard-won right enjoyed by the union, and is a breach of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its observations the Government quotes sections  and  of the Labour Code, which show that all servants of the State enjoy the right to organise. However, the Government states that such persons are divided into two separate classes: "" public employees "" and "" public workers "", and that the rules governing the exercise of the right of association are not the same for the two classes in question.
.While, according to the Government, the public "" workers' "" union enjoys this right, the public "" employees' "" union can neither submit claims nor enter into collective agreements (section  of the Labour Code).
.The Government explains that up to  December , under the legislation whereby servants of the State were classified into two categories, it was entirely true to say that two categories existed in the Colombian National University, i.e. public "" employees "", not entitled to make claims or to enter into collective agreements, and public "" workers "", who enjoyed these rights. Hence, the Government continues, under section  of the Labour Code, whereby "" unions of public employees shall not be entitled to make claims or conclude collective agreements "", while "" unions of public workers shall enjoy the same rights as other workers' unions and their claims shall be transmitted under the same conditions as for other unions "", it was perfectly lawful, up to  December , to allow the workers of the Colombian National University, organised in a union, to submit claims and to enter into collective agreements.
.However, the Government continues, Act No. , which came into effect on  December , establishes the status of the Colombian National University and provides, inter alia, that the relationship between the staff and the university shall be subject to public law, so that the staff in question belongs to the class of "" public employees "", and hence is entitled neither to make claims nor to enter into collective agreements.
.In conclusion the Government states that the permission given to the Workers' Trade Union of the Colombian National University, after adoption of Act No.  on  December , to submit claims and conclude collective agreements was a manifest breach of the law. "" Clearly "", the Government continues, "" such a breach of the law creates no right, much less that of continuing to break it.""
.In the light of the Government's explanations it appears that the refusal to enter into collective bargaining with the complaining organisation was in accordance with the national legislation in force. The Committee wishes to state that, nonetheless, the right to present their claims is generally recognised to exist even in the case of employees belonging to the category of workers referred to here. Furthermore, the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), to which Colombia is incidentally not a party, stipulates in Article  that it "" does not deal with the position of public servants engaged in the administration of the State, nor shall it be construed as prejudicing their right or status in any way "", but it should be remembered that public servants, who do not come within the scope of this Convention, should normally be covered by national legislation specifying their proper rights and duties.
.Finally, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to draw the Government's attention to the considerations mentioned above.",-1,1967,Colombia
142,"that strikers do not go beyond their legal aims and to prevent disorders and the commission of offences. Following this intervention, the Government states, both the disturbances and the illegal stoppage of work by the teachers came to an end and the situation in this respect is now quite normal.
.The Government indicates that the detention of the arrested persons lasted for eight days.
.The Committee has always held that allegations relating to the right to strike are not outside its competence in so far as they affect the exercise of trade union rights and has pointed out on several occasions that the right of workers and their organisations to strike as a legitimate means of defending their occupational interests is generally recognised. In this connection the Committee has stressed the importance that it attaches, where strikes are prohibited or are subject to restrictions in essential services or in the civil service, to the establishment of adequate safeguards to protect the interests of the workers who are thus deprived of an essential means of defending their occupational interests, and has pointed out that such restrictions should be accompanied by adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures, in which the parties concerned may participate at every stage, and that the awards given should in all cases be binding on both parties. The Committee explained in this connection that these principles do not apply to the absolute restriction of the right to strike but to the restriction of that right in essential services or in the civil service, in which case adequate guarantees should be provided to safeguard the interests of the workers.
.While noting the information contained in the Government's observations relating to the disorderly conduct of the strike, the Committee observes that the strike was illegal from the start and therefore liable to police intervention even before the disturbances took place. Considering, therefore, that the considerations set forth in the preceding paragraph are relevant to the case, the Committee wishes to draw the Government's attention to them and it recommends the Governing Body likewise to draw the Government's attention to the importance which the Governing Body attaches to these considerations.
.With regard to the arrest of Messrs. Agudelo, Carbajal and Cano, the Committee notes that the persons in question were arrested on the ground of causing disturbances and that they are no longer detained. For these reasons it does not consider that this aspect of the case calls for further examination.
.Accordingly, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that the allegations relating to the arrests referred to in the preceding paragraph do not call for further examination.
.As the Government has not furnished its observations on the allegations relating to the entering and closing down of the trade union headquarters of the teachers, to the fact that the headquarters of the A.S.A. were broken into or to the arrest of Messrs. Herrera or Rivera, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to request the Government to be good enough to present its observations thereon.
.In these circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to decide, for the reasons stated in paragraph  above, that the allegations relating to the arrest and detention of Messrs. Agudelo, Carbajal and Cano do not call for further examination;(b) to draw the Government's attention to the importance which the Governing Body attaches to the considerations set forth in paragraph  above regarding, in particular, the general recognition of the right of workers and their organisations to strike and, where strikes are prohibited in essential services or in the civil service, the establishment of adequate safeguards to protect the interests of the workers affected;(c) to request the Government to be good enough to furnish its observations on the allegations referred to in paragraph  above;(d) to take note of this interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report once it has received the observations requested from the Government in subparagraph (e) above.Geneva,  November . (Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.",0,1967,Colombia
143,".The Committee examined this case at its meeting held in November . On that occasion the Committee submitted an interim report containing a number of conclusions and a request for additional information from the Government; that report was approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ).
.This request was transmitted to the Government by a letter dated  November  to which the Government replied by a communication of  January .
.Colombia has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.Essentially, the complainants alleged that certain acts committed by the police on the instructions of the Government of the Province of Antioquia constituted a violation of the trade union rights of the members of the Antioquia Teachers' Association and of the other trade union organisations who were conducting a general strike in Antioquia. In particular, the complainants referred to the suppression of a trade union meeting; to the entering and closing down of the headquarters of the Teachers' Association; to the fact that the headquarters of the Accin Sindical Antioquea (A.S.A.) had been broken into and surrounded by assault troops of the military police; and to the detention of Messrs. Agudelo, Carbajal, Herrera, Cano and Rivera, all leading trade union members.
.At its meeting in November  the Committee noted the Government's observation that the strike of the teachers, who were by definition public employees in Colombian law and as such possessed no right to strike, was illegal from the start and therefore liable to police intervention a With regard to the arrest of Messrs. Agudelo, Carbajal and Cano, the Committee noted that these persons were arrested on the ground of causing disturbances and that they had been released after eight days' detention.
.As the Committee pointed out in paragraph  of its st Report, it has always held that allegations relating to the right to strike are not outside its competence in so far as they affect the exercise of trade union rights. In this connection the Committee recalled that, when considering the observations of the Government in previous cases possessing similar or comparable features, it had stressed the importance it attaches, where strikes are prohibited or are subject to restrictions in essential services or in the civil service, to the establishment of adequate safeguards to protect the interests of the workers who are thus deprived of an essential means of defending their occupational interests. Accordingly, the Committee recommended the Governing Body to draw the Government's attention to the importance attached by the Governing Body and the Committee to these considerations.
.Noting, however, that the Government had not furnished its observations on the remaining allegations referred to in paragraph  above, the Committee recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to be good enough to present its observations thereon.
.In its reply of  January  the Government explains that Messrs. Herrera and Rivera were arrested for the same reasons as were Messrs. Agudelo, Carbajal and Cano and that they were all subsequently released at the same time.
.The Government further states that the headquarters of the teachers' trade union were not closed down but were put under close supervision by the police, who for the same reason entered the premises of the headquarters of the Accin Sindical Antioquea. These measures were carried out, the Government states, for the purpose of preserving public order and in accordance with the proper procedure laid down for police action in such cases.
.On the basis of the Government's statement referred to in paragraph  above, it appears that all the trade union leaders who had been detained in connection with the strike were released. The Committee therefore recommends the Governing Body to take note of the Government's statement and to decide that in these circumstances no further purpose would be served in pursuing the examination of the allegations concerning the detention of the trade union leaders.
.With regard to the entering of the premises of the Accin Sindical Antioquea headquarters by the police, the Committee wishes to recall that in several previous cases, while recognising that trade unions, like other associations or persons, cannot claim immunity from search of their premises, the Committee has nonetheless emphasised the importance that it attaches to the principle that search should only be made following the issue of a warrant by the ordinary judicial authority after that authority has been satisfied that reasonable grounds exist for supposing that evidence exists on the said premises material to a prosecution for an offence against the law and provided that the search is restricted to the purposes for which the warrant was issued.
.In the present case the Committee considers that it does not necessarily follow, from the information before the Committee, that the police action was carried out on the basis of the authority of a search warrant. In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to take note of the Government's reply referred to in paragraph  above and to draw the Government's attention to the principle mentioned in paragraph .
.In these circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to take note of the Government's statement according to which all the trade union leaders who had been detained in connection with the teachers' strike were released;(b) to decide, therefore, that it would serve no useful purpose to examine further the allegations concerning the detention of the trade union leaders referred to in subparagraph (a) above;(c) to take note of the Government's statement that the police action concerning the entering of the headquarters of the Accin Sindical Antioquea was carried out according to the police regulations in force and to draw the attention of the Government to the principle mentioned in paragraph  above.
.These complaints were contained in a telegram and letter dated  June and  June  respectively from the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions and a letter dated  June  from the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions, all of which were sent directly to the I.L.O. The Government furnished its observations by a communication dated  August .
.Colombia has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants allege that certain acts committed by the police on the instructions of the Government of the Province of Antioquia, principally with respect to the Antioquia Teachers' Association and its members, constitute a violation of trade union rights. It is stated that five trade union organisations, of which one is the Antioquia Teachers' Association, are conducting a general strike in Antioquia in support of certain claims by their members. The complainants allege that the Teachers' Association, which is claiming the payment of increases in wages, has been the victim of severe acts of repression by the Provincial Government. In particular, the complainants refer to the suppression of a trade union meeting; to the entering and closing down of the trade union headquarters of the teachers; to the fact that the headquarters of the Accin Sindical Antioquea (A.S.A.) were broken into, and that they were surrounded by assault troops of the military police; and to the detention of Messrs. Agudelo, Carbajal, Herrera, Cano and Rivera, all trade union leaders. Mr. Agudelo is said to be a well-known national trade union figure, a member of the Executive Committee of the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions, and it is claimed that he is threatened with a sentence of  days' imprisonment, which, under the legislation on the state of emergency, would deprive him of his job and his position as trade union leader and could even lead to his expulsion from the country.
.In its communication of  August  the Government states, firstly, that teachers in Colombia are in substance and by definition public employees and, as such, the law does not give them the right to present petitions, to conclude collective agreements, to strike or to call strikes. Accordingly, the Government states, the teachers in question were not within their rights in striking.
.The Government goes on to say that, in addition to the above consideration, the strikers in question did not conform to section  of the Labour Code, which lays down that strikes shall be orderly and peaceful. The Government states that the teachers, instigated by certain of their leaders, attempted to cause disturbances and street riots, thereby committing offences against the law. The Government indicates that, when the disturbances and offences began to interfere with the rights of other citizens, the police intervened and arrested Messrs. Agudelo, Carbajal and Cano, leaders of the strike, in accordance with section  of Decree  of , which gives the police the duty of ensuring that strikes are conducted peacefully and lawfully and empowers them in the discharge of this duty to take the necessary action to ensure",-1,1967,Colombia
144,"national regulations concerning the Constitution and functioning of workers' organisations were compatible with the provisions of Convention No. , provided that the provisions in such regulations did not infringe the guarantees laid down in the Convention. The Committee also upheld the view that a requirement that union rules should comply with national legislation did not constitute a violation of the generally accepted principle that workers' organisations should have the right to draw up their Constitutions and rules in full freedom, provided that such statutory requirements did not infringe the principle of freedom of association.
.The Committee observes once again that a very considerable period of time has elapsed since the CSTC made its third request for recognition of its legal personality at the end of . The Committee points out again, as it did in another case concerning Colombia, that, while it is true that the founders of a trade union must comply with the formalities prescribed by legislation, these formalities should not be of such a nature as to hamper freedom to form organisations.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the attention of the Government to the principles and considerations set forth in paragraphs  to  above, and in particular to the fact that the statutory formalities to be complied with by the founders of a trade union should not be such as to hamper freedom to form organisations;(b) to request the Government to be good enough to provide information on the exact wording to the CSTC by-laws objected to by the General Secretariat of Labour and the specific nature of these objections; and(c) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report as soon as it is in possession of the information requested above.
.The Committee examined this case at its meetings in November  and February  and submitted to the Governing Body the two interim reports to be found in paragraphs  to  of its st Report and paragraphs  to  of its rd Report. These were approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ) and st Session (February-March ), respectively.
.Examination of certain of the allegations relating to the denial of legal personality to the Trade Union Confederation of Workers of Colombia (CSTC) had been adjourned in connection with which the Committee had requested additional information from the Government. It repeated this request on a number of occasions, while postponing its examination of the case. The ILO received this information from the Government on  December .
.Colombia has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.Recapitulating this aspect of the case, it will be recalled that the complainants alleged that the Ministry of Labour's Resolution No.  of  March  denied legal personality to the CSTC, contrary to the provisions of the national Constitution and the right of trade union organisations to establish Confederations. The first request for the granting of legal personality was submitted in May , but rejected by the Government two years later when the CSTC resubmitted it at its second congress in July . The complainants claimed that the real reason for the refusal of legal personality was based on ideological considerations and, in particular, on information supplied by the secret police.
.In its reply, the Government declared that legal personality had been refused to the CSTC, firstly, because the requirements of section  of the Labour Code had not been fulfilled and, secondly, because its proposed by-laws infringed section  of the Code. Furthermore, according to reports from the state security service, the aims of the CSTC were inconsistent with the functions recognised by law as being appropriate to trade unions and were incompatible with section  of the Code, which prohibits trade unions of any type from promoting or supporting campaigns or movements which disregard, either collectively or through individual members, legal precepts or action taken by the lawful authorities. In addition, certain members of the Executive Committee and of the member organisations of the CSTC were in prison on charges of activities designed to upset the public order.
.At its November  meeting, the Committee recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to supply more detailed information concerning infringement of sections  and  of the Labour Code, and on the activities which constituted an additional justification for the refusal to grant legal personality. In its communication of  January , the Government confined itself to stating that an appeal against the Ministry's resolution was before the Council of State, an independent body which could quash the resolution if it found a legal flaw in it.
.At its meeting in February , the Committee considered that the Council of State's ruling might make available information that would be useful in examining the case, and it therefore recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to be good enough to forward the text of the ruling, and the reasons adduced therein, as soon as it was given.
.On  December  the Government made the following information available to the ILO. As the CSTC had not been granted legal personality when it was first constituted, the organisations concerned had set up a new Confederation in July . On  March  the Ministry of Labour issued a resolution rejecting the new request for legal personality. An appeal against this resolution was lodged but the Ministry confirmed its ruling by means of a further resolution dated  April . The Ministry cited a number of reasons in support of its ruling.
.Firstly, section  of the Labour Code provided that only a trade union, and not a Confederation, could call a strike; however, under its by-laws the CSTC had the right to call a strike. Secondly, it was laid down in section  of the Code that members of the executive of a federation or Confederation must, at the time of their election, have been engaged in the trade or occupation concerned for more than a year, and there was no evidence of this in the supporting documents submitted by the CSTC when requesting the grant of legal personality. As to section  of the Code, the text of which is referred to in paragraph  above, the Ministry of Labour's resolutions stated that the decisions of the CSTC's constituent congress were an open incitement to disregard the law of the land and the decisions of the lawful authorities. Finally, with respect to the arrest of the leaders of the CSTC and its affiliated organisations, the Ministry stated that section  of the Code made the Government responsible for the inspection and supervision of trade union activities to ensure the maintenance of law and order; it was therefore impossible to grant legal personality to an organisation containing members against whom there was grave suspicion that they were committing offences against the peace.
.An appeal to quash the Ministry of Labour's resolutions was lodged with the Council of State. The evidence was submitted to that body in October  but its verdict had still not been given.
.Furthermore, according to the Government, various federations met on  December  for the purpose of reconstituting the CSTC. Shortly after, a request for recognition of legal personality was submitted and had been pending since June . To date, the Ministry of Labour had not taken any decision on it.
.As was pointed out previously, the case before the Committee involves the principle that workers' organisations have the right to establish and join federations and Confederations, and the principle that the acquisition of legal personality by workers' organisations, federations and Confederations should not be made subject to conditions of such a character as to restrict this right. In this respect, the Committee recalls that it previously took the view, in one of its first cases, that the formalities prescribed by national regulations concerning the Constitution and functioning of workers' organisations were compatible with the provisions of Convention No. , provided that the provisions in such regulations did not infringe the guarantees laid down in the Convention. The Committee also upheld the view that a requirement that union rules should comply with national statutory requirements did not constitute a violation of the generally accepted principle that workers' organisations should have the right to draw up their Constitutions and rules in full freedom, provided that such statutory requirements did not infringe the principle of freedom of association.
.On this basis and in line with the principle, stated in Article  of Convention No. , whereby Confederations should have the same rights under the Convention as those enjoyed by workers' organisations, the Committee considers it necessary to make the following points. In regard to section  of the Labour Code, the Committee has already pointed out on another occasion, in the case of similar legislation, that to prohibit federations and Confederations from calling a strike was",1,1967,Colombia
145,".The Committee has already examined this case at its th (November ), th (February ), th (February-March ) and th (February ) Sessions and on each occasion it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body. These reports can be found in paragraphs  to  of its st Report, paragraphs  to  of its rd Report, paragraphs  to  of its th Report and paragraphs  to  of its nd Report.
.Colombia has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The case concerns the attempts of the Trade Union Confederation of Workers of Colombia (CSTC) to obtain legal personality. The first request for the granting of legal personality was submitted in  but for various reasons it was rejected by the Government two years later. A second request submitted in July  was also rejected in March . In December  various federations met for the purpose of reconstituting the CSTC. Shortly after, a request for recognition of legal personality was submitted.
.At its th Session the Committee recommended the Governing Body to draw the attention of the Government to the principles and observations set forth in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, and in particular to the fact that the statutory formalities should not be such as to hamper freedom to form organisations. The Government was also requested to be good enough to provide information on the resolution concerning the third request for the granting of legal personality.
.On  October  the Government replied that the request had been passed from the General Secretariat of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security to the Labour Relations Branch of that Ministry because the General Secretariat objected to several of the proposed by-laws of the CSTC, and, more particularly, to article (b), concerning proceedings for the submission of claims; article (e), concerning the Executive Committee's power to examine intra-union, inter-union and union-management-labour authority disputes; article , on the nullity of the National Labour Congress; article (d), concerning the concluding of collective agreements by affiliated unions; article (j), concerning assignment of union funds and petty cash; article (b), concerning a general study of the country's problems through legislative provisions; and article , concerning the Confederation's expenditure and budget.
.The Government did not provide the exact text of the bylaws objected to, nor did it inform the Committee of the nature of its objections. It appeared to the Committee at its th Session, on the basis of the enumeration referred to in the preceding paragraph, that the matters dealt with in these by-laws were primarily internal affairs of the union and fell within the scope of Article  of Convention No. , which states that ""workers' and employers' organisations shall have the right to draw up their Constitutions and rules, to elect their representatives in full freedom, to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes"" while the ""public authorities shall refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof"".
.As has already been pointed out by the Committee on previous occasions, this case involves the principle that workers' organisations have the right to establish and join federations and Confederations, and the principle that the acquisition of legal personality by workers' organisations, federations and Confederations should not be made subject to conditions of such a character as to restrict this right. The Committee also upheld the view that a requirement that union rules should comply with national legislation did not constitute a violation of the generally accepted principle that workers' organisations should have the right to draw up their Constitutions and rules in full freedom, provided that such statutory requirements did not infringe the principle of freedom of association.
.The Committee observed that a very considerable period of time had elapsed since the CSTC made its third request for recognition of its legal personality. The Committee pointed out again, as it did in another case concerning Colombia, that while it is true that the founders of a trade union must comply with the formalities prescribed by legislation, these formalities should not be of such a nature as to hamper freedom to form organisations.
.In paragraph  of its nd Report the Committee recommended the Governing Body to draw the attention of the Government to the principles and considerations set forth in paragraphs  to  above and to request the Government to be good enough to provide information on the exact wording of the CSTC bylaws objected to by the General Secretariat of Labour and the specific nature of these objections.
.In a communication of  August , the Government announced that a resolution had been passed that same day granting legal personality to the CSTC. This information is confirmed in a letter from the CSTC dated  September .
.This case can be summed up as follows. The CSTC submitted two successive requests for the granting of legal personality - the first in  - which for various reasons were rejected by the Government. According to the Labour Code of Colombia a trade union cannot act as such unless it enjoys legal personality. A third request for this to be granted was submitted at the end of . The labour authorities raised objections which are summarised in paragraph  above.
.The Committee has made observations in a number of reports dealing with this case. It now notes that the organisation concerned has finally obtained legal personality. Consequently, the Committee considers that the matter raised in the complaint has been settled and that no further action is called for.
.Accordingly, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note with interest that the organisation in question has obtained legal personality, and(b) to decide that the case does not call for further examination on its part.
.The Committee examined this case at its meetings in November , February  and February-March  and submitted to the Governing Body the three interim reports to be found in paragraphs  to  of its st Report, paragraphs  to  of its rd Report, and paragraphs  to  of its th Report. These were approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ), st Session (February-March ) and th Session (February-March ) respectively.
.The case concerns the attempts of the Trade Union Confederation of Workers of Colombia (CSTC) to obtain legal personality. At paragraph  of the th Report, it was stated that various federations had met on  December  for the purpose of reconstituting the CSTC and seeking legal personality for the third time. At paragraph  of the same Report, the Government was requested to be good enough to provide information on the resolution concerning the new request for the granting of legal personality to this Confederation. This information has now been received in a communication from the Government dated  October .
.In its letter the Government states that the request for the granting of legal personality to the CSTC has been passed from the General Secretariat of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security to the Labour Relations Branch of that Ministry, because the General Secretariat holds that several of the proposed by-laws failed to meet the legal requirements, for example: article (b), concerning proceedings for the submission of claims; article (e), concerning the Executive Committee's power to examine intro-union, inter-union and union-management-labour-authority disputes; article , on the non-recognition of the National Labour Congress; article (d) concerning the conclusion of collective agreements by affiliated unions; article (j) concerning assignment of union funds and petty cash; article (b) concerning a general study of the country's problems through legislative provisions; and article , concerning the Confederation's expenditure and budget.
.The Government does not provide the exact text of the by-laws objected to, nor does it inform the Committee of the nature of its objections. It would appear to the Committee, on the basis of the enumeration referred to in the preceding paragraph, that the matters dealt with in these by-laws are primarily internal affairs of the union and would fall within the scope of Article  of Convention No. , which states that ""workers' and employers' organisations shall have the right to draw up their Constitutions and rules, to elect their representatives in full freedom, to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes"" while ""the public authorities shall refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof"".
.As has already been pointed out by the Committee on previous occasions, this case involves the principle that workers' organisations should have the right to establish and join federations and Confederations, and the principle that the acquisition of legal personality by workers' organisations, federations and Confederations should not be made subject to conditions of such a character as to restrict this right. In this respect, the Committee again recalls that it took the view in one of its first cases that the formalities prescribed by",-1,1967,Colombia
146,"not compatible with Article  of the Convention, which provides that trade union organisations should have the right "" to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes "", while the public authorities should refrain "" from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof "". With respect to the provisions of section  of the Code, which require that trade union leaders should, at the time of their election, have been engaged in the occupation or trade concerned for more than a year, the Committee considers that they are not in harmony with Article  of the Convention, which recognises the right of workers' organisations to elect their representatives in full freedom.
.As to the third reason given by the Ministry of Labour for the denial of legal personality to the CSTC, i.e. that the decisions of the CSTC's constituent congress were an open incitement to disregard the law of the land and the decisions of the lawful authorities, thus violating section  of the Labour Code, the Committee is unable to pass judgement without seeing the texts of the decisions, which have not been communicated by the Government. However, in this respect the Committee considers it appropriate to recall the provision of Article  of Convention No.  which states that "" In exercising the rights provided for in this Convention workers and employers and their respective organisations, like other persons or organised collectivities, shall respect the law of the land.""
.Lastly, with respect to the fourth reason given by the Ministry of Labour, viz. the arrest of leaders of the CSTC and of its affiliated organisations because there was grave suspicion that they were committing offences against the peace, the Committee recalls the view expressed by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations which the Committee has already quoted in a previous case. As the Committee of Experts stated, normal control of the activities of trade unions should be effected a posteriori and by the judicial authorities; and the fact that an organisation which sought to enjoy the status of an occupational organisation might in certain cases engage in activities foreign to trade union activities did not appear to constitute sufficient reason for subjecting trade union organisations a priori to control with respect to their composition and with respect to the composition of their management committees. On that occasion the Committee drew attention to the fact that refusal to register a union because the authorities, in advance, and of their own independent judgement, considered that it might be politically undesirable, would seem tantamount to submitting registration, which was compulsory and without which a union could not lawfully exist, to previous authorisation on the part of the authorities, which is not compatible with the provisions of Convention No. . In the present case, the Committee takes the view that if there is grave suspicion that trade union leaders have committed acts which are punishable by law, they should be subject to normal legal proceedings in order to determine the extent of their liability, and that arrest should not in itself constitute an obstacle to the granting of legal personality to the organisation concerned.
.The Committee observes that meanwhile the CSTC was constituted for the third time at the end of  and has again requested recognition of its legal personality, but despite the lapse in time this still has not been granted. Although the Committee is unaware of the reasons for the delay, it points out that more than a year has passed since the relevant proceedings were initiated and that the ruling of the Ministry of Labour has been pending for more than six months. The Committee points out, as it did in another case concerning Colombia, that while it is true that the founders of a trade union must comply with the formalities prescribed by legislation, these formalities should not be of such nature as to hamper freedom to form organisations.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the attention of the Government to the principles and observations set forth in paragraphs  to  above, and in particular to the fact that the statutory formalities to be complied with by the founders of a trade union organisation should not be such as to hamper freedom to form organisations;(b) to request the Government to be good enough to provide information on the resolution concerning the new request for the granting of legal personality submitted by the Trade Union Confederation of Workers of Colombia (CSTC);(c) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report as soon as it is in possession of the information requested in the previous subparagraph.
.The Committee examined this case at its meeting in November  and submitted to the Governing Body an interim report which is to be found in paragraphs  to  of the Committee's st Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ).
.The complaints alleged that trade union premises had been broken into, that a number of trade union leaders had been arbitrarily arrested, and that legal personality had been denied to the Trade Union Confederation of Workers of Colombia (C.S.T.C.). In its st Report the Committee submitted its final conclusions with regard to the arrest of trade unionists, and recommended the Governing Body to request the Government for further observations in respect of the other two aspects of the case.
.By a communication dated  January  the Government has answered the request for further observations.
.Colombia has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The problem facing the Committee in the present instance concerns the generally accepted principle that workers' organisations shall have the right to establish and join federations and Confederations, and the principle that the acquisition of legal personality by workers' organisations, federations and Confederations shall not be made subject to conditions of such a nature as to restrict the exercise of this right.
.The Committee has taken the view in other cases that in view of the nature of its responsibilities it cannot consider itself bound by any rule that national procedures of redress must be exhausted such as appeals, for instance to international claims tribunals.
.Nevertheless, considering that in the present case the Council of State's ruling as to the legality of the measure taken by the authorities may make available information which will be of assistance to it in its examination of the matter, the Committee, as it has done in earlier similar cases, recommends the Governing Body to request the Government to be good enough to supply the text of the ruling and the reasons adduced therein, as soon as it is pronounced, and in the meantime to postpone its examination of this aspect of the case.
.In these circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the allegations relating to the forced entry of trade union premises, to decide, for the reasons given in paragraph  above, and subject to the reservation that the principle set forth in paragraph  should be observed, that no useful purpose would be served by pursuing its examination of this aspect of the case;(b) with regard to the denial of legal personality to the C.S.T.C, to request the Government to be good enough to supply the text of the ruling of the Council of State on the appeal now before it, together with the reasons adduced therein, as soon as it is pronounced;(c) to take note of the present interim report, on the understanding that the Committee will report further when it has received the additional information to which reference is made in subparagraph (b) of this paragraph.
.The complaints were presented by letters dated  April and  June  from, respectively, the World Federation of Trade Unions and the Departmental Workers' Federation of Tolima (FEDETTOL). The W.F.T.U furnished further information in support of its complaint by a communication dated  May . A communication was also received on  June  in support of the complaint from six trade union federations which participated in the establishment of the Trade Union Confederation of Workers of Colombia (C.S.T.C.). By a letter dated  August  the Government furnished its observations on the matters raised in the complaints.
.Colombia has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations contained in the complaints relate firstly to the fact that trade union premises have been broken into and certain acts committed therein, including the destruction of files and libraries and the confiscation of legal documents. Secondly, the complainants allege that a certain number of trade union leaders have been arbitrarily arrested. Finally, it is claimed, legal",-1,1967,Colombia
147,"has never been declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of Justice nor, in the  years during which it has been in force, has its Constitutionality ever been questioned before this body. The Act was applied in  on the same grounds in accordance with the Constitution, which establishes the possibility of restricting the right of assembly by means of a law whenever public safety and order may be endangered. In this respect, the Uruguayan Constitution corresponds to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and to the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, in providing that: "" No restrictions may be placed on the exercise of this right other than those which are prescribed by law and which are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or public order, the protection of public health or morals or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.""
.The Government points out that in its reply to the original complaints it has already given the reasons for which it considered that the proposed meeting might affect safety and public order, thus coming within the provisions of Act No. . It adds to these reasons the fact that the resolutions adopted by the C.P.U.S.T.A.L at its meeting in Montevideo in  were of a purely political nature and were directed against the Organisation of American States (O.A.S.), of which Uruguay is a member, and against the governments of various American States with which the country maintains diplomatic relations. In these circumstances, it was clear that the new meeting would take the same attitude as that adopted in , the situation being further aggravated by the fact that the meeting would have to express its solidarity with the subversive policy recommended by the Havana Tri-Continental Conference of  and by the Conference of the Latin American Solidarity Organisation (), which Uruguay had denounced as violating international law and the principle of non-intervention. The Government repeats that it was on the grounds of all these considerations that it decided to ban the meeting in question with a view to ensuring public order.
.The Committee notes that the complainants request a re-examination of the case with regard to the right of assembly, which is alleged to have been infringed by the Government. In this respect, the complainants submit further evidence in stating that the Act on which the decision to ban the proposed meeting was based was considered unconstitutional under Uruguayan legal theory and case law, and refer to the opinion expressed by the I.L.O. working party, according to which this decision was unjustified. For its part, the Government maintains that the allegations submitted by the complainants do not, in fact, contain new evidence, but it states that although the Committee has already given a ruling on this case, it has no objection to all its aspects and possible repercussions being considered. With regard to the alleged unconstitutionality of the Act referred to, the Government points out that no ruling to this effect has ever been given by the Supreme Court.
.The Committee considers that basically both the complainants and the Government have repeated the facts originally stated, although certain additional information has been provided in connection with national legislation on the right of assembly. On the basis of these facts, the Committee considered that it should formulate its conclusions on the measures adopted by the Government against the foreign delegates who were to take part in the meeting; these conclusions were not contested by the complainants.
.In their latest communication the complainants have submitted a series of considerations in order for the Committee to re-examine the question from the point of view of the exercise of the right of assembly of trade union organisations and, in view of the position adopted by the Government with regard to this request, the Committee considers it appropriate to formulate its observations on this aspect of the case.
.In this respect, the Committee has stated on many occasions) that the right of trade unions to meet freely in their own premises, without need for prior authorisation and without control by the public authorities, constitutes a fundamental element of freedom of association. The Committee has also considered that the organisations concerned must observe the general provisions applicable in a country with regard to public meetings. In these cases, it rests with the government, which is responsible for the maintenance of public order and the exercise of police authority, to decide whether meetings, including trade union meetings, may in certain special circumstances endanger public order and security and to take adequate preventive measures
.In the present case, the Government adopted the measure without considering whether the meeting would be of a private or public nature. The Government had based its decision on the political nature which the meeting might have had, as could be supposed from the previous meetings of the C.P.U.S.T.A.L, at which statements had been made against the O.A.S and against other American countries with which Uruguay maintains diplomatic relations. They also referred to the connection which the meeting might have with certain resolutions concerning internal subversion adopted, for example, by the Havana Tri-Continental Conference. This suggestion has been rejected by the complainants, who repeat that the objectives and agenda of the meeting related strictly to trade union matters. The government measure is legally based on Act No. , which empowers the Government to grant or refuse permission to hold meetings aimed at making demonstrations against the policy of a foreign State, its international position or its actions as an entity in international law. In view of the above considerations, the Government maintains that the purpose of the measure was to ensure public order.
.The Committee notes that the complainants and the Government disagree with regard to the Constitutionality of the above-mentioned Act, and that whilst the Government provides certain specific information on its application in the past, the complainants have supplied no evidence to support their statement that this Act is considered contrary to the Constitution of Uruguay by national legal theory and case law.
.On the basis of the above considerations, the Committee confirms that this case involves a problem relating to the right of assembly of trade union organisations in a situation where, according to the Government, the exercise of this right could have repercussions of a political nature which would affect the international position of the Government of Uruguay as well as safety or public order.
.In a previous case, the Committee had to examine allegations concerning a national trade union congress which was banned by the authorities on the grounds of certain specific facts which gave reason to believe that the meeting was in danger of losing its trade union objectives and of being used for political ends. On that occasion, the Committee decided to call the attention of the Government to the desirability of giving the trade union movement the greatest possible measure of freedom of action in the occupational sphere which was compatible with the maintenance of public order. At the same time, the Committee pointed out that it would be desirable for the parties concerned to have regard, in the interests of the normal development of the trade union movement, to the principles enunciated in the resolution adopted by the International Labour Conference at its th () Session. This resolution declares in particular that the fundamental and permanent mission of the trade union movement is the economic and social advancement of the workers and that when trade unions in accordance with the national law and practice of their respective countries and at the decision of their members decide to establish relations with a political party or to undertake Constitutional political action as a means towards the advancement of their economic and social objectives, such political relations or actions should not be of such a nature as to compromise the continuance of the trade union movement or its social or economic functions, irrespective of political changes in the country.
.With regard particularly to the political activities of trade unions, the Committee also recalls the conclusions of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, to the effect that the general a priori prohibition of the political activities of trade unions may raise difficulties by reason of the fact that the interpretation given in practice to the relevant provisions may change at any moment and restrict considerably the possibility of action of the organisations. For this reason the authorities should only repress abuses which might be committed by organisations which had lost sight of the fact that their fundamental objective should be the economic and social advancement of the workers.
.The Committee takes account of the fact that the present case relates not to the congress of a national organisation but to a trade union meeting of an international nature. This type of meeting may give rise to special problems, not only because of the nationality of the participants but also in connection with the international policy and commitments of the",2,1967,Uruguay
148,".The complaint of the Central Federation of Chilean Workers is contained in a telegram dated  September , which was sent directly to the I.L.O. The text was communicated to the Government, which submitted its observations on the matter in a letter dated  December .
.Venezuela has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants allege that Mr. Julio Campos, their representative at the Congress of the Central Federation of Venezuelan Workers, who had gone to Caracas at the invitation, of the workers of that country, was arrested on orders from the Government of Venezuela.
.In its observations the Government states that on  September  (the day before the complainants' telegram was sent to the I.L.O.), several Caracas newspapers published articles according to which a Juan Campos, a Chilean trade unionist who had been invited to a meeting of the Central Federation of Venezuelan Workers, had been arrested. At this news, and as none of the national security services was aware of the alleged arrest, an administrative inquiry was made among the immigration services. The inquiry revealed that no one by the name of Juan Campos had entered the country but that two persons called Julio Campos, one a Colombian, the other a Chilean, had entered Venezuela, the second of these persons having stated that he was going to stay at the Caroni Hotel. When the police subsequently discovered that the person in question was not in fact staying at the Caroni Hotel, he was ordered to present himself for questioning, as is the normal practice with aliens in the country.
.When Mr. Julio Campos presented himself to the police, he was asked to state the purpose of his visit to Venezuela; Mr. Campos replied that he had come to Venezuela with the intention of visiting Caracas; when the police asked him why he had not attended the meetings of the Central Federation of Venezuelan Workers, he replied that he had come to Venezuela mainly as a tourist. The Government states that Mr. Campos did not come to Venezuela at the invitation of the Central Federation of Venezuelan Workers and had not attended the meetings of this organisation.
.After the above-mentioned check, the Government states that Mr. Campos was allowed to go free and that he left the country at a later date.
.From the information at the disposal of the Committee it would appear that the complaint of the Central Federation of Chilean Workers is based on erroneous information published in the Venezuelan press. From the detailed explanations furnished by the Government it is also clear that Mr. Campos was not detained and that he was able to leave the country freely.
.In these circumstances, considering that no useful purpose would be served in examining this matter further, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that the case calls for no further examination on its part.",1,1967,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
149,"of Article  of Convention No. , ratified by Argentina, according to which "" measures appropriate to national conditions shall be taken, where necessary, to encourage and promote the full development and utilisation of machinery for voluntary negotiation between employers or employers' organisations and workers' organisations, with a view to the regulation of terms and conditions of employment by means of collective agreements "". In this respect the Committee has in previous cases pointed out the importance it attaches to the fact that the right to bargain freely with employers with respect to conditions of work constitutes an essential element in freedom of association, and to the principle that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which might restrict the trade unions' right to seek, through collective bargaining or other lawful means, to improve the living and working conditions of those whom the trade unions represent, or impede the lawful exercise of this right.
.In certain cases a the Committee has had to express its views on matters similar to those raised in this case, in examining legislation under which prior approval is required before collective agreements can take effect, the government being given the power to amend such agreements or refuse them its approval for reasons of economic policy. The Committee considers that such provisions are contrary to the principle of free bargaining provided for in Convention No. .
.The present case does not concern prior approval of a collective agreement, but the legislation has gone further by amending agreements which had already been in force for some time. In addition, the legislation also prohibits collective agreements concerning the manning of ships from being concluded in the future, as indicated in paragraph  above.
.The Committee has admitted certain exceptions to the general rule concerning interference by the authorities in collective bargaining. It has considered that in certain circumstances governments might feel that the situation in the country called for stabilising measures, and it has therefore accepted that during the application of such measures it would not be possible for wage rates to be fixed freely through the medium of collective bargaining.
.In this connection the Committee observes that Act No.  is only in force temporarily until the General Shipping Act is promulgated. Furthermore, it would appear that the latter of these Acts will cover some of the matters dealt with in Act No. , according to section  thereof. Hence in this case what is involved is not the mere suspension of particular clauses of a collective agreement, but a new method of regulation of these matters, by legislative action.
.Lastly, the Committee observes that, after the events described, the Government enacted Act No. , providing for the introduction of methods and systems of rationalisation of state undertakings in consultation with the trade unions. According to the Government, the United Unions of Workers in the State Oil Industry concluded the first collective agreement on rationalisation within the framework of this Act.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the Government's attention to Article  of Convention No. , and to the principle that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which might restrict the unions' right to seek, through collective bargaining or other lawful means, to improve the living and working conditions of those whom the trade unions represent, or which might impede the lawful exercise of this right;(b) to remind the Government of the importance it attaches to the principles contained in the Consultation (Industrial and National Levels) Recommendation,  (No. ), according to which the authorities should seek the views, advice and assistance of the employers' and workers' organisations in an appropriate manner in respect of the preparation and implementation of laws and regulations affecting their interests;(c) to take due note of the fact that, after the events alleged, the Government promulgated Act No. , which has enabled the complainants to negotiate a rationalisation agreement with the appropriate state undertaking.",2,1967,Argentina
150,"country in which the meeting is to take place. In this connection the government of a particular country may consider it necessary to adopt restrictive measures on the grounds of certain special circumstances prevailing at a particular time.
.The Committee considers that such measures might be justified in exceptional cases, having regard to specific situations, and provided they conform to the laws of the country. However, it should never be possible to apply measures of a general nature against particular trade union organisations unless in each case sufficient grounds exist to justify the government decision-such as genuine dangers which may arise for the international relations of a State or for safety and public order. Otherwise the right of assembly, the exercise of which by international organisations should also be recognised, would be seriously restricted.
.In the case under examination there is disagreement between the complainants and the Government with regard to the aims of the meeting which motivated the decision adopted by the Government. There is also disagreement as to the legality of this decision, mainly in the light of the Constitutional provisions. On the one hand questions of fact are involved on which the Committee lacks sufficient evidence to judge the full implications of the case, and, on the other hand, questions of national law, on which the Committee is not competent to express an opinion. As far as possible, such questions should be raised before the appropriate judicial authorities of the country, which in the present case the complainants have apparently not done.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide, subject to the observations contained principally in paragraphs , , ,  and , that the allegations in the case do not call for further examination.
.In a communication dated  August  to the I.L.O the Secretariat of the Permanent Congress for Trade Union Unity of the Workers of Latin America (C.P.U.S.T.A.L.), which has its headquarters in Santiago, Chile, lodged a complaint against the Government of Uruguay alleging that it had banned a meeting of its General Council in Montevideo and had arrested some of the delegates. In two further communications dated  and  September  the authors of the complaint supplied additional information and also indicated that the National Labour Congress of Uruguay (C.N.T.) was affiliated to their organisation.
.The three communications mentioned in the previous paragraph were transmitted to the Government by a letter dated  October . The Government replied in a letter dated  February . At its sessions on  and  February  the Committee decided to postpone its examination of the case since the Government's observations had arrived too late to be examined on that occasion.
.On  February  the I.L.O received an undated communication from the C.N.T containing allegations to the effect that by forbidding the meeting in question, the Government had violated the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ). A copy of this communication was forwarded to the Government.
.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Secretariat of the C.P.U.S.T.A.L states that the General Council of this Organisation was due to be held in Montevideo from  August to  September  on the invitation of the C.N.T. The purpose of this meeting was "" the discussion of problems of trade union unity concerning Latin American workers, and also starting a study of social security in the region "". According to the complaint the C.N.T obtained permission from the Government beforehand and visas were granted to the delegations from the national trade union organisations which were due to attend. On  August  the Government issued a decree forbidding the meeting.
.The complainants state that on  August two delegates from a Chilean trade union organisation and a delegate from a Venezuelan trade union organisation, all of them members of the General Secretariat of the C.P.U.S.T.A.L, together with the Technical Secretary, arrived in Montevideo. These persons were, according to the complainants, detained for a number of hours, taken to the airport and expelled from the country.
.In the complainants' view these events constitute a flagrant breach of international Conventions. They state that the decree forbidding the meeting was "" based on false assertions and imputations that had nothing to do with the trade union movement "".
.The C.N.T claims in the communication mentioned in paragraph  above that, in issuing its decree banning the meeting of the General Council of the C.P.U.S.T.A.L, the Government violated the obligations it had assumed by ratifying Convention No.  with respect to the right to establish federations, as well as the domestic legislation of Uruguay itself, which protects freedom of association and the right of assembly. The C.N.T states that the proposed meeting intended to concentrate on a discussion of the possibility of forming a continent-wide trade union organisation and was intended to continue on a wider scale the work begun in Brasilia in , when the C.P.U.S.T.A.L was formed. The agenda, according to the C.N.T, comprised a review of the work accomplished by the Permanent Secretariat and of the state of organisation of the trade union movement in Latin America.
.Replying to the allegations of the Permanent Secretariat of the C.P.U.S.T.A.L, the Government states that the decree of  August  was entirely in accordance with the relevant Constitutional and statutory standards. It adds that in Uruguay "" the Government is empowered to grant or refuse the necessary permission for the holding of any meeting aimed at making demonstrations or criticisms in favour of or against the policy of a foreign State or its international position or its actions as a body corporate under international law "" (section  of Act No.  of  July ). The Government banned the meeting in accordance with the Constitutional provisions which make it responsible for maintaining domestic law and order and also observed the provision of the Constitution which guarantees the right of assembly but authorises the Government, in accordance with the law, to restrict this right in order to guarantee safety and public order.
.The Government states that, in deciding to impose the ban, account was taken of the background and circumstances of the case, viz. the political aim of the meeting, the affiliations of the delegates, the links between this meeting and the decisions concerning internal subversion and the violent overthrow of governments embodied in the resolutions of the Havana Tri-Continental Conference, the need for strict compliance with Uruguay's international obligations, etc.
.It adds that, contrary to the assertions of the complainants, permission from the Government to hold the meeting was never applied for or obtained and that no Uruguayan authority granted any visas or authorisations of any kind for the participation of foreign delegates. The delegates did not seek authorisation to enter the country, as most of them were citizens of Latin American countries who would not need to obtain tourist visas.
.It goes on to state that neither the C.N.T nor any other Uruguayan trade union organisation had asked the Government to revoke the decree and it rejects the charge that it has in any way violated International Labour Conventions. In particular it considers that Convention No.  has no connection with the case, which involves the prohibition of a meeting of foreign representatives on national territory.
.Lastly, the Government declares that none of the representatives who arrived in Montevideo was detained or arrested. As the meeting could not be held, they were told that they should leave Uruguayan territory.
.The Committee notes in the first place that there is a contradiction between the information supplied by the complainants and the Government not only as regards the purpose of the meeting but also concerning the actual events giving rise to the complaint. The Government confirms that it took the measure in question but categorically denies that the authorities had given permission for this meeting to be held in Uruguay or for the foreign delegates to enter the country.
.While the Committee has consistently emphasised the importance it has always attached to the fact that freedom from government interference in the holding or proceedings of trade union meetings constitutes an essential element of trade union rights, as well as to the principle that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof, the actual point at issue appears, in the present case, to be the sovereign right of a country to grant or deny entry to foreigners wishing to enter it. In this respect the Committee has taken the view ever since its earliest reports that it is not called upon to deal with the general question of the status of aliens, which is not covered by International Labour Conventions. In one case the Committee, in accordance with this principle, had to decide not to examine allegations that the diplomatic authorities of one country, by refusing the necessary visas, had",0,1967,Uruguay
151,"prevented the representatives of a trade union Confederation in another country from attending a trade union congress held within territory which was at that time under the jurisdiction of the first country.
.In these circumstances, and in view of the Government's statement to the effect that the foreign delegates arriving in the country to attend the meeting in question were neither detained nor arrested, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.",-1,1967,Uruguay
152,"formulate their programmes and that the public authorities shall refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof;(ii) to request the Government to be good enough to state as soon as possible whether there is a measure in force, as the complainants say, depriving the former members of the executive of the union of civil rights and to indicate the legal provisions on which any such measure is based;(c) to take note of this interim report, on the understanding that the Committee will submit a further report when it has received the information requested from the Government in clause (b) (ii) of this paragraph.",0,1967,Paraguay
153,"instigation of the labour authorities. However, from the other information contained in the detailed reply of the Government, and in particular from that supplied by the Ministry of the Interior, it appears that Messrs. Ramirez, Rojas, Pereira and Bedoya were detained for some  days for suspected subversive activities and that they were released some days before the assembly at which the new executive of the union was elected.
.The Committee wishes to recall that in previous cases in which it was alleged that trade union leaders had been preventively detained, it has considered that measures of preventive detention may involve a serious interference with the exercise of trade union rights which it would seem necessary to justify by the existence of a serious emergency and which would be open to criticism unless accompanied by adequate judicial safeguards applied within a reasonable period, and that it should be the policy of every government to ensure the observance of human rights and especially the right of all detained persons to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment. The Committee has also pointed out that the detention by the authorities of trade unionists concerning whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found is liable to involve restrictions of trade union rights. In these cases, the Committee has recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to take steps to ensure that the authorities concerned have instructions appropriate to eliminate the danger of detention for trade union activities
.In the present case, the available information does not show that the men were detained as a result of legal proceedings. Nevertheless, as they have since been released, the Committee recommends the Governing Body, subject to the considerations referred to in the preceding paragraph, to decide that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.Allegations relating to the Taking Over of a Union
.From the information supplied to the Committee, it appears that the Trade Union of the San Antonio Cold Store was taken over from July  to January . According to the statement of the Government, the reasons for this measure were the fact that the workers had declared several strikes without observing the requirements laid down in the Labour Code, these decisions being also taken independently of the union and the need to bring labour-management relations back to the right channels. In its reply, the Government also mentions certain acts of mismanagement of union funds, but this question, on which no details are supplied, appears to have been raised a posteriori, that is, in the report of the administrators.
.One of the provisions of the Labour Code, to which the Government refers, lays down that before the workers belonging to a union can declare a strike, the decision shall be agreed to by two-thirds of the members, after discussion at a general meeting, and secret ballot under the supervision of the competent labour authority (section  (b)). It should also be pointed out that, in accordance with section , whenever a strike is declared by a number of workers less than that indicated above, the competent authority shall declare that a state of strike does not exist, and order any workers who have left their employment to report back for work within the next  hours, under pain of termination of their contract of employment. Under section  of the Code, failure to comply with the other previous conditions as to form results in the workers concerned being disciplined by the non-payment of their wages during the period of the strike.
.The question raised in the complaint does not, however, refer to the application of provisions relating to strikes but to the alleged violation of the independence of the union, to measures taken against the leaders in office at the time, and to the actions of the administrators, who, according to the complainants, had lent themselves to manoeuvres designed to impose the appointment of an executive lacking the support of the majority of the members.
.The C.L.A.S.C states, in effect, that the taking over resulted in the dismissal of the previous executive, and the Christian Federation of Labour mentions the deprivation of civil rights for five years imposed on the members thereof. Further, at the meeting convened by the administrators, at which persons having no connection with the union had taken part by force, the members had not been able to present other candidates, to speak, or to vote.
.The Government replies to this that the administrative labour authority did not interfere in matters concerning the union, that the assembly was convened in accordance with all the formalities, and that the members elected their officers freely, democratically, and without coercion.
.It will be realised that the only respect in which all this information is consistent is in so far as it refers to the taking over of the union itself and to the fact that the Paraguayan Federation of Labour was entrusted with the task by the Government. This latter fact, although it gives a special nature to the case, cannot in itself be sufficient reason for regarding the examination of the allegations as closed. It should be recalled that in an earlier case, in which the Committee considered that the complainants had not furnished proof that the government concerned had intervened directly in trade union life, the Committee emphasised nevertheless that freedom of association should be ensured in fact as well as in law and drew the attention of the government to the desirability of taking appropriate measures, if necessary, to ensure the free exercise of the right to organise of workers and employers even in their relations with other organisations or third parties. In the present case the Government itself states that it entrusted the task of taking over the organisation in question to the Paraguayan Federation of Labour.
.The C.L.A.S.C refers to the provisions of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), both of which have been ratified by Paraguay. The only allegation to which the second of these Conventions can have any relevance is that referring to the support said to have been given by the undertaking to a candidate for office on the new executive of the union. Under Article , paragraph , of Convention No. , workers' organisations shall enjoy adequate protection against any acts of interference such as those designed to promote the establishment of workers' organisations under the domination of employers or employers' organisations, or to support workers' organisations by financial or other means, with the object of placing such organisations under the control of employers or employers' organisations. The complainants, however, give no details to support this allegation,
.On the other hand, the very fact of the taking over, the preventive detention of the officers of the Trade Union of the San Antonio Cold Store shortly before the trade union elections and the detailed allegations that this taking over prevented the members of the union from taking part freely in the assembly and, in particular, in the election of its officers-allegations of which the Government denies the truth-do have a connection with Article  of Convention No. , which provides, inter alia, that workers' and employers' organisations shall have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom, to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes and that the public authorities shall refrain from any interference that would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof.
.Lastly, the Committee has received no information from the Government on the allegation that the former officers have been deprived of civil rights for five years. If this measure has been taken, it would be important, for the further examination of the case, to know whether it is still in force and on what legal provisions it is based.
.For the above reasons, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to emphasise the importance it has always attached to the provision of Article  of Convention No.  referred to above, and also to ask the Government for information on the point mentioned in paragraph .
.In these circumstances, with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) in respect of the allegations concerning the detention of various officers of the Trade Union of the San Antonio Cold Stores, subject to the principles set forth in paragraph  above, to note that the persons concerned have been released and to decide that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination;(b) in respect of the allegations concerning the taking over of this trade union:(i) to emphasise once again the importance that it has always attached to the provision contained in Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), in accordance with which workers' and employers' organisations shall have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom, to organise their administration and activities and to",-1,1967,Paraguay
154,".The Committee examined this case previously at its November  Session, when it presented to the Governing Body certain conclusions, contained in paragraphs - of its th Report, which was approved by the Governing Body at its rd Session (November ).
.In that report the Committee submitted its final recommendations on one aspect of the case, namely the allegations relating to the detention of some leaders of a trade union. Still awaiting examination is another aspect of the case, concerning allegations of the taking over of the same trade union, in connection with which the Government was asked for additional information. The paragraphs which follow will deal only with this second aspect of the case.
.In a communication dated  June  the Government supplied the additional information that had been requested.
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the Committee's opinion it is of paramount importance that in such circumstances measures for the dismissal, suspension or disqualification of trade union officials as a penalty provided by law should not become enforceable except on the basis of a firm sentence on the part of the competent judicial authority or, in any case, after the period allowed for the submission of an appeal has elapsed without such an appeal having been made. Moreover, although knowledge of the law is normally taken for granted, it would be desirable when notifying the persons concerned of the administrative resolution, to inform them at the same time that they may submit an appeal through the administrative disputes procedure.
.In the present case the question of an appeal to their judicial authorities does not seem to have been raised.
.In any case, taking into account that the taking over of the union had already been annulled and that the sanction of disqualification imposed on various trade union leaders for five years was repealed after two years, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide, subject to the principles mentioned in paragraph  of the th Report of the Committee and subject to the considerations contained in paragraphs  to  above, that the allegations pending in this case and consequently the case as a whole do not call for further examination.
.The complaint is contained in a communication dated  February  from the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions (C.L.A.S.C.). The text was forwarded to the Government with a letter dated  February , together with the text of a statement made on  January  by the Christian Federation of Labour (Paraguay), which is affiliated to the C.L.A.S.C, and which had sent a signed copy of the statement to the I.L.O.
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  June .
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  February , the C.L.A.S.C alleged that the workers and the executive Committee of the Trade Union of the San Antonio Cold Store had been the victims of an attack on freedom of association. The strike that they had declared to obtain better working conditions had been repressed by the Government. The C.L.A.S.C added that the Government had decided to take over the union, and had therefore dismissed the executive that had been elected by the workers themselves and installed in its place persons appointed by the labour authorities as administrators. Since the workers did not accept the coercive measure of the Government or the violation of freedom of association, the labour authorities ordered the imprisonment of the legitimate officers of the union. The C.L.A.S.C concluded by requesting the I.L.O. to intervene in defence of trade union rights and Conventions Nos.  and .
.In the document sent by the Christian Federation of Labour (Paraguay) dated  January , it is indicated, among other things, that as a result of strikes carried out by the union in the undertaking, the National Directorate of Labour, meeting a request by the employers, decided to take over the union and entrust its administration to three members of the Paraguayan Federation of Labour (C.P.T.). The document in question also stated that since the executive of the union had not complied meekly with the orders of the administrators, these administrators had succeeded in having the officers of the union deprived of civil rights for five years.
.It was also stated that, at the assembly held on  January  to elect new officers, the Paraguayan Federation of Labour had appointed the chairman and secretaries of the meeting, which had to be suspended on account of the general indignation of the members of the union and the certainty that the candidate who, according to the allegation, was nominated by a political organisation and by the undertaking would be rejected. The former officers were arrested. When the assembly was resumed on  January, some  persons "" who did not work in the Cold Store and who were not and never had been members of the Union "" created disturbances "" in collusion with members of the police force and of the C.P.T."" and had a report and a list of candidates approved. Nobody was allowed to speak, no other list was presented, and no vote was taken. According to the complainants, it was by all these means that an attempt was made to prevent the list of candidates supported by the majority of the members and headed by genuine trade union leaders from taking control of the leadership of the union.
.In its letter of  June , the Government encloses a copy of a communication from the Ministry of Justice and Labour, the substance of which is as follows: As a result of complaints received from the International Products Corporation, the labour authorities became aware of the succession of strikes by the workers of the San Antonio Cold Store, who had failed to comply with any of the requirements laid down by the Labour Code (sections ,  and ). In view of this serious situation, the Directorate of Labour asked the Trade Union of the San Antonio Cold Store for information. The union replied that the previous three strikes had not been authorised by it and that they had been carried out by a decision of the workers and without the knowledge of the union officers. This clear and categorical statement led to the conclusion that the union, having had no part in these serious events, had lost authority over its members, and that it was therefore necessary to take over the union with a view to restoring normal conditions and bringing labour-management relations back to the right channels. The Labour Directorate, by virtue of resolution No.  of  July , declared that the union was taken over.
.The communication from the Ministry of Justice and Labour states that the taking over was carried out without interference by the administrative authorities, this task being entrusted to the C.P.T, to which the union was affiliated, and that it was this Federation that had appointed the committee of administration. The administrators' report stated that there had been irregular administration and mismanagement of the funds of the union, which had lost all authority and control over its members. For these reasons, the administrators convened a general assembly, with all the necessary formalities, at which the members appointed their officers freely and democratically without any coercion.
.The Ministry states categorically that there was no interference by the labour authorities in the assembly. It says that those who complained that force had been used to impose the election of sham trade union leaders were not telling the truth, since it was the Federation to which the union belonged that has been entrusted with its administration, and that there was no truth in the accusation that the labour authorities had ordered the imprisonment of the union leaders, such a measure being outside their powers.
.The Ministry of Justice and Labour states that reports obtained from the National Directorate of Technical Affairs of the Ministry of the Interior indicate that the workers Mauro Ramirez Arias, Cecilio Rojas Bedoya, Antonio Pereira Ayala and Csar Rufino Bedoya had been arrested on  January  for questioning in connection with the commission of subversive activities in the San Antonio area, and that they had been released on  January. On  January, the date of the assembly, no worker of the Cold Store was still under detention.
.The Government asserts that labour-management relations are now fully normal. It also denounces "" pseudo-union activities of a communist nature that are carried on in the name of Christian democracy in all the freely functioning unions, with the obvious purpose of destroying and dividing the working class "".Allegations relating to the Arrest of Union Leaders
.The Committee takes note of the Government's statement that no leader of the union in question has been arrested at the",1,1967,Paraguay
155,"personality has been denied to the C.S.T.C.Allegations relating to the Violation of Trade Union Premises
.In its communication of  April  the W.F.T.U claims that on  March  extensive acts of repression were carried out against the workers' and people's movement on the pretext of alleged national subversion. It is alleged that the offices of the departmental trade union federations and of many primary trade union organisations were broken into, their files and libraries sacked and even some legal documents confiscated.
.As the Government has not presented its observations on these particular allegations, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to request the Government to be good enough to furnish its observations thereon.Allegations relating to the Detention of Trade Union Leaders
.The W.F.T.U claims in its communication of  April  that the Government has arrested and imprisoned, in a manner irregular from the legal point of view, numerous trade union leaders, including  who are named in the complaint. The complaint from FEDETTOL refers in a more general way to the imprisonment of about  leaders of petroleum and agricultural workers' unions on the sole ground of having made, on behalf of their members, such claims as it is the duty of every trade union to press.
.With regard to these allegations, the Government places the arrests in the context of the insurrectionary movement in Colombia and the various forms it has taken.
.The Government adds that all the arrests were carried out strictly in accordance with procedure, with all the usual formalities, and that great care was taken, both in the arrest and in the subsequent detention, to respect the dignity of the persons concerned.
.The Government goes on to indicate that some of the arrested persons were in custody for between  and  hours, others from three to eight days and that the longest detention lasted barely more than a month.
.The Committee wishes to recall that it has pointed out in previous cases, in which it was alleged that trade union officers or members had been preventively detained, that measures of preventive detention may involve a serious interference with the exercise of trade union rights which it would seem necessary to justify by the existence of a serious emergency and which would be open to criticism unless accompanied by adequate judicial safeguards applied within a reasonable period, and that it should be the policy of every government to take care to ensure the observance of human rights and especially the right of all detained persons to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment. Noting, however, that the Government has stated that all the detained persons have been released and that all the regular procedures were complied with, the Committee does not consider that it would serve any useful purpose to pursue the examination of this aspect of the case.
.Accordingly, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.Allegations relating to the Denial of Legal Personality to the C.S.T.C.
.The complainants allege that, by Resolution No.  of  March , the Ministry of Labour denied legal personality to the C.S.T.C, contrary to the provisions of the national Constitution and of the Labour Code and in flagrant violation of the generally accepted principle whereby trade union organisations have the right to establish national Confederations.
.It is claimed that the request was first made in May  at a constituent Congress of the Confederation and that the Government refused on that occasion to grant legal personality. Subsequently, following a Congress in July , the request was repeated. The complainants claim that all the legal conditions for the recognition of legal personality had been fulfilled, including the communication to the Ministry of Labour of all the necessary documentation. They allege that the real reason for the denial of legal personality to the C.S.T.C is based on ideological considerations, particularly on information supplied by the Political Police.
.In Resolution No.  of  April , which confirmed the Resolution of  March , the Government, it is alleged, put forward as a ground for its decision that the State cannot recognise an organisation the members of which commit acts against law and order, this being a reference, it is claimed, to the arrest of certain trade union leaders (referred to in paragraphs  to  above). The complainants claim that the request for the grant of legal personality was presented in July  and that, according to the Labour Code, the Minister was under an obligation to reply within a period of  days. The Government's decision, the complainants allege, was not, however, given until  March . According to the complainants, it was during this period between the date on which the Government should have replied to the application for recognition and the date of Resolution No.  that the Government carried out the arrests which were referred to in the Resolution as a ground for not granting legal personality. It is contended that these circumstances are clear evidence of violation of trade union rights.
.In its communication the Government declares that legal personality was denied to the C.S.T.C, firstly, because the requirements of section  of the Labour Code were not fulfilled and the proposed Constitution infringed section  of the Code.
.In addition, the Government gives the other reasons set out in the Resolution for the decision not to grant legal personality to the C.S.T.C. According to information from the State security organisation, Resolution No.  states, the aims of the C.S.T.C are contrary to the legally recognised trade union functions and are not in accordance with the prohibition embodied in section  (d) of the Labour Code, according to which trade unions of any type are prohibited from promoting or supporting campaigns or movements which tend to disregard, either collectively or through their members, legal precepts or action taken by the legitimate authorities. The Resolution goes on to state that certain members of the Executive Committee and of the member organisations of the C.S.T.C were in detention on suspicion of activities contrary to law and order.
.In view of the apparent contradiction between the complainants' assertion that all the legal requirements for recognition were complied with and the Government's observations according to which the requirements of sections  and  of the Labour Code were not fulfilled, the Committee considers that further information is required on this aspect of the case. In addition, the Committee has not sufficient information at its disposal concerning the additional grounds for the refusal of legal personality, referred to in paragraph  above.
.Accordingly, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to request the Government to be good enough to furnish more detailed information on the infringement of sections  and  of the Labour Code by the C.S.T.C and on the various activities which, according to Resolution No. , constituted an additional justification for the refusal to grant legal personality to the C.S.T.C.
.In these circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to decide, for the reasons stated in paragraph  above, that the allegations relating to the detention of trade union leaders do not call for further examination;(b) to request the Government to be good enough to furnish its observations on the allegations relating to the violation of trade union premises;(c) with regard to the allegations relating to the denial of legal personality to the C.S.T.C, to request the Government to be good enough to furnish more detailed information on the infringement of sections  and  of the Labour Code by the C.S.T.C and on the various activities which, according to Resolution No.  of  March , constituted an additional justification for the refusal to grant trade union personality to the C.S.T.C.;(d) to take note of this interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report once it has received the observations and information requested in subparagraphs (b) and (c) above.",0,1967,Colombia
156,".The Committee previously examined this case at its meeting in May , when it reached certain final conclusions on the case as a whole, which are contained in its th Report, which was approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session (May-June ).
.On  June  the National Labour Congress of Uruguay submitted a communication in which it presented a series of observations on the basis of which it requested that the case be reconsidered. This communication having been transmitted to the Government of Uruguay, the latter replied by a letter dated  August .
.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.On other occasions, the Committee has considered that it could not reopen a case which it had already examined in substance and on which it had submitted final recommendations to the Governing Body, except where new evidence was adduced and brought to its notice.
.The Committee recalls that, according to the allegations contained in the original complaints, the General Council of the Permanent Congress for Trade Union Unity of the Workers of Latin America (C.P.U.S.T.A.L.) was due to be held in Montevideo from  August to  September  on the invitation of the National Labour Congress of Uruguay (C.N.T.), to discuss problems of trade union unity in Latin America and to start a study of social security in the region. According to the same allegations, the C.N.T had obtained permission from the Government to hold this meeting and visas had been granted to the national delegations which were due to attend. Nevertheless, on  August , the Government issued a decree forbidding the meeting. Some participants who had arrived in the country to attend the meeting were detained and expelled from Uruguay. With regard to the specific purpose of the meeting, it had also been alleged that its main aim was to analyse the possibility of forming a continent-wide trade union organisation, thus furthering the work begun in Brasilia in , when the Congress for Trade Union Unity was formed. The agenda comprised a review of the work accomplished by the Secretariat and of the state of organisation of the trade union movement in Latin America. The complainants maintained that the Government had violated Convention No. , which refers to the right to establish federations, as well as the legislation of Uruguay, which guarantees freedom of association and the right of assembly.
.In its reply, the Government had stated that in banning the above-mentioned meeting it acted in accordance with the relevant Constitutional and statutory standards. It referred to the fact that the Government was empowered to grant or refuse the necessary permission for the holding of any meeting aimed at making demonstrations or criticisms in favour of or against the policy of a foreign State or its international position or its actions as an entity under international Law (section , Act. No.  of  July ). The Government maintained that it had respected the Constitutional provision which guarantees the right of assembly but which, at the same time, authorises the Government, in accordance with the law, to restrict this right in order to guarantee safety and public order. In deciding to impose the ban, the Government took into account the background and circumstances of the case; viz. the political aim of the meeting, the affiliations of the delegates, the links between this meeting and the decisions concerning internal subversion and the violent overthrow of governments, embodied in the resolutions of the Havana Tri-Continental Conference, and the need for strict compliance with the State's international obligations. The Government had also explained in its reply that permission to hold the meeting had never been applied for or obtained and that no entry visas into the country had been granted, since in any case such visas were not necessary for Latin American citizens. None of the foreign delegates had been detained but as the meeting could not be held they were informed that they should leave the country. The Government stated that no Uruguayan trade union organisation had requested the repeal of the measure and maintained that Convention No.  did not apply to this case, which involved the prohibition of a meeting of foreign representatives on national territory.
.In examining the information submitted by the complainants and by the Government, the Committee noted the contradiction between the information supplied by the two parties. It also recalled the importance it had always attached to the fact that the authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict the right to hold trade union meetings or impede the lawful exercise thereof, but considered that in the present case the actual point at issue appeared to be the sovereign right of a country to grant or refuse entry to foreigners wishing to come into it. In this connection it pointed out that it was not called upon to deal with the general question of the status of aliens, which was not covered by international Conventions, and it referred to another case in which it had decided not to examine certain allegations that the authorities of a country had refused visas to the workers' delegates of a foreign trade union organisation, thus preventing them from taking part in a trade union congress held on territory which was then under the jurisdiction of these authorities. The Committee consequently recommended the Governing Body to decide that this case called for no further examination.
.In its latest communication, the National Labour Congress of Uruguay maintains that the real point at issue was not that stated by the Committee but recognition by the Government of the right of assembly since, according to the Government, it was indispensable to obtain official authorisation in order to exercise this right. According to the complainants this criterion is a contradiction of article  of the Constitution, which guarantees the right of peaceful assembly without arms, which shall not be denied by any authority in the Republic except by virtue of a law and only when public health, safety and order are threatened "". Act No.  of  June  regulates this Constitutional provision and does not stipulate that prior authorisation must be obtained in order to exercise the right of assembly. On the other hand, the complainants maintain that Act. No.  of  July , to which the Government referred, is unconstitutional according to national legal theory and case law.
.Repeating what it had already stated with regard to the aim of the meeting which was to be held, the complainants reject the Government's argument that the measure was adopted to meet the need of guaranteeing public order, being confined to banning a subversive meeting. They maintain in this respect that neither the intentions of the organisers nor the items on the agenda of the meeting gave the Government any justification for considering, as stated in the preamble to the decree banning the meeting, that "" it is undesirable in the present circumstances to allow the said meeting to take place in the light of the proclamation of insurrection issued by the recent Havana Congress and the repercussions which such a meeting might have on the relations maintained by the Republic with other countries of the continent "".
.The complainants refer in this respect to the opinion expressed by the I.L.O. working party set up in Uruguay (with tripartite membership and advisory informative functions). On  December  this working party sent a memorandum to the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, in response to the Government's request for a report. It was stated in this memorandum that "" only in the event of a breach of the law, that is to say when legal grounds can be invoked, is there any justification for the restriction of a right as widely recognised as the right of assembly of trade union organisations and Confederations. The members of the working party consider that the text of the resolution of  August, as published in the official gazette, invokes no legal grounds which might justify the curtailment of freedom of association, as constituted by the banning of a meeting of the type planned "".
.In its reply, the Government states that it wishes to raise no objection to further discussion of this case or to its being studied in all its aspects. It repeats its respect for trade union rights, in accordance with the national and international provisions which govern them with a view to ensuring their effectiveness within the public order upheld by the law. The Government points out that although the complainants have put forward no new facts in their communication, it wishes to make a number of observations on certain statements contained therein.
.With regard to the resolution of  August , the Government states that Act No. , under which the resolution was issued, is a provision currently in force in the country which the Government is obliged to apply. This Act",-1,1967,Uruguay
157,".This case was first examined by the Committee at its session in May  (th Report, paragraphs -), at which it submitted interim conclusions to the Governing Body and recommended the Governing Body to request further observations from the Government concerning one aspect of the case, namely that of the non-admission of trade unionists to the Committee for the revision of the Labour Code (th Report, paragraph  (b)).
.The case was again examined by the Committee at its sessions in February , May , November , February , May , November , February , at each of which the Committee decided to adjourn its examination of the case since the Government's observations on the above matter had not been received. In a communication dated  March  the Government communicated its observations on this question.
.Panama has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.With regard to the outstanding allegation that trade unionists had not been allowed to participate in government committees set up for the purpose of the revision of the Labour Code, the Government states in its communication that it does not consider it appropriate to justify the reasons which the authorities may have had when they took this attitude, since none of the officials concerned takes any part in the governmental work of the present revolutionary Government. The Government adds that its policy has, at all times, been aimed at ensuring a harmonious and balanced participation by all sectors of the economy in any action taken which affects their interests. It points out that, when work was resumed on the study of the draft Labour Code, all trade union organisations were asked to make their comments so that these could be considered seriously before a final decision was taken. In this connection the Government encloses with its communication a copy of a letter dated  February  addressed to the trade union organisations requesting their opinion on the draft Labour Code.
.While the refusal of a government to permit or encourage the participation of trade union organisations in the preparation of new legislation or regulations affecting their interests would not necessarily constitute an infringement of trade union rights, the Committee would point out that the principle of consultation, and co-operation between public authorities and employers' and workers' organisations at the industrial and national levels is one to which importance should be attached. In this connection, attention can be drawn to the provisions of the Consultation (Industrial and National Levels) Recommendation, , (No. ), Paragraph  (b) of which provides that "" such consultation and cooperation should aim, in particular, at ensuring that the competent public authorities seek the views, advice and assistance of employers' and workers' organisations in an appropriate manner, in respect of such matters as the preparation and implementation of laws and regulations affecting their interests."" In the present case, the Committee has noted the Government's statement that all trade union organisations have been consulted on the question of the revision of the Labour Code, and, in the circumstances, recommends the Governing Body to decide that the allegation relating to the non-admission of trade unionists to committees for the revision of the Labour Code, and consequently the case as a whole, do not call for further examination.

.The Committee had reached a number of final conclusions on the complaint submitted by the United Unions of Workers in the State Oil Industry, contained in paragraph  of its th Report. After this Report had been communicated to the Government and to the complainants, the latter sent a further communication on  July , in which they made observations on specific aspects of the case. After the Government had been informed of those parts of the communication which contained new points concerning the exercise of trade union rights, it furnished its comments in a letter dated  November .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its observations on the original complaint presented by the complainants, the Government had stated (see paragraph  of the th Report) that its respect for Convention No.  had been demonstrated by its promulgation of Act No.  of  (respecting the organisation of labour in state undertakings), which provided for the introduction of methods and systems of rationalisation with the participation of the unions. As a result of this Act, the Government stated, the organisations concerned played a direct part in rationalising state undertakings, and it was the United Unions of Workers in the State Oil Industry which had signed the first rationalisation agreement under the terms of the Act. In its conclusions the Committee recommended the Governing Body to take note of this fact.
.In their subsequent communication, the complainants stated that the effect of Act No.  was to compel the unions of workers in state undertakings to discuss changes in the existing systems of work, to impose the agenda for negotiations and to reserve for the Government the right to arbitrate without benefit of appeal. Any unions which refused to discuss work systems on the terms laid down in the Act would be obliged to accept regulations drawn up unilaterally by the Secretary of State for Labour, "" all of which constitutes a further infringement of Convention No.  "". The complainants add that Act No.  is a coercive measure since it does not allow collective bargaining to take its natural course. They point out that "" in the atmosphere of social disquiet existing in our country, and having no legal support whatsoever, our organisation chose the lesser evil, that is to say of going to the conference table as provided under Act No. , in the hope of avoiding a unilateral enforcement of a system of work which, by any standards, would be aimed at undermining all the social gains won over years of trade union activity "".
.The Government replied to these arguments by stating that Act No.  was passed "" as a consequence of the undeniable need to give state undertakings adequate means of improving methods of work and of making full use of them, in order to attain the highest possible output from their human resources and to fulfil the operational requirements of each undertaking at high levels of production and efficiency "". The Government also refers to the machinery introduced by the Act, whereby the managements of state undertakings must inform the Secretary of State for Labour of their rationalisation requirements, whereupon collective bargaining is begun with the unions representing the workers concerned. This bargaining is designed to secure "" the determination of methods of work adapted to the requirements of efficiency and economy "". In order to overcome differences of opinion that may arise between the parties during collective bargaining, provision is made for arbitration.
.The Government adds that the negotiations which took place in compliance with Act No.  were completely free and that the complainant organisation negotiated of its own free will, no recourse being made to the special arbitration procedure provided under the Act. As regards the allegation concerning the unilateral imposition of conditions of work by the Government, this applies only to a specific branch when no trade union organisation exists to negotiate directly.
.The Committee observes, in the light of the text of Act No. , that this applies to state undertakings, state-owned undertakings, joint state-privately-owned undertakings and the electricity and telephone companies, which must formulate their requirements in the field of the rationalisation of labour (section ). Once it has been informed of these requirements, the Secretariat of State for Labour passes them on to the relevant trade union organisations for them to submit their observations (section ). Having heard the parties, the Secretariat decides the points that should be settled by collective bargaining, which must not take more than  days (section ). Points on which no agreement is reached during the bargaining procedures must be submitted to the arbitration of the Secretary of State for Labour, whose award is not subject to appeal (section ). If any of the trade union organisations does not accept the procedure or withdraws from it, the Secretariat must prepare a draft work scheme for the undertaking concerned, which is then submitted to the Executive for approval. In cases where the need for the introduction of a new set of working methods and the characteristics of the existing trade union situation involve a new approach, which hinders the bargaining procedure that has been instituted, the working conditions to be, applied will be established by the Executive (section ).
.The Committee considers that the use of collective bargaining for the purpose of settling problems of rationalisation in undertakings and improving their efficiency may yield valuable results for both the workers and the undertakings. There are examples of this in various countries where certain conditions of employment have been regulated through collective bargaining in the light of rationalisation needs.
.The Committee notes that in the present case this type of collective bargaining has to follow a special pattern which amounts to imposing bargaining on the trade organisations; this bargaining in fact has to bear on those aspects determined by the labour authority; the period of negotiation must not exceed a specified time; and failing agreement between the parties, the points at issue must be settled by arbitration by the said authority. In the Committee's opinion this statutory system does not conform to the principle of voluntary negotiation. This, however, is the guiding principle of Article  of Convention No. , ratified by Argentina, whereby measures appropriate to national conditions must be taken, when necessary, to encourage and promote the full development and utilisation of machinery for voluntary negotiation with a view to the regulation of terms and conditions of employment by means of collective agreement.
.In the circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body (a) to draw the Government's attention to the considerations and the principles outlined in the preceding paragraph and to suggest that it review its legislation with a view to bringing it into line with the provision contained in Article  of Convention No. ; and (b) to bring these conclusions to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.
.The complaint from the United Unions of Workers in the State Oil Industry is contained in a communication dated  October  and sent directly to the I.L.O. The communication was referred to the Government, which furnished its observations through the Permanent Mission of the Argentine Republic accredited to the international organisations at Geneva on  April .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee observes that the complainants state that the Act runs counter to various international standards relating to the work of seafarers, and that they criticise a series of changes made in the labour system in force for seafarers. They allege, in addition, that in promulgating Act No.  the Government has infringed the right to voluntary collective bargaining laid down in Convention No. . The Committee feels that it is not called upon to consider amendments made in national labour legislation unless they affect the exercise of trade union rights, but it is prepared, on the other hand, to examine the manner in which such amendments are imposed, taking into account in this instance the fact that the complainants state that the Government failed to consult the trade union organisations and overlooked the standards laid down in collective agreements. As regards the new provisions which concern the exercise of trade union rights, the Committee observes that section  of Act No.  lays down that agreements concluded between the parties concerned which alter the manning of ships shall not be valid.
.The action taken by the Argentine Government raises questions which have to be considered in the light",2,1967,Argentina
159,".The complaint of the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions (I.F.C.T.U.) is contained in a communication dated  October . It was transmitted to the Government of El Salvador, which forwarded its observations on  September .
.El Salvador has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The I.F.C.T.U's communication was in the form of a cable in which it requested urgent I.L.O. intervention with the Government of El Salvador to secure the release of automobile transport workers who had been arrested and to put a stop to the alleged use of violence against them by the police. Upon receipt of this communication the complaining organisation's attention was drawn to its right to submit further information in substantiation of its complaint within one month, and since the allegations-although couched in vague terms-concerned the detention of workers, the Government was asked to send its observations on the matter.
.In its communication the Government states that it deplores the accusation made by the I.F.C.T.U, which calls in question the Government's respect for human rights as regards the exercise of freedom of association in El Salvador. The Government points out that the accusation is vague and imprecise and that it has no knowledge of the events in question, and would need further information from the complainants before being able to comment upon the matter.
.The Committee observes that, despite the length of time which has elapsed, the complainants have failed to supply further information in substantiation of their complaint, and hence have failed to furnish sufficient proof that there has been, as they allege, violation of trade union rights.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that the case does not call for further examination.",1,1967,El Salvador
160,".These three cases were last examined by the Committee at its session in November  (th Report, paragraphs  to ), when the Committee submitted to the Governing Body an interim report containing the Committee's conclusions on certain aspects of the case which remained outstanding at that time. The Committee also recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to supply additional information concerning certain other aspects of the case (paragraph  (b) and (c) of the th Report).
.The aspects of the case concerning which the Committee recommended the Governing Body to request additional information were the trial or exile of certain trade unionists in , and the events which occurred in  during which workers were killed. In particular, the Committee had noted that certain trade unionists, namely Mr. Lechin Oquendo, Mr. Quispe, Mr. Pimentel and Mr. Reyes, who had been charged with common law offences, were awaiting trial, and the Government was requested to supply information on the results of the proceedings instituted against these four persons. The Government was also requested to inform the Governing Body, as soon as possible, of the position before the law of the trade unionists who, according to the complainants, were exiled in , as well as on their possibility of legally re-entering the country. The Committee had occasion, at its session in February  (th Report, paragraphs  to ) to examine the case concerning Mr. Lechin Oquendo in the context of Case No. , since the Government had supplied certain information regarding this person. It will be recalled that the Committee, in view of the information received, recommended the Governing Body to decide that, subject to the further examination of the proceedings against Mr. Lechin Oquendo in the present cases, this aspect of the case did not call for further examination. As regards the events of  in which workers were killed, the Committee recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to keep it informed of the results of the judicial investigation ordered by the Government and to supply the text of the judgment in the case against Mr. Chacn (a trade union leader against whom proceedings were instituted in respect of various offences), together with the grounds for this judgment.
.At its various sessions since November  the Committee adjourned its examination of these cases since the Government had not supplied all the information requested.
.Bolivia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In a communication addressed to the Director-General of the ILO by the Government dated  December , the Government stated that the revolutionary government which came into power on  September  adopted certain measures which were of relevance in assessing the trade union situation. These measures, the Government stated, were as follows: (a) no persons were in prison for reasons of political or trade union activities; (b) the Chancellery of the Republic had been instructed to authorise ambassadors to issue visas to any citizens now outside the country for political reasons and wishing to return; (c) the Minister of the Interior had also received instructions to expedite the trials of any persons against whom legal proceedings had been instituted under previous regimes.
.The Committee feels bound to express its concern that in spite of repeated requests to the Government for information concerning the cases of Mr. Lechin Oquendo, Mr. Quispe, Mr. Pimentel, Mr. Reyes and Mr. Chacn, this information has not yet been communicated by the Government. The Committee likewise expresses its concern that the Government has so far failed to supply the information requested concerning the outcome of the judicial investigation into the events of June  in which workers were killed. In the absence of such information, the Committee finds itself unable to reach definitive conclusions regarding these aspects of the complaints. The Committee wishes to recall in this connection that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact. This purpose cannot readily be achieved unless co-operation is obtained from both complainants and governments in the communication of information either to substantiate or refute specific allegations, thus enabling the Committee to arrive at definitive conclusions in each case.
.Furthermore, the Committee wishes to recall that on several occasions it has emphasised the importance which it attaches to the principle of prompt and fair trial by an independent and impartial judiciary in all cases, including cases in which trade unionists are charged with political or criminal offences which the government considers have no relation to their trade union functions. The Committee also points out that the communication of the texts of judgments given in such cases and the grounds on which these are based provide useful information enabling the Committee to reach its conclusions in full knowledge of the facts.
.In all the circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to take note of the Government's statement that instructions have been given authorising ambassadors to issue visas to any citizens now outside the country for political reasons and wishing to return;(b) to draw the attention of the Government to the principles expressed in paragraph  above regarding the observance of the right of trade unionists to receive a prompt and fair trial, and the communication of the texts of judgments to the Committee;(c) to express serious regret that, in spite of repeated requests for information concerning Mr. Lechin Oquendo, Mr. Quispe, Mr. Pimentel, Mr. Reyes and Mr. Chacn, as well as the results of the judicial investigation into the events of June  in which workers were killed, this information has not been received, which prevents the Committee from reaching definite conclusions regarding these aspects of the case;(d) to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that the purpose of the whole procedure of the Committee on Freedom of Association is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and that this purpose cannot be readily achieved unless co-operation is obtained both from complainants and governments in the communication of information either to substantiate or to refute specific allegations, thus enabling the Committee to arrive at definitive conclusions in each case.
.These three cases have already been examined at previous meetings of the Committee, when it submitted to the Governing Body a number of interim reports containing the Committee's conclusions on various aspects of the questions raised.
.This report refers only to those aspects which are still outstanding and on which the Governing Body, at the Committee's recommendation, had requested certain additional observations and information from the Government.
.In a communication dated  July  the Government replied to these requests.
.Bolivia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In these circumstances, with regard to these cases as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the allegations concerning the dissolution of trade unions, to note the information supplied by the Government, according to which, on the one hand, the provision-called in question by the complainants-whereby sabotage was included in the grounds for dissolving trade unions has been repealed, and, on the other hand, by virtue of a decree of  trade union organisations can only be dissolved through a court, and to decide that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination;(b) with regard to the allegations concerning the arrest or exile of trade unionists in :(i) to note the fact that Mr. Ortiz, against whom legal action was being taken, was released under an amnesty;(ii) to reaffirm the importance which it attaches to ensuring adequate safeguards in order to prevent compulsory residence measures from being used as a means of impairing the free exercise of trade union rights;(iii) to note the information supplied by the Government according to which the majority of the persons named in the complaints had neither been arrested nor imprisoned and only Mr. Lechn Oquendo, Mr. Quispe, Mr. Pimentel and Mr. Reyes are awaiting trial, charged with common law offences, and to request the Government to be good enough to keep it informed of the results of the proceedings instituted against these four persons;(iv) to request the Government to be good enough to inform it as soon as possible of the position before the law of the trade unionists who, according to the complainants, were exiled in , as well as on their possibilities of legally re-entering the country;(c) with regard to the allegations concerning the events of June , in which workers were killed, to request the Government to be good enough:(i) to keep it informed of the results of the judicial investigation as soon as this has been concluded;(ii) to supply the text of the judgment in the case against Mr. Chacn, together with the grounds for this judgment, as",0,1967,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
161,"soon as it is passed;(d) with regard to the allegations concerning the occupying of trade union premises and the closing down of trade union radio transmitting stations:(i) to take note of the Government's statement to the effect that the trade union premises which had been temporarily occupied have now been restored to the workers;(ii) to decide, subject to the principles and considerations set forth in paragraphs  to  above, that the allegation concerning the closing down of radio transmitting stations does not call for further examination;(e) to take note of this interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report as soon as it has received the additional information requested from the Government in this paragraph.
.The complaints are contained in communications from the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions (C.L.A.S.C.), the World Federation of Trade Unions (W.F.T.U.) and the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions (I.F.C.T.U.) dated  June,  July and  July  respectively, which were sent directly to the I.L.O. In a communication dated  August  the C.L.A.S.C made new allegations relating to the case. All of these communications were transmitted to the Government.
.By a communication dated  July  the Secretariat of the Latin American Workers' Permanent Congress for Trade Union Unity submitted allegations concerning the same questions as those referred to by the organisations mentioned in paragraph  above. In a letter dated  July  the Director-General requested the said Secretariat to state whether the Latin American Workers' Permanent Congress for Trade Union Unity has any affiliates in Bolivia. Despite the time that has passed since then, this letter has remained unanswered.
.In a communication dated  September  the Government sent its observations relating to the complaints, the texts of which had been transmitted to it.
.Bolivia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but has not ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  June  the C.L.A.S.C asked the I.L.O to intervene in order to obtain the release of a miners' leader, Mr. Waldo Tarqui, and other trade union leaders who, it stated, had been imprisoned. In its communication of  August  the C.L.A.S.C stated that Mr. Waldo Tarqui (trade union leader at the San Jos mine), Mr. Constancio Apaza and Mr. Ren Cumgoza (trade union leaders at Catavi) were being held in a concentration camp and that Mr. Ren Chacn (trade union leader at Siglo XX), who had been arrested with the others on  June, had since been obliged to leave the country.
.The W.F.T.U, the I.F.C.T.U and the C.L.A.S.C, in their communications of  July,  July and  August  respectively, all state that military forces attacked the mineworkers in June . According to the I.F.C.T.U, a group of miners who, accompanied by their wives and children, were waiting for a workers' meeting to begin on  June were surprised by a military detachment which fired on them and killed a large number of people. It is further alleged that Mr. Tarqui, one of the leaders of the Bolivian Trade Union Action Movement, was arrested on that occasion. According to the W.F.T.U, the persons at the meeting on  June were strikers and  of them were killed and  wounded, while  trade union leaders were arrested.
.The complaints also refer to the alleged occupation of trade union premises and radio transmitting stations by the army. The I.F.C.T.U asserts that, far from improving, the situation of the Bolivian workers appears to be worsening owing in particular to the repressive measures taken "" by the military Government "".
.In its communication of  September  the Government states, "" in order to avoid distortion of the truth "", that, in view of indications of disturbances, the Government was compelled to declare a state of siege at the beginning of June, thus suspending individual rights and guarantees. It goes on to indicate that this preventive measure was not respected in the mining centres of Huanuni, Catavi and Siglo XX where subversive activity even increased. Some mining districts had declared themselves "" free territories "", which the Government describes as a false notion that led to resistance against legal measures and against the entry of the forces of order into the mining areas arbitrarily and unlawfully declared free.
.The Government continues by stating that the right to strike is embodied as a Constitutional right in Bolivia but that subversion disregards law and order, which was what happened on  and  June, since the entry of troops into the mining areas, on orders received from the authorities, was opposed by the agents of subversion, who "" immediately used firearms and caused casualties among the forces of order "", thus explaining the armed confrontation in which the troops "" answered force with force in justifiable self-defence "". The Government states that the regrettable casualties were the consequence of ideas and aims totally foreign to trade union interests and that several of those arrested have long since ceased to work in the mining centres of Catavi, Siglo XX and Huanuni and cannot therefore be considered as trade union members or leaders.
.The Government further states that trade union privilege does not protect acts which constitute offences under the Penal Code.
.The Government adds that the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, in accordance with its powers, is engaged in defending the legitimate rights of all workers and is at present devoting the utmost attention to improving the living conditions and legal protection of workers in the mining sector.
.The Government rejects the allegation contained in the complaints that it has violated trade union rights and democratic freedoms recognised by international Conventions. It also protests at the terms used in the complaints transmitted to it, which it considers improper.
.As regards this last point, the Committee wishes merely to point out, as it has done in other cases, that the character of the task entrusted to it demands that both governments and complainants should avoid using language calculated to embitter rather than to elucidate controversy and that, in replying to a request for observations on a complaint, a government is not acknowledging the propriety, still less the validity, of the complaint, but is simply co-operating with the Committee and the Governing Body in making possible an impartial examination of the matter.
.The Committee recalls that, in examining on a previous occasion Case No.  relating to Bolivia, it had before it allegations relating to similar events that had occurred in the Bolivian mining centres in May . On that occasion, on the basis of the evidence available (partly supplied by the same complainants), from which it appeared, inter alia, that the armed resistance movement accompanying the strike had exceeded the limits of strike action, the Committee did not consider that the measures adopted by the Government in order to overcome such resistance permitted any allegation of violation of trade union rights to be made in the case mentioned.
.In the present case, with regard to the serious events which, according to the complainants and the Government, did in fact take place in June , the Committee notes that, in answer to the complainants' allegation that a meeting of workers and members of their families was attacked by military forces, the Government replies that, at a time when a state of siege had been declared and Constitutional rights were therefore suspended, the miners had proclaimed "" free territories "" in certain districts and resisted the entry of the forces of order, opening fire on them.
.The question raised in the present case does not therefore appear to refer specifically to the strike but to the deaths and arrests alleged to have resulted from the intervention of the armed forces.
.In similar cases a in which it has been alleged that people have been killed when the police opened fire on strikers the Committee has recalled that, where the dispersal of public assemblies, etc., by the police on grounds of public order or similar grounds has involved loss of life, it attaches special importance to the circumstances being fully investigated by an immediate and independent special inquiry and to regular legal procedure being followed to determine the justification and responsibility for the action taken by the police.
.On the other hand, the Government has not sent any specific observations concerning the arrest of the four trade union leaders mentioned in the complaints and has merely stated that some of the persons arrested cannot be considered as trade union members or leaders, no longer being mineworkers. The Government's assertion, even if proved to be true, would not automatically imply that the persons in question can no longer be considered as trade union leaders if the workers had selected them as their leaders. When it examined on a previous occasion Case No.  relating to Bolivia r, the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, drew the Government's attention to the fact that certain",-1,1967,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
162,".The complaint of the World Federation of Trade Unions (W.F.T.U.) is contained in a letter of  April , sent directly to the I.L.O. This complaint having been passed on to the Government, the latter submitted its observations on the matter in a letter dated  October .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), as well as the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The W.F.T.U makes a certain number of allegations which will be examined separately below.
.Having noted the Government's observations, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that this aspect of the case, and consequently the case as a whole, calls for no further examination on its part.",-1,1967,Dominican Republic
163,".The complaints are contained in a telegram from the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions (I.F.C.T.U.) dated  February  and a communication from the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions dated  February . By a communication of  February  the LF.C.T.U supplied additional information concerning this case. All these communications were transmitted to the Government, which replied by a letter dated  March .
.Nicaragua has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The I.F.C.T.U alleges that the Government violently repressed trade union demonstrations organised in particular by the Independent Trade Union Movement of Nicaragua (MOSAN) when numerous trade union leaders were arrested. Both the I.F.C.T.U and the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions urgently request the I.L.O to intervene in favour of Mr. Edgar Macias Gmez, General Secretary of MOSAN, who, it is alleged, was arrested by the military police and disappeared as from  or  January .
.In its reply dated  March  the Government states that Mr. Macias is not only at liberty but is resident in Managua and carrying on his normal activities. The Government attached a newspaper cutting dated  February  reporting that on the previous day Mr. Macias had gone to the newspaper headquarters with another trade union leader to make certain statements concerning the murder of a trade unionist.
.With regard to the allegation of the I.F.C.T.U concerning the repression of trade union demonstrations, the Government states that it has no knowledge of any trade union demonstrations or violent repressive action on the part of the authorities, nor of any person detained on account of trade union activities. It adds that what took place in Managua on  January  was a political demonstration to support a presidential candidate, when the demonstrators, incited to revolt against the Government, attempted to take possession of police headquarters and killed an officer and two soldiers and wounded  others. The Government states that the measures taken by it averted a situation of bloody tragedy and that all the persons who took part in the revolt are now at liberty.
.As regards the allegations relating to the repression of trade union demonstrations and the arrest of trade unionists connected with such demonstrations, the Committee notes that the complaint does not supply such details as the date and place of the demonstrations or the reason for organising them, or the names of the persons arrested. The Government, on the other hand, states that nobody is at present detained on account of trade union activities and mentions a political demonstration which seems to have taken place a few days before the date of the complaint, the persons who took part in it now being at liberty. In view of these statements of the Government and the vagueness of the allegations presented, the Committee considers that this aspect of the case does not call for further consideration.
.As regards the allegations concerning the arrest of Mr. Macias the Committee notes the Government's statement which neither denies nor confirms the arrest of that trade unionist on the date given by the complainants but affirms that Mr. Macias is at liberty.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the allegations concerning the repression of trade union demonstrations and the arrest of trade unionists taking part therein to decide, for the reasons set forth in paragraph  above, that no useful purpose would be served by the further exanimation of these allegations;(b) as regards the particular case of Mr. Edgar Macias Gmez, General Secretary of the Independent Trade Union Movement of Nicaragua (MOSAN), who, according to the complainants, was arrested on  or  January , to take note of the Government's statement that this person is at liberty.",1,1967,Nicaragua
164,"provisions requiring that the election of trade union leaders should be subject to their being actively employed by the undertaking concerned and stating that a trade union leader should forfeit his right to office upon ceasing to be an employee of the undertaking were inconsistent with the right of all workers to elect their representatives in full freedom that is guaranteed by the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), which Bolivia has ratified.
.The Committee therefore considers it necessary to request the Government to provide specific observations as soon as possible with regard to the arrest of Mr. Waldo Tarqui, Mr. Constancio Apaza, Mr. Ren Cumgoza and Mr. Ren Chacn and, in particular, to state the present situation of those persons before the law.
.In conclusion, the Committee notes that the Government has made no observations regarding the allegations that the Government has occupied trade union premises and radio transmitting stations.
.In these circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to request the Government:(i) to inform it whether any investigation has been carried out, followed by due judicial proceedings, in order to determine the responsibility for the deaths which occurred during the events of June  to which the complaints refer, and, if so, to inform it of the results of such investigation;(ii) to furnish specific observations regarding the alleged arrest of the four trade union leaders named by the complainants and regarding the present situation of those persons before the law;(iii) to send its observations regarding the allegations mentioned in paragraph  above;(b) to take note of this interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report once it has received the supplementary information and observations requested from the Government in subparagraph (a) above.",-1,1967,Bolivia (Plurinational State of

.The complaint of the World Confederation of Labour is contained in three communications dated  December ,  December  and  January . The text of each of these communications was forwarded on receipt to the Government, which has made its observations on them in a communication dated  March .
.Bolivia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but not the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants alleged in a telegram dated  December  that Mr. Alejandro Barrisueta, a leader of the Bolivian Trade Union Action (ASIB), which is affiliated to the Latin American Confederation of Christian Trade Unionists, itself affiliated to the World Confederation of Labour, had been arrested and imprisoned at La Paz with other miners' leaders and held incommunicado.
.In a letter dated  January  the complainants give the following details concerning this aspect of the affair. Mr. Barrisueta and many other active trade unionists were arrested on  December ; on  December the ASIB applied for a writ of habeas corpus with a view to securing the release of Mr. Barrisueta, since all the other arrested workers had been released "" thanks to pressure by the workers, by various advanced elements in the country and by international organisations and to intervention by the Bolivian Catholic Church "".
.When the writ of habeas corpus had been applied for to secure the release of Mr. Barrisueta, the complainants go on the Bolivian authorities informed the ASIB that he had been banished to Ixiamas. "" The sole purpose of this measure "", the complainants asserted, "" was to avoid his appearing before the law courts.""
."" What is clear "", they continue, "" is that, according to the authorities, Mr. Barrisueta was released on the night of  December. The information we have received shows that he was subjected to severe physical torture during his imprisonment, but the most serious part of the affair is that his whereabouts are unknown. All the signs suggest that Mr. Barrisueta is being held by the police so that the lamentable physical state he has been placed in by the torture shall not be known. ""
.Another aspect of the case can be seen in the communication dated  December  from the complainant organisation, which gives information supplied to it by the ASIB. On the occasion of elections held in the Siglo XX mines, four groups were seeking the leadership of the union: the independents, the official list, the GRIT and the Christian Democrat Party. The representatives of the four groups appeared before the Regional Labour Inspector for the Llallagua district to establish an agreement that the winning group, whichever it might be, would be recognised by the Ministry of Labour in the exercise of its functions.
.The independents gained the election by a large majority, "" since it genuinely represents the mining working class, which has full confidence in its leadership "". It appears, however, that the agreement has been violated by the Government, through the Ministry of Labour, which refuses to recognise the managing committee and insists that the minority group, namely the official list, shall be incorporated in it to the extent of  per cent.
.The workers, according to the complainants, do not accept this arrangement and have taken many steps to have it annulled. All attempts at a peaceful settlement have been exhausted, all attempts to establish a dialogue and understanding with the Ministry of Labour have been useless, and the Ministry maintains its uncompromising position.
.The Government, in its observations, begins by stating that it is not unusual for professional agitators, working against the background of Castro-communist guerrilla warfare, to endeavour both inside and outside the country to cloak their subversive activities by making accusations before the international organisations concerning the violation of human and trade union rights in Bolivia. These procedures, the Government continues, are intended to maintain a persistent violation of the national laws and to create a climate of anarchy and chaos in the country.
.In reply to the allegations that have been made, the Government confines itself to stating that Mr. Barrisueta is not registered as an officer of any trade union organisation recognised in the country and that the ASIB has no legal existence, since it has no documents establishing its legal personality, a fact that excludes its assuming the right to represent the workers.
.The Government therefore ends by suggesting that the Committee should first determine the legal status of the ASIB and that it is only when the Government has seen the findings of the Committee in this connection that it will be able to deal officially with any request for information and observations.
.The Government, in its present observations, appears to suggest that, since the ASIB has no legal existence, the allegations contained in the present complaint are inadmissible.
.A first comment is called for. If, in the absence of recognition by the authorities or of registration-which itself may be the result of a failure by the organisation concerned or of a refusal by the authorities-or for any other reason, ASIB has no legal existence, it nevertheless has a de facto existence as borne out by its membership of an organisation affiliated to the complainant organisation.
.A second, even more important observation must be made. The complainant is not in fact the ASIB but the World Confederation of Labour, an organisation that has consultative status with the ILO and in relation to which no question of receivability can arise.
.In these circumstances-and in view of the extreme seriousness of some of the allegations made-the Committee considers that it ought to recommend the Governing Body:(a) to urge the Government to be good enough to reply without delay to the allegations that Mr. Barrisueta has been arrested and tortured and to state where he is at present;(b) to request the Government to be good enough to present its observations concerning the allegations analysed in paragraphs  to  above relating to the trade union elections carried out in the Siglo XX mines;(c) to request the complainant organisation to be good enough to give all relevant information concerning the trade union functions of Mr. Barrisueta;(d) to take note of this interim report, on the understanding that the Committee will submit a new report when it is in possession of the information specified in the three preceding subparagraphs.Geneva,  May . (Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.",-1,1968,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
166,"the education problem. As a result of these measures the teachers were obliged to re-register with the authorities if they wished to be reinstated and it seems that most of them were, in fact, re-employed for the following school year. According to the Government, no teachers have been persecuted or deported.
.The Committee notes the complainant's request that the right to engage in collective bargaining be restored to the teachers. In the light of the principles contained in Convention No. , the Committee would like to draw attention to the desirability of promoting voluntary collective bargaining, according to national conditions, with a view to the regulation of terms and conditions of employment. If the parties cannot come to any agreement during this procedure and if the right to strike is denied to certain categories of workers (as it is in Bolivia to public servants), the Committee has always considered that adequate guarantees should be afforded to the workers concerned in order fully to safeguard their interests, such as adequate, impartial and rapid conciliation and arbitration proceedings in which those concerned may participate at all stages. The Committee is of the opinion that had these procedures been followed in the present case the consequences of the dispute arising out of the teachers' claims might have been avoided or, at least, considerably attenuated.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:
.The complaints are contained in a communication sent to the ILO by the Bolivian National Trade Union Committee for the Defence of Workers' Rights on  October , and in a communication sent to the ILO on  February  by the Confederation of American Teachers. The texts of these complaints were referred to the Government of Bolivia, which in a communication dated  January , sent in certain preliminary observations on the first of the two complaints.
.Bolivia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but has not ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The National Trade Union Committee for the Defence of Workers' Rights states in its communication of  October  that it was set up "" as a result of the dissolution of the Bolivian Workers' Confederation by administrative authority, through the decree issued by the Governing Military Junta on  May  "". It states that as far as trade union matters are concerned, certain decisions taken by the Junta (which remained in power until August ) are still in force. Presidential decrees, promulgated in May and June , had ordered the reorganisation of trade unions, cancelled the mandate of all persons holding office in any trade union, federation, Confederation, or central workers' organisation and provided that for trade union elections to be valid they must be presided over by a representative of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security and by the civil or military authority of the district. Once the provisions of these decrees had been met, the trade union executive committees which were thus elected were to be recognised by separate Ministerial Orders. Candidates for election to trade union office were required to submit their candidature together with a statement of their qualifications to the Ministry ten days before the date of the election. By these measures, the complainants declare, the Government disregarded the existence of the trade union organisations, interfered in their internal matters and selected candidates for trade union office. It is alleged that this interference placed the workers' organisations under the Government's supervision and absolute control.
.The complaint states that on the basis of such provisions the Government, by decrees issued in May and June , and by a decree issued on  September , took the following specific measures: withdrawal of recognition from the Bolivian Workers' Confederation as well as from the branch Confederations, federations and trade unions; withdrawal of recognition from the Federation of Bolivian Mineworkers' Unions; confiscation of all trade union property; reduction of wages for the miners employed by the Mining Corporation of Bolivia; imprisonment, banishment and persecution of trade union leaders, "" many of whom "", like certain miners employed by the Bolivian Mining Corporation, "" do not know, even today, the reason for their imprisonment ""; measures of violence against the working population of Sora Sora, Siglo XX, Huanuni, Animas-Chocaya and Quechisla, culminating in the massacre which took place on  June , in Catavi; and the mass dismissal of , teachers.
.The complainants go on to say that on  September  new trade union regulations were issued by decree, which at present govern the whole of trade union life in Bolivia and violate not only ILO Conventions but also the law of the land, including Constitutional provisions. In accordance with the decree, they add, the Ministry of Labour "" shall exercise over-all guidance over the trade union organisations without prejudice to freedom of action ""; the legal personality of every trade union organisation shall be obtained by means of an order signed by the President of the Republic; elected officers must be "" recognised by name by the Government by means of a special Ministerial Order "". The decree limits the authority of trade unions to spend their own funds to the amount of , Bolivian pesos (the equivalent of $). Trade union officials must be Bolivian by birth, have worked at least six months in the undertaking, and cannot be on the committee of any political party. The complainants further criticise the system provided in the decree for the composition of trade union executive committees.
.The complainants take the view that such provisions infringe Articles , , , ,  and  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), since they prevent the Constitution of trade union organisations except with the prior authorisation, control and supervision of the Ministry; and since the authorities are empowered to recognise trade union officers and interfere in the drawing up of the Constitutions and rules and in the establishment of federations, Confederations and central workers' organisations, by restricting their number or directly depriving them of recognition. Furthermore, job security is not guaranteed to workers whose term of trade union office has expired, who are often subjected to slanderous accusations of crime, persecuted and banished.
.Finally, the complainants maintain that the stated conditions considerably affect trade union life in the country, since the Government, in addition to interfering in trade union organisation, has seized the miners' radio transmitters and the premises of the unions, and frozen union funds in bank accounts. They urge that the ILO send a committee to investigate their complaints.
.The complaint summarised above is signed by the President and Secretary of the National Trade Union Committee for the Defence of Workers' Rights, and also by "" officers of the national trade union organisations affiliated to this Committee "", namely the Federation of Oil Industry Workers, the Bolivian Printers' Federation, the Radio Workers' Union, the National Federation of Urban Schoolteachers, the National Confederation of Rural Schoolteachers, the La Paz Building Workers' Federation, and other bodies.
.In its complaint dated  February , the Confederation of American Teachers says that: "" the deplorable financial circumstances of Bolivian teachers are at the root of the protest movement in which the majority of the country's teachers have taken part "". Instead of meeting the teachers' legitimate demands for salary increases and improving their conditions of work, the Government, it is alleged, has ordered the dismissal of , teachers. It is further alleged that a "" Supreme Council for Education "" has been set up, which reports direct to the President and "" with which the teachers are obliged to re-register without their union being able to intervene in any way "". According to the complaint, this is a requirement imposed upon the dismissed teachers if they wish to have a chance to work the following year.
.It is alleged that the Government of Bolivia has taken a series of repressive measures against the leaders of the teachers' unions. The complainants state that the General Secretary of the National Federation of Urban Schoolmasters, Mr. R. Dvila Morales, and the Press Secretary of this Federation, Mr. A. Quiroz Elguera, have been expelled from the country.
.The Confederation of American Teachers, which has stated that it has affiliated organisations in Bolivia (the National Educational Workers' Confederation and the Departmental Schoolteachers' Federation of La Paz), considers that the Government has infringed the provisions of Conventions Nos.  and . It hopes that ILO intervention will induce the authorities to quash the order for the dismissal of , teachers, to restore the right to bargain collectively and to put an end to "" the persecution of leaders of teachers' unions officially recognised by the administrative authorities of Bolivia "".
.So far, the Government has supplied only certain observations relating to the complaint lodged by the National Trade Union Committee for the Defence of Workers' Rights. In its communication dated  January  it asserts that the said Committee is",1,1968,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
167,".The complaint is contained in a communication dated  October , sent directly to the ILO by the Permanent Congress for Trade Union Unity of the Workers of Latin America, the headquarters of which are in Santiago de Chile.
.The Government furnished its observations in a communication dated  November .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee considers that, in any case, governments have the right to take the necessary measures to guarantee public order and national security, which includes ascertaining the purpose of visits to the country by persons against whom there are grounds for suspicion from this point of view. The present case concerns an official of an international trade union Organisation who apparently wished to exercise the right of contacting a national affiliated Organisation and taking part in its work, who had obtained a visa from the Costa Rican authorities and concerning whom certain rumours had arisen. The Committee considers that in order to avoid the danger of the above-mentioned right being restricted, the authorities should check up on each specific case as quickly as possible and should aim-on the basis of objective criteria-at ascertaining whether or not there exist facts which might have real repercussions on public order and security.
.Accordingly, the Committee recommends the Governing Body, as it did in another case, to point out to the Government that it would be desirable, in situations of this kind, to seek an agreement through appropriate discussions in which the authorities as well as the leaders and organisations concerned may clarify their positions.",1,1968,Costa Rica
168,"not a legally constituted trade union body and operates outside the laws of the country. Before these complaints can be investigated, therefore, in the Government's opinion, the complainants should provide the ILO Committee on Freedom of Association with convincing proof both of its lawful Constitution and legal personality "" which may entitle it to speak on behalf of the workers of the country "". The Government says that it is prepared to reply at greater length, if and when this point is cleared up.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to ask the Government to be good enough to send in its detailed comments on the substance of the complaints made in this case (as summarised in paragraphs  to  above), and to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report once the observations referred to above have been received.",0,1968,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
169,".The Committee has already submitted four interim reports on this case contained respectively in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, paragraphs  to  of its th Report, paragraphs  to  of its th Report and paragraphs  to  of its st Report.
.Bolivia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ); it has not, on the other hand, ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.There are already three interim reports by the Committee on this matter (th Report, paragraphs  to ; th Report, paragraphs  to ; and th Report, paragraphs  to ).
.Bolivia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but has not ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.When the Committee last considered this matter at its session in May , two series of allegations remained outstanding, namely those relating to the arrest of Mr. Barrisueta, a leader of Bolivian Trade Union Action (ASIB), and those concerning elections in the Siglo XX mines.
.Despite repeated requests by the Committee and Governing Body, the Government has not provided the information requested of it in connection with these allegations (which concern events that took place in ). Accordingly, at its session in November , the Committee urgently requested the Government to supply this information (th Report, paragraph ). No reply having been received to this request, the Committee, at its session in February , in accordance with the rule of procedure set forth in paragraph  of its th Report, informed the Government that it might submit a report on the substance of the case at the present session, even if the information asked for had not been received. To date, this information has still not been received.
.In the circumstances, the Committee considers that, before examining the allegations made, it would be appropriate to recall what it said as early as its First Report (paragraph ) namely: "" The purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and the Committee is confident that, if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side will recognise the importance for the protection of their own good name of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to such detailed factual charges as may be put forward "".Allegations concerning the Imprisonment of Mr. Barrisueta
.In a telegram dated  December , the plaintiffs had alleged that Alejandro Barrisueta, a leader of Bolivian Trade Union Action (ASIB), had been incarcerated at La Paz with other miners' trade union leaders, and held incommunicado. Later, in a communication dated  January , they explained that Alejandro Barrisueta had been arrested on  December  and that on the th of that month the ASIB had applied for a writ of habeas corpus with a view to obtaining his release, since in the meantime the other arrested persons had been released. Following this application, the authorities had informed the ASIB that Barrisueta had been banished to Ixiamas. "" What is clear "" add the complainants "" is that according to the authorities, comrade Barrisueta was released on the night of  December. The information we have received shows that he was subjected to severe physical torture during his imprisonment, but the most serious part of the affair is that his whereabouts are unknown. All the signs suggest that Barrisueta is being held by the police so that the lamentable state he has been placed in by the torture shall not be known.""
.In its first reply, the Government merely confined itself to stating that Mr. Barrisueta was not registered as an officer of any trade union organisation in the country. Later, it said that Mr. Barrisueta "" was detained only for  hours during investigation of the possibility of his having taken part in the murder of a citizen, which is a crime under ordinary law in accordance with the general legislation of all countries "".
.At its session in May , the Committee recommended the Governing Body to urge the Government to reply to the statements made in the complaint, especially that concerning the mistreatment inflicted upon Mr. Barrisueta, and to state the whereabouts of Mr. Barrisueta. At its session in February , and again for the last time at its session in May , the Committee made similar recommendations to the Governing Body.
.The Government has so far not provided the information requested.Allegations concerning Elections in the Siglo XX Mines
.In a communication dated  December , the complaining organisation, making use of information provided by the ASIB, stated that on the occasion of the elections held in the Siglo XX mines, four groups had been seeking leadership of the union: the Independents, the official list, the ORIT, and the Christian Democratic Party. The representatives of the four groups had appeared before the Regional Labour Inspector for the Llallagua District to establish an agreement under which the winning group, whichever it might be, would be recognised by the Ministry of Labour in the exercise of its functions. According to the complainants, there was a breach of the agreement after the elections (won by the Independents); the Ministry of Labour had refused to recognise it and had insisted that the losing party (the official list) "" which was to be incorporated in the leadership to the extent of  per cent "" should represent the minority groups. The workers had refused to accept that arrangement and despite all efforts it had proved impossible to reach a peaceful settlement since the Ministry of Labour maintained an uncompromising attitude.
.Despite repeated appeals to the Government for its comments on this aspect of the case, none have been forthcoming.
.The Committee is aware that, since the events alleged to have taken place, there have been several changes of government in Bolivia.
.In this connection, the Committee recalls the principle which it has always emphasised, namely that there exists a link of continuity between successive governments in the same State and that although a government cannot be held responsible for events which took place under a preceding one, it has a clear responsibility for any consequences which those events might have produced since its accession to power. Furthermore, should there be a change of government or political system in a country, the government of the day should take all the necessary steps to remedy any continuing effects which the events on which the complaint is based may have had since its accession to power, even though those events took place under its predecessor.
.With regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to take note of the fact that the political system in Bolivia has changed since the events referred to by the complainants in the allegations;(b) to recall the principle whereby there exists a link of continuity between successive governments in the same State and that, although a government cannot be held responsible for events which took place under a preceding one, it has a clear responsibility for any consequences which those events might have produced since its accession to power. Furthermore, should there be a change of government or political system in a country, the government of the day should take all the necessary steps to remedy any continuing effects which the events on which the complaint is based may have had since its accession to power, even though those events took place under its predecessor;(c) to recall the comment made by the Committee, as early as its First Report, to the effect that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and the Committee is confident that, if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side should recognise the importance for the protection of their own good name of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to such detailed factual charges as may be put forward;(d) to recall the principle that workers should have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom and that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof;(e) to recall the importance which should be attached to the principle that all arrested persons should be subject to normal judicial procedure in accordance with the principles enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and in accordance with the principle that it is a fundamental right of the individual that a detained person should be brought without delay before the appropriate judge, this right being recognised in such instruments as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man, and the American Convention of Human Rights;(f) to deplore the fact that, despite repeated requests, the Government has failed to provide information concerning allegations, some of which are of a particularly serious",-1,1968,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
170,"nature, since they refer to the torture of an arrested trade union leader, and that consequently, it has been impossible for the Committee to reach its conclusions on the matter in full knowledge of the facts; and(g) to request the Director-General to maintain all appropriate forms of contact with the Government in order to obtain the information requested from it concerning the fate of Mr. Barrisueta.
.The Committee examined this case at its session in May , when it submitted to the Governing Body an interim report, which appears in paragraphs  to  of its th report, as approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (May ). At its session in February  the Committee submitted to the Governing Body a further interim report, which appears in paragraphs  to  of its th report, as approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (March ).
.To enable it to continue its examination of the case the Committee recommended the Governing Body (paragraph  of its th report) to ask the Government, as a matter of urgency, to supply detailed information and observations with regard to the allegations relating to the imprisonment and banishment of Mr. Barrisueta, a leader of the Bolivian Trade Union Action (ASIB), and its observations on the facts alleged concerning the elections at the Siglo XX mines (paragraph  (e) and (f) of the th report). In a communication dated  February  the Government supplied further information relating to the case.
.Bolivia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but not the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its latest communication, the Government confines itself to outlining, in general terms, the improved status of the trade union movement since the revolutionary regime came to power in Bolivia on  October . The Government further states that there are, at present, no political or trade union prisoners in Bolivia, and that the anti-labour policy of dissolving the leadership in the mining and industrial centres which was carried out by previous regimes has been completely reversed. The Government includes in its communication a copy of another communication received by it from the Bolivian Workers' Confederation (COB), which makes reference to the complaint before the Committee and adds that, despite the systematic persecution under previous regimes, workers' associations were able to remain intact although their activities and influence were limited as a result of the attitude of these governments. The Government contends that the complaint submitted by the World Confederation of Labour should now be examined in the light of this statement since, in the opinion of the Government, it clearly shows the present position of the Bolivian trade union organisations.
.The Committee feels obliged to point out that one of the principles established in the procedure for the examination of alleged infringements of trade union rights is that, where precise allegations are made, the Committee cannot regard as satisfactory replies from governments which are confined to generalities. It also draws the attention of the Government to the principle established in earlier cases that, where a change of regime has taken place in a country, the new government should take all necessary steps to remedy any continuing effects which events complained of as having taken place under its predecessor may have had since its accession to power. In the present case, the Committee is of the opinion that, while the new government cannot be held responsible for the events which gave rise to the complaint, the effects of the events which gave rise to the allegations concerning the imprisonment of Mr. Barrisueta and the elections at the Siglo XX mines could, without information to the contrary, be of a continuing nature.
.The Committee recalls that Mr. Barrisueta was alleged to have been arrested on  December , subjected to severe physical torture and banished, and, in view of the nature of this allegation, the Committee requested the Government to supply, as a matter of urgency, detailed information and its observations on the matters referred to in the complaint (paragraph  of the th report). As regards the allegation relating to the elections at the Siglo XX mines, which was contained in the communication of the complaining organisation dated  December , the Committee, at its session in February , having received no reply to its request for observations, again recommended the Governing Body (th report, paragraph  (f)) to invite the Government to send its observations on the facts alleged. No reply to either of these allegations has yet been received by the Committee.
.In the circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to deplore that, in spite of repeated requests made to the Government in this connection, no information has been supplied, and to invite the Government, as a matter of urgency, to supply detailed information and observations on these two aspects of the complaint, and especially on the present situation of Mr. Barrisueta; and(b) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report when it has received this information and these observations.
.The Committee examined this case at its session in May , when it submitted to the Governing Body an interim report, which appears in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, as approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (May ).
.In paragraph  of its th Report, the Committee submitted recommendations to the Governing Body for the purpose of inviting the Government and the complainant organisation to send specific information and observations, to enable it to continue its examination of the case. The Government sent information, dated  May , relating to one aspect of the case, but this communication was not received by the Committee in time to be examined at its meeting in May . The World Confederation of Labour, for its part, submitted further allegations in a communication dated  May , on which the Government submitted its observations in a communication dated  July .
.Bolivia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but not the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In all these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the allegations relating to workers' radio stations, to decide that no new evidence has been submitted which would justify re-examination of the matter, with a view to modifying the conclusions of the Committee contained in paragraph  of its th Report;(b) as regards the allegations relating to Mr. Juan Lechin Oquendo, subject to further examination in the context of Cases ,  and  (Bolivia) of Mr. Lechin Oquendo's position with regard to the proceedings brought against him, to take note of the Government's statement that he has not been exiled and is free to return to the country if he wishes to defend himself against these charges, and to decide that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination;(c) as regards the allegations relating to the denial of recognition to various trade union organisations by the Government:(i) to draw the attention of the Government to the principle contained in Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), which has been ratified by Bolivia and guarantees workers the right to establish organisations of their own choosing without previous authorisation; in Article  of the Convention, which provides that such organisations shall have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom and to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes, the public authorities refraining from any interference which would restrict that right or impede the lawful exercise thereof; and in Article  of the Convention, providing that these organisations shall not be liable to be dissolved or suspended by administrative authority;(ii) to invite the Government to adopt, with the least possible delay, the necessary measures to enable workers belonging to the trade union organisations referred to in the allegations to elect their representatives freely and to enable such organisations, after complying with mere requirements as to form, to obtain the legal recognition which will enable them once more to pursue their activities freely without interference by the authorities;(d) as regards the allegations relating to the denial of the right to organise to various categories of worker:(i) to draw the attention of the Government to the principle contained in Article  of Convention No. , which guarantees to all workers "" without distinction whatsoever "" the right to establish and join organisations of their own choosing;(ii) to invite the Government to adopt the necessary measures effectively to recognise the right of public officials, craftsmen, and heads and administrative personnel of schools to form organisations;(e) with regard to the allegations relating to the imprisonment of Mr. Barrisueta, bearing in mind the nature of the complaints, in particular the allegation that he was subject to mistreatment, and",0,1968,Bolivia (Plurinational State of

.The Committee recalls that, when examining Case No.  at its meeting in May , it reached the conclusion that the Government should again be urged to repeal as soon as possible any measures still in force to suspend or take over trade unions and requested the Government to keep it informed of any measures it has taken or proposes to take to this end.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to point out to the Argentine Government that the information in its reply tending to justify the measures taken against the Argentine Federation of Chemical and Allied Workers does not appear to correspond to the specific facts mentioned in the complaint;(b) since the question raised is in any case the taking over of a trade union organisation by the Argentine Government, to draw the attention of the Government once more to the principles set forth in paragraph  above and particularly to the principle contained in Article  of Convention No. , which has been ratified by Argentina, to the effect that workers' organisations shall not be liable to be dissolved or suspended by administrative authority;(c) to take note of the Government's statement that it intends to restore the trade union organisation in question to normal as soon as possible, and to request the Government to keep it informed of any measures adopted to this end.",2,1968,Argentina
172,".The complaint presented by the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions is contained in a communication of  June , which was forwarded to the ILO by the United Nations. A copy was sent to the Government of the Dominican Republic, which presented its observations on  September .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.It is alleged in the complaint that on  June  the Dominican Government arbitrarily expelled the Christian trade union officer Alfredo Di Pacce, who was carrying out an important trade union mission for the benefit of Dominican peasants and workers. The complainants explain that Mr. Di Pacce had all his papers in order and they request the intervention of the ILO to re-establish respect for human and trade union rights in the Dominican Republic.
.The Government states in its reply that while Mr. Di Pacce was in the country he enjoyed the traditional hospitality of the Dominicans, but that he abused this hospitality and devoted his time to political activities that were forbidden to him as a foreigner. When his visa expired, the migration authorities therefore decided not to extend his residence permit and they requested him to leave the national territory. In its communication the Government reproduces the Constitutional provisions under which it is the duty of every foreigner to refrain from taking part in political activities on Dominican territory.
.The Committee has considered in the past that it was not for the Committee to deal with measures deriving from national legislation concerning aliens, unless these measures had direct repercussions on the exercise of trade union rights.
.In the present case the Committee observes in this connection that, although the complainants state that Mr. Di Pacce was carrying out a trade union mission, the Government asserts that he was really devoting himself to political activities that were forbidden to him as a foreigner. The Committee also observes that the Government meets the complainants' statement that Mr. Di Pacce was expelled although his papers were in order by maintaining that his visa had expired and that his residence permit was not extended by the authorities.
.In these circumstances the Committee considers that this is a case of factual questions concerning the period of validity of the residence permit granted to Mr. Di Pacce for his stay in the Dominican Republic-questions moreover on which the complainants and the Government have given versions that appear to be contradictory-and that the Committee is no more competent to express an opinion on these questions than it is on the right of a government to extend or not to extend the validity of a residence permit;",-1,1968,Dominican Republic
173,".The complaint of the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions (I.F.C.T.U.) is contained in two communications dated  May and  July  and the complaint of the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions of Transport Workers (I.F.C.T.U.T.W.) in a communication dated  May .Copies of these communications were sent to the Government, which presented its observations through the Permanent Mission of the Republic of Argentina to the International Organisations in Geneva on  September .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its first communication the I.F.C.T.U requested the I.L.O. to intervene on account of the many arrests carried out by the Argentine authorities during the May Day demonstrations. Three Christian trade union officers were said to be among the persons arrested. In its second communication the I.F.C.T.U complained of the imprisonment of Mr. Julio Guilln and other officers of the Argentine General Confederation of Labour. The I.F.C.T.U.T.W also referred to the arrest of a large number of those taking part in the May Day demonstrations and mentioned by name Mr. Carlos Custer, Mr. Emilio Valenti, and Mr. Juan Carlos Loureiro. Both organisations maintained that through these measures the Argentine Government had violated the International Labour Conventions on freedom of association.
.In its reply the Government refers only to the two communications of the I.F.C.T.U and states that the arrests of the trade unionists mentioned in the complaint were carried out as a result of their participation with other active members in the disorders occurring on  May and  June  in connection with unauthorised public activities. The arrests were carried out to safeguard public order, and "" all those arrested were soon restored to liberty "". The Government declares that measures of this kind cannot be confused with the infringement of trade union rights and encloses a copy of the police regulations on disorders.
.In earlier cases the Committee has considered that the right to organise public meetings, particularly on May Day, is an important aspect of trade union rights, The Committee has also considered, however, that it rests with the Government, which is responsible for the maintenance of public order, to decide in the exercise of its police powers whether meetings, including trade union meetings, may in certain special circumstances endanger public order and security, and to take adequate preventive measures.
.In the present case it appears from the communication of the Government that the persons referred to in the complaints were arrested for participation in disorders arising in connection with certain unauthorised public activities. The persons were not prosecuted on these grounds, however, and they were soon restored to liberty. The Committee understands that these persons included the trade unionists mentioned by name in the I.F.C.T.U.T.W complaint, since the Government states that all those arrested during the May Day disorders have been released.
.In these circumstances, and subject to the principles expressed in paragraph  above, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that the present case does not call for further examination.",2,1968,Argentina

The complaint was forwarded to the Government, which made its observations thereon in a letter dated  December .
.Nicaragua has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.It is alleged in the complaint that on  July  the police searched the headquarters of the complainant organisations and that twenty leaders and members of affiliated unions were arrested while holding meetings. The authorities responsible for these measures are stated to have claimed that they were necessary to forestall possible disturbances. The reason was that on the date in question, the President of the United States was due to call at the International Airport of Nicaragua and this had given rise to demonstrations by students and political organisations. The complainants add that the legal adviser to the CGT applied to the Court of Appeal for the release of the arrested trade unionists but that it took the Court ten days to name a judge to hear the case. A protest was also made to the President and to the Minister of Labour, but no reply was received from these authorities. After spending five days in custody, the detained persons were finally released, but without the intervention of any court.
.In its reply the Government states that in the Ministry of Labour there is a department which is responsible for dealing with all trade union affairs, including complaints concerning infringements of trade union rights. The department in question has received no complaint regarding the events alleged by the complainants. The Government adds that in connection with the visit of the President of the United States the authorities took a number of preventive measures, since it was known that serious acts were being planned in certain quarters to cause a breach of the peace. These measures had no connection with trade unionism nor was there any search of union premises. The authorities merely interrogated certain individuals (some of whom belonged to the unions mentioned in the complaint) concerning the plans that were being made. The Government denies that freedom of association was in any way infringed and states that it guarantees this freedom. It points out that in  it ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and is now examining a draft Bill to reform the regulations governing trade unions so as to implement fully these instruments. In addition, Parliament has now given its approval to the establishment of a Tripartite Committee on Freedom of Association and Labour Participation in National Development Planning. The Government concludes by saying that it can take appropriate preventive measures to maintain law and order and the fact that these may have been directed against persons connected with a trade union who are engaged in actions designed to disturb law and order in no way constitutes a breach of trade union rights.
.The Committee notes that the complainants and the Government are in agreement regarding the preventive detention of a number of trade unionists in connection with the visit of the President of the United States to Nicaragua. The Government denies, however, that trade union premises were searched or that the complainants lodged a protest with the Ministry of Labour. As regards the allegation in the complaint about the delay in the legal proceedings instituted to secure the release of the arrested men, the Government makes no comment in its letter.
.The Committee wishes to recall that in previous cases in which it was alleged that trade union leaders had been kept in preventive detention, it has considered that such measures may involve a serious interference with the exercise of trade union rights, which it would seem necessary to justify by the existence of a serious emergency and which would be open to criticism unless accompanied by adequate judicial safeguards applied within a reasonable period, and that it should be the policy of every government to ensure the observation of human rights and especially the right of all detained persons to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment.
.In the present case, according to the Government, precautionary measures were taken against certain persons, including a number of union leaders, in order to prevent public disturbances. However, the Committee notes that these leaders were not placed at the disposal of the judicial authorities but that the police itself released them after a few days without apparently having discovered any evidence which would justify bringing them to trial. The Committee considers that it is one of the fundamental rights of the individual that a detained person should be brought without delay before the appropriate judge, this right being recognised in such instruments as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man and the Political Constitution of Nicaragua itself. In the case of persons engaged in trade union activities, this is one of the civil liberties which should be ensured by the authorities in order to guarantee the full effectiveness of the exercise of trade union rights.
.The Committee also wished to recall that on other occasions it has pointed out that the detention by the authorities of trade unionists concerning whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found is liable to involve restrictions of trade union rights, and in these cases it has recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to take steps to ensure that the authorities concerned have appropriate instructions to eliminate the danger of detention for trade union activities.
.As regards the alleged searching of trade union headquarters, which the Government denies in its reply, the Committee considers that trade unions cannot claim immunity from search provided that the judicial authorities have issued an appropriate warrant. The complainants have not supplied any more detailed information on this aspect of the case which would enable the Committee to formulate its conclusions thereon.
.Accordingly, having regard to the fact that the trade unionists in question have been released, the Committee recommends the Governing Body, subject to the considerations set forth in the preceding paragraphs, to decide that this case does not call for further examination.",1,1968,Nicaragua
175,"the Consultation (Industrial and National Levels) Recommendation,  (No. ), to the effect that consultation and co-operation should be promoted between public authorities and employers' and workers' organisations with the general objective of achieving mutual understanding and good relations between them with a view to developing the economy as a whole or individual branches thereof, improving conditions of work and raising standards of living and, in particular, that the authorities should seek the views, advice and assistance of employers' and workers' organisations in an appropriate manner in respect of such matters as the preparation and implementation of laws and regulations affecting their interests. Furthermore, in view of the Government's statement that strikes are illegal in the civil service, the Committee, recalling that allegations concerning the right to strike are not outside its competence in so far as they affect trade union rights, considers it necessary to refer to another of its conclusions. The Committee has held that while restrictions on the right to strike in the public service or in essential services could be accepted, there should in such cases be adequate guarantees to safeguard the interests of the workers who are thereby deprived of an essential means of defending their occupational interests, which implies that such restrictions should be accompanied by adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures in which the parties concerned can participate at all stages.
.The Committee observes that the wage freeze ordered by the Government did not only affect the public sector but also curtailed collective bargaining in the private sector of the economy. In this connection the Committee pointed out in one of its earlier cases that the development of procedures for the voluntary negotiation of agreements constituted an important aspect of freedom of association, but that it would be difficult to lay down an absolute rule concerning this matter because, under certain circumstances, governments might feel that the economic position of their countries called at certain times for stabilisation measures during the application of which it would not be possible for wage rates to be fixed freely through the medium of collective bargaining.
.In their allegations the complainants also refer to a Bill designed to abolish certain trade union rights and, more particularly, the right to bargain collectively. The Government states in its reply that legislation is due to enter into force to reorganise the system of fixing wages in the private sector and to replace the existing emergency methods by a permanent system, which would take account of the experience of Uruguay and other countries and also of the principles and standards of the ILO.
.Finally, the Committee takes note of the request by the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions and the World Confederation of Labour in their communications dated  and  July  for the appointment of an ILO committee of inquiry to make an on-the-spot investigation of the allegations made in the complaints. In the light of the foregoing analysis of the allegations and of the Government's reply, and of the principles set forth, and bearing in mind that the measures taken by the authorities appear to have been temporary and to have already been rescinded as regards certain of the allegations, the Committee does not think it advisable at the present time to give further consideration to this request.
.Accordingly, with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to take note of the fact that the mobilisation of employees of the National Fuel, Alcohol and Portland Cement Administration, the State Sanitation Service and the Telecommunications Administration has been terminated;(b) to take note of the Government's statement that the individuals arrested under the prompt measures of security were immediately released and that the occupation of various trade union premises was purely temporary and that the freedom of trade union organisations to conduct their own affairs is recognised;(c) to request the Government to be good enough to inform it more specifically of the present position of the union leaders Ramn Freire Pizzano and Otilio Barragn;(d) to reiterate to the Government the views set forth in paragraph  above concerning the mobilisation of workers and to request the Government to inform it of the present position in this respect of the employees of the State Telephone Service and the state-owned banks;(e) to draw the Government's attention similarly to the safeguards which should be laid down for civil servants and employees of essential services who are deprived of the right to strike and the development of voluntary bargaining procedures, and to request it to be good enough to supply details of any developments which may have occurred in this respect;(f) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will present a further report to the Governing Body once it has received the additional information requested from the Government in subparagraphs (c), (d) and (e) above.Geneva,  February .

176,".This case was previously examined by the Committee at its session in November , when it formulated its definitive conclusions thereon. These are contained in paragraphs  to  of the Committee's th Report and will be submitted for the approval of the Governing Body at its th Session.
.Since the November session of the Committee, however, the Government, in a communication dated  January , has presented a new series of observations which call for examination.
.The case consisted essentially of allegations that the Argentine Federation of Chemical and Allied Workers had been deprived of its trade union status and had been placed under the control of the Government. In its observations the Government stated that the reason for taking over this organisation was that it had participated in the "" Action Plan "" of the General Confederation of Labour (CGT), the purpose of which was to challenge certain political decisions of the Government, and that in doing so it had departed from the trade union aims for which it had been set up.
.At its session in November  the Committee noted that the taking over of trade union organisations implied the serious danger of a restriction of the right of workers' organisations to elect their representatives in full freedom and to organise their administration and activities, and it recommended the Governing Body, firstly, to draw the attention of the Government to the importance of Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Argentina, which provides that workers' organisations shall have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom, to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes, and that the public authorities shall refrain from any interference that would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof, and, secondly, to stress the importance of the principle set forth in Article  of Convention No. , to the effect that workers' organisations shall not be liable to be dissolved or suspended by administrative authority.
.In its communication of  January  the Government again states that the taking over of the Argentine Federation of Chemical and Allied Workers was due to the fact that this Organisation had departed from its trade union purpose to engage in activities of a political nature. The Government further states that the aim pursued in taking over an organisation is to restore to normal the situation of the organisation in question, and to regularise its operation in order that trade union elections may be held as soon as possible.
.The Government also states that such action does not have the effect of infringing the right of organisations to elect their representatives, to organise their administration or to formulate their programmes, to the extent that these organisations act in accordance with the specifically trade union objectives which justify their existence.
.Having noted these new observations by the Government, the Committee considers that they contain nothing to justify it in altering the conclusions it reached following its previous examination of the case, as contained in its th Report.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to confirm the conclusions contained in paragraph  (b) of the Committee's th Report;(b) to request the Government to be good enough to keep the Governing Body informed of any measures taken with a view to the return to a normal situation of the organisation mentioned in the complaint, stating in particular whether it has been possible for free elections to be held.
.The complaint of the Trade Unions International of Chemical, Oil and Allied Workers is contained in a communication dated  April . A copy of this was sent to the Government, which replied on  September  through the Permanent Mission of the Republic of Argentina to the International Organisations in Geneva.
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants state in their communication that the Argentine Federation of Chemical and Allied Workers has been the victim of an infringement of trade union rights by the Argentine Government. On  January  its premises were occupied by the police. As a result of this action, there were protests in various parts of the country, strikes were declared, and a meeting was held at which the officers of the Federation were unanimously confirmed in office. Nevertheless, the Government continued its repressive measures, the officers of the union were suspended, various active members were dismissed and the funds of the Federation were frozen. In this way the General Secretary of the Federation, who is also Vice-President of the complainant organisation, was prevented from carrying on his trade union duties in the country. The complainants protested to the President of the Republic of Argentina, asking him to take action to ensure that the rights of the Federation were respected, and in their complaint they urge that the Government should be called on to guarantee the exercise of the rights laid down in the international Conventions and to take the necessary measures to permit the Argentine Federation of Chemical and Allied Workers and its officers to carry on their activities in full freedom.
.The Government states in its reply that the action complained of was ordered with a view to maintaining national security, internal order and social peace, since the Federation in question had taken part in the so-called "" Action Plan "" of the General Confederation of Labour (CGT), the purpose of which was to challenge political decisions of the Government, a purpose implying the carrying on of an activity that was not specifically that of a trade union. The Government continues by stating that it has an obligation to ensure the observance of the legal provisions governing the operation of trade union organisations, having at its disposal the necessary means to put right any deviations that may arise. In the case in question, there had been a series of circumstances that, in the opinion of the Government, compelled it to bring trade union activities back to normal. Political decisions intended to guarantee the proper observance of trade union rights and obligations could not be called in question. At all events, the Government maintains, it is its aim to restore the trade union organisation in question to normal as soon as possible. The Government concludes that there has been no infringement of individual liberty and that the social and provident services of the organisation are being carried on regularly and efficiently.
.The Committee recalls that, when examining Case No.  concerning Argentina in its st Report, it observed that the Argentine Federation of Chemical and Allied Workers and other trade union organisations had had their trade union status suspended by resolution No.  of  March . The measure had been taken as a result of the Action Plan prepared by the CGT, which affected national security, and on account of the succession of direct measures carried out by various trade union organisations without the observance of the legal requirements which, in some cases, showed a disruptive intention incompatible with the legitimate exercise of trade union rights. The Government had subsequently indicated, through a letter dated  September , that Ministerial Resolution No.  of  had rescinded ""the taking over of the unions of the chemical industry "".
.The present complaint relates to incidents subsequent to those mentioned above, since the complainants give specific indications concerning a series of acts that started on  January . The Government, in its reply, does not deny the statements made in the complaint, and confines itself to justifying the measures adopted and referring to the participation of the Federation in the Action Plan. In other words, the Government appears to refer to acts that occurred long ago in connection with which the taking over of the Federation had been ordered and later rescinded.
.However this may be, the Committee observes that the question now at issue is a new taking over of a trade union organisation by the Argentine Government. The Committee has already pointed out that on many occasions it has had to examine the question of the taking over of trade union organisations in Argentina. On these occasions, the Committee has drawn the attention of the Government to the importance of Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), which provides that workers' organisations shall have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom, to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes, and that the public authorities shall refrain from any interference that would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof. The Committee has also drawn attention to the fact that the taking over of trade union organisations implies the serious danger of a restriction of the right of workers' organisations to elect their representatives in full freedom and to organise their administration and activities.

.Bolivia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but has not ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations outstanding in the present case, as contained in the complaint submitted on  October  by the Bolivian National Trade Union Committee for the Defence of Workers' Rights, refer in part to specific measures said to have affected the Bolivian Workers' Confederation, the Bolivian Federation of Mineworkers' Unions and other bodies. Furthermore, it was specifically claimed that the trade union legislation promulgated on  September  (replacing the Decrees issued in ) contained various clauses which ran counter to the principles of freedom of association.
.The Government supplied further observations regarding the complaint in two communications dated  June and  August , addressed to the Director-General of the ILO.
.In its communication of  June  the Government then in power stated that, on  October , a nationalist revolutionary government had assumed power in Bolivia and that, while under the previous Government the activities of the trade union movement were restricted, and trade union leaders persecuted, since  October  there had been a sharp change in the fortune of labour organisations. The Government stated that the Bolivian Federation of Labour had been able to play a prominent part on the political scene and to reach agreement at its Fourth National Congress (in May ) on a policy setting forth the responsibilities to be borne by the Bolivian working class in the life of the nation. There was, added the Government, real respect for trade union rights and freedoms. Miners had been granted a  per cent wage increase, the unions were free to publish their bulletins, and cordial relations existed between the labour movement and the revolutionary government. There existed, the Government continued, neither political repression nor harassment of organised labour, which enjoyed every freedom.
.With regard to the allegations concerning the trade union legislation enacted on  September  (Presidential Decree No. ), which replaced the legislation on trade unions issued in , the Committee notes from information supplied by the Government in another case relating to Bolivia (letter dated  December )-and confirmed in the communication dated  August -that this Presidential Decree has been repealed by Presidential Decree No.  of  September , under which provisions guaranteeing freedom of association and the free and democratic election of trade union leaders are to be drawn up, with the participation of workers' organisations established at the national level.
.The Committee observes, in connection with the legislation affecting workers' organisations in Bolivia, that the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, in its observations addressed to the Government in March , requested the Government to provide information, in its next report under article  of the Constitution of the ILO, concerning the action taken under Presidential Decree No.  of  September  and the legislation in force regarding trade unions.
.In the circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to take note of the statement of the Government which had taken over on  October , concerning the changes which had taken place in the trade union situation while that Government was in power;(b) to note that Presidential Decree No.  of  September  was repealed and replaced by Presidential Decree No.  of  September  and that the question of the legislation in force regarding trade unions is being pursued by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations; and(c) to decide that the outstanding allegations, and therefore the case as a whole, do not call for further examination by the Committee.
.The Committee examined this case at its meeting in November , when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body which appeared in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ).
.The complaints are contained in a communication sent to the ILO by the Bolivian National Trade Union Committee for the Defence of Workers' Rights on  October  and in a communication sent to the ILO on  February  by the Confederation of American Teachers.
.When the Committee examined the case in November  it had received the preliminary observations of the Government in respect of the first of the two complaints, but not in respect of the second. In these circumstances the Committee had recommended in paragraph  of its th Report that the Government forward its detailed comments on the substance of both the complaints.
.By a communication dated  March  the Government forwarded its observations on the complaint submitted by the Confederation of American Teachers. To date, however, the Government has not forwarded the detailed comments requested by the Committee in its th Report on the complaint submitted by the Bolivian National Trade Union Committee for the Defence of Workers' Rights.
.Bolivia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but has not ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its complaint dated  February  the Confederation of American Teachers says that: "" the deplorable financial circumstances of Bolivian teachers are at the root of the protest movement in which the majority of the country's teachers have taken part."" Instead of meeting the teachers' legitimate demands for salary increases and improving their conditions of work, the Government, it is alleged, has ordered the dismissal of , teachers. It is further alleged that a Supreme Council for Education was set up, which reports directly to the President and "" with which the teachers are obliged to re-register without their union being able to intervene in any way."" According to the complaint, this was a requirement imposed upon the dismissed teachers if they wished to have a chance to work the following year.
.It is alleged that the Government of Bolivia took a series of repressive measures against the leaders of the teachers' unions. The complainants state that the General Secretary of the National Federation of Urban Schoolmasters, Mr. R. Dvila Morales, and the Press Secretary of this Federation, Mr. A. Quiroz Elguera, were expelled from the country.
.The Confederation of American Teachers, which has stated that it has affiliated organisations in Bolivia (the National Educational Workers' Confederation and the Departmental Schoolteachers' Federation of La Paz), considers that the Government has infringed the provisions of Conventions Nos.  and . It hopes that ILO intervention will induce the authorities to quash the order for the dismissal of , teachers, to restore the right to bargain collectively and to put an end to "" the persecution of leaders of teachers' unions officially recognised by the administrative authorities of Bolivia.""
.In its communication of  March  the Government draws attention to Bolivia's present economic situation, which, it claims, made it impossible for it to accede to the teachers' demands for higher wages without causing hardship to other classes of workers and damaging the economy as a whole.
.The Government points out, moreover, that, despite the fact that the teachers had disrupted the educational process by encouraging their pupils to stage solidarity strikes and practise prolonged absenteeism, it had displayed boundless patience in a situation of considerable gravity. However, when, as a result of a mass demonstration in support of the Government's refusal to accede to the teachers' demands, the people expressed their desire for the dismissal of all the teachers, it was decreed that the school year should end forthwith and the teachers be dismissed.
.The Government further states that during the school holidays the recently created National Council for Education was able to carry out the arduous task of rationalisation by means of a code of standards and decisions which settled the education problem to the satisfaction of the majority of urban and rural schoolteachers, the heads of families and the population in general.
.The Government concludes its observations by denying the allegations relating to the deportation and persecution of teachers. According to the Government certain teachers had chosen voluntary exile whereas others had considered themselves persecuted by the security services either when they found that their political resistance to the Government and the decrees issued by the National Council for Education had been a complete failure, or possibly when each of them realised the extent of his own share in the blame.
.In the light of the above information it would appear that, having put forward a certain number of claims which were not met by the Government, the teachers encouraged the pupils to stage solidarity strikes in their support. It was then that the Government decided to dismiss the teachers and to take certain measures to resolve",-1,1968,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
178,".This complaint presented by the Trade Union Movement of Cundinamarca (Asicun) is set forth in two communications, one of them dated  January, the other  March . The first of these alleges "" anti-union discrimination taken against workers employed by the undertaking Mercados y Almacenes Caravana "" and police interference with a strike held in that undertaking. The second alleges "" anti-union discrimination "" in the San Diego Hospital.
.At its session in February  the Committee reached its final conclusions on the first series of allegations; these conclusions appear in paragraphs  to , and  () of its th Report, which will be submitted to the Governing Body for approval at the latter's th Session.
.As regards the second series, the Government had not yet submitted any observations at the time when the Committee was considering this case at its session in February . It has, however, since done so in a communication to the ILO, dated  April .
.In their communication dated  March , the complainants alleged that an organisation known as "" Analferaux "" (which they said represented the nurses) had handed in a set of claims to the management of the San Diego Hospital. The management had thereupon dismissed twenty-three members of the organisation. A complaint having been lodged against these dismissals, on the ground that they constituted "" anti-union discrimination "", the Ministry of Labour had ordered an inquiry, which had not, however, produced any results. Moreover, the management of the hospital had forced the nurses to give up their membership of "" Analferaux "" and to sign an agreement with regard to which that organisation was not consulted.
.The Government in its observations presents these matters in the following manner. On  April  the National Association of Assistant Nurses (Analferaux) had presented the management of the San Diego Hospital with a set of claims on behalf of the nurses, whom it claimed to represent. The manager questioned whether his nurses were in fact members of this organisation. The Ministry of Labour made an inquiry and, on  May , came to the conclusion that the nurses in that hospital were not in fact members of the Association, although the latter had made claims on their behalf.
.Furthermore, the Government continues, the Ministry despatched one of its officials to make inquiries on the spot, so that he could see for himself what working conditions were like and assess the relations between management and employees.
.The Government affirms that there are no grounds at all for the accusation of "" antiunion discrimination "". It is untrue, the Government asserts, that twenty-three people bad been dismissed. It adds that on the national level Analferaux has made no complaint concerning "" persecution "" or dismissals; the only complaint it had made concerned the fact that the manager of the hospital in question had declined to consider the claims made until such time as the ministerial inquiry had ascertained whether or not the nurses whom the Association claimed to represent were in fact members.
.From the information available, it seems that what happened, in essence, is this: a set of claims were presented to an employer by a certain organisation claiming to represent the workers in that undertaking; an official inquiry by the Ministry of Labour concluded that the organisation was not in fact entitled to act on their behalf, and the employer refused to consider the claims in question until such time as the inquiry had revealed what the position was.
.Furthermore, it would seem, in the light of the Government's statement, that the complainants did not see fit to lodge a complaint about "" anti-union persecution "" and dismissals with the national authorities, and that their accusations were unfounded. Having taken note of the Government's explanations, and of the fact that with regard to these two points the complainants have failed to supply any definite information (such as the names of those dismissed or "" persecuted ""), the Committee considers that the veracity of the allegations made has not been adequately proved.
.Accordingly, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that the case does not call for further examination.

The text of the telegram was communicated to the Government on  May , and that of the letter on  June . The Government forwarded its observations on the matter by a communication dated  August .
.In addition the complaining organisation, in conjunction with other Brazilian trade union organisations, made further allegations in a communication dated  July . Lastly, by a communication dated  July , the Union of Petroleum Workers of Bahia made yet further allegations. The texts of these last two communications were transmitted on  July  to the Government, which has not yet forwarded its observations upon them.
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.As concerns the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to decide, for the reasons stated in paragraph  above, and subject to the reservations made in paragraphs  and , that the allegations relating to the arrest of leaders of the Chemical and Pharmaceutical Industries Workers' Trade Union, Santo Andr, do not call for further examination;(b) to request the Government to be good enough to furnish its observations with respect, firstly, to the allegations relating to the military occupation of the premises of the Osasco Metalworkers' Union, and, secondly, to the allegations relating to the military occupation of the premises of the Union of Petroleum",-1,1968,Brazil
181,".The complaint of the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions (I.F.C.T.U.) is contained in a telegram dated  September , sent directly to the I.L.O. The complainants were informed that they were entitled to submit further information in support of their complaint, but they have not availed themselves of this opportunity. The complaint was transmitted to the Government, which forwarded its observations thereon in a communication dated  October .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants allege that on  September  soldiers and police of the Dominican Republic prevented a demonstration by the Autonomous Federation of Christian Trade Unions against a wage-freezing law. They allege that several trade union leaders were imprisoned, and they request the I.L.O. to intervene with a view to securing their release.
.In its observations, after stating that no trade unionist has been imprisoned, the Government indicates that the demonstration referred to by the I.F.C.T.U was in fact forbidden by the police acting on the basis of a decision taken by the State Secretariat for the Interior and the Police, which is empowered by law to grant or refuse authorisation for public demonstrations. The Government states that in the circumstances referred to in the complaint there was every reason to fear that the planned demonstration would degenerate into disorders, the consequences of which it was impossible to foresee. It adds that it was for this reason that the demonstration was not authorised.
.The Government goes on to say that the austerity legislation designed to freeze wages and so stabilise the balance of payments has recently been amended in a manner favourable to the workers, some of whose claims have been met. Thus, under the amendments made, wage increases have been rendered possible in undertakings, both public and private, which have made profits in the course of the financial year.
.Finally, the Government states that it views favourably the exercise of trade union rights and the workers' claims to the extent that they are compatible with the national Constitution and legislation.
.As regards the banning of the demonstration, the Committee recalls that in the past it has considered that trade union organisations must observe the general provisions relating uniformly to all public meetings. In the same connection, the Committee was also of the opinion that it rests with the Government, which is responsible for the maintenance of public order, to decide in the exercise of its corresponding powers whether meetings, including trade union meetings, may in certain special circumstances endanger public order and security and to take adequate preventive measures.
.In the present case it seems, firstly, that the demonstration planned was intended as a protest against the Government's economic policy, since it was directed against the austerity legislation to freeze wages, and secondly, and principally, that the reason for the banning of the meeting lay in the authorities' fears that public order might be endangered.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide, in the light of the precedents referred to in paragraph  above and for the reasons indicated in paragraph , that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.
.As regards the allegation that some trade union leaders had been imprisoned, which the Government formally denies, the Committee observes that although the complainants were accorded the possibility to do so, they did not supply any further information in support of their allegations, such as the names of the persons alleged to have been arrested.
.In these circumstances, considering that the complainants have not supplied sufficient evidence of their contentions, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that this aspect of the case and, consequently, the case as a whole, does not call for further examination.",-1,1968,Dominican Republic
182,".The Committee examined this case at its session in May , when it submitted to the Governing Body an interim report contained in paragraphs - of its th Report, which was approved by the Governing Body.
.In paragraph  of its th Report, the Committee submitted to the Governing Body a number of final conclusions on certain aspects of the case and a recommendation that the Governing Body request the Government of the Dominican Republic to send further information to enable the Committee to form its conclusions on the allegation, the examination of which had remained in abeyance. The Government furnished this information in a communication dated  October .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their first communication the complainants had alleged that on  November  the police and army had opened fire on the premises of the Stevedores' Union (POASI), before occupying the premises by force, although they had no legal warrant to do so; fifteen workers are said to have been arrested and other workers, who were injured, are said to have disappeared. Many workers are alleged to have been brutally assaulted and there is said to have been destruction of furniture and of the union headquarters in general.
.In its first communication concerning these allegations, the Government stated that it was incorrect that there had been a considerable number of persons injured in connection with the above-mentioned events. The Government stated that on the night of  November  a police patrol was attacked by individuals. When the attackers were pursued by the patrol to the premises in which they had taken refuge, the building of the above-mentioned trade union organisation suffered some damage. Although the Government assumed no responsibility for the incidents, it had taken the necessary measures for the building to bet repaired.
.The Committee had taken note of the Government's statements and recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to indicate whether an official inquiry had been carried out to establish responsibility for these occurrences and, if so, to communicate the results of this inquiry.
.In its subsequent communication the Government states that it ordered a detailed inquiry into the facts complained of, and that this inquiry has revealed that the police who took action in the case did so within the limits of their functions. The Government repeats that it has no responsibility "" in this regrettable incident "", despite which it "" compensated the leaders of the Stevedores' Union (POASI), in agreement with them, for repairs to the damaged building and furniture "".
.At the time of noting these new statements by the Government, the Committee deplores the fact that they contain no concrete information on the causes behind the incidents, simply stating that the police were not exceeding their powers. For their part, the complainants have not taken advantage of the possibility of supplying more detailed information on the events complained about. The Committee considers that for want of more detailed evidence it is impossible for it to reach definite conclusions on the facts in question.
.In any case, in view of the fact that the Government has in the meanwhile paid compensation to the Stevedores' Union, in agreement with its leaders, in order for the trade union building to be repaired, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide, subject to the above reservation, that this aspect of the case calls for no further examination.
.This complaint, lodged by the Latin American Workers' Permanent Congress on Trade Union Unity, was made in a letter dated  December . On  January  the complaint was referred to the Government, which, in a communication dated  April   sent in its observations.
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants allege that "" freedom of association and the right to organise are systematically violated by the most diverse forms of repression and particularly by violent police activities "".
.The complainants allege (in very general language) that "" over forty trade unions of state and sugar establishments have been taken over and their entire managing committees removed from office arbitrarily and without justification. Trade union leaders have been persecuted by the political police of the rgime and many of them have been unjustly put in prison. "" The headquarters of the Dominican National Federation of Workers are said to have been raided and equipment confiscated. Municipal unions have not been recognised and , municipal workers have been dismissed for not joining the government party. Lastly, it is said that the wages of dockworkers belonging to the union known as POASI have had their wages arbitrarily reduced by  per cent.
.The complainants also say that the Government has passed an Austerity Act freezing wages, despite the workers' protests and despite an alarming rise in the cost of living.
.These are general allegations couched in very general terms. They do not name the unions the executive committees of which are said to have been dissolved, or the trade union leaders said to have been persecuted or arrested, nor is there any indication as to exactly when these events took place. The complainants do, however, make certain other allegations of a rather more specific kind.
.Thus they claim that on  November  the police and army opened fire on the premises of the Stevedores' Union (POASI), before occupying those premises by force, despite the fact that they had no legal warrant to do so. Fifteen workers, it is stated, were arrested and thrown into gaol, and others disappeared; their present whereabouts are unknown, but there is reason to believe they may have been wounded. Many workers, it is said, were fired on and brutally assaulted with rifle butts and clubs.
."" This brutal assault by the police and military "", the complainants go on to say, "" also involved the destruction by the attackers of desks, pictures, telephones, windows, typewriters, files, doors and fans, and the union headquarters were subjected to a general and destructive vandalism......
.In its observations on the general allegations (see paragraph ) the Government simply states that ""it is not true that trade union leaders have been persecuted or imprisoned "".
.The Committee thus has to decide which of two completely contradictory statements is the more worthy of credence. In view, however, of the very general language used by the complainants, who failed, moreover, to avail themselves of the possibility of backing up their allegations with further information, the Committee feels that the veracity of these allegations has not been adequately demonstrated, and hence recommends the Governing Body to decide that this aspect of the case calls for no further consideration.
.The freezing of wages, referred to in paragraph  above, would appear to be an aspect of official wages policy rather than an attack on the principle of freedom of association. In this connection, the Government declares that the Austerity Act, which froze wages for the sake of the balance of payments, has recently been amended in a manner favourable to the workers. Their claims, the Government affirms, have to some extent been met, since private firms and public undertakings which have made a profit during the financial year have been authorised to increase wages.
.This aspect of the matter is not directly related to the exercise of trade union rights, and the Committee accordingly recommends that the Governing Body merely take note of the Government's statement.
.As regards the allegations analysed in paragraphs  and  above, the Government begins by asserting that, contrary to the complainants' statement, it is quite untrue that there were numerous victims of the events which took place on the night of  November .
.The Government then presents what happened in the following night. In the middle of the night, it says, a police patrol was attacked; the attackers, pursued by the police, took refuge in the trade union premises concerned, which premises suffered some damage in the ensuing action. The Government continues by saying that, although in no way responsible for "" these deplorable incidents "", it has arranged for the necessary repairs to be undertaken.
.While taking due note of the Government's statement concerning this aspect of the matter, the Committee wishes to know whether any official investigation has been undertaken to ascertain responsibilities and, if so, what the conclusions are.
.Hence it recommends the Governing Body to ask the Government to be so good as to supply the information mentioned in paragraph  above.
.As regards the case as a whole, the Committee recommends that the Governing Body:(a) decide that for the reasons set forth in paragraph  above, the general allegations analysed in paragraph  (winding up of trade union executive committees, arrest of trade union leaders and dismissals of workers) call for no further consideration;(b) take note of the Government's statement that the Austerity",-1,1968,Dominican Republic
183,"federations shall be set up one per state; however, the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare may authorise the creation of inter-state or national federations. The Government next quotes the single paragraph of section  of Ministerial Decree No.  of  August , which says: "" Should state federations wish to set up an inter-state or national federation, they must first obtain permission, as mentioned in this Section.""
.The Government states that the National Federation of Petroleum Industry Workers began by committing a breach of these regulations, inasmuch as the founder unions failed to ask the Ministry for permission in accordance with the law despite the fact that they were based in different states.
.In spite of this infringement, declares the Government, the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare agreed to investigate the Federation's request for recognition, which was handled in accordance with the normal procedure.
."" When the appeal was investigated by the Trade Union Guidance Committee "", states the Government, "" the Committee (a collegiate body in which various government departments are represented, together with employers and workers in equal numbers) was unanimous in rejecting it."" The Government adds that, when the matter was referred to the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare, he decided, taking into account the views expressed by the National Department of Labour, to reject the request for recognition lodged by the National Federation of Petroleum Industry Workers. The decision was dated  February .
."" From then on "", says the Government, "" the so-called National Federation had no vestige of a claim to official existence. While, before this ruling, it might conceivably have had some claim to future recognition, its appeal was finally rejected by the Minister. It follows that this body cannot act as a federation and is not even entitled to call itself one.""
.From the detailed explanations supplied by the Government it would appear that the reason for the decision to refuse recognition to the National Federation of Petroleum Industry Workers was that the founder unions did not conform to the exigencies of the law (see paragraphs  and  above), and that this is ultimately why the aforementioned federation has no official existence in the country concerned.
.Without denying that this may be the case according to current national legislation, the Committee feels obliged to point out that the conditions which this legislation lays down for the organisation of federations, and in particular the condition that founding unions based in different states must first ask permission (which may be refused) from the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare, are incompatible with the generally accepted principles of freedom of association, which include the right of trade unions to form such federations as they see fit.
.Moreover, since the union referred to in the complaint, namely the Union of Workers in the Petroleum (Distilling and Refining) Industry of the States of Guanabara and Rio de Janeiro, seems to have a perfectly normal legal existence (see below), and since the Government chose to reply concerning the basis of the allegations, the Committee considered it timely to investigate the latter.
.Concerning these allegations, which are analysed in paragraphs  to  above, the Government gives the following information. Elections were held by the Union of Workers in the Petroleum (Distilling and Refining) Industry of the States of Guanabara and Rio de Janeiro for the renewal of its administrative and representative organs. There were two rival lists of candidates. After the elections, the losing side complained that many members had been prevented from voting by underhand means, which had affected the outcome of the vote in a sense unfavourable to the losers.
.The Government goes on to state that, recognising that the complainants were well justified in appealing, the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare gave the following ruling:In accordance with the views expressed by the National Department of Labour, and in view of the fact that the voting booths were closed two hours before the advertised time, while the difference in the number of votes cast for the rival lists was less than the number of union members who did not vote, I HEREBY DECREE, in accordance with section  (a) of Ministerial Ordinance No.  of  January  that the validity of the appeal against the outcome of the elections, and of the request that these elections shall be declared null and void, shall be upheld.Hence I authorise the Regional Representative of the Department of Labour in the State of Guanabara to appoint another governing body for the union in question, this governing body to administer the affairs of the union and to organise fresh elections within ninety () days.(Signed) Jarbas Passarinho  April 
.The Government declares that the object of this decision was purely and simply the holding of "" new, authentic and honest elections in which the views of the majority of the members of the union (could) find full expression "".
.The Government says that the legislation governing elections in trade unions empowers the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare to appoint a governing body to run the affairs of the entity concerned, should a vote be pronounced null and void because of some fault or failing on the part of the union's officers, or when, the officers' terms of office having expired, fresh elections cannot be organised under the same management. The Minister, states the Government, accordingly authorised his Regional Representative in the State of Guanabara to run the union in question pending fresh elections, by appointing a governing body. This latter was made up of members of the union concerned, chosen amongst those who seemed most likely successfully to perform the duties provided for in the Ministerial Ordinance cancelling the former elections. The Government draws attention to the fact that the Minister left the union under the management of its own members, and did nothing to delay the holding of fresh elections. It states that although these were not in fact held within the time-limit specified, this was due to internal reasons (dissensions within the union's representative assembly).
.The Government declares that the administrative position of the Union of Workers in the Petroleum (Distilling and Refining) Industry of the States of Guanabara and Rio de Janeiro returned to normal following authentic elections held on ,  and  November  and the newly elected chairman's assumption of office on the th of the same month.
."" The union in question "", concludes the Government, "" is now in full enjoyment of the rights bestowed by the law on bodies representing occupations or classes. The reasons why a provisional governing body had to be appointed no longer apply, and the union is now running normally, its affairs being managed by its own, properly elected members.""
.From the information furnished by the Government it appears that the elections held by the union in question in March  (see paragraph  above) were considered improper, and that the labour authorities annulled them and appointed a provisional governing body to organise fresh elections.
.The Committee has already had occasion to investigate the question of intervention by governmental authorities in trade union elections following irregularities in the way they were conducted which had led the authorities to annul them. On that occasion, the Committee considered that the action taken by the administrative authorities in suspending the results of an election might appear arbitrary even when provisional and temporary and even when followed by judicial action. As in the past, the Committee considers that the principle of freedom of association does not prevent the exercising of control over the internal acts of a trade union when they infringe judicial or statutory rulings; but it also considers it of paramount importance, in order to guarantee an impartial and objective procedure, that such control should be exercised by the competent judicial authority.
.In these circumstances, inasmuch as the intervention of the administrative authorities in the present case was in accordance with the regulations relevant to trade union elections, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to draw the attention of the government concerned to the considerations mentioned in the previous paragraph and to invite it to re-examine the national legislation and practice in the light of these considerations.",-1,1968,Brazil
184,".The complaint is contained in a communication dated  April , sent from Washington by the Confederation of Cuban Workers in Exile. In another communication dated  May , the complainant organisation submitted further information in support of its allegations. The texts of both these communications were passed on to the Government, which furnished its observations in a letter dated  May , from the Permanent Delegation of Cuba in Geneva.
.Cuba has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.With regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) for the reasons stated in paragraph , to decide that there would be no point in examining further the allegations concerning the requirement of a work book in connection with the exercise of trade union rights and, for the reasons stated in paragraph , to decide that the allegations concerning provisions on the dissolution and suspension of trade union organisations call for no further examination;(b) as regards the allegations concerning the right of workers to establish organisations of their own choosing:(i) to draw the Government's attention to the importance it has always attached to the principle contained in Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Cuba, whereby workers have the right "" to establish ... organisations of their own choosing without previous authorisation "";(ii) to reaffirm the conclusions of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, mentioned in paragraph  above, according to which certain provisions of Cuban legislation, establishing a single trade union branch in each workplace composed of all the workers in the same workplace (with which provisions all trade union organisations existing before the promulgation of the Act were obliged also to comply) are incompatible with Article  of Convention No. ;(iii) to request the Government to keep it informed of any measures the Government might have adopted or might envisage adopting in order to eliminate the discrepancy between its legislation in this respect and the above-mentioned principle;(c) in connection with the allegations concerning government control of workers' organisations:(i) to reaffirm the importance it has always attached to the principle embodied in Article  of Convention No. , ratified by Cuba, that workers' organisations have the right to organise their administration and activities without interference from the public authorities which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof;(ii) to take note of the Government's statement that the provisions relating to the powers of the Ministry of Labour to control occupational organisations have not been applied to workers' organisations and to note moreover that the provision specifically mentioned by the complainants has been repealed;(d) in connection with the allegations concerning the right to bargain collectively:(i) to take note of the Government's statement that the Ministry of Labour is empowered to regulate wages, working hours, leave and conditions of work, that these regulations must be observed in collective agreements and that they are always issued in consultation with the workers' organisations;(ii) however, in view of the fact that such important aspects of conditions of work thus virtually remain outside the scope of collective bargaining, the authorities having moreover the power to intervene in certain cases by means of decisions which may determine the content or suspend the execution of collective agreements, to draw the Government's attention to the importance it has always attached to the principle that the right of workers' organisations to bargain freely with employers on conditions of work constitutes an essential element in freedom of association, and that the public authorities should refrain from any interference that would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof;(iii) to repeat to the Government the importance of the principle of voluntary negotiation on conditions of employment contained in Article  of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Cuba, with which the legislation of the country is not in line;(e) to bring these conclusions to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.",-1,1968,Cuba
185,".This case was previously examined by the Committee at its session in November , when it submitted to the Governing Body the interim report contained in paragraphs  to  of the Committee's th Report.
.Guatemala has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.It was alleged that a "" wave of terror of the extreme right "" was endangering the lives of Christian trade union leaders of the country and, more particularly, that five members of the executive committee of the Central Federation of Christian Workers of Guatemala, listed by name, had been threatened with death by an extreme right-wing underground group if they did not leave the country within a specified period, and that leaders of other organisations had had to leave the country for similar reasons.
.In its observations the Government confined itself to stating that in Guatemala, under the provisions of the National Constitution and the labour legislation in force, there were no breaches of freedom of association.
.When considering the case at its session in November , the Committee observed that the alleged actions, by their very nature, came under the heading of criminal law and appeared to be political in purpose. It pointed out, however, that to judge by the contents of the complaint, the threats in question seemed to have been directed against the persons concerned in their capacity as trade union leaders. The Committee therefore considered that the allegations had some relationship with the normal operation of trade unions and the freedom of action of their officials.
.After noting that the complainants did not accuse the Government of the actions in question, the Committee recalled that its constant practice in cases of this kind had been to make no distinction between allegations levelled against governments and allegations levelled against persons accused of violating freedom of association, but to determine in each particular case whether or not the government had ensured in its territory the free exercise of trade union rights.
.The Committee therefore recommended the Governing Body to ask the Government to be good enough to supply more precise observations and information on the facts referred to in the case.
.This recommendation was approved by the Governing Body, and the request for additional information contained in it was brought to the knowledge of the Government by a letter dated  November . The Government replied by a letter dated  December .
.In its reply the Government asserts that it does everything possible to ensure respect for trade union rights in the country and regrets that, despite its efforts, underground movements sometimes evade the precautions taken by the authorities. It recalls, however, that the country is going through a period of troubles instigated from abroad and that this prevents the Government, despite all its measures to this effect, from having full control of the situation.
.In these circumstances, having noted the explanations provided by the Government, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to express the hope that the Government will ensure that trade union rights can be exercised as far as possible in conditions of freedom and security.
.The complaint is made in two communications dated  and  April  from the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions (I.F.C.T.U.), which were forwarded to the Government in letters dated  April and  May  respectively.
.The Government made a number of observations on the case in a communication dated  June .
.Guatemala has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its cable dated  April , the I.F.C.T.U alleged that a ""wave of terror of extreme right "" was endangering the lives of Christian trade union leaders in Guatemala and called on the I.L.O. to intervene with the authorities "" to fight criminal extremism "". On  April, the I.F.C.T.U forwarded additional information supplied by the Latin American Christian Trade Union Confederation (C.L.A.S.C.) and the Central Federation of Guatemala Workers. According to this source, five members of the executive committee of the latter organisation, namely de Len, Cullar, Prado, Castillo and Aquino, were threatened with death unless they left the country. This threat is stated to have been made by an extreme right-wing underground group. It is alleged that leaders of other workers' organisations have had to leave the country in similar circumstances and that the foregoing leaders reported the facts to the authorities.
.In its observations, the Government confines itself to stating that in Guatemala by virtue of the Constitution, the Labour Code and relevant regulations, there are no breaches of freedom of association. As evidence of this the Government quotes the case of the Railwaymen's Action and Betterment Union which "" with the full support of the Government and with its economic backing "" settled a labour dispute with the International Central American Railway Company.
.The Committee notes that the alleged actions, by their nature, come under the heading of criminal law and in this case appear to be political in purpose. Nevertheless, to judge by the nature of the complaint, the serious threats in question appear to have been directed against the individuals concerned in their capacity as trade union leaders, while other leaders whose identity is not specified are stated to have been forced out of the country for the same reasons. Accordingly, the allegations appear to have some relationship with the normal operation of trade unions and the freedom of action of its officials.
.In this case, the complainants do not accuse the Government of the actions in question, but the Committee recalls that in the past it has considered that it should not make a distinction between allegations levelled against governments and allegations levelled against persons accused of impairing freedom of association and should consider whether or not, in each particular case, a government has ensured in its territory the exercise of trade union rights. In accordance with this practice, the Committee considers it necessary to ask the Government for more precise observations and information than it has supplied.
.Accordingly, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to request the Government to be good enough to supply as soon as possible its observations on the allegations concerning the threats alleged to have been made to these trade union leaders, together with any information it may consider relevant to the present position regarding the problem referred to by the complainants; and(b) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report once it has received the observations and information requested from the Government in the previous subparagraph.",-1,1968,Guatemala
186,".The complaint of the National Federation of Petroleum Industry Workers is contained in a communication of  June  addressed direct to the ILO. By a letter of  July  the text of the complaint was transmitted to the Government, which sent its observations in a communication dated  November .
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right.to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but it has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants state that on  March  the votes were counted in the election held for the renewal of the Committee of Management, the Supervisory Council and the Council of Representatives of the Union of Workers in the Petroleum (Distilling and Refining) Industry of the States of Guanabara and Rio de Janeiro. The elections were held on ,  and  March. After the counting of the votes, the complainants continue, one of the two lists that had been presented was declared by the election committee to have won.
.The complainants next state that, accepting the allegations made by those on the defeated list to the effect that there had been irregularities in the elections, the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare applied the relevant procedure, which led to the cancelling of the elections and the setting up of a board of management to administer the union and organise new elections within ninety days.
.The complainants, who assert that the elections had been regular, allege that it was on the contrary the cancelling of the ballot and the appointment of the board of management that were characterised by irregularities. They also make detailed allegations that the board of management has acted improperly; thus, its chairman is said to have denounced various workers to the authorities for holding "" subversive and anti-democratic "" opinions and also to have stated that he would not hold elections within six months, since if he were to do so "" the union would fall into anti-democratic hands "".
.The complainants also allege that high-ranking military officers in the service of PETROBRAS had taken steps to have obstacles raised by the Regional Labour Office of Guanabara to the holding of elections in the Union of Workers in the Petroleum (Distilling and Refining) Industry of the States of Guanabara and Rio de Janeiro during the following six months, so as to prevent the organisation, in their own words, from "" being placed under the control of subversive elements "".
.It is also alleged that "" the names of nearly  managers at various levels in PETROBRAS, who were not before then members of a trade union, had been hurriedly listed as a result of a decision at a higher level, with a view to their applying for inclusion on the list of members of the Union of Workers in the Petroleum (Distilling and Refining) Industry of the States of Guanabara and Rio de Janeiro "". Lastly, pressure had been brought to bear on some of the trade unionists returned in the first election to refrain from standing in the new elections, in return for which the management of PETROBRAS would place no further obstacles in the way of holding the elections within the period of ninety days fixed by the decision of the Ministry.
.In its reply of  November , the Government states that the complaining organisation has no legal existence in Brazil and on these grounds refuses the request for observations that has been addressed to it. "" The International Labour Organisation "", it goes on, "" will understand that in this case the supply of explanations would amount to a violation of the principles that govern trade union relations in Brazil. If it recognised this federation as having enough authority to cause information to be requested at the international level, Brazil would be obliged to recognise the legitimacy of its existence at the national level too. By doing this the Brazilian Government would give a concrete demonstration of its contempt for its own laws regulating its conduct. Without implying a lack of respect for the exalted aims of the International Labour Organisation, we are bound to make this statement to protect the sovereignty of Brazil.""
.When it had the case before it at its session in February , the Committee, in view of the reply by the Government, wished, as on previous occasions, to recall that the non-recognition by the public authorities of a trade union organisation was not in itself sufficient reason to deprive the organisation of its right to have recourse before the Committee to the complaint procedure in respect of infringement of freedom of association. As long ago as its First Report, the Committee considered that it would be altogether inconsistent with the purpose for which the procedure for the examination of allegations concerning the infringement of trade union rights had been established for it to admit that the dissolution or non-recognition of an organisation by governmental action extinguished the right of the organisation to invoke the procedure.
.In the present case, it appears from the information available to the Committee that it was after the reporting of the facts (as they were described by the person heading the list that had originally been elected) by the Union of Workers in the Petroleum (Distilling and Refining) Industry of the States of Guanabara and Rio de Janeiro to the National Federation of Petroleum Industry Workers that the Federation lodged a complaint with the ILO. According to a statement in its communication addressed to the Director-General, this was after ascertaining that the accusations were true.
.It seems that the complainant Federation has a factual existence at least. It further appears that the union at the origin of the complaint, which was taken up on its behalf by the Federation, enjoyed some form of recognition, implicitly at any rate, since according to its allegations the elections held within the union gave rise, after the intervention of a third party, to an official act by the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare in the form of the cancellation of these elections and the setting up of a board of management whose functions included the organising of new elections (see paragraph  above).
.In these circumstances, and in view of the principles recalled in paragraph  above, before the Committee could contemplate examining the substance of the case it considered it necessary to obtain certain additional information from the Government, principally in order to form an opinion on the question whether the complaint before it was received from an organisation competent to submit this complaint.
.The Committee therefore requested the Government to be good enough to indicate both the exact legal status of the National Federation of Petroleum Industry Workers, specifying the reasons for which, and any laws or regulations under which, this organisation has no legal existence and the exact legal status of the Union of Workers in the Petroleum (Distilling and Refining) Industry of the States of Guanabara and Rio de Janeiro.
.At the same time the Committee considered that it might have a clearer idea of the situation if it obtained certain information from the complainant Federation.
.It therefore requested the complainant organisation to provide all relevant information on its Constitution and its numerical importance in comparison with the total number of workers in the occupation represented by it and the number of unions affiliated to it, stating in particular whether the Union of Workers in the Petroleum (Distilling and Refining) Industry of the States of Guanabara and Rio de Janeiro is one of its affiliates.
.In two letters dated  March  the parties concerned were requested to send the supplementary information referred to above in paragraphs  and .
.The Government replied by a communication dated  April . The complainant organisation, on the other hand, did not respond to the request for information which had been sent to it. However, the Government's communication gave some of the information the Committee had wanted to find out from the complainant, showing in particular that the Union of Workers in the Petroleum (Distilling and Refining) Industry of the States of Guanabara and Rio de Janeiro had at one time been affiliated to the National Federation of Petroleum Industry Workers.""
.In its reply, the Government states that the National Federation of Petroleum Industry Workers was set up on  June  by seven petroleum unions from different states. The names of these unions are supplied. In addition to these founder unions, says the Government, five others, of which it gives the names and which include the Union of Workers in the Petroleum (Distilling and Refining) Industry of the States of Guanabara and Rio de Janeiro, later became affiliated.
.The Government then goes on to give the following information. The organisation of federations by unions is governed by section  of the Labour Code, which lays down that: "" Not fewer than five industrial associations which represent the absolute majority of a group of identical, similar or allied activities or occupations may form a federation.

187,".This case has already been examined by the Committee at its session in February , at which an interim report was presented containing a detailed analysis of the allegations formulated, together with observations by the Government relating to these allegations. The recommendations submitted to the Governing Body by the Committee after consideration of this case at its session in February  are contained in paragraph  of its th Report, which reads as follows:Accordingly, with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to take note of the fact that the mobilisation of employees of the National Fuel, Alcohol and Portland Cement Administration, the State Sanitation Service and the Telecommunications Administration has been terminated;(b) to take note of the Government's statement that the individuals arrested under the prompt measures of security were immediately released, that the occupation of various trade union premises was purely temporary and that the freedom of trade union organisations to conduct their own affairs is recognised;(c) to request the Government to be good enough to inform it more specifically of the present position of the union leaders Ramn Freire Pizzano and Otilio Barragn;(d) to draw the Government's attention to the principle set forth in paragraph  above concerning the mobilisation of workers and to request the Government to inform it of the present position in this respect of the employees of the State Telephone Services and the state-owned banks;(e) to draw the Government's attention similarly to the provision of safeguards for civil servants and employees of essential services who are deprived of the right to strike and the development of voluntary bargaining procedures, and to request it to be good enough to supply details of any developments which may have occurred in this respect;(f) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will present a further report to the Governing Body once it has received the additional information requested from the Government in subparagraphs (c), (d) and (e) above..A communication was received from the Government dated  April  following the request for additional information formulated in the above-quoted paragraph.
.A communication was received from the Government dated  April  following the request for additional information formulated in the above-quoted paragraph.
.The Government, in its reply, indicates that Mr. Freire Pizzano, who was arrested under the prompt measures of security on  June , was released on  July of the same year. As regards Mr. Barragn, arrested in the same circumstances on  July , he was released on  August.
.The measures of security applied at that time, says the Government, were cancelled by virtue of a decree, dated  March , issued by the Executive Power, and at present mobilisation measures do not apply to civil servants.
.The Government concludes that it applies and will continue to apply the principles laid down in paragraph  of the th Report relating to safeguards to be presented to workers deprived of the right to strike, and in support of this statement it submits the text of an Act dated  December  relating to conciliation procedures applicable to the given categories of workers.
.In view of the above, having noted in the information supplied by the Government, on the one hand, that the union leaders, Mr. Freire Pizzano and Mr. Barragn have been released and, on the other, that all measures for the mobilisation of civil servants have been cancelled, the Committee recommends that the Governing Body decide that this case does not call for further examination.
.The complaints are contained in communications from the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions, dated  July , the World Confederation of Labour, dated  July , the Trade Unions International of Public and Allied Employees, dated  August , and the World Federation of Trade Unions, dated  October . These communications were forwarded to the Uruguayan Government, which sent its observations on  November .
.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee observes that this case involves basically a series of measures taken by the Uruguayan Government-prompt measures of security similar to a state of emergency, the freezing of wages and prices, and the mobilisation of workers-which particularly affected the public sector of the economy, since the workers who were called up were employed by various state agencies. These security measures, according to the complainants, were not justified and were designed solely to facilitate the imposition of a wage freeze. Using these powers, the Government had repressed the series of claims formulated by the workers who were striving to protect their wages at a time of acute inflation. This repression had, allegedly, led to serious infringements of trade union rights in that the exercise of the right to strike had been impeded by the mobilisation of the workers concerned, meetings had been forbidden, trade union officials had been dismissed and imprisoned, etc.
.In other cases dealt with by the Committee in which complaints had been made of alleged infringements of freedom of association under a state of siege or emergency or by virtue of national security legislation, the Committee, while indicating that it is not called upon to comment on the necessity for or desirability of such legislation, which is a purely political consideration, has always taken the view that it must consider what repercussions the legislation might have on trade union rights.
.In the present case, the legislation in question led firstly to the mobilisation of employees of banks and other state agencies such as the Telecommunications, Sanitation and Fuel Administrations. On other occasions when the Committee has had to examine cases involving the mobilisation of workers, it has taken the view that such a measure is of an exceptional nature in a labour dispute in view of the gravity of its consequences with regard to personal freedoms and trade union rights and could only be justified by the need to ensure the working of essential services or industries whose suspension would lead to ail acute crisis. This is what appears to be the case from the text of the decree concerning the prompt measures of security, according to which not only had work been paralysed in the state banking system and in public administration in general, thereby preventing the normal working of various services which were essential to the administration of the country and the community, but there had also been a climate of violence and breaches of law and order.
.As regards the other measures by the Government to which the complainants refer-the arrest and dismissal of trade unionists and workers and the occupation of union premises-they appear to have been a direct result of the strikes which occurred after the emergency decree had been issued and the state employees mobilised. With regard more particularly to the arrest of trade unionists, the Committee takes note of the Government's general statement to the effect that all the individuals arrested under the emergency decree were immediately released. The Government specifically refers to Mr. Miguel Angel Olascoaga and Mr. Luis Alberto Iguini, leaders of the Confederation of Civil Servants' Organisations, both of whom were set free on  July . The Government makes no mention of Mr. Ramn Freire Pizzano or Mr. Otilio Barragn, both leaders of the CNT, who, according to the communication dated  October  from the World Federation of Trade Unions, were also arrested.
.With regard to the occupation of trade union premises by the police and the army-according to the complainants, the headquarters of the Uruguayan Federation of Commercial and Industrial Employees, the CNT and the Association of Bank Employees-the Committee notes the Government's statement that this occupation was only temporary and took place in accordance with the emergency decree. The Committee accordingly presumes that the premises were duly handed back to the respective trade union organisations.
.The Committee likewise notes that at the end of August  the mobilisation of employees of the ANCAP, the OSE and the Telecommunications Administration was terminated. It would appear, therefore, that this measure is still in force in the case of the UTE and the state-owned banks.
.As regards the suspension of the activities of the tripartite group set up to examine the question of wages and the anti-inflationary measures that should be taken-a step which occurred before the issue of the emergency decree, the mobilisation of the workers and the freezing of wages-the Committee notes that the Government makes no specific reference to this point in its reply. The Government merely states that inflation was nullifying the effect of the apparent advantages of higher wages, and that it therefore decided to impose a freeze on both wages and prices. However, the Government explains that this was a temporary measure and that subsequently increases were granted in both the public and the private sectors.
.The Committee considers that the establishment of the tripartite group was in accordance with the provision in",0,1968,Uruguay

189,".The Committee has previously examined this case at its session held in February , when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body which is contained in paragraphs  to  of its th Report.
.Ecuador has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complaint, which is in telegraphic form, consists of allegations that certain members of the complainant organisation were persecuted and imprisoned for having submitted petitions for an improvement in their conditions and that their legal adviser, Dr. Guillermo Guerrero Villagmez, has likewise been imprisoned. The Government, in its reply, stated that certain employees in the Subdirectorate for Flight Protection had submitted a series of petitions for better conditions and that the General Directorate of Civil Aviation had arranged meetings with the staff of the Subdirectorate in question "" for the purpose of giving an account both of the action which it had taken on behalf of its employees and of the obligations of the latter towards the Directorate "". These meetings, continued the Government, were never held, as the staff was prevented from attending by certain other employees of the Subdirectorate, who were punished for their actions. In consequence, some of the staff of the Subdirectorate left their work in contravention of the provisions of the Constitution, whereupon the authorities took certain measures, as provided for by law, in order to avoid the paralysis of commercial air transport activities. The Government further stated that civilian employees of the General Directorate of Civil Aviation constituted a special class of employees subject, under the Political Constitution, to military jurisdiction and, in respect of discipline, to the regulations of the Directorate. As to the allegation that the legal adviser to the Association had been imprisoned, the Government stated that the Directorate knows of no order for the arrest of Dr. Villagmez, nor of any other members of the Association, and that, while the Directorate was always prepared to discuss the demands of its staff, it was also determined to maintain order and would not allow commercial air services to be disrupted.
.The Committee, when examining the case at its meeting in February , pointed out that the presentation of claims by these employees through the intermediary of an industrial association had not led to the initiation of talks with that organisation, but merely to the calling together of the workers concerned by the General Directorate of Civil Aviation with a view to giving them an account "" both of the action which it had taken on behalf of its employees and of the obligations of the latter towards the Directorate "". Further, the Committee considered that civil aviation personnel could not be deemed by virtue of the functions they performed to belong to the armed forces with a view to excluding them from the guarantees provided for under the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ). In the Committee's view, civil aviation personnel were public servants who were automatically covered by the provisions of Convention No. , which contains no exception clause for the case of public servants. Nor should they be excluded from the guarantees afforded under Convention No. , for although Article  of this Convention allows for the exclusion of "" public servants engaged in the administration of the State "", civil aviation personnel clearly do not fall within the scope of this exception. The recommendations of the Committee, as set forth in paragraph  of its th Report and approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (March ), read as follows:
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the Government's attention to the principles and standards cited above and to invite the Government to consider the adoption of such measures as are necessary to promote voluntary negotiation with a view to the regulation of the terms and conditions of employment of workers employed by the commercial air transport service;(b) to draw the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to this case;(c) with regard to the allegations relating to the arrest of the legal adviser and various members of the Association of Aeronautical Technicians of Ecuador-since the Director-General of Civil Aviation declares that he has no knowledge of the order for these arrests-to request the Government to enlighten it as to the situation in which these persons find themselves at present, on the understanding that the Committee will report again as soon as it is in possession of this information.
.By a communication dated  May , the Government sent its observations on the points raised by the Committee in paragraph  of its th Report (above). The Government declares that the matters referred to in the complaint have been settled, that the employees in question are now back at work and that the economic sanctions which had been imposed on them have been lifted. The Government further states that the Association of Aeronautical Technicians has no connection with the General Directorate of Civil Aviation, and this, together with the fact that the complaint is not supported by any documentary evidence, and that the matter has not been pursued further at the national level, has convinced the Government that the complaint was filed purely to harm the General Directorate of Civil Aviation and the Ecuadorian Air Force.
.As regards the specific points raised by the Committee in its interim report, the Government declares that Dr. Guillermo Guerrero Villagmez was imprisoned as a result of an error committed by the police, but that he was immediately released. Further, to the best of its knowledge, no members of the complainant association have been persecuted. As regards the recommendations contained in subparagraph (a) of paragraph  of the Committee's interim report, the Government states that the General Directorate of Civil Aviation maintains the best possible relations with a number of organisations, but that the actual relations between the Directorate and its staff are governed by staff regulations which have been drawn up in accordance with the provisions of section  of the Armed Forces Personnel Act. The Government also states that it complies with all International Labour Conventions and treats all lawfully constituted employees' organisations with the respect due to them, as evidence of which it indicates that at present there exists an association of the Directorate's own staff approved by the Minister of Labour which is allowed to carry on its activities freely. In conclusion, the Government recalls that Conventions Nos.  and , to which reference is made in the interim report, provide for the exemption of members of the armed forces from the guarantees provided for therein, and that, under section  of the Political Constitution of the State of Ecuador, employees of the General Directorate of Civil Aviation form part of the armed forces of the country.
.From the information before it, the Committee considers that the essential problem of this case concerns the representation of the employees of the Directorate by an occupational organisation for the purposes of collective bargaining. The Directorate had not recognised the Association of Aeronautical Technicians, which had presented claims on behalf of these employees, and referred to various provisions of national legislation according to which the workers concerned were subject to military jurisdiction.
.The Committee is of the opinion that, while the employees in question are employed by the State, they do not fall within the special subcategory of "" public servants engaged in the administration of the State "" and should therefore enjoy the various guarantees provided for in Conventions Nos.  and . It is, moreover, the Committee's view that, had the Directorate entered into discussions with the Association, the events which had led to the filing of the complaint might never have occurred.
.The Committee notes that in the interim the employees of the Directorate have established an association of their own, which appears to be recognised by the Directorate. However, the Committee also notes that the Government once again draws attention to the fact that the employees of the Directorate form part of the armed forces and that, in consequence, they may be excluded from the provisions of Conventions Nos.  and . From this it would not seem that the Government would be prepared to extend recognition of the above-mentioned association to recognition for collective bargaining purposes. While the Committee appreciates that this situation may flow from Constitutional provisions at present in force in Ecuador, it must, nevertheless, insist on the views expressed in paragraphs  and  above.
.In all these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to invite the Government once more to consider the adoption of such measures as are necessary to promote voluntary negotiation with a view to the regulation of the terms and conditions of employment of workers employed by the commercial air",-1,1969,Ecuador

.The complaint of the Association of Aeronautical Technicians of Ecuador is contained in a communication dated  June  addressed to the President of the International Labour Conference. The text of this communication was transmitted to the Government, which forwarded its observations on  October .
.Ecuador has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complaint, in telegraphic form, protests against the imprisonment of Dr. Guillermo Guerrero Villagmez, legal adviser to the complaining organisation. The ILO is requested to intervene to persuade the Government to cease the persecution and imprisonment suffered by members of that organisation merely because they have submitted requests for better economic conditions.
.The Government's reply consists mainly in information supplied by the Director-General of Civil Aviation. According to this official a group of employees in the Sub-Directorate for Flight Protection submitted a series of petitions to the authorities responsible for labour questions through the intermediary of the Association of Aeronautical Technicians of Ecuador. The Director-General goes on to state that, even though the Association has no connection whatsoever with the Directorate of Civil Aviation, the latter, with the aim of resolving any possible difficulties, called meetings of the staff of the Sub-Directorate in question, in Quito and in Guayaquil, "" for the purpose of giving an account both of the action which it had taken on behalf of its employees and of the obligations of the latter towards the Directorate "". It was not possible to hold these meetings owing to the fact that the staff invited to attend them were prevented from doing so by three employees of the Sub-Directorate for the Coastal Region and four employees working at Quito Airport, who were punished for their action in accordance with the relevant regulations. In the light of this situation, some of the staff of the Sub-Directorate for Flight Protection left their work, in opposition to the principles laid down in the Constitution, whereupon the authorities took certain measures, as provided for by law, in order to avoid, in this way, the paralysis of commercial air-transport activities.
.The Director-General goes on to explain that civilian employees of the General Directorate of Civil Aviation are subject to military penal jurisdiction and, in respect of discipline, to the regulations of the Directorate. He refers in this connection to article  of the Political Constitution of the State, which lays down that "" all serving members of the armed forces and the civil police shall be subject to military or police orders and jurisdiction respectively. The same shall apply to those civilian employees who serve in these bodies. "" In addition, section , subsection , of the Act concerning the personnel of the armed forces lays down that "" all civilian employees and specialists under contract serving in the armed forces shall be subject to military penal jurisdiction and, in respect of discipline, to the appropriate regulations "".
.The Director-General of Civil Aviation declares that the Directorate has no knowledge of the order for the arrest of the legal adviser and other officials of the Association of Aeronautical Technicians of Ecuador, since it is not within its competence to order the detention of any person. He concludes with the assurance that the Directorate has always been prepared to enter cordially into conversations with its staff and satisfy those of their demands which it considers to be justified, but that it is also determined to maintain order and discipline and will not allow commercial air services to be disrupted, with serious consequences for both users and carriers.
.The Committee notes from the information supplied by the Government that the persons involved in this case are civilian employees working for the commercial air transport service, who fall within the jurisdiction of the armed forces. The submission of a series of claims by these employees through the intermediary of an industrial association did not lead to the initiation of talks with that organisation but to the calling together of the workers concerned by the General Directorate of Civil Aviation with a view to giving them an account "" both of the action which it had taken on behalf of its employees and of the obligations of the latter towards the Directorate "". This sparked off a chain of events which led to the presentation of the complaint now before the Committee.
.In the light of the comments made by the Government the Committee is of the opinion that in the present case it is necessary first and foremost to determine the extent to which the workers involved are covered by the guarantees set forth in the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ). Both Conventions allow national legislation to exclude the armed forces from the guarantees provided for therein. In the Committee's view the workers concerned cannot be deemed, by virtue of the functions they perform, to belong to the armed forces with a view to excluding them from coverage by the Conventions, but should be classified as employees of the State or public servants for the purposes of these instruments.
.The position of such officials under the Conventions in question is as follows. As concerns Convention No. , which speaks of "" workers ... without distinction whatsoever "" (Article ), all public servants are covered by the guarantees for which it provides in respect of the right to organise. As for Convention No. , Article  allows for the exclusion of "" public servants engaged in the administration of the State "". In this respect the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has pointed out that while the concept of public servant may vary to some degree under the various national legal systems, the exclusion from the scope of the Convention of public servants who do not act as agents of the public authority is contrary to the meaning of the Convention. The distinction to be drawn, therefore, according to the Committee of Experts, would appear to be, basically, between civil servants employed in various capacities in government ministries or comparable bodies-that is public servants who, by their functions, are directly engaged in the administration of the State as well as lower-ranking officials who act as supporting elements in these activities-on the one hand, and other persons employed by the Government, by public undertakings or by autonomous public institutions, on the other hand. The Committee on Freedom of Association observes that the civil aviation technicians involved in the present case obviously do not fall within the category of employees of the State whose functions justify their exclusion from the scope of Convention No. .
.It follows that, firstly, the personnel in question should have the right-guaranteed by Convention No. -to establish and to join organisations of their own choosing for the defence of their interests. Secondly, it is necessary to apply to such workers the provisions of Article  of Convention No. , which states that "" measures appropriate to national conditions shall be taken, where necessary, to encourage and promote the full development and utilisation of machinery for voluntary negotiation between employers or employers' organisations and workers' organisations, with a view to the regulation of terms and conditions of employment by means of collective agreements "". In this respect the Committee has already stressed in previous cases the importance it attaches to the principle that employers, including government authorities in their capacity as employers, should recognise for the purposes of collective bargaining the organisations representative of the workers.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the Government's attention to the principles and standards cited above and to invite the Government to consider the adoption of such measures as are necessary to promote voluntary negotiation with a view to the regulation of the terms and conditions of employment of workers employed by the commercial air transport service;(b) to draw the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to this case;(c) with regard to the allegations relating to the arrest of the legal adviser and various members of the Association of Aeronautical Technicians of Ecuador-since the Director-General of Civil Aviation declares that he has no knowledge of the order for these arrests-to request the Government to enlighten it as to the situation in which these persons find themselves at present, on the understanding that the Committee will report again as soon as it",-1,1969,Ecuador
192,".The Committee examined this case for the first time at its meeting in November , when it submitted an interim report, contained in paragraphs  to  of its st Report, which was approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session (March ). In it, the Committee asked the Government to supply certain additional information. When this was received, the Committee once more examined the case, at its meeting in February , following which it submitted its final conclusions to the Governing Body. These conclusions, which were set forth in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, were approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (February-March ). In a communication dated  August , the Government submitted comments on the conclusions of the Committee and the Governing Body, thus necessitating a re-examination of the case.
.Mexico has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but it has not ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the light of the information received, the Committee had summarised the case as follows. On  June  the Staff Union of Embotelladora del Norte, SA, concluded a ten-day agreement with the management of the firm on various problems that had arisen in connection with the interpretation of certain clauses of the collective agreement then in force. The agreement provided that, on the expiry of the ten days, the union and the management should reach a final solution to the problems. On  June , i.e. a few days after the period had expired, the firm proceeded to dismiss  workers belonging to the union, including members of the executive committee (the reason advanced being that there had been an unwarranted stoppage of work on  and  June), the only persons not affected by this measure being four workers who had joined a new union. Notice of the dismissal was given to the Central Conciliation and Arbitration Board on  June. On the same day the Staff Union presented the Board with a series of complaints and notified the company of its intention to call a strike on the grounds that the firm had failed to abide by the collective agreement and ordered the dismissals. Also on  June, another organisation, the Union of Workers of Aerated Water, Bottling and Allied Plants, was registered with the Board as a member of the Mexican Confederation of Labour, and a collective agreement, concluded between this new union and the firm, was filed with the Board on the same day.
.On  June the Board nevertheless arranged a meeting, which was attended by the Staff Union of Embotelladora del Norte, SA, and the management, and on the following day a count was made, with the help of the Board, of the workers in favour of the strike, as required by law, including the workers who had been dismissed. The same day, the Board gave a ruling to the effect that the strike was "" non-existent "", the reasons adduced being that the workers had been dismissed before the complaints were submitted and before notice had been given of the strike, that they were consequently not entitled to have their votes included in the count and, this being so, that the majority required by law had not been reached.
.The union concerned applied for an injunction against this ruling, which was granted. For various reasons the magistrate considered that the workers who had been dismissed should be included in the count and decided that the Board should determine whether or not the strike was lawful on the basis of the number of votes cast, including those cast by the workers who had been dismissed.
.The firm appealed against this decision, and the appeal was heard by the Court of the Eighth Circuit, which overruled the decision contained in the injunction, with the result that the original ruling declaring the strike to be "" non-existent "" remained valid. The Court considered, in particular, that the firm had already dismissed the workers belonging to the union, and had already terminated the collective agreement before the union submitted its complaints and gave notice of a strike, that the union was no longer entitled to represent such workers, that it was impossible to recognise a strike by persons not in the service of the undertaking and that the notice of the strike was intended to secure compliance with a collective agreement that had already been rescinded.
.At its session in February  the Committee considered that it was not called upon in this case to examine the legislation or the decisions taken as regards the lawfulness or unlawfulness of the strike, but rather the basic aspect of the dismissal of workers belonging to the Staff Union of Embotelladora del Norte, SA, in an effort to determine whether, in the light of the available information, the action taken constituted an unfair practice on the part of the firm, as the complainants allege. The Committee drew attention to the principle contained in Convention No. , that workers must enjoy adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment and that such protection shall apply, more particularly in respect of acts calculated, inter alia, to cause the dismissal of, or otherwise prejudice, a worker by reason of union membership.
.The Committee noted that the firm had signed a provisional agreement with the union to the effect that both parties would endeavour to reach a final solution to the problems that had arisen. The firm nevertheless proceeded to dismiss all the workers belonging to the union, except four who had joined a new union. The reason advanced for the dismissal was that the workers concerned had taken part in an unwarranted stoppage of work, even though the stoppage had taken place several days previously, i.e. while the provisional agreement temporarily resolving the dispute was being negotiated. Furthermore, on the day following the dismissals, the firm signed a collective agreement with a separate union, which was registered with the authorities on the same day.
.The Committee considered that all these facts clearly indicated that the dismissal was motivated by the trade union membership of the workers concerned and that its purpose was to prevent the union representing them from defending their interests by collective bargaining or by resorting to strike action. In the Committee's opinion, this was plainly an act of anti-union discrimination by the firm and the Committee regretted that the authorities had not taken, or had not been able to take, the necessary steps to protect the workers and the trade union concerned.
.In its comments on these conclusions, the Government states that in any country subject to the rule of law, where legislation exists to protect workers, the measures taken depend on whether the parties to the dispute take their case to the judicial or the administrative labour authorities.
.In this particular instance, the Government adds, the case was taken to the judicial authorities following the issue of a written strike order after the workers' dismissal; at no time prior to this were the labour authorities asked to intervene. The Arbitration Board was therefore bound to decide that the situation could not be reversed since there was no point or time at which it was empowered to rule on the dismissals.
.The law, states the Government, empowers an employer and a worker to terminate a contract of employment unilaterally for good reason and the termination remains operative unless the worker is reinstated by order of a labour court of the first instance on the ground that the employer was not justified in making the dismissal.
.The Government goes on to state that the decisions by the Arbitration Board and the Court of the Eighth Circuit were fully in accordance with Mexican legislation and case law. Moreover, the courts, in the decisions with which the Committee's report was concerned, merely ruled on the existence or non-existence of a strike. These decisions in no way prejudge the character of the dismissals. A court order as to whether or not a strike exists does not cover the substance of the dispute. This view is endorsed by the Supreme Court of Justice.
.As in its previous communications, the Government states that the parties to the dispute enjoyed the benefits of due process of law. The authorities intervened at a particular time and their conduct can only be judged with effect from that moment. "" Breach of the law or bad faith by management, even if they occur, are not the fault of the Government, especially if they took place before the authorities were notified of a dispute between private parties. The Government's conduct (through the Board, which was required to determine whether or not a strike could be deemed to exist) cannot be interpreted either as inability to prevent something that had already happened when it was called in, i.e. the dismissals, or as consent, since it was not asked to settle the substance of the dispute but only",-1,1969,Mexico
193,"an incidental aspect, viz. whether or not a strike existed.""
.In the Government's view, to regret that the authorities have not taken or have not been able to take the necessary steps (see paragraph  above) is to assume that the judicial authorities can take arbitrary action and ignore the law, whereas they are able to operate only within the framework of their function and according to the way the parties state their case. The executive or administrative authorities in a State subject to the rule of law are bound to abide by the decisions of the judicial authorities, which in Mexico possess the functional autonomy they need to discharge their responsibility.
.In this particular case, the Government continues, the labour and federal courts as the sole interpreters of the law (under the Constitution) decided that "" the dismissed workers could not be included in the count of a strike ballot and that the strike itself was nonexistent. In concerning themselves with the strike, they did not decide whether or not the dismissals were justified, since this aspect would require a separate judgement "".
."" The Government as a whole "" it states "" takes, and can only take, such measures in the field of freedom of association as its legislation and law in general permit "".
.Quite apart from whether or not a strike existed, the Government affirms that the workers were covered by the law at all times, since in addition to exercising their right to strike they submitted claims (either individually or collectively) for reinstatement in their former jobs, combined with maintenance of their acquired rights with regard to seniority, wages, overtime, savings fund contributions, profit sharing, holidays with pay and wages since  June .
.The claims came before the body called No.  Special Group (Industry). The Government points out that hardly had the complaint been submitted and the hearing begun, when the complainants began to withdraw their demands. Between  June  and  November ,  of the original  claimants withdrew and in January  the defence counsel requested that the cases of the remaining  workers be allowed to lapse. When the case came before the labour court, the latter upheld this request and declared the case to have lapsed with respect to the remaining workers who had not withdrawn their claim. The plaintiffs queried this decision, but their argument was rejected, although they were informed that the decisions could be challenged under the protection of rights legislation, i.e. they were "" at liberty to enforce their rights in accordance with the ordinary provisions of the law "". The Government concludes by stating that the complainants did not lodge any appeal against the decision.
.The Committee notes that the Government's comments relate to two main points: the procedure followed and decisions given regarding the lawfulness or unlawfulness of the strike; and the proceedings instituted by the injured workers and the results.
.As regards the former point, the Committee has already said that it does not consider that it is called upon to examine the legislation or the decisions taken concerning the lawfulness or unlawfulness of the strike (see paragraph  above).
.As regards the dismissals involved in this case, the Government argues that the workers concerned were covered by the legal safeguards against unfair dismissal and initially at least made use of the opportunities for appeal open to them in order to secure redress. The fact that the majority of them subsequently withdrew and the remainder did not follow their appeals through does not alter the situation that these opportunities exist and are open to all who consider that they have been injured. The Committee does not suggest that these procedures were not properly followed.
.Nevertheless, the fact remains that the dismissals in question involved all workers belonging to the union making the complaint (with the exception of four who joined another union) and that this sweeping measure not only deprived the workers concerned of their jobs because of their trade union membership but also entailed the disappearance of the union itself since it was a plant union. The Committee further notes that on the same day- June -the competent authority, namely the Central Conciliation and Arbitration Board, officially took cognisance of the dismissal of the workers concerned, registered the new union which had just been set up and filed the new collective agreement concluded at the same time between this new union and the management (see paragraph  above). The sequence of events compels the Committee to conclude that the management was engaging in a typical unfair practice and a definite act of anti-union discrimination directed equally against individual workers and the organisation to which they belonged.
.In view of these facts, which are not disputed by the Government, the Committee is bound to conclude that in this case "" adequate protection "" was not given against acts of anti-union discrimination; these acts had the effect of causing the disappearance of the union itself, since it was an independent union consisting solely of workers in the undertaking.
.Accordingly, in order to ensure that situations such as the present case should not recur, the Committee, as when it last examined the case, can only recommend the Governing Body once more to request the Government to be good enough to examine ways and means of providing adequate protection, in accordance with the generally recognised principles on the subject, to both workers and trade unions affected by such forms of anti-union discrimination.
.The Committee examined this complaint at its meeting in November , when it submitted an interim report appearing in paragraphs  to  of its st Report, which was approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session (March ). In this report, the Committee requested the Government to supply certain further information.
.The Government sent further information relating to the case in two communications dated  May  and  February .
.Mexico has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but has not ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the light of all the information received by the Committee and, in particular, the text of the judgements communicated by the Government, the case may be summarised as follows.
.On  June , the Staff Union of Embotelladora del Norte SA concluded a ten-day agreement with the management of the firm on various problems that had arisen in connection with the interpretation of certain clauses of the collective agreement then in force. The agreement provided that on the expiry of the ten days the union and the management should reach a final solution to the problems. On  June , i.e. a few days after the period had expired, the firm proceeded to dismiss  workers belonging to the union, including members of the executive committee (the reason advanced being that there had been an unwarranted stoppage of work on  and  June), the only persons not affected by this measure being four workers who had joined a new union. Notice of the dismissal was given to the Central Conciliation and Arbitration Board on  June. On the same day the Staff Union presented the Board with a series of complaints and notified the company of its intention to call a strike on the grounds that the firm had failed to abide by the collective agreement and had ordered the dismissals. Also on  June, another organisation, the Union of Workers of Aerated Water, Bottling and Allied Plants, was registered with the Board as a member of the Mexican Confederation of Labour (CTM), and a collective agreement, concluded between this new union and the firm, was filed with the Board on the same day.
.On  June, the Board nevertheless arranged a meeting, which was attended by the Staff Union of Embotelladora del Norte SA and the management. On the following day a count was made with the help of the Board, as required by law, of the workers in favour of the strike including those who had been dismissed. The same day the Board gave a ruling to the effect that the strike was "" non-existent "", the reasons adduced being that the workers had been dismissed before the complaints were submitted and before notice had been given of the strike, that they were consequently not entitled to have their votes included in the count and, this being so, that the majority required by law had not been reached.
.The union concerned applied for an injunction against this ruling, which was granted. For various reasons the magistrate considered that the workers who had been dismissed should be included in the count and decided that the Board should determine whether or not the strike was lawful on the basis of the number of votes cast, including those cast by the workers who had been dismissed.
.The firm appealed against this decision and the appeal was heard by the Court of the Eighth Circuit, which overruled the decision contained in the injunction, with",-1,1969,Mexico
194,".The Committee last examined this case at its session in May , when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body, which appeared in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (May-June ).
.Certain questions, however, remain outstanding, notably those concerning the present position of the State Electricity and Telephone Service (UTE) and, in particular, the closing of its premises and the nature of the breaches of discipline which prompted the dismissal of members of the Management Committee of the UTE Employees' Union (AUTE). On these points the Government was requested to supply further information.
.The Government submitted its further observations on the case in a communication dated  August .
.Uruguay has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In paragraph  of its th Report, the Committee submitted the following recommendations, which were approved by the Governing Body and transmitted to the Government
.With regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the allegations concerning the detention of various trade unionists, to note the information supplied by the Government in its communications of  March  and  March , according to which all those persons mentioned in the allegations as having been detained have either been released or else were not imprisoned in the first place, and also to note that at present no one is being held under the Emergency Security Measures Decree;(b) as regards the allegations concerning the closing of the premises of the National Labour Congress (CNT) to ask the Government to supply information concerning the present position regarding the CNT and, in particular, to state whether its premises still remain closed and, if so, for what reason;(c) as regards the allegations concerning the taking of anti-union measures against the AUTE:(i) to note the Government's statement contained in its communication of  March , according to which the state of normality in labour and trade union matters in the AUTE implies the right of the trade union(s) to carry out under normal conditions all lawful and legitimate activities, including that of negotiating with the management;(ii) to ask the Government, once again, to supply detailed information on the nature of the breaches of discipline which prompted the dismissal of members of the Management Committee of the AUTE;(d) to take note of this interim report on the understanding that the Committee will submit a further report when it has received the further information requested from the Government in subparagraphs (b) and (e) (ii) above.
.With regard to the Committee's first question, the Government, in its communication of  August , states that the premises of the CNT have not been closed, that this organisation is not the object of any police or other measures which would prevent it from functioning normally and that, in consequence, it is carrying on all its activities with complete freedom. With regard to the second question, the Government denies the allegations according to which officials of the UTE had been dismissed for exercising trade union activities or for belonging to the AUTE. According to the Government, the dismissals in question were decided on  July  by a resolution of the UTE administration and as a result of the fact that a number of officials had illegally abandoned their work.
.The Government encloses in its communication of  August  a copy of the above-mentioned resolution as well as the text of section  of the Staff Regulations of UTE Employees, drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution of Uruguay.
.By this resolution some fifty-six officials were dismissed; their names and functions are specified in the text. The resolution also sets forth the considerations which prompted the decision in question. These considerations may be summarised as follows: the strike led to a sudden disruption of the electricity supply, with the result that the lives of the inmates of hospitals and similar establishments were endangered; a public summons was issued on  June , in accordance with the provisions of section  of the Staff Regulations, calling for a return to work within twenty-four hours; this summons was not followed by the employees in question; section , which forbids strikes of UTE employees, provides that those employees who disregard the above-mentioned summons shall be dismissed; moreover, since the strike was held in contravention of the provisions contained in sections  and  of Act No.  of  December , it was clearly illegal; this situation of illegality was rendered more serious by reason of the fact that there was a deliberate disregard of the provisions of the Decree respecting the mobilisation of the personnel of the Administration (No. /) and the Emergency Security Measures Decree (No. / of  June ); in all these circumstances and in view of the obvious and compelling needs of the essential, public service managed by the UTE, it was necessary to dismiss the employees concerned in accordance with the provisions of section  of the Staff Regulations.
.The Committee notes that the Government justifies the action taken by the authorities on the grounds that the strike in question was unlawful and that the summons calling for a return to work was disregarded by the employees concerned. The Government bases its position essentially on section  of the UTE Staff Regulations, which contains an absolute prohibition on recourse to strike action by UTE officials and on sections  and  of Act No.  of  December . Under section  of this Act, a Committee on Productivity, Prices and Incomes is to, inter alia, act as conciliator in labour disputes submitted to it; and no strike or lockout is to be considered lawful if the matter in dispute and the decision to take such action have not been put before it at least seven days before the date fixed for the strike or lockout. According to section  of the Act, if the dispute takes place in a public service, the Committee may decide within five days of receiving such notice what essential services have to be maintained; any interruption of the services will render the strike or lockout unlawful.
.The Committee has always been guided by the principle that allegations relating to the right to strike are within its competence so far as they affect the exercise of trade union rights) In a number of cases, the Committee has observed that, while strikes in essential services may be prohibited, such prohibition is only acceptable where accompanied by adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures in which the parties concerned can participate at all stages.
.In the present case, there is an absolute prohibition on recourse to strike action by the employees of an essential service. However, as regards any alternative means that the employees in question might have at their disposal for the settlement of their claims, the information supplied by the Government merely refers to certain provisions of Act No. , which provides for conciliation procedures.
.In all these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to take note of the Government's statement that the premises of the CNT have not been closed, that this organisation is not the object of any police or other measures which would prevent it from functioning normally and that, in consequence, it is carrying on all its activities with complete freedom;(b) to note that the dismissal of officers of the AUTE resulted from their participation in a strike in an essential service, where such action is prohibited by law;(c) to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that, where strikes are prohibited in essential services, such prohibition must be accompanied by adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures in which the parties concerned can participate at all stages.
.The Committee examined this case at its meeting in March  when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body which appeared in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (March ).
.Certain questions, however, remain outstanding, notably those concerning the alleged imprisonment of trade unionists, the closing of trade union premises and the taking of anti-union measures against the State Electricity and Telephone Service Employees' Union (AUTE). On these points the Government was requested to supply further information.
.The Government submitted its further observations on the case in two communications dated  March and  March .
.Uruguay has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).

.Jamaica has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The recommendations of the Committee, as set forth in paragraph  of its th Report, read as follows:
.Concerning the case as a whole the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to decide, for the reasons set out in paragraph  above, that the allegations concerning the refusal to admit the Jamaica Maritime Union to membership of the Joint Industrial Council of the Banana Board do not call for any further examination on its part;(b) to request the Government, concerning the allegations of non-recognition of the complainant union for the purposes of representing certain categories of worker, to indicate whether the expiry of the agreement linking Sprostons Jamaica Ltd. to the United Port Workers' and Seamen's Union has brought about any changes in the position of the Jamaica Maritime Union, and, if so, what the nature of the changes is;(c) to take note of the present interim report on the understanding that the Committee will submit a further report when it has received the supplementary information referred to in the preceding subparagraph.
.These recommendations were approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (May-June ) and the request for further information contained in paragraph  (b) of the Committee's th Report (cited above) was brought to the notice of the Government by a letter dated  June .
.In a letter dated  June , the Government states that, following the expiry of the agreement between Sprostons Jamaica Ltd. and the Union Port Workers' and Seamen's Union, the Ministry of Labour and National Insurance, at the request of the Jamaica Maritime Union, conducted a poll amongst seamen engaged on the ships in question on  February and  March . The results of this poll revealed that the majority of the workers were in favour of representation by the Jamaica Maritime Union, and the union was subsequently granted recognition by the company. The Government further states that both parties later met under the auspices of the Ministry of Labour and National Insurance in resolving a dispute affecting an employee of the company.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that the case does not call for further examination.
.The complaint of the Jamaica Maritime Union is contained in a communication addressed directly to the ILO on  May  and supplemented by a further communication dated  June . The original complaint and the further information supplied were communicated to the Government, which forwarded its observations on them in two communications dated  July and  August .
.Jamaica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.Concerning the case as a whole the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to decide, for the reasons set out in paragraph  above, that the allegations concerning the refusal to admit the Jamaica Maritime Union to membership of the Joint Industrial Council of the Banana Board do not call for any further examination on its part;(b) to request the Government, concerning the allegations of non-recognition of the complainant union for the purposes of representing certain categories of worker, to indicate whether the expiry of the agreement linking Sprostons Jamaica Ltd. to the United Port Workers' and Seamen's Union has brought about any changes in the position of the Jamaica Maritime Union, and, if so, what the nature of the changes is;(c) to take note of the present interim report on the understanding that the Committee will submit a further report when it has received the supplementary information referred to in the preceding subparagraph.",1,1969,Jamaica
196,".The complaint of the Independent Trade Unions Advisory Council is contained in two communications addressed to the ILO on  August and  September  respectively. The original complaint and the later communication in substantiation thereof were forwarded by a letter dated  August  to the Government, which furnished its observations thereon in a communication dated  November .
.Jamaica has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.It is alleged that the Service Station Attendants' Union, which is a registered trade union under Jamaican law, not having been recognised by a large number of employers in the petroleum retail trade, requested the Ministry of Labour to intervene on its behalf and in particular to carry out a number of fact-finding polls to ascertain, as is provided for by national law and practice, the representative character of the Union. In response to its request the Union was asked by the Ministry to supply certificates of membership of the various stations; these were supplied to a total of forty-three certificates up to  May . To date, it is alleged, not one of these polls has been taken.
.The complainants state that the failure of the Ministry to set in motion the machinery established for this purpose constitutes an infringement of trade union rights provided for under a number of Conventions, and, in particular, under Convention No. .
.The complainants further state that on  July  the Ministry of Labour announced that a New Minimum Wage Board governing the petroleum retail trade had been set up composed of representatives of the employers, the workers and of independent bodies, together with the Chairman and Secretary of the Board, and that, despite the fact that the Service Station Attendants' Union is the only organisation truly representative of the workers in the trade, it was not granted a single seat on the Board.
.As a preface to its observations the Government states that it not only supports the principles of freedom of association and the right of workers to bargain collectively but encourages, on a voluntary basis, autonomy in industry, and that to this end the Ministry of Labour and National Insurance provides machinery for the determination of representational issues arising out of claims by trade unions.
.With regard to the complaint itself the Government states that the Union asked the Ministry of Labour to intervene first in twelve and later in more cases of claims for representational rights and that, following a meeting held at the Ministry of Labour and National Insurance one employer did, in fact, grant representational rights to the Union. The Government claims, moreover, that the Ministry has not been in a position to ascertain whether the Union has made out a prima facie case for representation and, indeed, denies that the Union ever asked for the taking of fact-finding polls.
.The Government further states that the claims of the Union for representational rights have met with a great deal of resistance from the Petroleum Retailers' Association on the grounds, inter alia, that for economic reasons the employers in the trade will not be in a position to bargain with the Union until such time as the Minimum Wages Advisory Board for the Petrol Trade has completed its findings. In addition, the Association felt that the Union, by its action in certain establishments, was "" undermining all discipline, creating abuse to customers and generally leaving the employees with the impression that they were immune to any discipline.""
.The Government explains that in keeping with the Minimum Wage-Fixing Machinery Convention,  (No. ), it has been its policy to fix minimum wages in those trades where wages are unreasonably low, where there is little or no union organisation or where it is difficult to organise the workers and that in the present case, although provision exists for the full expression of all the parties concerned before the Board, the Minister has decided to enlarge its membership and has appointed a representative of the Service Station Attendants' Union thereto.
.According to information available to the Committee, there exists in Jamaica a system whereby the Ministry of Labour may intervene in cases where a union claims to be representative of workers in a particular industry or undertaking with a view to ascertaining the representative character of the organisation in question. There are two possible courses of action: where the agreement of both sides is obtained the Ministry may conduct an industrial poll, the results of which invariably settle the bargaining position of the union vis--vis the employer; where the agreement of the employer is not obtained, the claimant union may, subject to certain conditions being met, request the Ministry to conduct a fact-finding poll, the results of which, however, merely determine the wishes of the workers in respect of the claimant union. Moreover, in its observations in the present case the Government states that in order to take a fact-finding poll the Ministry must receive the co-operation of the employer, who is required to provide a list of his workers and permit the Ministry to enter and conduct the poll on his premises during working hours.
.The Committee notes that in the present case the complainants affirm and the Government denies that the taking of fact-finding polls was requested.
.The Committee has often drawn attention to the principle expressed in Article  of Convention No. , ratified by Jamaica, whereby governments should take measures appropriate to national conditions to encourage and promote the full development and utilisation of machinery for voluntary negotiation between employers or employers' organisations and workers' organisations, with a view to the regulation of terms and conditions of employment by means of collective agreements. The Committee has also attached considerable importance to the principle whereby employers should recognise organisations that are representative of workers in a particular industry for the purposes of collective bargaining.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to draw the attention of the Government to the above-mentioned principles and, in view of the fact that machinery exists in Jamaica for the promotion of the recognition of workers' organisations by employers, to request the Government to take all necessary steps to ensure that this machinery is fully utilised in order to give effect to these principles.",-1,1969,Jamaica
197,".The Committee examined this case at its session in May , when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body, which appeared in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (May-June ).
.The case comprised the following allegations: allegations relating to a clash between the police and workers at Puerto Limn; allegations relating to the dismissal of workers at the Luxform underwear factory; allegations regarding the threat of action against the workers' and peasants' movement; allegations regarding action against Mr. Juan Rafael Solis Barboza, press secretary of the complainant organisation, at the instigation of the Costa Rican authorities; allegations relating to the expulsion of union leaders from the banana-growing area owned by the Ticaban Company; allegations relating to the dismissal of trade unionists by plantation employers; allegations respecting an attack by government forces on trade union members in the Estrella valley.
.Among these allegations, only the last three remain pending, the Committee having submitted its final recommendations on all the others to the Governing Body, which approved them.
.With regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to decide, for the reasons stated in paragraph  above, that the allegation respecting the attack by government forces on trade union members during the course of an illegal strike in the Estrella valley calls for no further examination;(b) as regards the allegations relating to the expulsion of union leaders from the banana growing area owned by the Ticaban Company, to insist that the Government should take all legislative and other measures to establish and make effective the right of trade union leaders to enter plantations to exercise lawful trade union activities, as provided for by Legal Opinion No.  of ;(c) as regards the allegations relating to the dismissal of trade unionists by plantation employers, to take note of the information supplied by the Government concerning a Bill guaranteeing trade union rights and to request the Government to keep it informed on any developments in the situation;(d) to take note of the general information supplied by the Government and to request the latter to keep it informed of the results of the action it is taking, particularly concerning the redrafting of the Labour Code on matters of freedom of association.
.The complaint by the General Confederation of Costa Rican Workers was made in a communication dated  October  addressed directly to the ILO, supplemented by a further communication dated  November of the same year. The complaint, together with the supplementary information, was forwarded to the Government, which sent in its observations in a communication dated  April .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).

198,".These cases last came before the Committee at its February  session, when it submitted to the Governing Body an interim report, which is to be found in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (March ).
.In subparagraph (c) of paragraph  the Committee made certain recommendations to the Governing Body in regard to the allegations still pending, namely that the Government of Argentina be requested to supply information and observations concerning the alleged kidnapping of Mr. Raimundo Ongaro, the death of Mr. Emilio Juregui and the measures of anti-trade union discrimination said to have been taken against Mr. Carlos Bongiovani.
.The Argentinian Government has forwarded its observations by letters dated  May and  August .
.Argentina has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee earlier examined certain allegations by the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) according to which Mr. Ongaro, on his way to take part in a public meeting in Tucumn province in January , had been kidnapped by naval and police personnel and taken to a naval base near the city of Bahia Blanca, some , kilometres away from the place where he was arrested, and then released. In reply to these allegations the Government had denied the alleged kidnapping, pointing in evidence to the dismissal of the case by a judge on  April , and explaining that Mr. Ongaro had been invited by the police authorities not to continue his journey to Tucumn as it was feared that extremist elements would make use of his presence to cause disturbances, and had himself asked to be taken back.
.In view of the discrepancy between the two versions, the Committee at that time recommended that the Government be requested to forward the text of the court decision to which it had referred, together with the reasons (paragraph  (d) of the Committee's th Report). The Committee repeated this request at its February  session.
.In its communication of  May  the Government merely repeats that there never was any kidnapping.
.The Committee also examined a complaint by the WCL that Mr. Emilio Juregui had been murdered by the Argentinian police in a public street on  June . As the Government had not submitted its observations on that allegation, the Committee recommended the Governing Body to ask for information from the Government as to what action had been taken in order to clarify the matter and on any results of such investigations (paragraph  (f) (ii) of the Committee's th Report). This recommendation was also repeated by the Committee at its February  session.
.In its communication of  May  the Government states that the death of Mr. Juregui occurred during disturbances in Buenos Aires, and that the facts of the case have been communicated to the competent judicial authority. According to the Government Mr. Juregui was neither a trade union official nor a worker, and in view of the circumstances in which he met his death-during a street scuffle-the Government considers that it is not within the Committee's competence to concern itself with this aspect of the complaint.
.Lastly, the Committee examined a complaint presented on  November  by the WCL that Mr. Carlos Bongiovani, shop steward for the "" Consumer Routes "" (Rutas de Consumidores) section, had been suspended from his employment on account of his trade union activities. The Government, having been informed of this complaint, states in its communications of  May and  August  that it has no information about the person in question and that the National Industrial Relations Tribunal, a tripartite body which is competent to deal with all matters relating to the dismissal or suspension from employment of trade union representatives or modifications in their conditions of employment, has no record of this case either.
.With regard to the allegation relating to the kidnapping of Mr. Raimundo Ongaro, the Committee regrets that the Government has not forwarded, as requested, the text of the court decision, which would have furnished fresh evidence to assist the Committee in reaching its conclusions. As matters stand, in view of the time that has elapsed since the events in question are alleged to have taken place and the fact that no attempt was made to keep Mr. Ongaro in custody as a result of these events, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that no useful purpose would be served by examining this aspect of the case further.
.With regard to the allegations relating to Mr. Emilio Juregui and Mr. Carlos Bongiovani, the Committee takes note of the Government's observations, and in view of the lack of detailed information from the complainants concerning the persons in question and the circumstances in which the alleged events occurred, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that these aspects of the case do not call for further examination.
.The Committee examined these cases at its session in November , when it submitted an interim report (paragraphs  to  of its th Report) which was approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (- November ).
.In paragraph  of its th Report, the Committee submitted to the Governing Body a number of recommendations, some for the purpose of inviting the Argentine Government to send certain information in order that consideration of the corresponding allegations might be pursued. The Government sent further information in its communication dated  November , and the World Confederation of Labour submitted further allegations in a communication dated  November , relating to one of the aspects of the case, which were communicated to the Government. The recommendations formulated by the Committee were communicated to the Government, which replied in communications dated  December .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.With respect to these cases as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) concerning the allegations relating to the conviction of Mr. Elpidio Torres and other trade unionists by military tribunals, and the detention of Mr. Raimundo Ongaro and other trade unionists, to take note of the fact that the detainees have been released under the Act of Amnesty and other measures taken in this connection and to express its satisfaction that, according to the Government's statement, these measures make it quite certain that there are no trade union leaders deprived of their freedom anywhere in the country;(b) concerning the allegations relating to the appointment of a Government delegate to the CGT, to take note of the formation of the National Reorganising and Normalising Committee of the CGT, composed exclusively of trade union representatives, and to note that the functions of the Government delegate have been brought to an end; and to express the hope that trade union elections will be held as soon as possible, in conformity with the principle contained in Article  of Convention No. , ratified by Argentina, which recognises the right of workers' organisations to elect their representatives freely, without interference by the public authorities;(c) concerning the remaining allegations pending, to ask the Government once more to send, as soon as possible, the information previously requested regarding the allegations concerning the kidnapping of Mr. Ongaro and the death of Mr. Emilio Juregui, and to be good enough to formulate its observations on the allegation regarding the measures of anti-trade-union discrimination taken against Mr. Carlos Bongiovani-it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report when it has received this information.
.The original complaints and the additional information supplied in these three cases, which are dealt with together because they involve the same type of allegations, were contained in seven communications from the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) (dated  January,  May,  April,  May,  July,  July and  August ), two communications from the International Metalworkers' Federation (IMF) (dated  June and  July ), one communication from the Latin American Confederation of Christian Trade Unions (CLASC) (dated  July ), one communication from Argentine Trade Union Action (ASA) (dated  July ), two communications from the Trade Unions International of Chemical, Oil and Allied Workers (dated  and  August ) and one communication from the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) (dated  August ).
.As these communications were received, they were forwarded to the Government for its observations. These were received in four letters dated  May and ,  and  September  from the Permanent Mission of the Argentine Republic to the International Organisations in Geneva.

200,"importance of the principles given in the preceding paragraphs  to , and having taken note that the emergency measures, including those concerning the mobilisation of civil servants introduced in , had been repealed, the Committee, at its session in May , recommended the Governing Body to decide that Case No.  did not call for a more thorough examination on its part.
.The allegations made in the present case refer essentially to a new decree on emergency security measures promulgated by the Uruguayan Government on  June . It is stated in one of the complaints that the reason for the new security measures was the disquiet of the workers when faced by the wage freeze and the dismissal of its leaders, and it is alleged in another that, by the repeated application of such measures, the Government intends to make them the normal method of solving labour conflicts. The Government, for its part, categorically denies these allegations and submits the text of the provisions in question, according to which the security measures were introduced after the calling of a general strike intended to include the civil service and essential services provided by state agencies and aimed at interrupting various services and disrupting public order. The Government states that the system of security measures will remain in force for such a period as may be necessary for normality to be achieved, but that the measures for the mobilisation of workers have already been rescinded in respect of the workers employed by various state agencies; such measures appear to be still in force with respect to the workers in the State Telephone Service (UTE) where, to judge from the complaints, the conflict between the trade union organisation concerned and the authorities appears to have been particularly serious. In fact, so far as this conflict is concerned, the Committee observes that the complaints are not restricted to the mobilisation measures introduced on  June , but also contain allegations concerning the systematic refusal of the administrative authorities to meet the trade union representatives in order to discuss the problems affecting the workers, concerning the dismissal of numerous trade union officials, and concerning the prevention of the collection of union dues and the appropriation of the dues for a particular month. The Committee proposes to examine at its next session the reply of the Government to the allegation submitted in this connection by the UTE Employees' Union.
.Certain general measures provided for in the decree on emergency security measures appear, then, to be still in force, namely the prohibition of all propaganda in favour of stoppages and strikes, and of meetings connected therewith, the premises in which it is intended to hold such meetings being liable to closure; furthermore, it is still legally possible to arrest or detain any person, and consequently any trade unionist, without previous trial. The Government emphasises that its fundamental objective is to ensure liberty for all, including the trade unions, and states that all the measures were taken with this end in view, recalling also that the National Assembly, which continues to function normally, can order their rescission. Furthermore, the application of these measures within the legal framework is said to be ensured by the judiciary, whose independence is stressed by the Government.
.The Committee takes note of these observations of the Government, and takes note likewise, in particular, of its declaration that it is willing to agree to any procedure and any acceptable method of establishing proof in order to clarify the questions mentioned in the complaints concerning the reasons for the arrest of trade unionists under the system of emergency security measures and the treatment of those arrested and mobilised, and concerning the application of such measures as far as the trade union organisations are concerned.
.The Government states explicitly that it has neither dissolved nor taken over any trade union organisation. It follows from its observations that, as far as such organisations are concerned, it has applied to them only the prohibition of meetings connected with stoppages and strikes, this being provided for in the decree on security measures, which empowers the authorities to close the premises in which it is intended to hold such meetings. In this connection, certain allegations to which the Government has not specifically replied refer to the closing down of the headquarters of the CNT (whose officials are said to have been obliged to operate under conditions of clandestinity) and of the UTE Employees' Union; in addition, according to the complainants, the channels of communication of the unions have been blocked. In view of the importance which the Committee and the Governing Body have always given to the principle that the right of trade unions to meet freely in their own premises without the need for any prior authorisation and without any form of control by the authorities constitutes a fundamental element of freedom of association, and to the principle that the right to express opinions through the press or in any other way is certainly one of the essential elements of the rights of trade unions, the Committee considers that, in order to pursue the examination of such allegations with full knowledge of the case and to determine the scope of the security measures as far as the exercise of these rights is concerned, it would be useful to receive more precise information from the Government concerning the matter.
.With reference to the particular cases of arrest mentioned by the complainants, the Government has submitted information concerning six trade unionists who have been released, and two who are said not to have been arrested. On the other hand, the Government does not refer specifically to the alleged arrest of the trade unionists Ariel Mederos, Hugo Castro, Ricardo Mario Acosta, Humberto Rodriguez and Eduardo Platero, and has not yet submitted its observations concerning the complaint of the World Federation of Teachers' Unions.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to take note that, in their essentials, the questions of principle concerning the introduction by the Government of emergency security measures has already been examined by the Committee in its th and th Reports, approved by the Governing Body, in connection with an earlier case concerning Uruguay (Case No. );(b) with regard to the allegations made in the present case with respect to the security measures promulgated by the Decree of  June , to take note of the statements of the Government according to which no official, worker or employee has been arrested as such, the arrests-within the Constitutional system of the emergency security measures-having been made on the grounds of activities contrary to public order, subversive acts or contraventions of the above-mentioned decree; no industrial or trade union organisation has been taken over; no person has been maltreated or tortured, and no form of forced labour has been imposed, the Government being willing to agree to any procedure and any acceptable method of establishing proof in order to elucidate these matters;(c) to take note of the statement of the Government according to which the mobilisation of workers in various state agencies has already been rescinded, and that it is hoped that demobilisation will soon affect all those workers covered by the decrees which have been promulgated;(d) in view of the serious consequences that the mobilisation of workers may have from the point of view of the exercise of trade union rights, and the fact that such measures can be justified only by the need to ensure the functioning of essential services or industries the interruption of which would give rise to a situation of acute crisis, to express the hope that the measures of this type still remaining in force may be repealed as soon as possible and to request the Government to keep it informed of the measures taken for this purpose;(e) to request the Government to be good enough to submit its observations relating specifically to the allegations concerning the closure of the premises of the CNT and the UTE Employees' Union;(f) to take note of the information submitted by the Government according to which six"" of the trade unionists mentioned in the complaints, who had been arrested, have been released, and that no record of the arrest of two others can be found, but to request the Government to be good enough to submit its observations with regard to the other trade unionists mentioned in paragraph ;(g) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will present a further report once it has received the additional information and observations requested from the Government in subparagraphs (d), (e) and (f) of this paragraph.Geneva,  November .(Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.",-1,1969,Uruguay
201,".The complaint is contained in two communications dated  November  and  December  addressed to the ILO directly by the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions (CLASC) and the World Confederation of Labour respectively. The complaint was forwarded by letter dated  December  to the Government, which furnished its observations thereon in a communication dated  March .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.It is alleged that on  November  Mr. Emilio Mspero, the General Secretary of the CLASC, who was on his way to attend the Third National Congress of the Autonomous Confederation of Christian Trade Unions (CASC) (scheduled for  to  November ), was met on his arrival at the airport of Santo Domingo by the Chief of Immigration, who informed him that he was persona non grata in the country and that the Government of the Dominican Republic had ordered that he be sent back in the aeroplane in which he had arrived and this despite the fact that all his papers were in order. Mspero asked to be allowed to get in touch with some of the other government authorities and with the union leaders of the CASC, but the immigration officer ordered that Mspero be escorted by some fifteen armed police and put back in the aeroplane from which he had disembarked.
.In these circumstances the complainants requested the ILO to take up Mspero's case with the Dominican authorities and to demand that basic trade union rights be guaranteed.
.In its observations the Government points out that its Ministry of Labour immediately took the necessary measures to redress this regrettable incident and that as a result of these measures Mr. Emilio Mspero was allowed to re-enter the country the following day so as to permit him to take an active part in the Third National Congress of the CASC, which was held in Santo Domingo between  and  November of last year. During his stay in the country Mr. Mspero was received by the Minister of Labour, together with the leaders of the CASC. Moreover, Mr. Mspero enjoyed the ample facilities made available to him by the Dominican authorities, amongst which might be mentioned his participation in a television programme where he was able to expatiate on the aims and purposes of his organisation before a group of local journalists.
.In view of the Government's explanation the Committee is led to the conclusion that the matters raised in the complaint have been satisfactorily resolved.",-1,1969,Dominican Republic
202,".By means of a direct communication to the ILO dated  November , the Workers' Confederation of Peru transmitted a complaint by the Federation of Peruvian Bank Employees.
.The complaint was communicated to the Government for its observations, which were received in a communication dated  March . After examining this case at its meeting in May , the Committee decided to obtain certain additional information from the Government with a view to formulating its conclusions. This information was supplied to the ILO on  December .
.Peru has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants allege that during the course of the negotiation and settlement of the most recent set of collective claims advanced by the Federation of Peruvian Bank Employees, the Peruvian labour authorities took action affecting collective bargaining and violating the provisions of Convention No. .
.The complainants first of all describe the procedure provided by Peruvian law for the settlement of workers' collective claims for wage increases or improvements in working conditions. There are three principal stages:(a) direct negotiation between workers and employers;(b) in the event of direct negotiations breaking down the claims are discussed before a conciliation board presided over by an official of the labour administration;(c) if both parties agree the claims may be settled by way of arbitration; if not the claims will be settled by the labour administration. Further, a Presidential Decree of  July  provides that "" claims concerning wage increases and conditions of work may be submitted thirty days before the expiry of the period fixed by agreement or by law for previous wage increases to apply. In such cases, any agreements reached by the parties shall come into force upon the expiry of the current agreements "".
.The complainants state that, in the present case, it was on the basis of this latter enactment that, on  May , they submitted to the Banks of Peru their file of collective claims, which were to come into force on  June of that year since the agreement reached in respect of the previous claims was due to expire on  May .
.The complainants allege, however, that these claims were not dealt with in accordance with the legal provisions governing collective bargaining. Thus at the stage of direct negotiations the banks adopted a totally obstructionist attitude quite incompatible with their obligation to co-operate in finding a settlement by suggesting bases for agreement. Again during the conciliation stage their failure to discuss all the points raised in the claims flew right in the face of a decision of the Administration Division of  July  that "" the parties must be informed that both during direct negotiation as well as before the Conciliation Board, all points of claims must be discussed; likewise account must be taken of the Presidential Decree of  "" (which obliges both parties-especially the employers to co-operate in settling collective claims).
.The complainants allege, moreover, that in a manner quite incompatible with its professed policy of "" supporting and encouraging the principle of collective bargaining as the most suitable means of reconciling the interests of both employers and workers"" the labour administration arbitrarily cut short the proceedings of the Conciliation Board on the grounds that it had failed-thereby ensuring that it did fail. Moreover, when, immediately after halting the proceedings of the Conciliation Board, the labour administration pronounced on the claims, it did so by decreeing a general rise of  soles a month for a period of eighteen months from  July  instead of a period of one year as is customary and as had been agreed with the banks for many years and ratified by administrative provisions-in particular, by Resolution No.  RT dated  November . This Resolution lays down in clause  that "" advantages acquired through previous agreements shall remain in force, provided that they are not mentioned in the present claims. Banks which grant greater advantages than those sought, or which grant advantages in settlement of these claims, may neither reduce nor withdraw such advantages "".
.The complainants further allege that in fixing a period of eighteen months instead of the twelve months provided for under collective agreements and custom, the labour administration has acted in contempt of collective bargaining, of Convention No.  and of statutory provisions and its own previous practice in affairs of this nature.
.The Government in its observations states that the allegations of the complainants are unfounded since the decisions of the Directorate General of Labour on the subject of the collective demands of the Federation of Peruvian Bank Employees were taken in accordance with the substantive and procedural rules governing such demands. According to the Government, collective disputes are the subject of a series of legal provisions (some of which were cited by the complainants in the second part of their allegations), which the labour administration has strictly observed. More particularly, Presidential Decrees of  May  and  January  provide that when conciliation proceedings are under way as a result of a collective dispute or any other dispute affecting the interests of the workers, the two sides shall abstain from taking any action detrimental to the interests of the other and from illegal activities such as lockouts, go-slows, strikes and collective stoppages of work whatever their purpose. The bank employees failed to observe these regulations and repeatedly interrupted their labours; a fact which, as is public knowledge, affected the normal functioning of the banking system in the country. As a consequence the labour administration was legally obliged under the Presidential Decree of  March  to declare that the Conciliation Board had failed. The Government goes on to state that by virtue of this Decree the Peruvian labour administration has the power to declare that conciliation has failed whenever the dispute is of such a nature or has arisen in such a manner as to render it impossible.
.As regards the allegation that the labour administration was at fault in fixing the new wage scale for eighteen instead of the usual twelve months, the Government states that the increase of  soles a month amounted to an increase of some . per cent over the previous rate, whereas the increase in the cost-of-living index during the preceding year had been only . per cent. In view of the magnitude of the increase it was felt to be only reasonable and equitable that it should be binding over a longer period than the normal twelve months. In adopting this procedure, the Peruvian labour administration was acting quite correctly since the refusal of the parties to go to arbitration and their submission of the matter to the decision of the labour administration entail binding acceptance of its recommendations as is provided in Presidential Resolution No.  DS of  September . The intervention of the Peruvian labour administration in the affair, which constitutes the subject-matter of the present complaint, was therefore in strict accordance with the legal provisions governing the consideration and settlement of collective disputes in Peru (inter alia, the provisions of ILO Convention No.  which forms part of the Law of the Republic). Moreover, its decisions were taken in pursuance of powers granted under Presidential Decree No.  DT of  August .
.The Committee notes that the Government makes no reply to the allegations concerning the attitude adopted by the employers in the course of the proceedings. With regard to the termination of the conciliation proceedings the Government refers to national legislation which provides that during the course of these proceedings both parties shall refrain from taking action detrimental to the interests of the other party; and states that, in the present case, the workers by repeatedly stopping work acted in breach of this legislation. The Government further makes reference to certain provisions of national legislation which empower the Peruvian labour administration to declare that conciliation has broken down whenever the dispute is of such a nature or has arisen in such a manner as to render it impossible. The Government states that it was because of the stoppages of work that the labour administration terminated the conciliation proceedings. As regards the decision of the labour administration to give a general wage increase of  soles a month for a period six months longer than the period agreed in previous collective agreements, the Government states that this measure was justified by the fact that it was a particularly large increase compared with the rise in the cost-of-living index over the past year.
.Regarding the allegations concerning the attitude adopted by the employers during the direct negotiation and conciliation stages the Committee observes that Peruvian legislation provides that employers shall co-operate in finding a settlement to a set of collective claims put forward by the workers and shall discuss all points raised therein.
.The Committee asked the Government for additional information showing whether restrictions on strikes during the course",-1,1969,Peru
203,"of conciliation continue to be applied after the labour authority has given its decision in the case of a collective dispute. In its reply the Government states that the right to strike is not restricted; nevertheless, it also mentions that measures adopted by the labour authority during the course of the proceedings relating to collective claims in order to prevent attitudes prejudicial to the interests of the other party are kept in operation subsequently only in cases where the workers' side prolongs the dispute notwithstanding the settlement of the matter by the authority, in lieu of the arbitrator. It would therefore appear that the workers may not strike in support of their claims once the labour authority has adopted a decision regarding the questions at issue.
.This conclusion is also suggested by Decree No.  of  concerning the settlement of labour disputes, which the Committee has examined and under which, following the breakdown of direct negotiation and conciliation, the dispute, if the parties do not consent to submit it to arbitration, has to be settled by the labour authorities specified therein.
.From this it appears that under the law, the claims advanced by the Federation of Peruvian Bank Employees had to be settled by binding decision of the labour authority after the breakdown of conciliation and the refusal to go to voluntary arbitration. This means that the Federation was not entitled to declare a strike during the conciliation proceedings and, as seen above, that it was not entitled either to have recourse to a strike after the authority had reached its decision on the claims advanced.
.The Committee has always applied the principle that questions relating to the right to strike are not outside its competence in so far as they affect the exercise of trade union rights. In doing so it has pointed out that the right of workers and their organisations to strike as a legitimate means of defending their occupational interests is generally recognised.
.With regard to the decision of the labour authority to declare the conciliation proceedings concluded owing to the stoppage of work during those proceedings, the Committee recalls that it has in many cases in the past observed that, although the right of workers and their organisations to strike as a legitimate means of defending their occupational interests is generally recognised, this right may be subject to temporary restrictions, such as the suspension of strikes during conciliation and arbitration proceedings in which the parties can take part at every stage. In doing so, the Committee has stressed that when restrictions of this kind are placed on the exercise of the right to strike, the ensuing conciliation and arbitration proceedings should be adequate, impartial and speedy.
.With regard to the binding settlement of disputes by decision or arbitration given by the labour authority, the Committee recalls that although it has stated in previous cases that, where strikes are prohibited or are subject to restrictions, the workers should enjoy adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitrary procedures in order to protect their interests, it has also pointed out that such principles do not apply to the absolute prohibition of the right to strike but to the restriction of that right in the essential services or in the civil service, in which case adequate guarantees should be provided to safeguard the interests of the workers.
.The Committee observes that in Peru binding arbitration on the part of the labour authority if a dispute is not settled by other means is part of the general procedure applicable to collective disputes. The Committee believes that this system may result in a considerable restriction of the right of workers' organisations to organise their activities and may indirectly entail an absolute prohibition of strikes, contrary to the principles generally recognised in regard to freedom of association.
.The Committee notes the Government's declaration that there are no measures restricting the right to strike but it also observes that there are legal provisions which would appear to result in voiding the lawful exercise of this right.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to point out to the Government that the system for the settlement of collective disputes as laid down by law may result in a considerable restriction of the right of workers' organisations to organise their activities and indirectly impose an absolute prohibition of strikes, contrary to the principles generally recognised in regard to freedom of association;(b) to restate the principle that the right to strike may be subject to temporary restriction such as the suspension of strikes during conciliation and arbitrary proceedings, which should be adequate, impartial and speedy and allow either party to act at every stage;(c) to draw the Government's attention to the desirability of re-examining the legislation with a view to clarifying the legal situation in this regard in the light of the above considerations, keeping the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations duly informed.",1,1969,Peru

.The Committee examined this case at its meeting in November , when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body, which appears in paragraphs - of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ).
.Certain aspects of the case are outstanding, which relate to allegations on the mobilisation of workers, the imprisonment of trade unionists and the closing of trade union premises, on which points further information was requested from the Government. The Committee also adjourned to its present meeting the examination of certain allegations on anti-trade-union measures against the UTE Employees' Union (AUTE).

(Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.
.The complaints and the additional information submitted by the complainants are contained in two communications from the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), dated  July and  August ; two communications from the UTE Employees' Union, dated  July and  August ; a communication from the Trade Unions International of Workers of the Building, Wood and Building Materials Industries, dated  August , a communication from the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), dated  August , and a communication from the World Federation of Teachers' Unions, dated  October .
.The texts of the above-mentioned communications were forwarded to the Government of Uruguay, each as it was received, and the Government submitted its observations in four communications, dated  August,  September,  and  October .
.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee observes that the questions referred to by the complainants in the present case appear to constitute, in essentials, the continuation or repetition in  of certain occurrences which were examined by the Committee in Case No. , concerning Uruguay. This case, as the Committee observed, basically involved a series of measures taken by the Uruguayan Government (in )-emergency security measures similar to a state of siege, the freezing of salaries and prices, and the mobilisation of workers-which applied to workers in various state agencies. According to the allegations made on this occasion, the measures taken by the Government were aimed at imposing a wage freeze, suppressing the claims put forward by the workers and impeding the exercise of the right to strike by mobilising the workers, while other measures, such as the banning of meetings, the dismissal and imprisonment of trade union officials and workers, etc., had been adopted.
.In connection with these matters, the Committee recalled, at its session in February , that in other cases in which complaints had been made of alleged infringements of freedom of association under a state of siege or emergency or by virtue of national security legislation, the Committee had stated that it was not called upon to comment on the necessity for or desirability of such legislation, which is a purely political consideration, but must consider what repercussions the legislation might have on trade union rights.
.The Committee also recalled that, on other occasions when it has had to examine complaints involving the mobilisation of workers, it has taken the view that such a measure is of an exceptional nature in view of the gravity of its consequences with regard to personal freedoms and trade union rights, and could be justified only by the need to ensure the functioning of essential services or industries whose interruption would lead to a situation of acute crisis.
.In addition, on this occasion, in view of the statement by the Government that strikes in the civil service are not permitted, the Committee, considering that the allegations concerning the right to strike fall within its competence, although only to the extent to which they affect trade union rights, considered it necessary to recall that, while restrictions on strikes in the civil service or in essential services could be accepted, there should in such cases be adequate guarantees to safeguard the interests of the workers who were thereby deprived of an essential means of defending their occupational interests, which implied that such restrictions should be accompanied by adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures in which the parties concerned could participate at all stages.
.Furthermore, the Committee observed that the wage freeze ordered by the Government did not affect the public sector alone but also curtailed collective bargaining in the private sector of the economy. In this connection, the Committee recalled I that it had pointed out in one of its earlier cases that the development of procedures for voluntary negotiation constituted an important aspect of freedom of association, but that it would be difficult to lay down an absolute rule in this matter since, under certain circumstances, governments might feel that the position of their countries called at certain times for stabilisation measures, during the application of which it would not be possible for wage rates to be fixed freely through the medium of collective bargaining.
.At its sessions in February and May , the Committee examined the information submitted by the Government concerning the measures adopted in  and the subsequent occurrences and, in particular, the information concerning the reasons for the introduction of the emergency measures, the subsequent repeal of such measures, and the release of the trade unionists who had been arrested on this occasion. The Committee also received a statement in which the Government declared that it was strictly applying, and would continue to apply, the principles laid down by the Committee concerning the guarantees to be accorded to workers deprived of the right to strike, a subject dealt with by an Act promulgated in December , which is concerned with the conciliation procedures applicable to such workers. After having emphasised the",0,1969,Uruguay

.As a preface to the observations contained in its communication of  March , the Government points out that no trade union body representing the teaching profession has been prevented from carrying on its lawful activities; that no trade union premises have been closed, that no measures have been taken which violate International Labour Conventions on freedom of association, and that the only measures initiated have been taken on the basis of the Emergency Security Measures Decree.
.The Government states that public servants employed in essential services do not enjoy the right to strike and that, consequently, members of the teaching profession are excluded from this right. The Government adds, however, that no sanctions have been taken against any member of the teaching profession for taking part in strikes and that the legal basis for any measures which have been taken is the Emergency Security Measures Decree.
.The Government further states that all those persons mentioned in the complaint as having been detained have either been released or else were not imprisoned in the first place; that no one was detained for trade union activities but solely for having infringed the provisions of the Emergency Security Measures Decree of  June . Moreover, the Government points out that no one is at present being held under this decree.
.The Government explains that all these measures, which are subject to the control of the General Legislative Assembly, or during the recess, of its standing Committee, and which may be revoked at any time, were designed, together with other similar measures, to combat subversion at a time of crisis which it was fortunately able to overcome, and in which it had to face an offensive aimed at making chaos and violence prevail against the Constitutional and democratic rgime.
.The Government further states that the detention of the persons referred to above had nothing to do with the particular problems of either education or freedom of association.
.Replying to other questions raised by the Committee in its th Report, the Government in its communication of  March  states the following:(a) Mr. Humberto Rodriguez was arrested on  June  and released on  July ; the reason for his detention was, as in the other cases mentioned, violation of the provisions of the Emergency Security Measures Decree;(b) the premises of the CNT were closed on  June  but the organisation in question, which enjoys the right of assembly within the limits set by the decree of  June , has since held many meetings quite normally and has carried on intense trade union activity without, however, officially communicating its new address;(c) the return to normal of the labour and trade union situation in the UTE means that the trade union(s) has (have) the right to carry on all lawful and legitimate trade union activities, including that of negotiating with the management;(d) the penalties inflicted on certain officials of the UTE were for acts qualified as breaches of discipline under the Personnel Regulations. No measures taken were prompted by trade union activities. Moreover, none of these measures has been rescinded by the Administrative Disputes Tribunal, the independent legal body responsible under the Constitution for supervising the legality of administrative acts.
.In regard to this last point the Government also states that it is prepared to supply a list of cases of administrative appeals for revocation of decisions made by the UTE management on this subject, and a list of the actions for revocation, if any, which, once administrative channels have been exhausted, officials or ex-officials who think their rights have been infringed by administrative acts, either illegal or involving abuse of powers, can bring before the Administrative Disputes Tribunal.
.The Committee notes the information supplied by the Government in its communications of  March  and  March , according to which all those persons mentioned in the allegations as having been detained have either been released or else were not imprisoned in the first place; it also notes that at present no one is being held under the Emergency Security Measures Decree.
.The Committee further notes the Government's statement contained in its communication of  March , according to which no teachers' trade union has been prevented from functioning normally, nor have the premises of any such trade union been closed. By contrast, the Government, in its communication of  March , states-without giving any kind of explanation therefor-that the premises of the CNT were closed on  June  but that the union has subsequently carried on intense trade union activity without, however, officially communicating its new address to the authorities.
.In this connection the Committee recommends the Governing Body to ask the Government to supply information concerning the present position regarding the CNT and, in particular, to state whether its premises still remain closed and, if so, for what reason.
.The Committee notes the Government's statement according to which the state of normality in labour and trade union matters in the UTE implies the right of the trade union(s) to carry out under normal conditions all lawful and legitimate activities, including that of negotiating with the management. The Committee observes, however, that, while the Government states that the sanctions taken against certain officials of the UTE were for ""breaches of discipline"" under the terms of the Personnel Regulations, that there exists an appeals procedure which may be invoked by any official who considers that he has been unjustly treated and that, to date, none of the sanctions inflicted has been rescinded by the Administrative Disputes Tribunal, the Government has still not replied to the Committee's earlier request for more precise information on the nature of the breaches of discipline which prompted the imposition of these sanctions.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to ask the Government, once again, to supply detailed information on the nature of the breaches of discipline which prompted the taking of the sanctions in question.
.With regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the allegations concerning the detention of various trade unionists, to note the information supplied by the Government in its communications of  March  and  March , according to which all those persons mentioned in the allegations as having been detained have either been released or else were not imprisoned in the first place, and also to note that at present no one is being held under the Emergency Security Measures Decree;(b) as regards the allegations concerning the closing of the premises of the National Labour Congress, to ask the Government to supply information concerning the present position regarding the CNT and, in particular, to state whether its premises still remain closed and, if so, for what reason;(c) as regards the allegations concerning the taking of anti-union measures against the AUTE:(i) to note the Government's statement contained in its communication of  March , according",0,1969,Uruguay
206,"the result that the original ruling declaring the strike to be "" non-existent "" remained valid. The Court considered, in particular, that the firm had already dismissed the workers belonging to the union and had already terminated the collective agreement before the union submitted its complaints and gave notice of a strike, that the union was no longer entitled to represent such workers, that it was impossible to recognise a strike by persons not in the service of the undertaking and that the notice of the strike was intended to secure compliance with a collective agreement that had already been rescinded.
.The Committee does not consider that it is called upon in this case to examine the legislation or the decisions taken as regards the lawfulness or unlawfulness of the strike, but rather the basic aspect of the dismissal of workers belonging to the Staff Union of Embotelladora del Norte SA in an effort to determine whether, in the light of the available information, the action taken constituted an unfair practice on the part of the firm, as the complainants allege. The Committee has already drawn attention to the principle, contained in Convention No. , that workers must enjoy adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment and that such protection should apply more particularly in respect of acts calculated, inter alia, to cause the dismissal of, or otherwise prejudice, a worker by reason of union membership.
.The Committee notes that the firm had signed a provisional agreement with the union to the effect that both parties would endeavour to reach a final solution to the problems that had arisen. The firm nevertheless proceeded to dismiss all the workers belonging to the union, except four who had joined a new union. The reason advanced for this dismissal was that the workers concerned had taken part in an unwarranted stoppage of work, even though the stoppage had taken place several days previously, i.e. while the provisional agreement temporarily resolving the dispute was being negotiated. Furthermore, on the day following the dismissals, the firm signed a collective agreement with a separate union, which was registered with the authorities on the same day.
.The Committee considers that all these facts clearly indicate that the dismissal was motivated by the trade union membership of the workers concerned and that its purpose was to prevent the union representing them from defending their interests by collective bargaining or by resorting to strike action. In the Committee's opinion, this is plainly an act of antiunion discrimination by the firm and the Committee regrets that the authorities have not taken, or have not been able to take, the necessary steps to protect the workers and the trade union concerned.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the Government's attention to the considerations contained in the preceding paragraph and to the conclusion that Embotelladora del Norte SA committed an act of anti-union discrimination, contrary to the principles laid down in the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. );(b) to request the Government to consider what measures could be taken to provide adequate protection for the workers in accordance with the principles contained in Convention No.  and for the unions affected by such acts of anti-union discrimination.
.The complaint is contained in a communication sent by the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions (CLASC) on  July . The complainant organisation submitted further information in another communication dated  August . The Government sent its observations on the case in three communications, dated  September ,  October  and  July .
.Mexico has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but it has not ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee recommends the Governing Body to take due note of the Government's explanations. However, with regard to the last of these allegations, the Committee wishes to recall a view already expressed on a number of previous occasions, according to which the detention by the authorities of trade unionists concerning whom no grounds of conviction are subsequently found is liable to involve restrictions of trade union rights and that it is important in cases of this kind that governments take the necessary measures to ensure that the authorities concerned have instructions appropriate to eliminate the danger of detention for trade union activities.""
.The Government has not sent any information on the results of the lawsuit brought by the Staff Union of the Embotelladora del Norte against the undertaking and, in particular, in respect of the dismissals effected by this latter. The Committee recommends the Governing Body to request the Government to be good enough to send this information and, at all events, to send details of the present situation of the workers who were dismissed, in the meantime, adjourning its examination of this aspect of the case.
.With respect to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to take note of the Government's explanations concerning the investigation to determine the responsibility of the public servants of the Central Conciliation and Arbitration Board, the alleged intervention of "" shock troops "" in the inter-union dispute which forms the subject-matter of this complaint, and the allegations concerning police intervention and the detention of trade unionists;(b) to draw the Government's attention to the considerations expressed in paragraph  above;(c) to request the Government to be good enough to send information on the judicial proceedings set in motion by the Staff Union of the Embotelladora del Norte against the undertaking and, in particular, on the present position of the workers who were dismissed;(d) to take note of this interim report, on the understanding that the Committee will submit a new report when it has received the information referred to in subparagraph (c) above.",0,1969,Mexico
207,".The complaint is contained in a communication dated  August  addressed to the ILO by the Trade Unions International of Transport, Port and Fishery Workers (a Professional Department of the World Federation of Trade Unions), to which the complaining organisation appends a document emanating from the Single Sea Transport Workers' Union of Uruguay (Sindicato Unico del Transporte Martimo del Uruguay), an affiliate of the International. The text of this communication and its annex were transmitted to the Government for comment, and the latter forwarded its observations in a communication dated  September .
.Uruguay has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee takes note of these observations.
.It emerges from a perusal of Decree No.  of  July  that its purpose was to approve regulations concerning the drawing up and keeping of registers of merchant marine personnel. Under these regulations the supervision of the registers for captains and officers on the one hand, and seamen on the other, is entrusted to two "" administrative committees "" composed of the Director of the Merchant Marine, as chairman, and representatives of the shipowners and personnel concerned (in the case of the latter, representatives of occupational organisations possessing legal personality). The essential purpose of the registers appears to be to act as a placement service. Any member of an "" administrative committee "" may challenge, giving his reasons, the inclusion of any person on the list of those available for work, and the challenge will be examined by a tripartite board whose ruling is final. If for any reason no more registered personnel should be available, the Director may authorise the engagement of personnel not on the register who fulfil the statutory requirements.
.In these circumstances the only allegation which could have any bearing on the exercise of trade union rights is that referring to the conditions of appointment of the trade union representatives on the "" administrative committees "". It is to be noted that in this case all workers' organisations possessing legal personality are entitled to appoint a representative. Consequently there is no question of one organisation being appointed to represent all the workers in the branch of employment in question, which would have made it necessary, from the standpoint of trade union rights, to assess, on the basis of objective and impartial criteria, the relative representativeness of the organisations concerned. The only requirement laid down in the regulations is that the organisations represented should possess legal personality. Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Uruguay, stipulates that the acquisition of legal personality by workers' and employers' organisations shall not be made subject to conditions of such a character as to restrict the application of the rights and guarantees provided for in Articles ,  and  of the Convention. In the present instance, the national organisation directly concerned merely claims that such a requirement "" should not be laid down "" without supplying any evidence to prove that the acquisition of legal personality is made subject to conditions of such a character as to restrict the exercise of any of the rights and guarantees generally recognised in relation to freedom of association.
.In these circumstances, for the reasons stated in paragraph  above, the Committee considers that the complainants have not furnished proof that the facts stated in their allegations constitute an infringement of freedom of association, and recommends the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.Geneva,  November .(Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.",-1,1969,Uruguay

.In its communication of  February , the World Confederation of Labour states that according to information received, Mr. Agripino Silva, "" a young Paraguayan trade unionist, responsible for the workers' education activities of the CCT (Confederation of Christian Workers) "" was arrested and imprisoned by the police on  January . The complainant organisation refers to "" oppression and persecution "" perpetrated for years by the Government against the working masses, and states that "" the arbitrary and unjust arrest and imprisonment of Agripino Silva for his trade union activities is further glaring evidence of such practices "". The complainant organisation requests the ILO to intervene so that this trade unionist may be released immediately to resume his trade union activities in accordance with the International Labour Conventions and so that the Conventions may be respected and applied by the Government.
.In its communication of  February , the Government transmitted information on the allegations relating to Angel Riveros and Juan Flix Martinez, which had been provided by the Ministry of Justice and Labour. According to this information, the names of the supposed leaders of the Confederation of Christian Workers appear on the police records of the Departmental Authorities of Caaguaz, where these persons were arrested on  July  and released on  July  "". The Government added that they were not arrested on account of their trade union activities but in connection with breaches of law and order. Trade union activities in Paraguay, stated the Government, were well safeguarded but the safeguards could not be invoked to justify non-observance of regulations on law and order. The trade union situation in the country was not what the Ministry of Justice and Labour would like it to be, owing to the absence of agricultural undertakings grouping a sufficient number of workers to enable trade unions or workers' associations to be formed. Rural activities were not carried on within large undertakings. Small family holdings were more common, farmed by the owners with the help of their relatives. The Ministry of Justice and Labour stated that it had no knowledge of the existence of the trade union offices mentioned in the complaint or of the supposed trade union organisations the complainants claimed to represent. The Ministry "" is satisfied with the development of the growing trade union movement in Paraguay and considers that this development cannot be impeded by complaints of non-existent infringements of freedom of association "".
.At its session in May  the Committee decided to request the Government to supply information concerning the actual offences imputed to Messrs. Riveros and Martinez which would have constituted breaches of public order and to indicate whether these persons were brought before the competent judicial authority. It also requested the Government to transmit its observations concerning the detention of Agripino Silva and to state the legal position of this person.Allegations concerning the Arrest of Efigenio Fernndez
.In its communication dated  March , the World Confederation of Labour referred to the arbitrary arrest of Efigenio Fernndez, Secretary-General of the Paraguayan Christian Workers' Confederation, and acting member of the Executive Committee of the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions. Mr. Fernndez, state the complainants, was arrested in San Joaquin on  March  while accompanying an official of the Ministry of Agriculture at the founding of a peasant co-operative. As stated above, no reply has been received from the Government concerning these allegations.
.The Government having failed to supply the information requested from it concerning the allegations, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to recall the observation made by the Committee as early as its First Report, namely that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and the Committee is confident that, if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side should recognise the importance for the protection of their own good name of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to such detailed factual charges as may be put forward;(b) to recall that, in cases involving the arrest of trade unionists, on various occasions, when governments have countered allegations according to which trade union leaders or workers had been arrested for trade union activities by stating that the persons in question had actually been arrested for subversive activities, for reasons of national security or for having committed common offences, the Committee has always followed the rule consisting in requesting the government concerned to supply further information as soon as possible with regard to the relevant arrests and the exact grounds on which they were made, adding that, if in some cases the Committee has decided that allegations concerning the arrest or detention of trade unionists did not require further examination, it has only done so after receiving information from the Government that proved conclusively that these arrests or detentions had no connection with trade union activities, but were occasioned by activities outside the trade union sphere which were either prejudicial to public order or of a political nature;(c) to recall the importance which should be attached to the principle that all arrested persons should be subject to normal judicial procedure in accordance with the principles enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and in accordance with the principle that it is a fundamental right of the individual that a detained person should be brought without delay before the appropriate judge, this right being recognised in such instruments as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man and the American Convention on Human Rights;(d) to draw the attention of the Government to the principle that the detention of trade unionists concerning whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found is liable to involve restrictions of trade union rights;(e) to deplore the fact that, despite repeated requests for information, the Government has not submitted the information sought by the Committee on the serious allegations made by the complainants, thereby making it impossible for the Committee to formulate its conclusions on the matter in full knowledge of the facts; and(f) to request the Director-General to maintain all appropriate forms of contact with the Government in order to obtain the information requested from it concerning the trade unionists mentioned in paragraphs  and  above who were arrested.",-1,1969,Paraguay
210,".In a communication dated  December , addressed to the ILO directly, the International Metalworkers' Federation announced that on behalf of its Venezuelan affiliate FETRAMETAL it wished to lodge a complaint against the Government of Venezuela for breach of freedom of association. The Federation alleged that on  December , Mr. Mollegas, Chairman, and Mr. Mercano, Secretary of FETRAMETAL, were arrested by government agents and dragged off to an unknown destination, outside the area in which the Orinoco steelworkers' strike was proceeding. Members of FETRAMETAL were, it was said, full of the deepest misgivings concerning the fate of these two men.
.The Government of Venezuela having been at once acquainted, by telegram, with the contents of this message, it cabled back on  December . In this telegram, the Government said that the strike recently declared in the National Steel Company had been entirely illegal, and that thirty-two unions, as well as the Confederation of Venezuelan Workers (the leaders of which had condemned the stoppage as illegal) had come out against it. Mr. Mollegas had been detained for reasons which had nothing to do with his trade union activities, and the matter had been referred to the Disciplinary Tribunal of the Confederation of Venezuelan Workers after his conduct had been questioned by the workers themselves. Steelworkers, and "" others in the steel areas "" had condemned the attitude taken up by FETRAMETAL, because industrial plant had been sabotaged and violence used against workers anxious to carry on. The Confederation of Venezuelan Workers had withdrawn the authorisation given to FETRAMETAL to conduct the dispute because of the attitude adopted by Mollegas. As to Mercano, the Government denied that he was in custody.
.On  December , the complainants wrote to the Director-General in the following terms:Having learnt that Mollegas and Mercano are no longer being held incommunicado, and that negotiations with a view to their release are proceeding in a more normal atmosphere, our affiliate has asked us to withdraw the complaint made against the Government of Venezuela. Immediate economic problems are in process of solution, it appears. A special parliamentary committee has been set up and the causes of the present position in the iron and steel industry are under investigation. This being so, we consider that the interest taken in this matter by international organisations has been instrumental in getting these questions thoroughly investigated, and that there is every reason to hope for a satisfactory outcome. However, it seems to us that at this stage it would be better if the Venezuelans themselves were left to decide what action should be taken.
.On  January  the complainant organisation again wrote to the Director-General to say that the matters which had given rise to the complaint had been settled by a new collective agreement which had the Government's backing. The letter added:However, I wish to thank you, and the ILO, for your speed in cabling the Venezuelan Minister of Labour; such action, quite certainly, played apart in improving the atmosphere and contributed, in particular, to the release of the trade union leaders arrested, besides facilitating a settlement of the strike.
.When, in the past, the Committee has found itself faced with a situation of this kind, it has always taken the view that: the desire shown by a complaining organisation to withdraw its complaint, while it constitutes a factor to which the greatest attention must be paid, is not, however, in itself sufficient reason for the Committee to cease automatically to proceed with the examination of the complaint. The Committee has always felt free to evaluate the reasons given to explain the withdrawal of a complaint and to investigate whether these appear sufficiently plausible to lead one to believe that the withdrawal was made in complete independence.
.In this particular instance, there is no reason to believe that the complainant organisation was not fully independent in deciding to withdraw its complaint. Moreover, as it says itself, the reasons which prompted the complaint no longer obtain, while the labour dispute that had been proceeding has ceased with the conclusion of a new collective agreement.
.Under cover of a letter, dated  February , the Government, referring to the fact that the complainants have dropped their complaint and "" with a view to informing the Committee on Freedom of Association of the illegality of the strike and of the lawfulness of the detention of the trade union leaders which had formed the subject-matter of the dispute "", submits the text of a report dealing with certain legal aspects of the dispute together with photostats of numerous articles which have appeared in the press containing views and opinions relating thereto.
.In view of the fact that the complainant organisation has withdrawn its complaint for the reason that the problem which had given rise to the dispute has now been resolved, the Committee, considering that it would be pointless, under the circumstances, to proceed to an examination of the merits of the affair, recommends the Governing Body to decide that the case does not call for further examination.",1,1969,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
211,".The Committee considered Case No.  at its sessions in May and November , February, May and November  and March , when it submitted to the Governing Body the reports contained, respectively, in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, paragraphs  to  of its st Report, paragraphs  to  of its rd Report, paragraphs  to  of its th Report, paragraphs  to  of its th Report and paragraphs  to  of its th Report, all of which were approved by the Governing Body.
.In paragraph  of its th Report the Committee submitted its final conclusions to the Governing Body in respect of the various allegations examined, in the following terms:
.In these circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the allegations relating to the detention of the trade union official, Eustaquio Tolosa, to express its satisfaction at the decision to reduce his sentence, a decision in which the Committee's conclusions were taken into account, and the fact that Mr. Tolosa has now been released;(b) with regard to the allegations relating to the taking over of various trade union organisations and the suspension of their trade union status, to draw the Government's attention to the fact that, despite the time which has elapsed and the repeated requests made to it, the Government has not yet brought to an end those measures to take over unions which were still in force, and to take note of the Government's statement that it intends to keep the Committee informed, within the briefest possible period, on the return to a normal situation by the unions taken over;(c) with regard to the allegations relating to interference by the authorities in the affairs of the CGT, measures directed against union leaders and members and compulsory arbitration and collective bargaining:(i) to regret the failure on a number of occasions to supply the information requested on which the Committee was relying in order to formulate its conclusions on the said allegations with a full knowledge of the facts;(ii) to draw the Government's attention once more to the importance of Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), which states that workers' and employers' organisations shall have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom, to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes, while the public authorities shall refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede its lawful exercise; and to the principle laid down in Article  of the Convention that workers' and employers' organisations shall not be liable to be dissolved or suspended by administrative authority;(iii) to draw the Government's attention to the fact that the right of free collective bargaining is a fundamental trade union right for all employees who are not covered by the safeguards provided by civil service regulations; and that if, as part of its stabilisation policy, the Government considers that wage rates cannot be settled freely through collective bargaining, this restriction should be imposed as an exceptional measure and only to the extent that is necessary, without exceeding a reasonable period, and that it should be accompanied by adequate safeguards to protect workers' living standards.
.These conclusions were transmitted to the Government, which supplied information in three communications dated  May,  September and  October .
.In the meantime, the International Federation of Chemical and General Workers' Unions had sent a communication dated  February  containing allegations of infringement of trade union rights in Argentina in connection with collective bargaining. The Government has not yet forwarded its observations on this complaint, which has been recorded as Case No. . Since the allegations relate to one of the aspects examined in Case No. , the Committee has decided to amalgamate the two cases and deal with them together.
.Argentina has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).Allegations relating to Measures to Take Over Various Trade Union Organisations and to Suspend Their Trade Union Status
.At its session in March  the Committee referred to the allegations relating to the taking over of various trade union organisations and the suspension of their trade union status which it had examined at earlier sessions. The Committee recalled on this occasion the Act of the Argentine Revolution concerning the taking over of trade unions and the various statements by the Government to the effect that it was hastening the process of a return to normal in the trade union movement, and drew attention to the time which had elapsed since the taking over of the unions still deprived of their status and to the importance of such a return to normal if these organisations were to exercise their rights under Convention No.  to elect their representatives in full freedom and to organise their administration and activities.
.The Committee had before it a communication dated  January  from the Government in which it indicated that the basis for the measures to take over trade unions was the need to promote the process of reorganisation of the unions concerned and their return to a normal situation in accordance with the aims pursued by the Government of the Argentine Revolution. The letter went on to say that all the organisations taken over had been engaging in activities outside their powers. As their voting lists were restored to normal, the Government intended to call elections and allow the unions to revert to their normal operation. The Government again stated, as it had done to the Committee on previous occasions, that these measures were not directed against the exercise of trade union rights. On the contrary, the Government hoped to count on the participation of the workers in the task of reconstructing the country. But if this participation was to be effective and fruitful, the unions must abide by the law and carry out specifically occupational activities, and their leaders must be genuinely representative. Accordingly, it was of cardinal importance that such organisations should bring their Constitutions into line with the legislation in force. The Government concluded by stating that it would keep the Committee informed, within the briefest possible period, on the return to a normal situation by the unions taken over.
.At its meeting in May  the Committee had already pointed out that in some cases the Government had lifted the suspension of the status of certain unions, such as the Textile Workers' Union and the Metal Workers' Union, but it had not done so in the case of other unions which had been deprived of their status at the same time and for the same reason.
.The Government has appended to its communications of  September and  October  copies of Resolutions Nos.  and  of  August , restoring the trade union status of the Telephone and Telecommunications Workers' Union of the Republic of Argentina (FOETRA) and annulling the suspension of the trade union status of the Buenos Aires branch of that Federation, and a copy of Resolution No.  restoring the trade union status of the Tucumn Sugar Industry Workers' Union (FOTIA).
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to take note of the measures taken in respect of the trade union organisations mentioned in the preceding paragraph, and to urge the Government once again to lift the suspension of the trade union status and end the takeover of the unions still affected, and to keep the Committee informed in this respect.Allegations relating to Collective Bargaining and Compulsory Arbitration
.At its session in November  the Committee examined a number of allegations made by the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions to the effect that Act No.  of  respecting compulsory arbitration eliminated the right to strike and the provisions of Act No.  that respected collective agreements and violated the relevant international standards. The General Confederation of Labour of the Argentine Republic had mentioned the same Act in its communication. The FOETRA, for its part, had stated that by virtue of Act No.  referring to private concerns, and Act No.  referring to the public sector, "" the joint agreements on collective bargaining have been abolished "".
.With regard to Act No.  respecting compulsory arbitration, the Government, which had supplied the text, had explained that the Act owed its existence to the need to seek appropriate formulae to settle labour disputes that might affect vital national interests and delay the process of recovery to which the Argentine Revolution was committed. As for Act No. , the Government had denied that it constituted a violation of freedom of association and stated that its purpose was to harmonise and co-ordinate the economic recovery of the country and at the same time to ensure the workers a genuine wage by means of graded increases fitting in with the",0,1969,Argentina

Furthermore, this language was used by certain employees in their capacity as trade union officials on the occasion of a labour dispute (when violent language is not infrequently employed by both sides), and not by these employees in the course of their work against their employer, as provided in section  of the Labour Code.

214,".The Committee examined this case at its February  session, at which time it submitted to the Governing Body an interim report which is to be found in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (May-June ).
.In paragraph  of that report, the Committee made a recommendation to the Governing Body that it should request the Government for information with respect to the only allegation still outstanding: that concerning the dismissal of the trade union leader, Mr. Rafael Herrera.
.The Government supplied the information requested by a communication dated  July .
.In the complaint it had been stated that Mr. Rafael Herrera, Chairman of the National Workers' Union of the National Local Roads Fund, had been dismissed by the manager of the Cundinamarca District Local Roads Fund, an autonomous official body. In the complainant's opinion, this action was in breach of the laws which prohibit the dismissal of trade union leaders without prior authorisation from a labour magistrate. The Government had replied to these allegations to the effect that Mr. Herrera had been dismissed for having absented himself from his work without asking his employer for permission beforehand, as he was required to do by law, although his employer was bound by law to grant him time off to carry out trade union work. The Government explained that the legal guarantee which protected trade union officials by prohibiting their dismissal without prior authorisation from a magistrate did not apply to public employees, to which category Mr. Herrera belonged. The Government added that Mr. Herrera had lodged an appeal with the ordinary labour court, which would rule on the legality of his dismissal.
.Following its constant practice in cases where a matter was the subject of pending national judicial proceedings and these proceedings were attended by proper guarantees of due process of law, the Committee decided to postpone its examination of the case until it was in possession of information as to the outcome of the proceedings.
.In its communication of  July , the Government states that on  November , Mr. Herrera withdrew his action against the Cundinamarca District Local Roads Fund before the Third Labour Judge of the Circuit, agreement having been reached as to what was owed to him in the way of salary adjustments, bonuses and allowances.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that the case does not call for further examination.
.The complaint is contained in a communication sent to the ILO by the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions on  July . The text was passed on to the Government, which sent its observations in a letter dated  August .
.Colombia has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee takes note of the Government's observations and of the fact that legal action is being taken in respect of the case. In the past it has been the Committee's constant practice, when a matter is the subject of pending national judicial proceedings, provided these proceedings are attended by proper guarantees of due process of law, to postpone examination of the case until it knows the outcome of the proceedings, since it considers that the ruling given may be a source of useful information in considering the allegations made. The Committee considers it appropriate to apply the same criterion in this case.
.The other aspect of the complaint appears to refer to a change in the system whereby employers grant time off to the national leaders of the trade union organisation in question. It is alleged that although these leaders offer their services to units of the state body in the districts of the country, they must henceforward request such time off from the central authority of the employing body. The complainants confine themselves to stating that in practice the new system obstructs the performance of trade union duties.
.In a previous case, in which it had been alleged that a particular undertaking had ended an arrangement whereby trade union delegates had been allowed time off, the Committee expressed the opinion that, since such facilities were a considerable asset for the exercise of trade union rights, a substantial reduction of these facilities might have an adverse effect on the exercise of these rights, and recommended the Governing Body to draw the attention of the Government concerned to this aspect of the question.
.In the present case the right of trade union leaders after having notified their employers to take time off to carry out their trade union work is provided for in Colombian legislation and it may be assumed that any unjustified restriction of this right may be the subject of an appeal to a court or to some other body. It is not stated in the complaint whether the persons concerned have availed themselves of this possibility. Furthermore, the complainants have not made use of the opportunity afforded to them to furnish the Committee with sufficient evidence for it to judge to what extent the decision referred to impeded the exercise of trade union rights. In the circumstances the Committee considers that it would be pointless to pursue examination of this case.
.With regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) for the reasons stated in paragraph  above, to decide that it would be pointless to pursue examination of the allegations concerning the system of granting time off to trade union leaders for the performance of trade union duties;(b) as regards the allegations concerning the dismissal of the chairman of a trade union, to request the Government to supply detailed information on the outcome of the pending court appeal against this dismissal;(c) to take note of the fact that the Committee will continue its examination of the latter aspect of the case when it has received the information requested from the Government.Geneva,  February .

215,".The Committee last examined this case at its session in February , when it submitted to the Governing Body an interim report which is contained in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (March ).
.A number of allegations relating to searches and closing of trade union premises remained outstanding, with respect to which the Government has now forwarded its observations by a communication dated  September .
.In addition, on  and  January , the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) made further allegations concerning the infringement of trade union rights in connection with the Government's intention to make trade union membership compulsory and create a single union. These allegations, which constitute Case No. , will also be dealt with by the Committee in the present report, together with the Government's observations thereon, contained in its communication of  September .
.Panama has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.With regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the allegations relating to searches and closing of trade union premises, to take note of the fact that it would appear from the information supplied by the Government that all effects of the measures denounced in the allegations have now ceased, and to decide, subject to the reservations expressed in paragraph , that no useful purpose would be served by pursuing examination of this aspect of the case;(b) with regard to the allegations relating to the intention of the Government to make trade union membership compulsory and to create a single union, to decide, while reaffirming the principles set forth in paragraph , that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.
.The original complaints and the additional information supplied in these five cases are dealt with together because they involve the same type of allegation. The complaints are contained in the following communications: two from the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), dated  and  January , one from the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions (CLASC), dated  January , one from the International Federation of Secondary Teachers (FIPESO), dated  February , one from the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of the Workers of Latin America dated  March , one from the Trade Unions International of Workers of the Building, Wood and Building Materials Industry, dated  June  and one from the National Federation of Christian Peasants dated  September .
.As these communications were received they were transmitted to the Government for its observations. These were presented in two communications dated  and  January .
.Panama has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  January  the WCL alleged that the following leaders of the Isthmian Federation of Christian Workers and the Peasant Federation were detained in prison: Jorge Emilio Chapote, Pedro Flix Montaez, Teodoro Martinez, Maximino Rodriguez, Domingo Castrelln, Pedro Snchez, Apolinario Snchez, Juan Senz, Rufino Snchez, Carlos Solis, Andrs Snchez, Victor Soto and Raimundo Snchez. In its communication dated  January  the WCL added that the Government was intercepting correspondence, censoring all communications and searching the trade union headquarters of the two organisations mentioned above. For its part, the CLASC confirmed the detention of some of the persons mentioned and added to the list the names of Jos Fiel Senz and Domingo Snchez. The CLASC stated that the Military Junta in power since October  had the headquarters of the Isthmian Federation of Christian Workers and the National Christian Peasant Federation searched and that applications for writs of habeas corpus made on behalf of the prisoners were rejected, some of the prisoners being given the alternative of being deported or remaining in prison.
.The International Federation of Secondary Teachers alleged in its communication of  February  that Mr. Clarence Beecher, Secretary for International Affairs of the Panama Teachers' Association, had been imprisoned, together with other teachers, since  December . The FIPESO added that teachers' public meetings and the publication of their professional journal had been banned.
.The Permanent Congress on Trade Union Unity of the Workers of Latin America stated in its communication dated  March  that since taking power the Military Junta had created a permanent state of repression directed against the trade union movement, behind the shield of the suspension of Constitutional guarantees. The complainants went on to say that the Federation of Workers' Unions of Panama had been the subject of a search by the National Guard, as well as other trade union premises, including those of the tailors', building workers' and bus drivers' unions, etc. On the occasion of these searches, members of the National Guard destroyed and seized trade union property and kept the trade union premises closed, thus obstructing all union activity. The complainants further alleged that the trade union leaders Angel Gmez, Jos del Carmen Tun, Florencio de Gracia, Sixto Valarezo, Ramn Diaz, Efigenio Arauz and Pedro Gonzlez, had already been in prison for more than three months.
.The Trade Unions International of Workers of the Building, Wood and Building Materials Industries alleged in its communication of  June  that the Military Government had closed down the headquarters of the Trade Union Federation of the Workers of Panama and a number of affiliated organisations, including the premises of the Federation of Building Workers. The complainants added that several trade union leaders were being kept in prison and referred to the names of some of the persons mentioned in the preceding paragraph, in particular Mr. Angel Gmez, who was said to be critically ill with pneumonia and had been taken as a matter of urgency to a hospital but had since been taken back to prison.
.Lastly, the National Federation of Christian Peasants of Panama stated in its complaint dated  September  that on  October  individual guarantees had been suspended by the Government with the result that rural and urban trade union leaders were being persecuted and imprisoned. The persons arrested were: Natividad Martinez, arrested on  September  in the district of Palmar in Cocl province, charged with possessing arms, after his house had been searched by the army; Bernab Reyes, Secretary General of the El Palmar Agrarian League, arrested on  September, the reason for his arrest not having been made known; Leonardo Montero, Secretary General of the Cao El Rey Agrarian League, accused by the judge and the mayor of the district of Donoso, Coln Province, as an act of reprisal. The complaining organisation added that pressure had been brought to bear on the peasants' organisations to give up any trade union activity not controlled by the Government and that every day more trade union leaders were being arrested.
.In its communications dated  and  January  the Government stated that after careful examination of the various complaints presented, it had reached the conclusion that the allegations were unfounded and that the trade union organisations of the country had without interruption been functioning in accordance with the provisions of the law in force. The labour authorities had always been motivated by concern that the trade union movement should be vigorous and managed by the workers themselves. For its part, the Government had on no occasion arrested any citizen on account of his being a trade union leader, but only for participation in political activities entirely unrelated to trade union matters. The persons arrested on various occasions after  October  had been set at liberty, and the complaint relating to the present detention of trade union leaders was therefore inadmissible. The allegations relating to the persecution and imprisonment of leaders and pressure that had been exercised against the peasant organisations were also rejected, since the Government had placed at the disposal of the inhabitants of the interior of the country adequate facilities for them to organise and carry on proper trade union activities.
.The Committee observes that the various complaints allege the detention of trade union leaders since the Military Government came into power and suspended Constitutional guarantees in October . Some of the allegations also refer to searches of the premises of various trade union organisations, in particular the Isthmian Federation of Christian Workers, the National Christian Peasants' Federation, the National Trade Union Federation of the Workers of Panama and the Building Workers' Federation, and in certain cases the closing of the premises affected. The complaints also refer to the persecution of trade union leaders and pressure exercised against the peasants' organisations. The Government, for its part, denies, in a general way, any persecution directed against trade unionists and states that no person has been arrested on account of his being a trade unionist, but only for participation in political activities. The Government points out",-1,1969,Panama
216,"that the persons arrested have been set at liberty and states that at the present moment there are no Panamanian trade union leaders in prison.
.The Committee has always refrained from expressing an opinion on the political aspects of a state of emergency but from its earliest cases it has emphasised that in such circumstances, measures of detention which may involve serious interference with the exercise of trade union rights should be accompanied by adequate judicial safeguards applied within a reasonable period. The Committee has always emphasised the importance of due process of law in cases in which trade unionists are charged with offences of a political character or with offences under the ordinary law and has taken the view, for example, that the requirement of due process would not appear to be fulfilled if under the national law the effect of a state of siege is that the court to which application is made for habeas corpus cannot examine the merits of the case a
.In all cases involving the arrest, detention or sentencing of a trade union official the Committee, taking the view that individuals have the right to be presumed innocent until found guilty, has considered that it was incumbent upon the Government to show that the measures it had taken were in no way occasioned by the trade union activities of the individual concerned. That is why in all such cases, if the Committee has concluded that allegations related to the arrest, detention, or sentencing of trade unionists did not call for further examination, it has done so only after receiving observations from the governments concerned indicating sufficiently precisely and with sufficient detail that the measures taken against the person in question had no connection with the exercise of trade union rights but were occasioned by activities outside the trade union sphere which were either prejudicial to public order or of a political nature. The Committee has also on other occasions pointed out that the detention by the authorities of trade unionists concerning whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found is liable to involve restriction of trade union rights.
.From the information submitted to the Committee it would appear that the trade union leaders arrested were set free after a longer or shorter period without at any time being brought before a regular court to determine whether or not they were guilty in the course of regular judicial proceedings. With regard to the reasons for the arrests, the Committee regrets that the Government has not sent more precise information which would have enabled it to examine the various allegations in full knowledge of the facts.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to draw the attention of the Government to the considerations set forth above in paragraphs  and , while taking note of the statement by the Government that the detained persons have been set at liberty and that at the present time there are no Panamanian trade union leaders in prison.
.As regards the allegations relating to searches and closing of trade union premises, to which the Government has not referred in its reply, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to invite the Government to be good enough to send its observations and to indicate the present position of the trade union organisations concerned, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report once it has received this information.",-1,1969,Panama

.The Trade Unions International of Workers of the Building, Wood and Building Materials Industries alleged in its communication of  June  that the Military Government had closed down the headquarters of the Trade Union Federation of the Workers of Panama and a number of affiliated organisations, including the premises of the Federation of Building Workers. The complainants added that several trade union leaders were being kept in prison and referred to the names of some of the persons mentioned in the preceding paragraph, in particular Mr. Angel Gmez, who was said to be critically ill with pneumonia and had been taken as a matter of urgency to a hospital but had since been taken back to prison.
.Lastly, the National Federation of Christian Peasants of Panama stated in its complaint dated  September  that on  October  individual guarantees had been suspended by the Government with the result that rural and urban trade union leaders were being persecuted and imprisoned. The persons arrested were: Natividad Martinez, arrested on  September  in the district of Palmar in Cocl province, charged with possessing arms, after his house had been searched by the army; Bernab Reyes, Secretary General of the El Palmar Agrarian League, arrested on  September, the reason for his arrest not having been made known; Leonardo Montero, Secretary General of the Cao El Rey Agrarian League, accused by the judge and the mayor of the district of Donoso, Coln Province, as an act of reprisal. The complaining organisation added that pressure had been brought to bear on the peasants' organisations to give up any trade union activity not controlled by the Government and that every day more trade union leaders were being arrested.
.In its communications dated  and  January  the Government stated that after careful examination of the various complaints presented, it had reached the conclusion that the allegations were unfounded and that the trade union organisations of the country had without interruption been functioning in accordance with the provisions of the law in force. The labour authorities had always been motivated by concern that the trade union movement should be vigorous and managed by the workers themselves. For its part, the Government had on no occasion arrested any citizen on account of his being a trade union leader, but only for participation in political activities entirely unrelated to trade union matters. The persons arrested on various occasions after  October  had been set at liberty, and the complaint relating to the present detention of trade union leaders was therefore inadmissible. The allegations relating to the persecution and imprisonment of leaders and pressure that had been exercised against the peasant organisations were also rejected, since the Government had placed at the disposal of the inhabitants of the interior of the country adequate facilities for them to organise and carry on proper trade union activities.
.The Committee observes that the various complaints allege the detention of trade union leaders since the Military Government came into power and suspended Constitutional guarantees in October . Some of the allegations also refer to searches of the premises of various trade union organisations, in particular the Isthmian Federation of Christian Workers, the National Christian Peasants' Federation, the National Trade Union Federation of the Workers of Panama and the Building Workers' Federation, and in certain cases the closing of the premises affected. The complaints also refer to the persecution of trade union leaders and pressure exercised against the peasants' organisations. The Government, for its part, denies, in a general way, any persecution directed against trade unionists and states that no person has been arrested on account of his being a trade unionist, but only for participation in political activities. The Government points out",-1,1969,Panama
220,"that the persons arrested have been set at liberty and states that at the present moment there are no Panamanian trade union leaders in prison.
.The Committee has always refrained from expressing an opinion on the political aspects of a state of emergency but from its earliest cases it has emphasised that in such circumstances, measures of detention which may involve serious interference with the exercise of trade union rights should be accompanied by adequate judicial safeguards applied within a reasonable period. The Committee has always emphasised the importance of due process of law in cases in which trade unionists are charged with offences of a political character or with offences under the ordinary law and has taken the view, for example, that the requirement of due process would not appear to be fulfilled if under the national law the effect of a state of siege is that the court to which application is made for habeas corpus cannot examine the merits of the case a
.In all cases involving the arrest, detention or sentencing of a trade union official the Committee, taking the view that individuals have the right to be presumed innocent until found guilty, has considered that it was incumbent upon the Government to show that the measures it had taken were in no way occasioned by the trade union activities of the individual concerned. That is why in all such cases, if the Committee has concluded that allegations related to the arrest, detention, or sentencing of trade unionists did not call for further examination, it has done so only after receiving observations from the governments concerned indicating sufficiently precisely and with sufficient detail that the measures taken against the person in question had no connection with the exercise of trade union rights but were occasioned by activities outside the trade union sphere which were either prejudicial to public order or of a political nature. The Committee has also on other occasions pointed out that the detention by the authorities of trade unionists concerning whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found is liable to involve restriction of trade union rights.
.From the information submitted to the Committee it would appear that the trade union leaders arrested were set free after a longer or shorter period without at any time being brought before a regular court to determine whether or not they were guilty in the course of regular judicial proceedings. With regard to the reasons for the arrests, the Committee regrets that the Government has not sent more precise information which would have enabled it to examine the various allegations in full knowledge of the facts.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to draw the attention of the Government to the considerations set forth above in paragraphs  and , while taking note of the statement by the Government that the detained persons have been set at liberty and that at the present time there are no Panamanian trade union leaders in prison.
.As regards the allegations relating to searches and closing of trade union premises, to which the Government has not referred in its reply, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to invite the Government to be good enough to send its observations and to indicate the present position of the trade union organisations concerned, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report once it has received this information.",-1,1969,Panama

222,".This complaint, by the World Confederation of Labour, appears in a communication dated  November  sent direct to the ILO. It consists of a copy of a memorandum drafted by the body known as the "" Authentic Trade Union Federation of Honduras "" (FASH). The complaint was duly referred to the Government, which sent in its observations thereon in two communications, one dated  September and the other  October .
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The facts of the case, as extracted from the complaint itself, the Government's first communication and the abundant supporting documents submitted by Government and complainants alike can be summarised as follows.
.On  June  a group of employees of the Bank called "" El Ahorro Hondureo, S.A."" formed a union and on the th of the month the provisional executive of the union notified the labour authorities of the union's establishment so as to obtain the protection of the law. In a decision dated  June  the Director-General of Labour declared that the union enjoyed state protection; the persons concerned, and the Bank, were informed accordingly.
.The very same day the management of the Bank assembled various members of the union just set up. The complainants affirm that the manager forced these employees to sign a statement withdrawing from the union. The manager states that at this meeting there was a friendly discussion as to whether or not it was desirable to have a trade union within the Bank. One point discussed, so he affirms, was the possibility that in the event of a labour dispute, the Bank's employees might show their solidarity with another union by recourse to extreme measures, such as shutting down the Bank, contrary to the public interest, and despite the competition of foreign banks, in which no trade unionism existed. Furthermore, the workers had been told that the advantages enjoyed by them had not been the fruit of trade union battles, but had been freely granted by the Bank. As a result of this conversation, the workers had freely signed statements withdrawing from the union; such statements had been referred to the labour authorities.
.Nevertheless, three days thereafter, these same workers wrote to the manager to say that their statements of withdrawal were null and void, since they had been constrained to make them by the bank authorities. In its turn, the union executive wrote to the manager to say that to destroy the union the Bank had "" had recourse to measures similar to those employed by a prison warder, culminating in illegal threats and acts of constraint "" and "" shameful acts "".
.On the basis of the statements of withdrawal from the union and of a complaint alleging constraint, lodged by the Central Trade Union Federation of Free Workers of Honduras (FECESITLIH), the labour authorities decided to investigate the matter. Various officials of the Ministry of Labour questioned the employees who had attended the meeting referred to above. As is shown in the report dated  July  (available to the Committee), all but one of these people said that they had withdrawn under the threat of dismissal. In the light of the investigations made by its officials, the General Labour Inspectorate on  September  fined the manager of the Bank for a breach of freedom of association. This decision was upheld by the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare, and the Bank's appeal to the Supreme Court of Justice was rejected.
.In the meantime, the Bank "" in a summary procedure before the Primary Labour Court "" asked for permission to dismiss the members of the provisional executive of the union, invoking section , clause B, of the Labour Code ("" any act of violence, abuse, assault or serious insubordination committed by the worker in the course of his work against members of the employer's family, members of the managerial or supervisory staff or other workers ""). The Court ruled that the language used by the executive in its memorandum to the manager (see paragraph  above) was punishable under the aforementioned clause; it also took the view that the employees concerned had freely withdrawn from their union. The Attorney-General for Labour (responsible to the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare) had been against the Bank's petition on the grounds that the management had used pressure against the Bank's employees; that, he felt, ran counter to the legislation in force, which protected the right to organise.
.While thus appealing to the labour courts, the Bank had begun an action for slander against those employees who had attended the meeting mentioned above, and an action for defamation against the executive of the union. This action against the executive alleged the use of insulting language (see paragraph  above). The action taken against the other employees was based on the contention that they had voluntarily withdrawn from their union while later telling the manager that they had been constrained by the Bank to do so-a calumnious assertion. These cases had resulted, respectively, in charges and warrants of arrest against the accused; the latter were currently released on bail.
.The union itself was given official recognition on  August , and on  September it was registered with the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare. According to the manager, the members of the executive of the union were not in fact dismissed, although the Bank bad been authorised to dismiss them. Nevertheless, several members of the executive in fact left the Bank and withdrew from the union, while other members of the union also decided to withdraw from the organisation. Finally, on  November , the remaining nine members met and decided to call for the union to be wound up, since it now had fewer than the ten members laid down in the Labour Code. Commenting, the manager stated that, "" the good will shown by the Bank, visible in its attitude throughout, had at last been understood by those few employees who, innocently led astray by outside advice, had been ill-advised enough to take action damaging to the Bank ... These few employees ... decided to declare that the union could no longer exist, since its membership had fallen below the minimum "".
.The narrative of events shows that right from the beginning the manager had been against the creation of a union and that within a very few months of its establishment the latter ceased to exist, its membership having fallen below the prescribed minimum. The meeting attended by the bank authorities and a group of persons belonging to the union just set up assumes great importance in this case. With regard to this meeting, there are two contradictory versions of what happened; one alleges that the employees were forced to withdraw from their union, and the other that they did so voluntarily, as the result of a discussion as to whether or not it would be a good thing for a union to be set up within the Bank. From the documents referred to the Committee by Government and complainants, and especially from the resolution adopted by the General Labour Inspectorate (whereby, after investigation, the manager was fined for a breach of freedom of association), and from the report dated  July , setting forth statements made by those employees who had attended the meeting referred to above, the Committee concludes that certain acts of antitrade union discrimination, contrary to Convention No. , do indeed appear to have occurred. Neither the verdict rendered by the Labour Court nor the decisions taken in the actions for defamation and slander contain anything which would enable the Committee to reach any other conclusion; nor does it appear from the texts in question that the statements made by those employees who had alleged pressure and constraint were disproved. In reality, none of the legal decisions given specifically deals with the facts which, according to the employees concerned, induced them to withdraw from their union and later to go back on their decision.
.The Committee observes that, on the one hand, the labour authorities punished the manager of the Bank for acts in breach of freedom of association, and that on the other hand, a criminal court had taken the view that the employees' denunciation of such acts constituted slander. The Committee recommends the Governing Body to express to the Government its concern at this state of affairs, as well as to point out the considerations set forth in the foregoing paragraph.
.As regards the permission given to dismiss the members of the union executive, and as regards the action for defamation brought against these members, it should be pointed out that the expression used-indicating that the management of the Bank had "" had recourse to measures similar to those employed by a prison warder and culminating in illegal threats and acts of constraint "" and "" shameful acts ""-is based on",1,1969,Honduras

The Government added that they were not arrested on account of their trade union activities but in connection with breaches of law and order. Trade union activities in Paraguay, stated the Government, were well safeguarded but the safeguards could not be invoked to justify non-observance of regulations on law and order. The trade union situation in the country was not what the Ministry of Justice and Labour would like it to be, owing to the absence of agricultural undertakings grouping a sufficient number of workers to enable trade unions or workers' associations to be formed. Rural activities were not carried on within large undertakings. Small family holdings were more common, farmed by the owners with the help of their relatives. The Ministry of Justice and Labour stated that it had no knowledge of the existence of the trade union offices mentioned in the complaint or of the supposed trade union organisations the complainants claimed to represent. The Ministry "" is satisfied with the development of the growing trade union movement in Paraguay and considers that this development cannot be impeded by complaints of non-existent infringements of freedom of association "".
.At its session in May  the Committee decided to request the Government to supply information concerning the actual offences imputed to Messrs. Riveros and Martinez which would have constituted breaches of public order and to indicate whether these persons were brought before the competent judicial authority. It also requested the Government to transmit its observations concerning the detention of Agripino Silva and to state the legal position of this person.Allegations concerning the Arrest of Efigenio Fernndez
.In its communication dated  March , the World Confederation of Labour referred to the arbitrary arrest of Efigenio Fernndez, Secretary-General of the Paraguayan Christian Workers' Confederation, and acting member of the Executive Committee of the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions. Mr. Fernndez, state the complainants, was arrested in San Joaquin on  March  while accompanying an official of the Ministry of Agriculture at the founding of a peasant co-operative. As stated above, no reply has been received from the Government concerning these allegations.
.The Government having failed to supply the information requested from it concerning the allegations, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to recall the observation made by the Committee as early as its First Report, namely that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and the Committee is confident that, if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side should recognise the importance for the protection of their own good name of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to such detailed factual charges as may be put forward;(b) to recall that, in cases involving the arrest of trade unionists, on various occasions, when governments have countered allegations according to which trade union leaders or workers had been arrested for trade union activities by stating that the persons in question had actually been arrested for subversive activities, for reasons of national security or for having committed common offences, the Committee has always followed the rule consisting in requesting the government concerned to supply further information as soon as possible with regard to the relevant arrests and the exact grounds on which they were made, adding that, if in some cases the Committee has decided that allegations concerning the arrest or detention of trade unionists did not require further examination, it has only done so after receiving information from the Government that proved conclusively that these arrests or detentions had no connection with trade union activities, but were occasioned by activities outside the trade union sphere which were either prejudicial to public order or of a political nature;(c) to recall the importance which should be attached to the principle that all arrested persons should be subject to normal judicial procedure in accordance with the principles enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and in accordance with the principle that it is a fundamental right of the individual that a detained person should be brought without delay before the appropriate judge, this right being recognised in such instruments as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man and the American Convention on Human Rights;(d) to draw the attention of the Government to the principle that the detention of trade unionists concerning whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found is liable to involve restrictions of trade union rights;(e) to deplore the fact that, despite repeated requests for information, the Government has not submitted the information sought by the Committee on the serious allegations made by the complainants, thereby making it impossible for the Committee to formulate its conclusions on the matter in full knowledge of the facts; and(f) to request the Director-General to maintain all appropriate forms of contact with the Government in order to obtain the information requested from it concerning the trade unionists mentioned in paragraphs  and  above who were arrested.",-1,1969,Paraguay
226,".The Latin American Confederation of Christian Trade Unions submitted a complaint on  August  with the backing of the World Confederation of Labour (communication dated  August of that year). It was alleged that on  August , Angel Riveros, Secretary-General of the Confederation of Christian Workers and President of the Regional Federation of Christian Agricultural Leagues of the Department of Caaguaz, together with Juan Flix Martinez, Organisational Secretary of the Christian Peasant Federation of Paraguay, had been arrested.
.On  February , the World Confederation of Labour submitted a fresh allegation to the effect that Agripino Silva, a young Paraguayan trade unionist, responsible for the workers' education activities of the Confederation of Christian Workers, had been arrested on  January of that year. In another communication dated  March , the World Confederation of Labour affirmed that Efigenio Fernndez, General Secretary of the Confederation of Christian Workers, had been arrested on  March .
.In a communication sent on  February , the Government said, with reference to Angel Riveros and Juan Flix Martinez, that the names of the supposed leaders of the Confederation of Christian Workers appeared on the police records of the Departmental Authorities of Caaguaz, where they were arrested on  July  and released on  July . It added that the arrests did not result from trade union activities but from action involving breaches of law and order. Furthermore, the Paraguayan Ministry of Justice and Labour had no knowledge of the existence of the trade union offices supposedly held by the complainants, or of the alleged trade union organisations they claimed to represent.
.At its meeting in May , the Committee decided to ask the Government to comment on the specific charges brought against Riveros and Martinez, and to say whether they had been brought to justice. The Government was also asked to comment on the alleged detention of Agripino Silva and to indicate what his position was in the eyes of the law.
.The Government having failed to reply although repeatedly invited to supply comments and information, as mentioned in the preceding paragraph, as well as to provide information about the allegation concerning Efigenio Fernndez, the Committee made an urgent appeal at its meeting in November . No answer having been received, it informed the Government, at its meeting in February , that under the procedure in force, the Committee was entitled to submit a report on the substance of the matter at its next session, even if the information asked for had not been received. Since this information was still not forthcoming, the Committee submitted its report to the Governing Body at its th Session (- June ). Paragraphs  to  of the Committee's st Report (approved by the Governing Body at that session) discuss the allegations and contain the Committee's recommendations.
.In accordance with those recommendations, the Governing Body recalled that as far as the arrest of trade unionists was concerned, in a number of cases where the complainants alleged that trade union leaders or workers had been arrested for trade union activities, and the governments' replies amounted to general denials of the allegation or were simply to the effect that the arrests had been made for subversive activities, for reasons of internal security or for crimes under ordinary law, the Committee followed the rule that the governments concerned should be requested to submit further information, as precise as possible, about the arrests and the reasons for them, adding that if in certain cases the Committee had reached the conclusion that allegations relating to measures taken against trade unionists did not call for further examination, this was only after it had received sufficient information from the governments showing sufficiently precisely and with sufficient detail that the measures had in no way been occasioned by trade union activities, but solely by activities outside the trade union sphere, which were either prejudicial to public order or of a political nature.
.The Governing Body also deplored the fact that despite reiterated appeals, the Government had not provided the information requested about the serious allegations made by the complainants, thus preventing the Committee from reaching its conclusions in full knowledge of the facts.
.Lastly, the Governing Body asked the Director-General to make suitable approaches to the Government with a view to obtaining the information sought with regard to the trade unionists in question.
.Accordingly, the Director-General made repeated attempts to secure this information, while the Committee itself made further pressing appeals to the Government with the same end in view.
.Finally, the Government wrote on  December  to say that although the persons mentioned were not registered as trade union leaders with the Ministry of Justice and Labour, Angel Riveros and Juan Flix Martinez had been arrested on  July  and released on  July of that year; Agripino Silva had been arrested on  January  and released on  February ; and Efigenio Fernndez, arrested on  March , had been released on  March . All these men, according to the Government, had been arrested for breaches of the peace.
.The Committee takes due note of this communication, though it regrets that the Government has failed to provide detailed information about the specific charges brought against these persons, to enable it to reach its conclusions with an adequate knowledge of the facts.
.In any event, in view of the time which has elapsed since the events referred to by the complainants and the Government, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note that the arrested trade unionists referred to in the complaints were released in July , February  and March ; and(b) in these circumstances, to decide that these cases do not call for further examination on its part.
.In a communication dated  August , the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions (CLASC) submitted certain allegations of infringements of trade union rights in Paraguay. The World Confederation of Labour (WCL), in a letter dated  August , supported this complaint. The Government, to which the text of the abovementioned communications had been sent, furnished certain observations in a letter dated  February . In a further communication dated  February  the WCL submitted fresh allegations.
.The WCL, in a communication dated  March , submitted additional allegations. The text of this communication was transmitted to the Government, which has not submitted any observations thereon.
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.Despite repeated requests to the Government by the Committee to supply more specific information concerning the allegations referred to in paragraph  above, and information concerning the allegations referred to in paragraph  above, the Government has, so far, failed to do so. Accordingly, at its session in November , the Committee addressed an urgent appeal to the Government to supply the information which the Committee had requested (th Report, paragraph ). No reply having been received to this appeal, the Committee, at its session in February , and in accordance with the rule of procedure contained in paragraph  of its th Report, informed the Government that it might submit a report on the substance of the matter at its present session even if the information requested had not been received. This information has still not been received.
.In these circumstances, before examining the allegations, the Committee considers it appropriate to recall the observation which it made in paragraph  of its First Report, namely, "" the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and the Committee is confident that, if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side will recognise the importance for the protection of their own good name of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to such detailed factual charges as may be put forward "".Allegations concerning the Arrest of the Trade Unionists Angel Riveros, Juan Flix Martinez and Agripino Silva
.In its letter of  August , the CLASC states that the Government has infringed trade union rights and interfered in the exercise of trade union activities. According to this complaint, Mr. Angel Riveros, Alternate Secretary-General of the Confederation of Christian Workers (CCT) and President of the Regional Federation of Christian Agricultural Leagues of the Department of Caaguaz, and Mr. Juan Flix Martinez, Organisation Secretary of the Christian Peasant Federation of Paraguay (FCC) were arrested at their homes. The CLASC adds that  hours after their arrest it was impossible to establish where they were imprisoned or to ascertain the actual grounds for their arrest. Steps were taken to secure this information, which was essential before any legal action could be taken on their behalf. According to the CLASC, the fact that the trade union leaders were hidden away and the lack of information as to their whereabouts are obvious proof of the infringements previously referred to. In its communication of  August , the World Confederation of",-1,1969,Paraguay
227,".These cases last came before the Committee at its February  session, when it submitted to the Governing Body an interim report, which is to be found in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (March ).
.In subparagraph (c) of paragraph  the Committee made certain recommendations to the Governing Body in regard to the allegations still pending, namely that the Government of Argentina be requested to supply information and observations concerning the alleged kidnapping of Mr. Raimundo Ongaro, the death of Mr. Emilio Juregui and the measures of anti-trade union discrimination said to have been taken against Mr. Carlos Bongiovani.
.The Argentinian Government has forwarded its observations by letters dated  May and  August .
.Argentina has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee earlier examined certain allegations by the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) according to which Mr. Ongaro, on his way to take part in a public meeting in Tucumn province in January , had been kidnapped by naval and police personnel and taken to a naval base near the city of Bahia Blanca, some , kilometres away from the place where he was arrested, and then released. In reply to these allegations the Government had denied the alleged kidnapping, pointing in evidence to the dismissal of the case by a judge on  April , and explaining that Mr. Ongaro had been invited by the police authorities not to continue his journey to Tucumn as it was feared that extremist elements would make use of his presence to cause disturbances, and had himself asked to be taken back.
.In view of the discrepancy between the two versions, the Committee at that time recommended that the Government be requested to forward the text of the court decision to which it had referred, together with the reasons (paragraph  (d) of the Committee's th Report). The Committee repeated this request at its February  session.
.In its communication of  May  the Government merely repeats that there never was any kidnapping.
.The Committee also examined a complaint by the WCL that Mr. Emilio Juregui had been murdered by the Argentinian police in a public street on  June . As the Government had not submitted its observations on that allegation, the Committee recommended the Governing Body to ask for information from the Government as to what action had been taken in order to clarify the matter and on any results of such investigations (paragraph  (f) (ii) of the Committee's th Report). This recommendation was also repeated by the Committee at its February  session.
.In its communication of  May  the Government states that the death of Mr. Juregui occurred during disturbances in Buenos Aires, and that the facts of the case have been communicated to the competent judicial authority. According to the Government Mr. Juregui was neither a trade union official nor a worker, and in view of the circumstances in which he met his death-during a street scuffle-the Government considers that it is not within the Committee's competence to concern itself with this aspect of the complaint.
.Lastly, the Committee examined a complaint presented on  November  by the WCL that Mr. Carlos Bongiovani, shop steward for the "" Consumer Routes "" (Rutas de Consumidores) section, had been suspended from his employment on account of his trade union activities. The Government, having been informed of this complaint, states in its communications of  May and  August  that it has no information about the person in question and that the National Industrial Relations Tribunal, a tripartite body which is competent to deal with all matters relating to the dismissal or suspension from employment of trade union representatives or modifications in their conditions of employment, has no record of this case either.
.With regard to the allegation relating to the kidnapping of Mr. Raimundo Ongaro, the Committee regrets that the Government has not forwarded, as requested, the text of the court decision, which would have furnished fresh evidence to assist the Committee in reaching its conclusions. As matters stand, in view of the time that has elapsed since the events in question are alleged to have taken place and the fact that no attempt was made to keep Mr. Ongaro in custody as a result of these events, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that no useful purpose would be served by examining this aspect of the case further.
.With regard to the allegations relating to Mr. Emilio Juregui and Mr. Carlos Bongiovani, the Committee takes note of the Government's observations, and in view of the lack of detailed information from the complainants concerning the persons in question and the circumstances in which the alleged events occurred, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that these aspects of the case do not call for further examination.
.The Committee examined these cases at its session in November , when it submitted an interim report (paragraphs  to  of its th Report) which was approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (- November ).
.In paragraph  of its th Report, the Committee submitted to the Governing Body a number of recommendations, some for the purpose of inviting the Argentine Government to send certain information in order that consideration of the corresponding allegations might be pursued. The Government sent further information in its communication dated  November , and the World Confederation of Labour submitted further allegations in a communication dated  November , relating to one of the aspects of the case, which were communicated to the Government. The recommendations formulated by the Committee were communicated to the Government, which replied in communications dated  December .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.With respect to these cases as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) concerning the allegations relating to the conviction of Mr. Elpidio Torres and other trade unionists by military tribunals, and the detention of Mr. Raimundo Ongaro and other trade unionists, to take note of the fact that the detainees have been released under the Act of Amnesty and other measures taken in this connection and to express its satisfaction that, according to the Government's statement, these measures make it quite certain that there are no trade union leaders deprived of their freedom anywhere in the country;(b) concerning the allegations relating to the appointment of a Government delegate to the CGT, to take note of the formation of the National Reorganising and Normalising Committee of the CGT, composed exclusively of trade union representatives, and to note that the functions of the Government delegate have been brought to an end; and to express the hope that trade union elections will be held as soon as possible, in conformity with the principle contained in Article  of Convention No. , ratified by Argentina, which recognises the right of workers' organisations to elect their representatives freely, without interference by the public authorities;(c) concerning the remaining allegations pending, to ask the Government once more to send, as soon as possible, the information previously requested regarding the allegations concerning the kidnapping of Mr. Ongaro and the death of Mr. Emilio Juregui, and to be good enough to formulate its observations on the allegation regarding the measures of anti-trade-union discrimination taken against Mr. Carlos Bongiovani-it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report when it has received this information.
.The original complaints and the additional information supplied in these three cases, which are dealt with together because they involve the same type of allegations, were contained in seven communications from the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) (dated  January,  May,  April,  May,  July,  July and  August ), two communications from the International Metalworkers' Federation (IMF) (dated  June and  July ), one communication from the Latin American Confederation of Christian Trade Unions (CLASC) (dated  July ), one communication from Argentine Trade Union Action (ASA) (dated  July ), two communications from the Trade Unions International of Chemical, Oil and Allied Workers (dated  and  August ) and one communication from the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) (dated  August ).

.With regard to all these cases, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) concerning the allegations regarding the arrest of the General",-1,1969,Argentina
230,"to urge the Government once again to lift the suspension of the trade union status and end the takeover of the unions still affected, and to keep the Committee informed in this respect;(b) as regards the allegations relating to collective bargaining and compulsory arbitration:(i) while taking note of the legislation enacted by the Government with respect to collective bargaining, as well as the temporary and emergency nature this legislation is said to have, to reaffirm that the right of free collective bargaining is a fundamental trade union right for all employees who are not covered by the safeguards provided by civil service regulations;(ii) in view of the implications for the standard of living of the workers of the fixing of wages by the Government, by-passing the collective bargaining process, and of the Government's wage policy in general, to draw attention to the importance it attaches to the promotion of effective consultation and co-operation between public authorities and workers' and employers' organisations in this respect, in accordance with the principles laid down in the Consultation (Industrial and National Levels) Recommendation,  (No. ), for the purpose of considering jointly matters of mutual concern with a view to arriving, to the fullest possible extent, at agreed solutions.",0,1969,Argentina
231,"dates of expiry of the various collective agreements.
.The Committee observed that the legal provisions in question appeared to raise questions that should be examined in the light of certain generally recognised principles respecting freedom of association and, in any case, in the light of that contained in Article  of Convention No. -ratified by Argentina-to the effect that "" measures appropriate to national conditions shall be taken, where necessary, to encourage and promote the full development and utilisation of machinery for voluntary negotiation between employers or employers' organisations and workers' organisations, with a view to the regulation of terms and conditions of employment by means of collective agreements "". The Committee, observed, however, that the provisions of Act No.  were intended to remain in force only until  December .
.In view of the fact that the observations of the Government had been expressed in general terms and concerned only part of the allegations relating to collective bargaining, the Committee postponed consideration of these allegations and requested the Government to be good enough to report on specific cases in which Act No.  was applied, and also to send the text of Acts Nos.  and .
.With its communication of  February , the International Federation of Chemical and General Workers' Unions, acting on behalf of its affiliated organisation, the Glass and Allied Industries Trade Union of Argentina (Sindicato Obrero de la Industria del Vidrio y Afines de la Argentina) forwarded the text of Act No.  of , alleging that the Government was prohibiting collective bargaining, in violation of Act No.  respecting collective agreements and ILO Convention No. . Under the terms of Act No.  a general wage increase was granted, the collective agreements in force were extended until  December  and Acts Nos.  and  were ordered to remain in force until the same date.
.The Government supplied the information requested of it on  May . According to its communication, Act No.  provided for increases in the basic remuneration established by the collective agreements due to expire in  and kept the agreements in force until  December . This Act, according to the Government, formed an instrument of economic policy to supplement the other measures adopted in the field of budgets, taxation, exchange, customs and finance with a view to the urgent stopping of the inflationary spiral. Act No.  was an emergency measure adopted in view of the prevailing economic situation. The Government went on to state that the Act in question had been replaced by Act No.  of  December , in order to prolong the emergency rules made necessary by the economic conditions the country was going through. The new Act maintained the temporary suspension of the system of concluding collective agreements-which would be re-established as soon as the Act expired on  December -and provided for a general increase in wages.
.With regard to Act No.  the Government states that under it a Technical Advisory Commission on Wage Policy had been set up to be responsible for the study, analysis and assessment of measures to establish a co-ordinated and harmonious wage policy with respect to the central administration, state undertakings, decentralised bodies and private public service undertakings covering the whole national territory or whose activities exceeded the boundaries of a province. Every plan for modifying the pay of the staff of the above-mentioned establishments must be submitted in advance to this Commission, which would issue the instructions to be followed with respect thereto.
.As for the application in practice of Act No.  respecting compulsory arbitration, the Government stated that arbitration awards had been issued in four cases, concerning commercial employees, textile workers, tram workers and workers in the meat industry.
.The Government concluded by declaring that all these Acts are emergency measures whose sole effect had been a temporary suspension of collective bargaining in regard to the fixing of wages. It was the Government's intention to re-establish the system of Act No.  respecting collective agreements as soon as economic conditions permitted. In the Government's view the legislation referred to above did not infringe either Convention No.  or any principle connected with freedom of association.
.Since this communication from the Government further legislative provisions in this connection have been enacted and have been brought to the Committee's knowledge. Mention may be made first of all of Decree No.  of  August  and Act No.  of  September . These texts authorise the re-negotiation of the collective agreements kept in force under Acts Nos.  and . The agreements re-negotiated in accordance with these provisions shall remain in force from  January  to  December . The negotiations must be completed within  days. If agreement cannot be reached, the authority may refer the matter to compulsory arbitration in accordance with the provisions of Act No. , which is now to remain in force until  December . While this Act provides that the parties may be compelled to go to arbitration where the dispute "" is of such a character as to affect the economic activity, productivity, development and progress of the nation and/or the security and well-being of the community "", these terms are so broad that they give the impression that the authority can submit to arbitration practically all cases in which it has not been possible to reach agreement.
.The Committee has also taken note of the enactment of other provisions relevant to the same subject. Act No. , already mentioned, provides for a certain increase in the prevailing minimum living wage, and Decree No.  of  September  does the same with respect to various family allowances. Act No.  of  September  prohibits the reflection in prices of higher costs resulting from the negotiation of new collective agreements, except in certain cases. Lastly, Decree No.  of the same date provides for the setting up of a National Prices and Wages Advisory Board, tripartite in composition, and with advisory and informatory functions, which will be required to publish an annual report analysing and forecasting trends in prices and wages.
.The Government has more recently, on  October , introduced further measures affecting collective bargaining. Acts Nos.  and , promulgated on that date, grant a general increase in the pay of all workers in private employment from  November  and provide for a further increase from I March , to remain in effect until  December . The Government may readjust pay rates from  January  if there is evidence of a decline in the value of real earnings, to be determined on the basis of the annual report to be submitted by the National Prices and Wages Advisory Board. Collective bargaining must exclude all matters pertaining to the fixing of wages. The wage increases granted must not be reflected in prices, with certain exceptions.
.The Committee observes that, according to the Government's declarations, the restrictive measures adopted in respect of collective bargaining are emergency measures and the resultant suspension of the provisions of Act No.  respecting collective agreements is only temporary. From the terms of the more recent legislation it is evident that these too are temporary measures, although it is worthy of comment that the restrictions imposed on collective bargaining as far as wages are concerned are to remain in force for a prolonged period lasting until the end of .
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body, while taking note of the legislation enacted by the Government with respect to collective bargaining, as well as of the temporary and emergency nature this legislation is said to have, to reaffirm that the right of free collective bargaining is a fundamental trade union right for all employees who are not covered by the safeguards provided by civil service regulations. Furthermore, in view of the implications for the standard of living of the workers of the fixing of wages by the Government, by-passing the collective bargaining process, and of the Government's wage policy in general, the Committee also recommends the Governing Body to draw attention to the importance it attaches to the promotion of effective consultation and co-operation between public authorities and workers' organisations in this respect, in accordance with the principles laid down in the Consultation (Industrial and National Levels) Recommendation,  (No. ), for the purpose of considering jointly matters of mutual concern with a view to arriving, to the fullest possible extent, at agreed solutions.
.In these circumstances, with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the allegations relating to measures to take over various trade union organisations and to suspend their trade union status:(i) to take note of the measures taken to restore the trade union status of the Telephone and Telecommunications Workers' Union of the Republic of Argentina (FOETRA) and the Tucumn Sugar Industry Workers' Union (FOTIA) and annulling the suspension of the trade union status of the Buenos Aires branch of that Federation;(ii)",-1,1969,Argentina
232,"that the persons arrested have been set at liberty and states that at the present moment there are no Panamanian trade union leaders in prison.
.The Committee has always refrained from expressing an opinion on the political aspects of a state of emergency but from its earliest cases it has emphasised that in such circumstances, measures of detention which may involve serious interference with the exercise of trade union rights should be accompanied by adequate judicial safeguards applied within a reasonable period. The Committee has always emphasised the importance of due process of law in cases in which trade unionists are charged with offences of a political character or with offences under the ordinary law and has taken the view, for example, that the requirement of due process would not appear to be fulfilled if under the national law the effect of a state of siege is that the court to which application is made for habeas corpus cannot examine the merits of the case a
.In all cases involving the arrest, detention or sentencing of a trade union official the Committee, taking the view that individuals have the right to be presumed innocent until found guilty, has considered that it was incumbent upon the Government to show that the measures it had taken were in no way occasioned by the trade union activities of the individual concerned. That is why in all such cases, if the Committee has concluded that allegations related to the arrest, detention, or sentencing of trade unionists did not call for further examination, it has done so only after receiving observations from the governments concerned indicating sufficiently precisely and with sufficient detail that the measures taken against the person in question had no connection with the exercise of trade union rights but were occasioned by activities outside the trade union sphere which were either prejudicial to public order or of a political nature. The Committee has also on other occasions pointed out that the detention by the authorities of trade unionists concerning whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found is liable to involve restriction of trade union rights.
.From the information submitted to the Committee it would appear that the trade union leaders arrested were set free after a longer or shorter period without at any time being brought before a regular court to determine whether or not they were guilty in the course of regular judicial proceedings. With regard to the reasons for the arrests, the Committee regrets that the Government has not sent more precise information which would have enabled it to examine the various allegations in full knowledge of the facts.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to draw the attention of the Government to the considerations set forth above in paragraphs  and , while taking note of the statement by the Government that the detained persons have been set at liberty and that at the present time there are no Panamanian trade union leaders in prison.
.As regards the allegations relating to searches and closing of trade union premises, to which the Government has not referred in its reply, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to invite the Government to be good enough to send its observations and to indicate the present position of the trade union organisations concerned, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report once it has received this information.",-1,1969,Panama

235,".This case was considered by the Committee at its meeting in May , at which time it submitted a report to the Governing Body which appears in paragraphs  to  of its st Report, adopted by the Governing Body at its th Session (- June ).
.The complaints contained allegations about repression of the trade union movement in Guatemala, restrictions on the free exercise of trade union activities, the deaths of various trade unionists and the disappearance of Miguel Vldez Girn, an active member of the Tailors' Union and former General Secretary of the Autonomous Trade Union Federation of Guatemala (FASGUA). According to the National Confederation of Workers of Guatemala, Mr. Vldez Girn had been arrested at his home in April , although the police denied this.
.The Government made no comments on these complaints, despite several requests by the Committee, which, at its meeting in November , urgently appealed to the Government for information. No reply was forthcoming, and the Committee, at its meeting in February , in accordance with the procedure in force, informed the Government that the Committee was entitled to report on the substance of the matter at its following meeting, even if the information requested had still not been received. Finally, no information having been supplied, the Committee reported as described above.
.In adopting the report, the Governing Body called the Governments attention to certain principles of freedom of association connected with the points raised in the complaints. It deplored the fact that the Government had not commented on the serious allegations made, thus preventing the Committee from reaching its conclusions in full knowledge of the facts.
.As regards the disappearance of Vldez Girn in particular, the Governing Body expressed the view to the Government that the appointment of an independent board of inquiry would be a particularly appropriate means of throwing light on what had happened and determining responsibilities.
.The Governing Body asked the Director-General to keep in touch with the Government with a view to securing information about the position with regard to Mr. Miguel Vldez Girn.
.Accordingly, the Director-General repeatedly approached the Government for information, and the Committee continued to make urgent appeals in the same sense.
.The only information obtained from the Government appears in a communication dated  January , from the Permanent Representative of Guatemala in Geneva, stating that according to the National Police Headquarters and the Ministry of the interior, a search had been made for Mr. Vldez Girn in hospitals and prisons throughput the country, but without success. Nevertheless, further attempts were being made to ascertain his whereabouts.
.In the circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to express its concern at the disappearance of the trade unionist Miguel Vldez Girn, to request the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of its inquiries, and to request the complainants to forward any information which they may have concerning what has become of this person.
.The complaints are contained in communications addressed direct to the ILO by the National Confederation of Workers of Guatemala, dated  April , and the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions, dated  April  and  February , and in a communication dated  February  addressed direct to the ILO by the World Confederation of Labour. The World Confederation of Labour submitted additional information in a further communication dated  May .
.The complaints and additional information were communicated to the Government on  April ,  May , and  February and  May . The Government, however, did not submit any observations thereon despite the repeated requests addressed to it. Accordingly, at its session in November , the Committee made an urgent appeal to the Government to supply the information which it had sought from it. No reply having been received to this request, the Committee, at its session in February , in accordance with the rule of procedure contained in paragraph  of its th Report, informed the Government that it might submit a report on the substance of the case at its present session even if the information awaited from the Government had still not been received. To date, this information has not been received.
.Guatemala has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  April  the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions alleges that trade union rights are being violated as a result of a Decree (No. /) which, according to the complainant organisation, prohibits the operation of trade unions.
.In its communication dated  April , the National Confederation of Workers also refers to the suspension of trade union activities by Decree No. /. This organisation adds that after the state of emergency was proclaimed a number of people were apprehended, including the former Secretary-General of the Autonomous Trade Union Federation of Guatemala (FASGUA), Miguel Vldez Girn, at present a militant member of the Union of Tailors, who was taken violently from his home in the early hours of the morning. To date, the police deny having taken Mr. Vldez Girn and detained him.
.In its further communication dated  February , the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions adds that, following the state of siege proclaimed by the Government of Colonel Carlos Arana Osorio, approximately  persons, including trade unionists, were murdered as a result of their political, trade union or student activities. For example, continue the complainants, the leader of the Christian Democratic opposition, Adolfo Mijangos, and the leader of the peasants' trade union, Tereso de Jess Oliva, were recently gunned down in the centre of Guatemala City. Other trade union leaders were also being persecuted and an attempt was being made to eliminate all the organisations and persons who were trying to maintain the freedom and dignity of the people and workers of Guatemala.
.In its communication dated  February , the World Confederation of Labour states that the wave of repression by the authorities has not failed to have an effect on the trade union movement. The WCL also refers to the death of Tereso de Jess Oliva who, it states, was once associated with the WCL.
.In its further communication dated  May  the WCL states that, under the decree introducing the state of emergency, all forms of trade union activity are prohibited, and that general assemblies of unions and committee meetings can no longer be held. As a result, it is not possible to conclude collective agreements or to ensure the normal functioning of the unions.
.In this connection, the Committee has taken note of the observations made by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to the Government in  in which that Committee noted the terms of Decree No. /, which regulates certain trade union activities during a state of emergency and refers to the existence of another decree which suspended the operation of trade union activities. The Committee of Experts observed that Decree No. / made it possible (with the approval of the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare) to extend the term of office of union leaders when it was impossible to hold union meetings because of a state of emergency, and authorised these leaders to undertake only activities connected with the termination or negotiation of collective agreements. The Committee also notes that while the Committee of Experts considered that these provisions represented progress as compared with the decree suspending trade union activities in general, it requested the Government to supply information on the steps taken to permit trade unions to engage in all legitimate trade union activities.
.The Government having failed to reply to the allegations, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to recall the observation made by the Committee as early as its First Report, namely that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and the Committee is confident that, if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side should recognise the importance for the protection of their own good name of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to such detailed factual charges as may be put forward;(b) to note that the allegations put forward concern the repression of the trade union movement in Guatemala, the restrictions imposed on trade unions in the free exercise of their activities, the death of a number of trade unionists, including in particular the leader of the peasant's trade union, Tereso de Jess Oliva, and the disappearance of Miguel Vldez Girn;(c) to note that the Government, in the present case, has supplied no information to show that these allegations are unfounded;(d) to draw the attention of the Government to the principle that measures taken in a state of emergency may constitute a serious interference by the authorities in trade union affairs contrary to Article  of Convention No. , except where such measures are necessary because the organisations concerned have diverged from their",-1,1970,Guatemala
236,".The complaint is contained in two letters addressed direct to the Director-General of the ILO by the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions (CLASC) and the International Federation of Trade Unions of Transport Workers, dated  November  and  December  respectively.
.Both of these communications were forwarded to the Government of El Salvador, which sent its observations thereon in a letter dated  May .
.El Salvador has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their letter dated  November , the complainants (CLASC) state that the Government was attempting to destroy the National Union of the Transport Industry and the Trade Union Council of El Salvador (CONSISAL). In particular, state the complainants, in October  the Government, "" with the complicity of a transport undertaking whose support it enjoys "", fabricated a charge of blackmail against two of the principal leaders of the Union and members of CONSISAL, Mr. Ren Barrios Amaya and Mr. Pompilio Martinez, General Secretary and Disputes Secretary respectively of the National Union. This charge, the complainants continue, was sustained by the Attorney-General of the Republic and the case was brought before the Penal Court. When the attorney of the trade union presented himself to be informed of the charge, further proceedings had been instituted on the grounds of "" creating anti-democratic anarchic situations "", an offence for which bail is not granted and for which the penalty, according to the law of El Salvador, is three to five years' imprisonment.
.The complainants further contend that the attorney submitted a written statement to the effect that there had been no such offence. The judge granted bail but the prosecution, on being apprised of the judge's decision, refused to endorse it without, however, explaining the legal grounds for this refusal. The complainants add that this took place prior to the Union's annual meeting and publicity was given to it so as to prevent Mr. Barrios and Mr. Martinez from being re-elected. In fact, state the complainants, both were re-elected.
.The most serious aspect of the case, continue the complainants, is that the warrant for the arrest of the two leaders is still in force and seven more trade unionists have been charged in a similar manner. By intimidation and even the threat of death, the comrades of the two leaders were being prevented from giving them any support.
.The International Federation of Trade Unions of Transport Workers, in its communication dated  December , stated that it supported the above complaint and added that, for many years, the Government had been placing more and more obstacles in the way of the trade union activities of the National Union of the Transport Industry of El Salvador. This Union, and the two leaders in question, were being subjected to systematic persecution, this being an infringement of the right to organise.
.In its reply to the foregoing allegations, the Government states that a complaint of blackmail was made by the representatives of the COTSA Transport Company against Mr. Ren Barrios Amaya and Mr. Pompilio Martinez Larin on the grounds that they had obtained the sum of , colones from the transport company, having threatened to declare a strike if their demands were not met. This complaint was investigated by the Public Prosecutor of the Republic.
.This case, adds the Government, was considered in December  by the Penal Court of El Salvador, which decided that the offence complained of had indeed been committed but since, in accordance with the Penal Code, blackmail cannot be committed against a body corporate-in this case the transport company-the case was dismissed and the accused permitted to remain at liberty, bail not being necessary since no detention order had been issued against them. The Government encloses copies of the judgements of the court in this connection.
.From the information supplied by the complainants and that supplied by the Government in reply to the allegations made, it would appear to the Committee that the two trade union leaders concerned were charged with blackmail or extortion. They were subsequently tried under normal judicial procedure in connection with this charge. From the judgements supplied by the Government, the Committee observes that the case against the two persons concerned was dismissed and they were permitted to remain at liberty.
.In the opinion of the Committee, no information has been supplied by the complainants in support of their allegations and in particular the allegation that the charge brought against Mr. Barrios Amaya and Mr. Martinez Larin was fabricated by the authorities with the complicity of the transport company in question; nor does the judgement of the court refer to any charge that these persons had "" created anti-democratic situations "", as stated by the complainants. From the aforementioned judgement it is also clear that no warrant for the arrest of the two trade unionists is in force, as alleged by the complainants.",1,1970,El Salvador
237,"the firm of ""El Porvenir"", it would appear from the Government's communication that since the workers had not fulfilled the necessary conditions to be able to take lawful strike action, they were refused the authorisation for which provision is made by law. Nevertheless the Government does not describe the exact circumstances that gave rise to this refusal or the specific legislative provisions infringed by the workers.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to deplore the fact that, despite the amount of time that has elapsed, the Government has failed to supply detailed information on the allegations, as requested by the Governing Body, thus making it impossible for the Committee to draw up its conclusions in full knowledge of the facts;(b) to draw the attention of the Government once more to the considerations in paragraphs  and  above; and(c) to decide, in view of the fact that the arrested trade union leaders are free and that the situation in the firm of ""El Porvenir"" has been restored to normal, no purpose would be served in pursuing its examination of the case.
.The Committee first examined this case at its May  session (see th Report, May , paragraphs  to ), when it submitted to the Governing Body an interim report, which was approved by the Governing Body at its rd Session (May-June ). In this interim report the Committee recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to furnish additional information on certain aspects of the case (see paragraphs  and  of the th Report).
.This case arose out of allegations according to which, as part of a wave of repression and persecution directed against trade unions, two leaders of the Autonomous Trade Union Movement of Nicaragua (MOSAN), an affiliate of the WCL, had been arrested and imprisoned, and further allegations according to which the Ministry of Labour had taken sides in a dispute between the employees and the firm of "" El Porvenir "", said to be subjecting its employees to harsh military discipline.
.The aspects of the case concerning which the Committee recommended the Governing Body to request additional information from the Government relate, firstly, to a statement by the Government to the effect that the action taken against the two MOSAN leaders was due to the fact they had been caught sticking up subversive posters and, secondly, to the fact that the Government had furnished no answer to the allegations concerning the situation in the firm of "" El Porvenir "".
.The Committee adjourned its examination of the case at its sessions in November  (see paragraph  of its th Report) and February  (see paragraph  of its th Report) since the observations requested from the Government had not been received. The Committee again adjourned its examination of the case at its session in May  (see paragraph  of its st Report), since the Government's observations had been received too late for the Committee to examine them in substance.
.Nicaragua has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.With regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as concerns the allegations relating to measures taken against two trade union leaders:(i) to draw the Government's attention to the observations made in paragraphs  and  above;(ii) to request the Government once again to furnish information as soon as possible concerning the subject-matter of the incriminating posters;(b) as concerns the allegations relating to military discipline and to the situation in the firm of "" El Porvenir ""(i) to draw the Government's attention to the observations made in paragraph  (a), (b) and (c) above;(ii) to request the Government once again to furnish as soon as possible the information in mentioned paragraph ;(c) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report as soon as it has received the information requested from the Government.
.The complaint of the World Confederation of Labour is contained in a communication dated  May , supplemented by two further communications dated respectively  May and  June . The complaint and the additional information supplied in substantiation thereof were transmitted to the Government, which forwarded its observations concerning their substance by a communication dated  February .
.Nicaragua has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.On the basis of information supplied to it by its affiliated organisation in Nicaragua, the Autonomous Trade Union Movement of Nicaragua (MOSAN), the World Confederation of Labour alleges in general terms that a wave of repression and persecution has been unleashed against trade unions and their members in that country. More specifically, it alleges that two leaders of the MOSAN, Messrs. Fernando Caracas Ricaurte and Guillermo Mejia, have been arrested and imprisoned.
.Appended to the supplementary information it has supplied in connection with this case, the World Confederation of Labour has furnished photocopies of the receipts for fines paid by Messrs. Caracas Ricaurte and Mejia, stating that these fines were the only means whereby they could regain their freedom. "" As you will observe, "" declares the World Confederation of Labour "" these receipts do not record any details, nor do they specify any particular offence as having been committed, which is yet further proof that in the Republic of Nicaragua the most fundamental workers' rights are disregarded, their leaders being imprisoned, heavy fines being imposed upon trade union officials and members and union members being terrorised if they defend the interests of the workers and refuse to submit to the dictates of the Government and the police "".
.Furthermore, on the basis of fresh information received from its affiliate in Nicaragua, the World Confederation of Labour accuses the Ministry of Labour of taking sides in a dispute between the workers and the firm of "" El Porvenir "", which it alleges to be "" subjecting its employees to harsh military discipline "". "" This is quite understandable,"" continues the World Confederation of Labour "" bearing in mind that the undertaking in question is owned by the President of the Republic, General Somoza, whose family has ruled the country for thirty years "".
.In its observations the Government states that the reason for the measures taken against Messrs. Caracas Ricaurte and Mejia was that they were caught in the act of sticking up subversive posters, and that these measures were taken in pursuance of Decree No.  of , the text of which the Government supplies. The Government also supplies the text of a statement made in this connection by the Police Magistrate of Managua, and points out that the persons in question have not appealed against the Police Magistrate's ruling.
.The Government argues that the World Confederation of Labour has based its allegations on information supplied by a "" non-existent "" organisation, the Autonomous Trade Union Movement of Nicaragua (MOSAN), "" of serious breaches of freedom of association in Nicaragua "", adding that this information too is unlawful and unfounded, and that "" in any case it should not be taken into consideration since this organisation has no legal personality, the Associations Department of the General Inspectorate of Labour having no record on its books of the registration of the so-called Autonomous Trade Union Movement of Nicaragua "". The Government appends to its communication an attestation; from the Associations Department of the General Inspectorate of Labour to the effect that it has no record of the registration of the MOSAN.
.Before examining the specific allegations made in the complaint, the Committee considers that it should deal with the preliminary question raised by the Government in the observations quoted in the preceding paragraph. In this connection the Committee wishes to point out that it has never considered itself bound by any national definition of the term ""industrial association"". In the present case the Committee notes that the MOSAN does have at least a de facto existence and that it is affiliated to the World Confederation of Labour. Moreover, the complaint having been filed in the names of the latter organisation, which enjoys consultative status with the ILO, its receivability in this instance cannot be open to the doubt that the Government appears to imply.
.With regard to the allegations relating to the measures taken against Messrs. Caracas Ricaurte and Mejia, the Committee has noted the Government's statement to the effect that these measures were taken because the persons concerned had been caught in the act of sticking up subversive posters.
.The Government does not indicate, however, what was subversive about the posters in question, and the attestation by the Police Magistrate appended by the Government to its reply is no more explicit on this point. Accordingly the Committee, in order to have all the facts before it when forming its opinion, considers it necessary to recommend the Governing",0,1970,Nicaragua
238,".The Committee first examined this case at its May  session (see paragraphs - of the Committee's th Report, which was approved by the Governing Body at its rd Session in May-June ) and again at its November  session (see paragraphs - of the rd Report, which was approved by the Governing Body at its th Session in November ).
.Nicaragua has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.This case concerns allegations that, as a consequence of a wave of repression and persecution directed against trade union organisations, two leaders of the Autonomous Trade Union Movement of Nicaragua (MOSAN), an affiliate member of the WCL, were arrested and imprisoned, and further allegations according to which the Ministry of Labour took sides in a dispute between the workers and the firm of ""El Porvenir"", in which the workers were subjected to harsh military discipline.Allegations Relating to Measures Taken Against Two Trade Union Leaders
.At its May  session, the Committee recommended the Governing Body to request further information from the Government concerning its statement that the action taken against the two MOSAN leaders was motivated by their having been caught sticking up subversive posters.
.In a communication of  February , the Government supplied no further information and confined itself to repeating the terms of the reply already examined by the Committee at its May  session. In a communication dated  May , the Government stated that in its opinion its was for the State of Nicaragua alone, in the exercise of its sovereignty, to decide whether or not the posters were of a subversive nature. In a communication dated  May  the Government repeated this viewpoint. None of these communications shed any light on the nature of the posters in question, as had been requested by the Committee.
.At its November  Session, the Committee considered it desirable to recall that, in accordance with Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Nicaragua, the law of the land may not be such as to impair, nor may it be so applied as to impair, the exercise of trade union rights. The Committee pointed out that the Government's failure to furnish a reply could leave room for doubt as to the Government's observance of this provision. The Committee further recalled that, in accordance with the procedure laid down for the protection of freedom of association, the question as to whether a sentence related to a criminal offence or to the exercise of trade union rights could not be resolved unilaterally by the government concerned, but was a matter for the Committee to decide after examining all available information. The Committee, consequently, recommended the Governing Body once more to request the Government to furnish as soon as possible information concerning the subject matter of the incriminating posters.
.In a communication dated  December , the Government deplores the fact that attention should still be focused on an event which occurred more than two years ago, when the persons involved in certain disturbances have been released and enjoy full freedom. The arrest of Nicaraguan citizens who were committing unlawful acts has nothing whatsoever to do with their being or not being trade unionists. The Government states that in accordance with the law normal police action was taken. The Government also rejects the allegation that a wave of repression and persecution was directed against trade union organisations.Allegations Relating to the Situation in the Firm of ""El Porvenir""
.At its May  session the Committee also recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to furnish its observations on this aspect of the case.
.In its communication dated  May , the Government gave an assurance that - contrary to what was alleged in the complaint - the Ministry of Labour had at no time taken sides and that relations between employers and workers in the firm of ""El Porvenir"" were peaceful and harmonious. In its communication of  May , the Government reaffirmed what it had stated in its previous communication. It added, nevertheless, that the Ministry of Labour had concerned itself solely with the enforcement of the provisions of the Nicaraguan Labour Code, particularly sections  et seq, which govern the procedure to be followed in the event of collective disputes of an economic or social nature between employers and workers, and sections  et seq, which lay down rules with regard to strikes.
.These sections define a strike as being lawful when it has been authorised by the competent conciliation board or labour magistrate, according to the circumstances. A strike is authorised only when all the procedures prescribed in the Code in the event of disputes have been followed: () submission of a statement of demands to the labour inspector; () report by the labour inspector to the Ministry of Labour, which appoints a judge to deal with the strike and whose task it is to set up a conciliation board; () appearance of the parties involved before the conciliation board (all strike action being prohibited if the labour side fails to appear); () voting on the proposals of the management by the workers, who must accept or reject these proposals by a  per cent majority vote () a fresh vote, the same majority being required, to decide whether to pursue negotiations or to take strike action. When the prescribed majority is reached, the board can authorise the strike, though its decision may be appealed against before the higher labour court (the appeal has suspensive effect and the court must give a ruling within  hours). When  days have elapsed after a strike has been authorised, the dispute is submitted to compulsory arbitration and the arbitration award is binding on both parties for a period of at least six months. Any strike declared without authorisation is considered unlawful and legally inexistent, automatically entailing the termination of the strikers' contract of employment, without prejudice to the imposing of other penalties.
.In view of the fact that the Government had not indicated the circumstances in which the Ministry of Labour intervened to ensure the enforcement of the provisions governing collective disputes and to settle the strike in question, the Committee, at its November  session, considered it necessary to point out:(a) that allegations with regard to the right to strike were not outside its competence in so far as they concerned the exercise of trade union rights;(b) that it had already made it clear in the past, in referring to its recommendation that restrictions on the right to strike were acceptable if accompanied by adequate conciliation and arbitration procedures, that the recommendation in question referred not to the absolute prohibition of the right to strike but to the restriction of that right in essential services or in the public service, in relation to which the Committee had established that adequate guarantees should be provided to safeguard the workers' interests;(c) that, while taking note of the information contained in the Government's observations concerning the provisions governing the settlement of collective disputes, the Committee noted that the provisions in question restricted the right to strike not only in essential services but for all workers. Being accordingly of the opinion that the observations made in the previous subparagraph applied to the present case, the Committee considered that the Government should take account of them and recommended the Governing Body to draw the attention of the Government to the importance attached by the Governing Body to these considerations.
.Since the Government had not supplied more detailed information as to which provisions of the Labour Code the Ministry of Labour had applied in the firm of ""El Porvenir"", the Committee also recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to supply this information as soon as possible.
.In its communication of  December , the Government rejects the allegation concerning military discipline of the workers and denies that the authorities took sides in dealing with the dispute in the firm of ""El Porvenir"". According to the Government the provisions of the Labour Code applied were those governing the procedure to be followed in the event of collective disputes of an economic or social nature and strikes. The Government points out that where concerted stoppages of work take place without the requirements of the law being fulfilled, section  of the Code is applied.
.Section  provides that if a strike is commenced without the authorisation referred to in the Code (see paragraph  above), the General Labour Inspectorate or conciliation board will declare it unlawful and legally inexistent, with all the legal consequences resulting from such declaration.
.The Committee observes that in its latest communication the Government, despite the repeated requests made to it, still refrains from sending the specific information requested in connection with the allegations concerning measures taken against two trade union leaders. As regards the allegations concerning the dispute in",1,1970,Nicaragua
239,"in a letter dated  October .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants allege that the Municipal Council of Goicoechea has dismissed thirty-two workers as an act of reprisal and anti-trade-union victimisation. According to the complainants, the dismissals took place because the National Union of Municipal Workers had submitted a list of claims for better economic and social conditions which the Municipal Council refused to discuss.
.The Government confirms that the Goicoechea Municipal Council did indeed dismiss some of its workers, but adds that this was due to the need to reorganise its administration in the interests of greater efficiency. Dismissals had taken place in other local authorities for similar reasons. The Government adds that some of the dismissals in Goicoechea were due to serious misdemeanours by several of the workers. As regards the submission of a claim, the Government states that under national legislation and case law, a municipality is not required to conclude a collective agreement.
.In its communication the Government declares that the labour authorities investigated the case and found no evidence of any victimisation. The conclusions of these authorities were, in turn, referred to the Tripartite Fact-Finding Committee on Freedom of Association. While the investigation was being held, the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare issued a circular to all local authorities urging them to lose no time in paying any compensation to which redundant workers might be entitled. The Goicoechea Municipal Council reported that it had paid compensation to thirteen of the workers it had dismissed.
.The Committee considers that the complaints fall, in fact, into two parts-first, the dismissal of the municipal employees and, second, the refusal of the Municipal Council to discuss a claim aimed at the conclusion of a collective agreement.
.As regards the former, the Government denies that the dismissals involved any victimisation but acknowledges that some of them were due to serious misdemeanours by the workers concerned; it gives no details of the nature of these misdemeanours. As regards the latter, it refers to section  of the Labour Code, whereby any "" private "" employer with a given proportion of unionised workers is compelled to conclude a collective agreement with the appropriate trade union at the latter's request. However, if the employer is a public body, this obligation does not apply.
.The Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), which sets standards designed to protect workers against any acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment and provides for measures to encourage and promote collective bargaining, allows an exception in the case of public servants engaged in the administration of the State. On the other hand, the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has stated that while the concept of public servant may vary to some degree under the various national legal systems, the exclusion from the scope of the Convention of public servants who do not act as agents of the public authority is contrary to the meaning of the Convention.
.In the present case, there is nothing in the evidence before the Committee to show which categories of municipal employees are involved so that it can decide whether or not they are covered by the guarantees contained in the Convention. Nor is it clear from the available information what actions some of the workers are alleged to have committed which led to their dismissal.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to request the Government to be good enough to define the nature of the duties of the workers covered by the claim submitted by the National Union of Municipal Workers and the misdemeanours considered to be serious which led to the dismissal of certain of these workers;(b) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report once it has received the additional information requested from the Government.Geneva,  November . (Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.",1,1970,Costa Rica
240,".The Committee previously examined this case at its th Session (November ), when it submitted an interim report thereon to the Governing Body (st Report, paragraphs  to ).
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee recalls that the complainants alleged that  workers of the Municipal Council of Goicoechea had been dismissed as an act of reprisal because they had submitted a claim aimed at the conclusion of a collective agreement. The Government had denied that the dismissals were acts of reprisal, stating that they had taken place either because of a reorganisation of the administration or because of misdemeanours committed by several of the workers involved. The Government had also stated that, as regards the submission of a claim, a municipality was not, under national legislation and case law, required to conclude a collective agreement.
.In this connection the Committee recalled that the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), which sets standards designed to protect workers against any acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment and provides for measures to encourage and promote collective bargaining, allows an exception in the case of public servants engaged in the administration of the State. On the other hand, the Committee also recalled that the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations had stated that while the concept of public servant may vary to some degree under the various national legal systems, the exclusion from the scope of the Convention of public servants who do not act as agents of the public authority is contrary to the meaning of the Convention.
.The Committee had observed that there was nothing in the evidence before it to show which categories of municipal employees were involved so that it could decide whether or not they were covered by the guarantees contained in the Convention. Nor was it clear from the available information what actions some of the workers were alleged to have committed which led to their dismissal. The Committee had accordingly requested the Government to define the nature of the duties of the workers covered by the claim submitted to the Municipal Council by the National Union of Municipal Workers, and the misdemeanours, considered to be serious, which led to the dismissal of certain of these workers.
.The Government responded to this request by submitting additional information on the matters in a communication dated  November  addressed direct to the ILO.
.In this communication the Government provides a list of the names and occupations of the dismissed workers, all of whom, states the Government, were municipal workers performing a public service for a municipal corporation, as a department of public administration to which section  of the Labour Code was applicable. This section provides that any "" private "" employer with a given proportion of unionised workers is compelled to conclude a collective agreement with the appropriate trade union at the latter's request. It appears therefore that if the employer is a public body, this obligation does not apply.
.The Government further states that the misdemeanours committed by the workers which caused them to be dismissed were indiscipline, refusal to obey orders of superiors and utter disregard for the tools and equipment issued to them for the performance of their duties, all of which was proved when the matters were thoroughly investigated.
.The Government adds that it is relevant to mention that the matters were not established before the courts, not because of lack of evidence but because of the intervention of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare, through which payment of the statutory benefits was secured for the dismissed workers. As a result of this, legal proceedings were terminated.
.The Government adheres to its view that the dismissals in question in no way amounted to trade union persecution, as alleged by the complainants, since at the time of submission of the claims for better financial conditions, the Municipal Corporation had already decided upon a reorganisation of its staff.
.From the information supplied by the Government in its communication, it appears to the Committee that the nature of the duties of the majority of the workers covered by the claim submitted by the National Union of Municipal Workers is not such as to justify the exclusion of these workers from the scope of the Convention. In the list of persons dismissed by the Council, the Committee observes that out of the  persons named,  are manual workers or labourers (mainly roadsweepers and refuse collectors), four are inspectors of buildings or public entertainment, one is a tax inspector and another a musician in the Municipal Philharmonic Orchestra. Clearly, the majority of the workers involved did not act as agents of the public authority and accordingly are entitled to the protection afforded by Convention No. .
.With regard to the dismissal of the workers employed by the Municipal Council of Goicoechea, the Committee notes the complainants' allegation that the dismissals were acts of reprisal and anti-trade-union victimisation which were the result of the submission of a claim by the National Union of Municipal Workers for improved conditions. The Committee also notes that the misdemeanours which caused the dismissal of certain of the workers were fully investigated by the authorities, and that acts of indiscipline, failure to obey orders, and disregard for tools and equipment, were found to be proved. The Committee is of the opinion that while the commission of misdemeanours of this nature may have been provoked by the refusal on the part of the Council to negotiate, it nevertheless considers that no information has been supplied by the complainants to support the allegation that these dismissals were acts of reprisal or anti-trade-union victimisation. The Committee accordingly recommends the Governing Body to decide that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.
.With regard to section  of the Labour Code and the refusal of the Municipal Council of Goicoechea to discuss or negotiate with the National Union of Municipal Workers in connection with its claim for improved conditions, the Committee wishes to draw the attention of the Government to Article  of Convention No. , which lays down that "" Measures appropriate to national conditions shall be taken, where necessary, to encourage and promote the full development and utilisation of machinery for voluntary negotiation between employers or employers' organisations and workers' organisations, with a view to the regulation of terms and conditions of employment by means of collective agreements "". In this connection the Committee has, on several occasions, emphasised the importance which it attaches to the principle that employers, including public authorities in their capacity as employers, should recognise for collective bargaining purposes the organisations representative of the workers employed by them.
.The Committee accordingly recommends the Governing Body to request the Government to consider, in the light of the considerations and principles set forth in paragraphs ,  and  above, what measures should be taken to ensure the promotion of the full development of voluntary negotiation between workers' organisations and, in appropriate circumstances, public authorities in their capacity as employers, with a view to the regulation of terms and conditions of employment by means of collective agreements. The Committee also recommends the Governing Body to draw the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to this aspect of the case in connection with its examination of reports supplied by the Government under article  of the Constitution of the ILO.
.In these circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to decide that the majority of the workers covered by the claim submitted by the National Union of Municipal Workers were entitled to the protection of Convention No. ;(b) to decide, for the reasons given in paragraph  above, that the allegations concerning the dismissal of  workers by the Municipal Council of Goicoechea do not call for further examination;(c) to request the Government to consider, in the light of the considerations and principles set out in paragraphs ,  and  above, what measures should be taken to ensure the promotion of the full development of voluntary negotiation between workers' organisations and, in appropriate circumstances, public authorities in their capacity as employers, with a view to the regulation of terms and conditions of employment by means of collective agreements; and(d) to draw the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to this aspect of the case in connection with its examination of reports supplied by the Government under article  of the Constitution of the ILO.
.The complaints by the Confederation of Workers and Peasants of Costa Rica (COCC) and the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions (CLASC) were submitted in two communications dated  July and  August . These were forwarded to the Government of Costa Rica, which submitted its observations",1,1970,Costa Rica
241,".The complaint of the Latin American Federation of Workers of the Construction and Wood Industry was contained in a communication dated  November  addressed to the Director-General of the ILO. The complaint was communicated to the Government for observations on  December  and when the case first came before the Committee at its session in February , the Committee decided to adjourn its examination of the case since the Government's observations had not been received. The Government's observations were received in the form of a letter dated  March  addressed to the Director-General of the ILO.
.El Salvador has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complaint was signed by Mr. Marcelo Luvecce, General Secretary of the Latin American Federation of Workers of the Construction and Wood Industry, who, the complaint states, on  October , in his official capacity, was on mission in accordance with a plan of technical assistance for the member organisations of the Federation. This mission began in Guatemala, from where Mr. Luvecce proceeded to Honduras, where he stayed until  October . On that day, the complaint continues, Mr. Luvecce flew to Ilopango airport in El Salvador, where, upon showing his passport, he was told that the Government had issued instructions not to permit him to enter the country. The complaint adds that his travel ticket was taken from him and he was deported to Costa Rica, the nearest country he could enter without a visa. The complaint points out that Mr. Luvecce, being a Chilean citizen, had no need of a visa to enter El Salvador, which he had visited on two previous occasions.
.The complaint explains that the purpose of Mr. Luvecce's visit to El Salvador was connected with technical assistance to the two member organisations of the Federation which had invited him. Furthermore, as Secretary of Workers' Action of the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions, he was to visit and make contact with comrades from the national organisation affiliated to this federation.
.The complaint continues that Mr. Luvecce protested to officials at the airport and pointed out that their action constituted an infringement of freedom of association. In addition to being mistreated, Mr. Luvecce's technical assistance plans were upset as a result of his arrival in other countries being advanced.
.The Government, in its reply, states that the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare was informed of this complaint and a detailed inquiry was subsequently carried out. As a result of this inquiry the Government states that it views with great concern the incident reported on behalf of Mr. Luvecce. The Government admits that Mr. Luvecce may indeed have been mistreated as alleged but that the matter must have arisen solely in connection with immigration formalities. The Government deplores and regrets that such an incident should have been interpreted as an interference in the exercise of freedom of association, a principle which, the Government states, it has accepted as one of the bases of its policy of peace and social harmony.
.The Committee notes the Government's statement that Mr. Luvecce's inability to enter El Salvador must have arisen solely in connection with immigration formalities. The Committee also notes, however, that no explanation is given by the Government in reply to the statement that Mr. Luvecce was informed that the Government had issued instructions not to permit him to enter the country. Nor does the Government specify the immigration formalities with which Mr. Luvecce seems to have failed to comply.
.The present case concerns an official of an international trade union organisation who apparently wished to make contact with two affiliated national member organisations. In previous cases of this kind, the Committee has applied the principle that the right of national workers' organisations to affiliate with international organisations-a right embodied in Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. )-carries with it the right of national unions to make contact with the international organisations with which they are affiliated and to take part in the work of such organisations. The right of affiliation is not, in the present case, in question. The Committee has, in the past, considered that it was not competent to deal with measures deriving from national legislation on aliens unless these measures had direct repercussions on the exercise of trade union rights. The measures taken by the authorities in this case could, in the opinion of the Committee, indeed have repercussions on the exercise of trade union rights. The Committee considers that in order to avoid the danger of these rights being restricted the authorities should check up on each specific case as quickly as possible and should aim-on the basis of objective criteria-at ascertaining whether or not there exist facts which might have a real effect on public order and security.
.Accordingly, the Committee recommends the Governing Body, as it has done on previous occasions, to draw the Government's attention to the fact that it would be desirable, in situations of this kind, to seek an agreement through appropriate discussions, in which the authorities as well as the leaders and organisations may clarify their position.",1,1970,El Salvador
242,"Body to request the Government to be good enough to give details of the subject-matter of the incriminating posters.
.Having noted, moreover, that the Government makes no reply to the allegations mentioned in paragraph  above to the effect that the Ministry of Labour appears to have taken sides in a dispute between the workers and the firm of "" El Porvenir "", and that this undertaking has been "" subjecting its employees to harsh military discipline "", the Committee recommends the Governing Body to request the Government to be good enough to forward its observations on this aspect of the case.
.Lastly, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to adjourn its examination of the case on the understanding that the Committee will report again as soon as it is in possession of the additional information to which reference is made in the two preceding paragraphs.",0,1970,Nicaragua
243,"it being understood that the Committee would submit a further report as soon as the said information had been received.
.The Government has forwarded two further communications relating to the matter dated respectively  and  October .
.With regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the allegations concerning Mr. Olavo Hansen:(i) to express its regret that the Government has failed to supply the information which had been requested concerning allegations of a most serious nature;(ii) to note that, in view of the contradictions which exist between the allegations formulated and the information supplied by the Government, the Committee has decided to request the complainants to furnish any precise information and evidence at their disposal concerning the circumstances surrounding the death of Mr. Olavo Hansen and the discovery of his body;(b) with regard to the allegations concerning the other detained persons, to request the Government to supply the text of the provisions of Law No.  of , which Messrs. Demisthoclides Batista and Herval Arueira are said to have violated, and the text of the judgements delivered against the persons concerned, together with the grounds adduced therefor;(c) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report when it has received the additional information requested from the complainants and from the Government in accordance with subparagraphs (a) (ii) and (b) above.
.The complaint of the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions (CLASC) is set forth in a communication dated  June ; that of the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) in a communication dated  June  and that of the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) in a communication dated  June .
.On  July  the texts of these communications were transmitted to the Government for its observations. The Government replied by a communication dated  October .
.On  November  the WCL communicated a number of further allegations. On  December  the text of the communication was transmitted to the Government for its observations. To date no reply has been received from the Government on the subject of these latest allegations.
.Brazil has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), but not the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants allege in their communications of June  that a trade unionist of So Paulo, Mr. Olavo Hansen, was arrested together with sixteen of his colleagues during the officially authorised May Day celebrations at the sports ground "" Maria Zlia "" in So Paulo. It is further alleged that Hansen was subjected to lengthy interrogation by the Political Police (the DOPS) and so badly treated that when he got back to his cell he could no longer stand. For several days he was abandoned to his cot; he could neither get up, nor speak, nor urinate. On  May his corpse was found near the Ipiranga Museum: it was covered with lesions and contusions-the product of the brutal tortures to which he had been subjected. His death was officially registered on  May , but his family was only informed on  May  (the date on which his corpse was discovered).
.In addition to the allegations relating to the arrest, torture and killing of Mr. Olavo Hansen, two of the complainants (the WCL and the WFTU) allege (without, however, giving details) that a similar fate befell Mr. Salvador Tolezano who was, at the time of his death, a leader of the Bank Employees' Union. The Committee dealt with these allegations in its th Report (see Case No. ).
.Two of the complainants (the WCL and CLASC) ask for the establishment by the ILO of a commission of inquiry to carry out an on-the-spot investigation in Brazil in view of the repeated and serious infringements of freedom of association and human rights in that country.
.The WCL in its communication of  November  alleges that a number of other trade union leaders have been persecuted as follows for carrying out trade union activities: Victorio Chinagli, President of the Male Nurses' Union of Campinas (State of So Paulo), was kept in custody from April until August  and was maltreated by the police during interrogation; Dr. Marco Aurelio, a trade union counsel working in Campinas (State of So Paulo), was kept in custody during the month of April and was tortured during the preliminary interrogation; it is not known whether or not be is still in prison; Aristocles Batista, President of the Railwaymen's Union, Ferro Leopoldina (Rio de Janeiro), has been condemned to eight years' imprisonment; Ahuera, also from Ferro Leopoldina, has been condemned to several years' imprisonment after having been tortured while awaiting trial.
.The Government, in its communication of  October , replies to the complainants' allegations concerning Mr. Olavo Hansen. The Government's reply essentially consists in a summary Magistrate of an official investigation carried out by the Public Prosecutor's Office to determine the cause of death of Mr. Olavo Hansen. According to this information, Olavo Hansen and certain others were arrested on  May  at the "" Vila Maria Zlia "" Sports Stadium and a police inquiry was initiated into their attempt against the security of the State, that is to say, for having distributed subversive pamphlets. The Government advises that Hansen was a militant member of the Trotskyist wing who had already been brought to trial before a military court in  and who maintained contact with individuals charged with crimes against national security as well as being an agent for the newspaper "" Frente Operaria "" (an organ of the Revolutionary Workers' Labour Party).
.The Government further states that "" after Hansen had passed through the No.  Police Battalion and the Operao Bandeirantes (OBAN) "", he was interrogated by the Department of Political and Social Order (DOPS) on  May . Mr. Dias, who carried out the preliminary questioning, noted that at the time "" he showed no signs of any injury or ill treatment "".
.It is further stated that on  May Hansen said he did not feel well and asked for a doctor. He was examined by Dr. Ciscato (the physician of the Policlinic of the Department of Political and Social Order), who ordered him to be taken to the Army General Hospital in Rio Paulo, where he was given a bed and suitable treatment. He died at about  a.m. the following morning ( May): the cause of death was established by the duty doctor at the hospital as being kidney failure due to a chronic and finally acute condition. The post-mortem report of the same date stated that internal examination of the body was negative from the anatomopathological and forensic standpoints. However, a toxicological examination of the stomach content, of the liver and of a blood sample was positive in revealing the existence of the insecticide "" Paration "".
.The Government further states that up to the evening of his arrest Hansen had been working at the "" Industria Agro-Pecuaria "", an undertaking which handles fertilisers and insecticides, the latter including a product called "" Paration "". While it was not established that he had any of this product on his person at the time of his arrest the police thought it possible that he might have had some hidden in his clothing or about his person. The Government further advises that Dr. Ciscato claims that when he examined Hansen on the night of  May, Hansen told him that he had long suffered from kidney trouble and was in fact undergoing treatment for it: Dr. Ciscato was of the opinion that Hansen died from kidney failure.
.The Government states, in conclusion, that the investigation into the cause of Hansen's death revealed exogenous poisoning by the insecticide "" Paration "" (as the most likely cause of death) since all the evidence went to show that at the time of his arrest he had either a quantity of this poison on his person, or else was suffering from chronic poisoning which led to kidney failure. The Government accordingly maintains that since he was in this condition prior to his admission to the military hospital and since he received proper medical treatment at the hospital, his death was natural and could not therefore be attributed to any third parties.
.In cases of this kind, where it is alleged that the death of a person has a direct bearing on the exercise of trade union rights, the Committee has invariably stressed the desirability of the Government instituting an immediate and impartial inquiry in order to elucidate the facts and to determine responsibilities. In the present case it would appear from the Government's reply that an inquiry was held and that the inquiry concluded that no third party could be held responsible for Hansen's death.
.The Committee, however, feels bound to point out that while the inquiry concluded that Hansen died on  May  as a result of "" Paration """,0,1970,Brazil
244,"it had been by the Institute of Forensic medicine.
.The WFTU states that finally Mr. Olavo Hansen's parents went to the Chamber of Deputies to ask Mr. Pedroso Horta, leader of the Brazilian Democratic Movement, to secure condemnation of ""the criminal act committed by the political police"". Pedroso Horta is said to have told Mr. Hansen's parents that there was no point in continuing their efforts ""because the Government enjoyed a substantial majority in Parliament and it was impossible to obtain an inquiry"".
.In conclusion, the WFTU states: ""Olavo Hansen's death in the So Paulo prison made a very great impression on the Brazilian trade unions and also on public opinion. By its systematic refusal to hold an inquiry, as proposed in the Chamber of Deputies and by the trade union organisations of Sao Paulo, the: Government of Brazil merely admits to the crime committed against the worker Olavo Hansen, who was employed in the So Paulo chemical industry and was a member of the Chemical and Pharmaceutical Industry Workers' Union of Santo Andr and Maria"".
.For its part, the Government supplied further observations in a communication dated  October .
.In this communication, the Government points out that the further information supplied on  June  by the WFTU - the text of which had been passed on to it - adds nothing to the complaint lodged by this organisation on  June  since, states the Government, this information is confined to a very one-sided summary of information published by certain newspapers at the time of Mr. Hansen's death, when the result of the inquiry held by the judicial authorities had not yet been made known.
.The Government considers that all the questions raised by Mr. Hansen's death were sufficiently clarified in its first letter of  October , in which all the information supplied to the Ministry of Labour and social welfare by the competent bodies of the judicial authorities were duly communicated to the Committee. The Government nevertheless presents the observations dealt with in the following paragraphs.
.The case concerning Mr. Olavo Hansen, states the Government, as it has always maintained, has no connection with the exercise of trade union activities. The real nature of the activities in which Mr. Hansen was engaged at the time of his arrest is clearly shown by the texts that he and his companions were distributing. These texts aimed above all at inciting workers to subversion against law and order and were signed by the ""Revolutionary Labour Party, Brazilian Section of the Fourth International"".
.The Government repeats that Mr. Olavo Hansen died at the general military hospital of So Paulo, where he had been taken urgently to receive the medical treatment required by an acute condition of kidney failure. After being examined by a group of doctors from the Institute of Forensic Medicine, the body was returned to the family for burial. The experts stated that the cause of death was a kidney condition that had never been properly treated.
.The Government admits that this case was discussed in the Brazilian press as well as in the National Congress. It adds that this merely serves to show the existence in Brazil of normal freedom of expression, making it possible to throw light on such questions. Furthermore, states the Government, ""it cannot be said, without distorting the truth, that the Brazilian Government opposed an inquiry into the matter: the Chamber of Deputies did not consider it advisable to hold such an inquiry in view of the fact that in the particular case of Mr. Hansen's death a judicial inquiry had immediately been opened by the judge presiding over the second military judicial circumscription, on the order of the Secretary for Public Safety of the State of So Paulo"".
.The Government of Brazil - the reply continues - considers the matter closed. It has been dealt with by a court decision, dated  December , in which the judge concluded, after examining all the facts, that Mr. Hansen died a natural death due to an acute condition of kidney failure. The legal procedure followed its normal course and the case has now been disposed of. Consequently the Brazilian Government has no right to reopen it.
.By a communication dated  January  addressed to the Director-General, the Federation of Workers in the Chemical and Pharmaceutical Industries of the State of Sao Paulo, on its own behalf and on behalf of its affiliate, the Union of Workers in the Chemical and Pharmaceutical Industries of Santo Andr, requests that the case concerning Mr. Olavo Hansen should be dismissed; in support of this request, the organisation concerned stresses that the matter has been elucidated in a satisfactory manner by the competent national bodies.
.Having taken note of this communication, the Committee notes that it emanates from an organisation which is not a complainant. Since the original complainants have themselves not withdrawn their complaints, and since both the WCL and the Government have supplied new information on the substance of the matter, the Committee considers that the communication from the Federation of Workers in the Chemical and Pharmaceutical Industries of So Paulo should not cause it to discontinue its examination of the case, and it considers that the case should be examined on its merits.
.The Committee notes the observations of the Government contained in its communication of  October  and set out in paragraphs  to  above. It regrets, however, that the Government has refrained from supplying, as it had been requested, precise information as to the procedure followed in interrogating Mr. Hansen, and its observations on the specific allegations according to which the body of Mr. Hansen, who died on  May , was found covered with bruises on  May near the Ipiranga Museum. This information would have been useful in attempting to shed light on the facts referred to in the complaints.
.Despite its repeated efforts to obtain information likely to help it in establishing the truth on the disturbing circumstances surrounding Mr. Olavo Hansen's death, the Committee is obliged to recognise that, since it first began its examination of this case, there have been two conflicting versions of what took place, which makes it impossible for it to express an opinion in full knowledge of the facts.
.In the circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note the further information supplied by the World Federation of Trade Onions, set out in paragraphs  to  above, as well as the observations of the Government contained in the communication of  October  and set out in paragraphs  to  above;(b) to regret that the Government has refrained from supplying the precise information requested on the points mentioned in paragraph  above, which information would have been useful in attempting to shed light on the facts referred to in the complaints; and(c) to deplore the fact that, despite its repeated efforts to secure information likely to help it in establishing the truth surrounding the circumstances of Mr. Olavo Hansen's death, the Committee, and subsequently the Governing Body, remains faced with two conflicting versions of the facts and is therefore unable to express an opinion concerning allegations of the utmost gravity.
.The Committee last examined this case at its th Session, held in Geneva on  November , when it submitted to the Governing Body an interim report, contained in paragraphs  to  of its th Report. This report was approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ).
.After the Committee's last examination of the case, two series of allegations remained outstanding; those relating to the arrest of Messrs. Herval Arueira and Demisthoclides Batista, and those relating to the arrest and death of Mr. Olavo Hansen.
.With regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to decide, for the reasons indicated in paragraphs  and  above, that the allegations relating to Messrs. Herval Arueira and Demisthoclides Batista do not call for further examination;(b) as regards the allegations relating to Mr. Olavo Hansen:(i) to note, once again, the serious nature of the allegations relating to the circumstances surrounding the death of the person concerned;(ii) to accord once again to the complainants the opportunity of supplying any precise information and evidence at their disposal concerning this aspect of the case;(iii) to request the Government, once again, to communicate detailed information concerning the procedure followed during the interrogation of Mr. Olavo Hansen, and supply its observations concerning the allegations that the body of Olavo Hansen was found covered with lesions and contusions near the Iparanga Museum on  May ;(c) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report when the information referred to above has been received.
.The Committee examined this case previously at its session in February , when it submitted an interim report, contained in paragraphs  to  of its nd Report, which was approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session (March ). In this report, certain additional information was requested from the Government,",-1,1970,Brazil
245,"poisoning operating on a kidney condition, the Government does not present any comments or observations with regard to the allegation that Hansen's bruised and battered corpse had been found outside the Museum of Ipiranga on  May , the day on which Hansen's family were notified of his death. The Committee requires further information from the Government in order to enable it to come to conclusions on this part of the complaint. Accordingly, it recommends the Governing Body to ask the Government for its observations on these allegations together with the text of the decision rendered by the court and the grounds adduced therefor.
.As regards the requests made by CLASC and the WCL on  and  June  respectively for the establishment by the ILO of a commission of inquiry to carry out an on-the-spot investigation in Brazil in view of the repeated and serious infringements of freedom of association and human rights in that country, the Committee considers it premature to make any recommendation concerning these requests until the Government has had an opportunity of providing this further information.
.In all these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) (i) to take note of the inquiry instituted by the Government to determine the probable cause of Mr. Olavo Hansen's death;(ii) to ask the Government to explain in detail the procedure followed in the interrogation of Mr. Olavo Hansen;(iii) to ask the Government for its observations on the allegations according to which Mr. Olavo Hansen's bruised and battered corpse was found outside the Museum of Ipiranga on  May , together with the text of the decision rendered by the court and the grounds adduced therefor;(b) to request the Government to furnish its observations on the allegations relating to Messrs.

246,".The complaint made by the Federation of Workers in Chemical and Pharmaceutical Industries of the State of So Paolo is set forth in a communication dated  February , and sent to the ILO direct. The communication was later supplemented by another, dated  February . The complaint was referred to the Government of Brazil, which, in a communication dated  May , submitted its observations on it.
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but it has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The information available (derived from the complainants' second communication and from the Government's observations) shows that the incident which gave rise to the complaint had nothing to do with freedom of association. The crime committed was one of common murder and had nothing to do with the fact that the victim had been active in the trade union movement.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends that the Governing Body decide that the case calls for no further examination.",-1,1970,Brazil
247,".The complaint of the World Confederation of Labour is contained in a communication dated  December , addressed direct to the ILO. The text of it was transmitted to the Government, which forwarded its observations thereon by two communications dated  May and  September .
.Argentina has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants refer to the arrest of two Argentine lawyers, "" closely connected with the Argentine trade union movement "", namely Mr. Rodriguez Anido, legal adviser to the regional office of Accin Sindical Argentina for the province of Tucumn, and his assistant, Mr. Salas Correa. These lawyers are said to have been arrested on the occasion of workers' demonstrations which took place in the city of San Miguel de Tucumn in November . At the time the complaint was filed these persons were allegedly being held at the Government's pleasure in Buenos Aires.
.In its reply the Government gives the following information. Mr. Rodriguez Anido, lawyer, was arrested on  November  for incitement, in connection with a demonstration of a political character, to actions disturbing public order and safety during the disturbances which occurred on that date in the city of San Miguel de Tucumn. By Decree No.  of  December , his detention at the Government's pleasure became inoperative and he was freed on  December of the same year.
.Mr. Salas Correa, lawyer, was arrested on  November , for participating in actions which disturbed public order and safety on  and  November of the same year in the city of San Miguel de Tucumn. By virtue of Decree No.  of  December  his detention during the Government's pleasure became inoperative and he was released.
.It would appear from the Government's explanations that the reason for the action taken against these persons was acts constituting a disturbance of public order and safety committed by them during demonstrations which took place in San Miguel de Tucumn and having no direct connection with the exercise of trade union rights. For their part, the complainants, who merely mention that the persons concerned are "" closely connected with the Argentine trade union movement "", offer no evidence that there was any breach of freedom of association in this instance.
.In any event, since the persons in question are now at liberty, the Committee, considering that it would be pointless for it to pursue its examination of this case, recommends the Governing Body to decide that it does not call for further examination.",-1,1970,Argentina
248,".The present case, which deals essentially with the take-over by the administrative authorities of trade union organisations belonging to the complainant organisation, was previously examined by the Committee at its session of November , when an interim report was submitted, contained in paragraphs  to  of the Committee's th report. This report was adopted by the Governing Body at its th Session (February-March ).
.At its session in November  the Committee submitted its conclusions on the questions mentioned in the complaint and drew the attention of the Government to the principles of freedom of association relating to the case.
.Having noted, however, a statement by the Government according to which between July and September  elections would take place which would completely regularise the situation of the Federation of the United Petroleum Trade Unions of the State, the Committee thought it appropriate before closing the case to request the Government to be kind enough to state whether elections had taken place in those sections of the Federation which had been taken over and whether the take-overs had now been brought to an end.
.This request was brought to the notice of the Government, which replied by an undated communication received by the ILO on  June .
.In this communication the Government indicated that the Union of Wage Earners and Salaried Employees of the YPF and the United Petroleum Trade Unions of the State at Plaza Huincul had held elections on  July  and that "" the management of the affairs of these Unions was handed over to the officials elected upon that occasion "".
.In these circumstances the situation of the trade unions constituting the complainant organisation appears to have returned to normal and the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.
.The complaint of the Federation of the United Petroleum Trade Unions of the State is contained in a communication received by the ILO on  December , supplemented by a further two communications dated  January and  February . These communications were duly transmitted to the Government, which forwarded its observations on  June .
.Argentina has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants allege that by Acts Nos.  and  and Resolution No. / of the Secretariat of State for Labour, the Government has taken over the Federation of the United Petroleum Trade Unions of the State and its Buenos Aires and Ensenada branches. These measures were taken, respectively, in October and September . Some time later, in December , the Secretariat of State for Labour further ordered the taking over of the Plaza Huincul branch. The above-mentioned Acts state the grounds for the takeover as being the existence of serious irregularities in the administration of these organisations and repeated infringements of the laws and regulations, particularly as regards the administration of their funds and the keeping of accounts. In the case of the Plaza Huincul branch, the measure was said to have been taken on the grounds of "" activities alien to trade union affairs "", but the text of the decision for the takeover offered no explanation as to the nature of these activities.
.As concerns Resolution No. /, which relates to the Ensenada branch, the complainants allege that on  August  a group of persons attacked the offices of that branch, displacing the legitimate authorities thereof. The police are said to have protected the assailants, and the Secretariat of State for Labour, when requested to see that the premises were handed back to the legitimate authorities of the Federation, issued the aforementioned resolution, whereby these authorities were stripped of their office and a controller was appointed.
.The complainants add that prior to the adoption of the takeover measures, the Government had ordered an inquiry to be made into the accounts of the Federation and of its Buenos Aires branch. The lawful authorities of these organisations were not notified of the results of this inquiry, carried out by inspectors from various Government departments, nor were they called upon to present any defence against any charges that might have been made against them; they were thus denied the right to defend themselves.
.The complainants explain at length the political motives which in their view prompted the Government to take the measures described above, deriving from the attitude taken by the Federation and its General Secretary, Adolfo Cavalli, to the Government and to its social and trade union policy. In reality these measures are alleged to be reprisals designed to "" eliminate one of the keystones in the struggle to attain popular demands "". There has even been personal persecution of Mr. Cavalli, whose name has been removed, at the order of the Government, from the list of employees of the petroleum enterprise for which he worked.
.The complainants later describe the action taken by the controller appointed to manage the Federation and by the labour authorities once the takeover had taken effect. On the one hand, between October and December  all the funds of the Federation were frozen and it was unable to meet its financial commitments, with the result that not only did the organisation lose its good reputation, but also it was involved in greater expenditure, having to meet the costs of the legal proceedings brought as a result of its failure to honour its commitments. On the other hand, the controller did not comply with the terms of reference given to him when the takeover of the Federation was ordered. Under the terms of the relevant Act, he should have convened the Central Executive Board of the Federation (in accordance with article  of the Federation's statutes) in order that the Board might decide upon appropriate measures to restore the situation to normal. However, he did not convene the Board because he was prevented from doing so by the Secretary of State for Labour, and on  October he closed the headquarters of the Federation. Military officials had exerted pressure on various members of the Central Executive Board in an attempt to persuade them to appoint a certain person as General Secretary, but their action did not produce the desired results. Subsequently, on  January , the controller convened a group of  members of the Executive Board and, invoking an earlier agreement between the leaders of the Federation, appointed a National Secretariat to run the Federation until April . According to the complainants, this agreement was not the outcome of any regular meeting of the Central Executive Board but was an agreement reached by a group behind the backs of the entire Board and based on the pressure and threats constantly exerted by the pro-Government sector as well as the pressure exerted by the Secretariat of State for Labour.
.Lastly, according to the complainants' statement, in February  three of the most important branches of the Federation-those of Ensenada, Buenos Aires and Plaza Huincul-were still under the control of the Government.
.In its reply the Government states that the Federation of the United Petroleum Trade Unions of the State was taken over on the grounds that the authorities of the union in question had been remiss in carrying out their responsibilities. Matters had reached such a point that the Secretariat of State for Labour took legal proceedings to ascertain whether what had been done amounted to an offence under the Criminal Code. It was for this reason that, in the preambles to the Acts ordering the takeover of the Federation and its Buenos Aires branch, no specific mention was made of the conduct of the members of the National Secretariat of the Federation, so as not to compromise a free decision by the courts. The Federation never exercised its right to go to law itself.
.In the case of the Ensenada branch, on account of certain administrative irregularities-including refusal to hold elections-the labour authorities appointed an electoral delegate with the specific task of arranging elections and regularising the whole matter. The Plaza Huincul branch was taken over because there was evidence that the persons running it were engaging in activities of a political character.
.The Government goes on to state that in accordance with the legislation authorising the taking over of the Federation, and with its statutes, the controller possessed all the powers normally vested in the National Secretariat, the Central Executive Board and the Congress of the Federation. By virtue of the above, it was decided that the representatives of the Federation's member unions should assume control. The Government adds that elections are being held between July and September this year to ensure that the workings of this organisation return fully to normal.
.With regard to the alleged blockage of the Federation's funds, the Government states that the controller arranged for an audit of the accounts and communicated the results to the legal authorities with a view to possible criminal proceedings on a charge of fraud, but",0,1970,Argentina
249,".The complaint of the Costa Rican Christian Workers' and Peasants' Confederation was contained in a communication dated  November , which was forwarded to the Government on  December  for observations.
.Despite the repeated requests made by the Committee, the Government has not furnished its observations. Consequently the Committee, at its May  Session, sent an urgent appeal to the Government to supply the observations requested (nd Report, paragraph ). No response having been made to this appeal, the Committee, at its November  Session, in accordance with the rules of procedure established in paragraph  of its th Report, stated that it intended to submit at its present session a report on the substance of the matter even if the information awaited from the Government had not been received by that date (th Report, paragraph ). The observations in question have not been received to this day.
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its complaint, the Costa Rican Christian Workers' and Peasants' Confederation denounces as ""trade union persecution"" the dismissal of Isaac Amador Prez, General Secretary of the union of the firm Ensambladora Centroamericana S.A. (ECASA), and of Manuel Chaves Sojo and Juan Luis Cordero Fernndez, other trade union leaders. These persons are alleged to have been dismissed by the undertaking for having collected signatures in order to raise the question of a collective agreement.
.Since the Government has not submitted its observations on these allegations, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to recall the observation made by the Committee in paragraph  of its First Report, according to which the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and the Committee is confident that, if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments for their part will recognise the importance for the protection of their own good name of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to such detailed factual charges as may be put forward;(b) to note that the allegations made refer to measures of antiunion discrimination against three trade union leaders, namely Mr. Isaac Amador Prez, Mr. Manuel Chaves Sojo and Mr. Juan Luis Cordero Fernndez;(c) to note that in the present case the Government has furnished no information to prove that the allegations are groundless;(d) to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that one of the fundamental principles of freedom of association is that workers should enjoy adequate protection against all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment and that this protection is particularly desirable in the case of trade union officials because, in order to be able to perform their trade union duties in full independence, they must have the guarantee that they will suffer no prejudice on account of the mandate which they hold from their trade unions; and that this guarantee is also necessary in order to ensure that effect is given to the principle that workers' organisations should have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom;(e) in particular, to draw the attention of the Government to the Convention and Recommendation concerning workers' representatives, adopted by the International Labour Conference in , in which it is expressly established that workers' representatives in the undertaking should enjoy effective protection against any act prejudicial to them, including dismissal, based on their status or activities as workers' representatives or on union membership or participation in union activities, in so far as they act in conformity with existing laws or collective agreements or other jointly agreed arrangements;(f) to deplore the fact that despite the repeated requests made to it, the Government has not supplied the information requested by the Committee in respect of the allegations that have been made, thus making it impossible for the Committee to submit its conclusions on the case in full knowledge of the facts.",1,1970,Costa Rica
250,"that there was never any question of a blockage of funds as alleged by the complainants. Lastly, as concerns Mr. Adolfo Cavalli, who was General Secretary of the Federation at the time of the takeover, the Government states that his behaviour is at present being investigated with a view to criminal proceedings. Although the complainants allege that he was the victim of an unfair practice on the part of the undertaking employing him, the National Industrial Relations Council has no record of any protest on his part of the kind customary in such circumstances.
.The Committee observes that this is yet another case involving the taking over of trade unions by administrative authority, with the removal from office of their leaders and their replacement by an official appointed by the Government. The Committee has already had to examine a number of cases relating to Argentina involving the taking of similar measures by the authorities."" The Committee, considering that such measures are contrary to the principles of freedom of association, has drawn the Government's attention to the importance of Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), which provides that workers' organisations shall have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom, to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes, and that the public authorities shall refrain from any interference that would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof. The Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, too, has observed that on various occasions the Government of Argentina has dismissed managing committees of trade unions and has appointed in their stead controllers responsible for administering the respective organisations. In the opinion of the Committee of Experts, measures of this nature are not in conformity with Article  of Convention No. , and the removal of trade union leaders in cases where violations of the legislation or of the internal statutes have been proved, as well as the appointment of temporary administrators, should be effected through the courts.
.The Committee on Freedom of Association wishes to emphasise yet again that the right guaranteed to workers' organisations by Article  of Convention No. , and the obligation imposed thereby upon the public authorities to refrain from any interference that would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof, do not mean that trade union leaders should be exempt from any supervision aimed at ensuring that their actions comply with the existing legislation (which in its turn should not run counter to the principles of freedom of association) or with the union's statutes. Nevertheless, it is of the greatest importance that in order to guarantee an impartial and objective procedure, such control should be exercised by the relevant judicial authority.
.As concerns the allegation that Mr. Adolfo Cavalli was the victim of an act of antiunion discrimination when his name was removed from the list of employees of the undertaking for which be worked, the Government has sent no information which throws light on this question. The Committee has pointed out in earlier cases, bearing in mind the provisions of Article  of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), that it is one of the fundamental principles of freedom of association that workers should enjoy adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment-dismissal, transfer or other prejudicial measures-and that this protection is particularly desirable in the case of trade union officials because, in order to carry out their trade union functions in full independence, they must have the assurance that they will not be victimised by virtue of their trade union office a The Committee observes that the legislation of Argentina (Act No.  respecting industrial associations of employees) contains a number of provisions for the protection of trade union officials and representatives in their employment, and that the National Industrial Relations Council is the body competent to examine complaints of infringement of these provisions and put matters right where it is proved that such infringement has taken place. In this respect the Committee takes note of the information supplied by the Government to the effect that no complaint concerning Mr. Cavalli has been filed with that body, as would have been natural in such a case.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the attention of the Government in particular to the observations set forth in paragraphs  and  above;(b) to urge the Government to enact such provisions as are necessary in the light of these observations in order to bring national law and practice into harmony with Article  of Convention No. ;(c) to request the Government to provide information as to whether elections have been held in the taken-over branches of the Federation of the United Petroleum Trade Unions of the State, and whether the takeovers have now been brought to an end;(d) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report as soon as it is in possession of the information requested from the Government.Geneva,  November, .

.In its communication dated  February , the World Confederation of Labour states that the wave of repression by the authorities has not failed to have an effect on the trade union movement. The WCL also refers to the death of Tereso de Jess Oliva who, it states, was once associated with the WCL.
.In its further communication dated  May  the WCL states that, under the decree introducing the state of emergency, all forms of trade union activity are prohibited, and that general assemblies of unions and committee meetings can no longer be held. As a result, it is not possible to conclude collective agreements or to ensure the normal functioning of the unions.
.In this connection, the Committee has taken note of the observations made by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to the Government in  in which that Committee noted the terms of Decree No. /, which regulates certain trade union activities during a state of emergency and refers to the existence of another decree which suspended the operation of trade union activities. The Committee of Experts observed that Decree No. / made it possible (with the approval of the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare) to extend the term of office of union leaders when it was impossible to hold union meetings because of a state of emergency, and authorised these leaders to undertake only activities connected with the termination or negotiation of collective agreements. The Committee also notes that while the Committee of Experts considered that these provisions represented progress as compared with the decree suspending trade union activities in general, it requested the Government to supply information on the steps taken to permit trade unions to engage in all legitimate trade union activities.
.The Government having failed to reply to the allegations, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to recall the observation made by the Committee as early as its First Report, namely that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and the Committee is confident that, if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side should recognise the importance for the protection of their own good name of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to such detailed factual charges as may be put forward;(b) to note that the allegations put forward concern the repression of the trade union movement in Guatemala, the restrictions imposed on trade unions in the free exercise of their activities, the death of a number of trade unionists, including in particular the leader of the peasant's trade union, Tereso de Jess Oliva, and the disappearance of Miguel Vldez Girn;(c) to note that the Government, in the present case, has supplied no information to show that these allegations are unfounded;(d) to draw the attention of the Government to the principle that measures taken in a state of emergency may constitute a serious interference by the authorities in trade union affairs contrary to Article  of Convention No. , except where such measures are necessary because the organisations concerned have diverged from their trade union objectives and have defied the law, and that in any case, such measures should be accompanied by adequate judicial guarantees invoked within a reasonable time;(e) to draw the attention of the Government to the principle that freedom of association implies not only the right of workers and employers to form freely associations of their own choosing but also the right, for the occupational organisations themselves, to pursue lawful activities in defence of their occupational interests; and that the right of trade unions to hold meetings freely on their own premises, without the need for previous authorisation and without control by the public authorities, is a fundamental element in freedom of association;(f) to deplore the fact that, despite the repeated requests for information, the Government has not submitted any observations on the serious allegations put forward by the complainants, thereby making it impossible for the Committee to formulate its conclusions on the matter in full knowledge of the facts;(g) to draw the attention of the Government, with regard to the death of Tereso de Jess Oliva and the disappearance of Miguel Vldez Girn, to the opinion that the appointment of an independent commission of inquiry by the Government concerned would be a particularly appropriate method of ascertaining facts and determining responsibilities in these cases; and(h) to request the Director-General to maintain all appropriate forms of contact with the Government in order to obtain information concerning the position of Mr. Miguel Vldez Girn.",-1,1970,Guatemala
252,".The Committee examined this case at its session in February , when it submitted to the Governing Body an interim report, contained in paragraphs - of its rd Report. The Governing Body approved this Report at its rd Session (May ).
.In the said Report certain further information and comments were requested from the Government, which sent them in two communications dated  May and  August  respectively.
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.It will be recalled that the complainants referred, in their complaint dated  June , to a previous complaint relating to the Government's decision in January  to take over the Argentine Federation of Chemical and Allied Workers. On that occasion the Committee had recommended the Governing Body "" to take note of the Government's statement that it intends to restore the situation of the trade union organisation in question to normal as soon as possible "". The complainants went on to say that no measure was taken along these lines and that the authorities forcibly handed over the management of the Federation to Government supporters. The leaders imposed by the authorities proceeded to organise "" rigged "" elections at the end of November . The electoral Committee, made up of persons who had no connection with the organisation, produced no lists of candidates and refused to allow the ballot boxes to be kept on the Federation's premises, as was customary. As a result, the complainants alleged, a large number of members of the Federation abstained from voting.
.In its reply dated  October , the Government referred to the elections held within the Federation, stating that there had been no electoral Committee and no allegations of electoral fraud. The government-appointed controller of the organisation, an official from the Secretariat of State for Labour, organised an election on  February  and, at the Congress held one month later, the new authorities of the Federation were elected, taking over the trade union organisation on  March . The Congress had submitted a single list of candidates, which obtained  votes from the  delegates.
.At its session in February  the Committee observed, primarily, that the procedure whereby the leaders of the Federation were elected did not reach its culmination until two years after the takeover of the organisation by the public authorities. The Committee considered it necessary to emphasise in this respect the importance it attaches to the principle contained in Article  of Convention No. , which lays down that "" workers' and employers' organisations shall have the right to draw up their Constitutions and rules, to elect their representatives in full freedom, to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes "", and that "" the public authorities shall refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof "".
.As regards the elections themselves, the Committee observed that, in their account of the events, the complainants referred to what appeared to have been primary elections, held in November  for the purpose of electing delegates to the Congress which was to have the actual task of electing the leaders of the Federation. The Government had supplied certain details about this Congress but, apart from stating that there had been no electoral Committee, it had made no comment on the remaining assertions of the complainants with regard to these primary elections, which concerned alleged irregularities in regard to the displaying of a list of candidates and the custody of the ballot boxes.
.It would appear from certain trade union leaflets, of which copies were supplied to the Committee by the complainants, that the group of trade unionists ousted as a result of the takeover hold the takeover responsible, in particular, for the following facts: that the rolls listing the names and other particulars of the electors were not made available to those on the officially authorised lists of candidates; that the ballot boxes were not allowed to be kept on the Federation's premises; that the persons on the officially authorised list of candidates were not permitted to be on the electoral Committee (or board); and that no announcement was made as to when and where the voting was to take place. Accordingly, the group of trade unionists in question announced the withdrawal of their list of candidates and urged the workers to boycott the election.
.The Committee recalled Decree No.  of , which was apparently in force at the time of the elections, and which contains certain provisions relevant to some of the points raised by the complainants. Section  of the Decree lays down certain rules with regard to elections which must be embodied in the by-laws of trade unions. As concerns electoral rolls, section  (d) stipulates that they must be made available to members and to candidates for office not less than  days prior to the date of the election. As for the places where the votes may be cast, section  (b) states that these must be specified in the notice of election and may not be changed.
.Furthermore, the Committee noted the Government's observations to the effect that no allegations of electoral fraud had been made. In this respect the Committee pointed out that it had stated on many occasions that, while in view of the nature of its responsibilities it could not consider itself bound by the rule, normally applicable in international jurisdictions, that national procedures of redress must be utilised in the first instance, it must have regard, however, in examining the merits of a case, to the fact that a national remedy before an independent tribunal, whose procedure offered appropriate guarantees, had not been pursued.
.In conclusion, the Committee recommended that the Government be requested: (a) to supply information concerning the administrative and judicial avenues open to the trade unionists involved in the present case whereby they could appeal against the decisions of the controller as regards the elections that had been held; (b) to forward its observations and comments on the points mentioned in paragraphs  and  above.
.In its communication of  May  the Government states that the leaflets sent to the Committee by the complainants do not constitute authentic proof and that the electoral meeting and last ballot undertaken in the Chemical and Allied Workers' Union were entirely normal and gave rise to no objections. The Committee understands that this refers to the primary elections mentioned by the complainants. The Government goes on to say that only one list of candidates was presented at the elections since the other lists, which had been officially approved, were withdrawn. Voting was secret and the Government gives the addresses of the places in which the  voting booths were installed. There were , names on the electoral roll and , persons voted. The list presented obtained , votes. Twenty-one votes were declared null and void and there were  blank votes. The Government adds that the leaflets sent to the ILO by the complainants are self-contradictory since, while one of them denounces irregularities, a subsequent one calls upon members to take part in the elections (which implies that the alleged irregularities had been made good) and that, lastly, one day before the elections began, a further leaflet called for non-participation in the elections.
.In its communication of  August , the Government explains that the decisions taken by the government-appointed controller of an occupational association, as regards elections held therein, may be challenged if they contravene the provisions of the association's by-laws. Such decisions may be appealed against to the controller's hierarchical superiors (in accordance with Decree No. /). Moreover, recourse may always be had to court proceedings by any person who considers that his legitimate rights and interests have been abused. In cases where prompt and efficacious intervention is required to ensure the effective application of the guarantees embodied in the Constitution, the persons concerned may avail themselves of the amparo procedure to secure respect of a fundamental right (Act No. ). The Government explains that this was the interpretation given by the Supreme Court of Justice when it ruled that "" where acts already committed by administrative authorities constitute a present or imminent threat of actual harm, there are grounds for seeking the protection of the courts "".
.The Committee observes that the further communications sent by the Government contain no specific information regarding the complainants' allegations, mentioned in paragraph , or the relevant legislative provisions, referred to in paragraph . The Government confines itself to pointing out that the fact that in one of the trade union leaflets members were urged to participate in the voting implies that the irregularities denounced by the trade union concerned, in a previous leaflet, had been remedied. Nevertheless, the Committee notes that in the final leaflet, calling upon workers not to take part in the elections, the reasons given are the alleged irregularities",2,1970,Argentina
253,"Accordingly, the group of trade unionists in question announced the withdrawal of their list of candidates and urged the workers to boycott the election.
.The Committee recalls Decree No.  of , which was apparently in force at the time of the elections, and which contains certain provisions relevant to some of the points raised by the complainants. Section  of the Decree lays down certain rules with regard to elections, which must be embodied in the by-laws of trade unions. As concerns electoral rolls, section  (d) stipulates that they must be made available to members and to the candidates for office not less than  days prior to the date of the election. As for the places where votes may be cast, section  (b) states that they must be specified in the notice of election and may not be changed.
.In order to be in possession of sufficient evidence on which to base its conclusions in regard to this case, the Committee would like to have the Government's observations and comments on the points mentioned in the two preceding paragraphs.
.In these circumstances, with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw attention to the importance it attaches to the principle contained in Article  of Convention No. , which lays down that workers' and employers' organisations shall have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom, to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes, and that the public authorities shall refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof;(b) to request the Government to be good enough to supply information concerning the administrative and judicial avenues which were open to the trade unionists involved in the present case enabling them to appeal against the decisions of the controller concerning the elections in question;(c) to request the Government to be good enough to forward its observations and comments on the points mentioned in paragraphs  and  above;(d) to take note of the present interim report, on the understanding that the Committee will report again as soon as it is in possession of the information, observations and comments to which reference is made in this paragraph.Geneva,  February  (Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.",-1,1970,Argentina
254,"referred to in paragraph  above. Two of these irregularities would constitute infringements of the provisions of Decree No.  of  (see paragraph  above). The Committee consequently considers that, because of the lack of precision and detail in the information sent by the Government, it is impossible to throw sufficient light on the events complained about in this case. Nor is the Committee in a position to judge the extent to which the alleged irregularities would have rendered the electoral process fraudulent. In any case, they appear to have led to the withdrawal of various lists of candidates so that the trade union election could not be held in completely normal conditions. Moreover, the Committee observes that less than half of those who were entitled to vote actually did so.
.The Committee considers it necessary to recall that the elections took place while the Argentine Federation of Chemical and Allied Workers (to which the Chemical and Allied Workers' Union is affiliated) was under Government control and that the elections were organised by the official from the Secretariat of State for Labour who was acting as controller. The Committee has frequently had occasion to express its opinion (restated in paragraph  above) with regard to the taking over of trade unions by public authorities. As regards measures that can be taken by government-appointed controllers in the exercise of their functions, the Committee considers that these are liable to appear arbitrary, even though they may be called in question before the courts. This is why the Committee has repeatedly pointed out that, although the principles established in Article  of Convention No.  do not prevent the control of internal acts of a trade union, if it is considered that such acts constitute a breach of legal or statutory provisions, it is of the utmost importance, in order to guarantee an impartial and objective procedure, for such control to be exercised by the relevant judicial authority. This would avoid the risk to the free exercise of trade union rights caused by any type of administrative takeover of trade unions.
.On the other hand, the Committee observes that the decisions taken by the government-appointed controller could have been appealed against in the courts in order to clarify the matters raised by the persons involved and, in view of the circumstances, to provide a timely remedy to any proved irregularity, but that the persons concerned did not avail themselves of this possibility.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to regret the fact that the Government has not sent precise information regarding the allegations made by the complainants of irregularities in trade union elections;(b) to note that the persons concerned did not avail themselves in this case of their right of appeal to the judicial authorities to oppose the measures alleged to have affected them in the electoral procedure;(c) to draw the Government's attention to the considerations set forth in paragraphs  and  above as regards the specific question of trade union elections and the more general problem of the taking over of trade unions by the administrative authorities.
.The complaint of the Trade Unions International of Chemical, Oil and Allied Workers is contained in a communication dated  June . It was brought to the attention of the Government, which forwarded its observations by a communication dated  October .
.Argentina has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants begin by referring to an earlier complaint examined by the Committee, which related to the taking over by the Government, ordered in January , of the Argentine Federation of Chemical and Allied Workers. The Committee recommended the Governing Body in connection with that case "" to take note of the Government's statement that it intends to restore the trade union organisation in question to normal as soon as possible "".
.The complainants go on to say that no action has been taken to this effect, and that the authorities have forcibly handed over the management of the Federation to pro-government collaborators. The General Secretary of the Federation, who had been arrested in July , was released only after mass demonstrations and a strike. According to the complaint, the leaders imposed upon the Federation by the authorities organised rigged elections at the end of November . The electoral committee, composed of people who had no connection with the Federation, displayed no list of candidates and even refused to allow the ballot boxes to be kept on the Federation's premises as was customary. In view of these facts, allege the complainants, the Federation's members abstained from voting in large numbers.
.The complaint concludes with the statement that the last collective agreement was signed on behalf of the Federation by government officials.
.In its reply the Government, referring to the General Secretary of the Federation, mentioned above, declares that he was arrested on account of activities presumed to be of subversive nature, and subsequently released.
.As regards the elections held within the Federation, the Government states that there was no electoral committee and that no allegations were made of electoral fraud. The controller in charge of the taking over of the organisation, an official of the Secretariat of State for Labour, called for elections on  February , and at the Congress held a month later the Federation's new leaders were elected. They took office on  March . A single list of candidates was submitted to the Congress, and obtained  votes from the  delegates present.
.As concerns the collective agreement to which the complainants refer, the Government explains that under Decree No. / a timetable was laid down for the renewal of collective agreements, that for the chemical industries being due for renewal in December . Since at that time the Federation was under government control, the Secretary of State for Labour designated the controller and two other persons to negotiate on its behalf, since otherwise the agreement in force would have been renewed without any possibility of securing better working conditions.
.The Committee observes that the procedure whereby the leaders of the Federation were elected did not reach its culmination until two years after the taking over of this organisation by the public authorities, with the result that when the time came for the renewal of the collective agreement (towards the end of this period), the workers' representatives had to be designated by the Secretariat of State for Labour, and included the controller himself-an official of the Secretariat. The Committee considers it necessary to emphasise in this respect the importance it attaches to the principle contained in Article  of Convention No. , which lays down that workers' and employers' organisations shall have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom, to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes, and that the public authorities shall refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof.
.As regards the elections held within the Federation, the Committee takes note of the Government's observation to the effect that no allegations of electoral fraud were made at the time. The Committee has pointed out on many occasions that, while in view of the nature of its responsibilities it cannot consider itself bound by any rule that national procedures of redress must be exhausted, such as applies, for instance, to international claims tribunals, it must have regard in examining the merits of a case, to the fact that a national remedy before an independent tribunal whose procedure offers appropriate guarantees has not been pursued.
.The Committee observes that in their account of the events in question the complainants refer to what appear to have been primary elections held in November  for the purpose of electing delegates to the Congress which was to have the actual task of electing the leaders of the Federation. The Government supplies certain details about this Congress, but apart from stating that there was no electoral committee, it makes no comment upon the remaining assertions of the complainants with regard to these primary elections, which concern alleged irregularities in regard to the displaying of a list of candidates and the custody of the ballot boxes.

255,".The Committee last examined this case at its st Session, held in Geneva on  May , when it submitted to the Governing Body an interim report contained in paragraphs  to  of its st Report. This report was adopted by the Governing Body at its th Session (Geneva, - June ).
.After the Committee's last examination of the case, only one series of allegations - those concerning the arrest and death of the trade unionist Olavo Hansen - remained outstanding.
.The allegations concerning Mr. Olavo Hansen had been made by the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions (CLASC) in a communication dated  June , by the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) in a communication dated  June  and by the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) in a communication dated  June . The Government had forwarded its observations in a communication dated  October .
.The complainants maintained that a Sao Paulo trade unionist, Mr. Olavo Hansen, had been arrested together with sixteen of his colleagues during the officially authorised May Day celebrations at the ""Maria Zlia"" sports ground in Sao Paulo. It was further alleged that Mr. Hansen had been subjected to lengthy interrogation by the political police (DEOPS) and so badly treated that when he got back to his cell he could no longer stand. For several days he was said to have been left lying on his bed, unable to get up, speak or even urinate. On  May his corpse was found near the Ipiranga Museum, covered with lesions and bruises resulting from the brutal torture inflicted on him. His death was officially registered on  May  but his family was informed only on  May  (the date on which his corpse was discovered).
.The Government forwarded its observations on the above allegations in its communication of  October . The Government's reply consisted essentially summary of the report to the examining magistrate on the official investigation carried out by the Public Prosecutor's office to determine the causes of Olavo Hansen's death. According to this document, Olavo Hansen and others were arrested on  May  at the ""Villa Maria Zlia"" sports stadium and a police inquiry was ordered into their attempted breach of the security of the State, which consisted in the distribution of subversive pamphlets. According to the Government, Hansen was a militant member of the Trotskyist wing who had already been brought to trial before a military court in  and maintained contact with individuals charged with crimes against national security, besides being an agent for the newspaper Frente Operaria (an organ of the Revolutionary Workers' Labour Party).
.The Government further stated that after Hansen had been handed over to the No.  Police Battalion and then to the ""Operaao Bandeirantes"" (OBAN), he was interrogated by the Department of Political and Social Order (DEOPS) on  May . Mr. Dias, who carried out the preliminary questioning, noted that at the time ""he showed no signs of any injury or ill treatment"".
.The Government added that on  May, Hansen said he did not feel well and asked for a doctor. He was examined by Dr. Ciscato (the physician at the policlinic of the DEOPS), who ordered him to be taken to the military hospital at So Paulo, where he was given a bed and suitable treatment. Hansen died at about  a.m. on the following morning ( May); the cause of death was established by the doctor on duty at the military hospital as kidney failure due to a chronic, and finally acute, condition. The post mortem report of the same date stated that internal examination of the body was negative from the anatomo-pathological and forensic standpoints. However, a toxicological examination of the stomach content, of the liver and of the blood sample was positive in revealing the presence of the insecticide ""Paration"".
.The Government further stated that up to the evening before his arrest, Mr. Hansen had been working at the ""Industria Agro-Pecuaria"", an undertaking which handles fertilizers and insecticides, some of the latter containing a product called ""Paration"". While it had not been established that he had any of this product on his person at the time of his arrest, the police thought it possible that he might have had some hidden in his clothing or about his person. The Government further advised that Dr. Ciscato, who had been called out on the night of  May to examine Hansen, had claimed that Hansen had told him that he had suffered from kidney trouble for many years and was undergoing treatment for it. Dr. Ciscato was of the opinion that Hansen's death was due to kidney failure.
.The Government stated in conclusion that the investigation into the cause of Mr. Hansen's death had revealed poisoning by the insecticide ""Paration"" as the most likely cause of death, since all the evidence showed that at the time of his arrest he either had a quantity of this poison on his person or else was suffering from chronic poisoning which led to kidney failure. The Government accordingly maintained that since he had been in this condition prior to his admission to the military hospital, and since he had received proper medical treatment at the hospital, his death was due to natural causes and could not therefore be attributed to any third parties.
.At its session in February , the Committee noted, from the Government's observations, that an inquiry had been held which had concluded that no third party could be held responsible for Hansen's death. It had felt bound to point out, however, that while the inquiry had concluded that Mr. Hansen had died on  May  as a result of ""Paration"" poisoning operating on a kidney condition, the Government had not presented any comments or observations with regard to the allegation that Hansen's bruised and battered corpse had been found outside the Ipiranga Museum on  May , the day on which his family was notified of his death. The Committee considered that it required further information from the Government in order to enable it to reach its conclusions on this aspect of the complaint.
.The Committee accordingly recommended the Governing Body: (i) to request the Government to supply detailed information concerning the procedure followed during the interrogation of Mr. Olavo Hansen; (ii) to request the Government to communicate its observations concerning the allegations according to which the body of Olavo Hansen was found, covered with lesions and bruises, near the Ipiranga Museum on  May , as well as the text of the judgement delivered and the grounds adduced therefor.
.In a communication dated  October , the Government confined itself to repeating that Mr. Hansen had died in the military general hospital of Sao Paulo, a fact which, in its opinion, removed any basis from the allegations referred to in the preceding paragraph.
.At its session in November  the Committee, in the hope of clarifying the matter, requested the complainants to furnish any further precise information and evidence at their disposal concerning this aspect of the case.
.At its May  Session, the Committee noted that it had received no new information with regard to this particular aspect of the case.
.In the circumstances, the Committee recommended the Governing Body: (a) to note once again, the serious nature of the allegations relating to the circumstances of Mr. Olavo Hansen's death; (b) to give the complainants a further opportunity of supplying the information mentioned in paragraph  above and to request the Government once again to supply the information specified in paragraph  above.
.Subsequently the WFTU, in a communication dated  June , states that it has been assured by Brazilian trade unionists of the truth of the information related in paragraph  above. The WFTU encloses extracts from Brazilian newspapers of the time referring to the violent death of Mr. Olavo Hansen at the hands of the political police.
.The WFTU states in its communication that the Member of Parliament and leader of the Brazilian Democratic Movement (MDB), Mr. Pedroso Horta, raised the question of Mr. Hansen's death in the Chamber of Deputies, demanding that the Government order an inquiry into Hansen's death in the Santo Andr prison and take steps to ensure that the torturers were punished. The deputy chief of the party in power (Alianza Renovadora), Mr. Cantidio Sampao, is said to have stated that an inquiry would be instituted and would result in those responsible being punished, ""for the Government did not approve of such acts"".
.The WFTU goes on to say that on the same day another Member of Parliament, Humberto Lucena, mounted the rostrum of the Chamber of Deputies to read a telegram sent by the Sao Paulo trade unions to the President of the Republic, ""informing him of Olavo Hansen's assassination by the political police in Santo Andr prison"". After hearing this denunciation, Mr. Cantidio Sampao is reported to have stated that it was surprising in the circumstances that the cause of Olavo Hansen's death was said to be ""unknown"", as",-1,1970,Brazil
256,".The complaint by the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions is contained in a communication dated  July . It was transmitted to the Government of Argentina, which sent its observations on  January .
.Argentina has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants allege that on  June  the workers of the automobile mechanics section represented by the Union of Automobile Mechanics and Allied Workers of the City of Crdoba initiated a dispute with the firm of IKA-Renault which had refused to discuss the collective agreement that had just expired. As a reprisal the firm dismissed  workers. In addition, with the acquiescence of the provincial government, the company's security guards forcibly entered the private homes of workers and arrested them. A total of  members of the union were detained.
.In its reply the Government states first of all that in Argentina a magistrate is alone entitled to authorise the police to enter premises and that private individuals are in no circumstances authorised to do this.
.Concerning the collective dispute to which the complaint refers, the Government presents the following observations. Under Act No.  concerning collective agreements, the IKA-Renault firm began negotiations with the union in question. When it was found impossible to reach an agreement, the members of the union raided and occupied various factory premises on  June , taking several executives of the firm as hostages. The persons presumed responsible for these incidents have been indicted for violation of individual freedom, usurpation and unlawful association. On  June several workers were dismissed on these grounds.
.On  June the Secretariat of State for Labour issued a resolution calling for an end to the strike and providing for compulsory conciliation to be initiated in accordance with Act No.  concerning conciliation and arbitration in collective disputes. These instructions were not heeded, nor were conciliation proceedings started, and the Secretariat for Labour then issued a new resolution similar to its previous one. When the dispute continued, a further resolution was issued on  July repeating the instructions to stop the strike, and the firms affected were called upon to suspend the dismissals and other action taken since  June, the parties being summoned to a conciliation meeting.
.The conciliation proceedings finally began on  July the parties declaring that they would abide by the instructions mentioned above. Negotiations continued until  August, on which date the IKA-Renault firm made proposals that included the reinstatement of  workers (which was in fact carried out, more than this number being reinstated), payment of dismissal allowances to persons not reinstated and payment to the trade union leaders in the same situation of the dismissal allowance plus  per cent. The trade union leaders refused this proposal and requested the referral of the dispute to compulsory arbitration as established under Act No. . The Secretariat of State for Labour did not accept this request on the grounds that the Act in question was not applicable in the circumstances. The Government states in conclusion that the dispute has in fact been settled, almost every worker involved having individually accepted the firm's proposals.
.The Committee observes that, under Act No.  concerning conciliation and arbitration in collective disputes, when the parties fail to reach an agreement compulsory conciliation is required through the intervention of the Labour Authority. Until the dispute is referred to conciliation and during the relevant proceedings the workers are not allowed to declare a strike. This possibility is open to them only if conciliation breaks down and it is not agreed to submit the dispute for arbitration.
.The Committee has always considered that allegations concerning the right to strike are not outside its competence in so far as they affect the exercise of trade union rights. The Committee has also on numerous occasions observed that the right of workers and their organisations to strike as a legitimate means of defending their occupational interests is generally recognised. Nevertheless, the Committee has indicated that the right to strike may be subject to temporary restrictions placed thereon such as suspension of strikes during conciliation and arbitration proceedings in which parties can take part at every stage.
.In the present case in the absence of agreement on the negotiations not only did the workers declare a strike without going through compulsory conciliation, but some of them also occupied work premises and took several executives of the undertaking as hostages. Subsequently the strike continued despite the initiation of conciliation proceedings ordered by the Labour Authority. This resulted in the indictment of a number of workers for the offences stated by the Government and the dismissal of workers. Finally, the dispute was concluded and the dismissed workers were reinstated or compensation was paid to those not reinstated in almost all cases.
.In view of these circumstances and in the light of the considerations stated above in paragraph , the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that this case calls for no further examination.",2,1970,Argentina
257,".The Committee examined this case in May  and February . The reports it submitted to the Governing Body at these sessions appear in paragraphs  to  of its st Report and in paragraphs  to  of its nd Report.
.Guatemala has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations still outstanding were made by the National Confederation of Workers of Guatemala in a communication dated  April. . They concern the arrest, following the proclamation of a state of emergency, of Mr. Miguel Vldez Girn, an active member of the Tailors' Union and former General Secretary of the Autonomous Trade Union Federation of Guatemala (FASGUA). According to the complainants, Mr. Vldez Girn had been arrested at his home in April , although the police denied the fact.
.The Committee recalls that the Government had made no comments on this matter despite several requests to do so. In November  the Committee, therefore, urgently appealed to the Government for information. No reply was forthcoming and the Committee, at its meeting in February , in accordance with the procedure in force, informed the Government that the Committee intended to report on the substance of the matter at its following meeting, even if the information requested had still not been received. No information having been supplied, the Committee submitted its conclusions on the case in its st Report.
.In adopting this report, the Governing Body drew the Government's attention, inter alia, to the possibility of appointing an independent board of inquiry as a particularly appropriate means of throwing light on what had happened and determining responsibilities. The Governing Body had also asked the Director-General to keep in touch with the Government with a view to securing information about the position of Mr. Vldez Girn.
.Accordingly, the Director-General, on a number of occasions, approached the Government for information, and the Committee continued to make urgent appeals to the same effect. In a communication dated  January  the Government stated that, according to the National Police Headquarters and the Ministry of the Interior, a search had been made for Mr. Vldez Girn in hospitals and prisons throughout the country, but without success. Nevertheless, further attempts were being made to ascertain his whereabouts.
.In these circumstances, the Committee had recommended the Governing Body in February  to express its concern at the disappearance of this trade union leader, to request the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of its inquiries, and to request the complainants to forward any information which they may have concerning the situation of Mr. Vldez Girn.
.This latest request was communicated to the National Confederation of Workers of Guatemala and repeated reminders were sent. The complainant, however, has not sent any information about the outcome of the trade unionist in question. Nor has the Government sent any further information. Since the allegations concerning this trade union leader date back to  April , the Committee recommends the Governing Body, once again, to express its concern at the disappearance of Mr. Vldez Girn and to request the Government to forward any information it may obtain concerning what has become of him.
.This case was considered by the Committee at its meeting in May , at which time it submitted a report to the Governing Body which appears in paragraphs  to  of its st Report, adopted by the Governing Body at its th Session (- June ).
.The complaints contained allegations about repression of the trade union movement in Guatemala, restrictions on the free exercise of trade union activities, the deaths of various trade unionists and the disappearance of Miguel Vldez Girn, an active member of the Tailors' Union and former General Secretary of the Autonomous Trade Union Federation of Guatemala (FASGUA). According to the National Confederation of Workers of Guatemala, Mr. Vldez Girn had been arrested at his home in April , although the police denied this.
.The Government made no comments on these complaints, despite several requests by the Committee, which, at its meeting in November , urgently appealed to the Government for information. No reply was forthcoming, and the Committee, at its meeting in February , in accordance with the procedure in force, informed the Government that the Committee was entitled to report on the substance of the matter at its following meeting, even if the information requested had still not been received. Finally, no information having been supplied, the Committee reported as described above.
.In adopting the report, the Governing Body called the Governments attention to certain principles of freedom of association connected with the points raised in the complaints. It deplored the fact that the Government had not commented on the serious allegations made, thus preventing the Committee from reaching its conclusions in full knowledge of the facts.
.As regards the disappearance of Vldez Girn in particular, the Governing Body expressed the view to the Government that the appointment of an independent board of inquiry would be a particularly appropriate means of throwing light on what had happened and determining responsibilities.
.The Governing Body asked the Director-General to keep in touch with the Government with a view to securing information about the position with regard to Mr. Miguel Vldez Girn.
.Accordingly, the Director-General repeatedly approached the Government for information, and the Committee continued to make urgent appeals in the same sense.
.The only information obtained from the Government appears in a communication dated  January , from the Permanent Representative of Guatemala in Geneva, stating that according to the National Police Headquarters and the Ministry of the interior, a search had been made for Mr. Vldez Girn in hospitals and prisons throughput the country, but without success. Nevertheless, further attempts were being made to ascertain his whereabouts.
.In the circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to express its concern at the disappearance of the trade unionist Miguel Vldez Girn, to request the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of its inquiries, and to request the complainants to forward any information which they may have concerning what has become of this person.
.The complaints are contained in communications addressed direct to the ILO by the National Confederation of Workers of Guatemala, dated  April , and the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions, dated  April  and  February , and in a communication dated  February  addressed direct to the ILO by the World Confederation of Labour. The World Confederation of Labour submitted additional information in a further communication dated  May .
.The complaints and additional information were communicated to the Government on  April ,  May , and  February and  May . The Government, however, did not submit any observations thereon despite the repeated requests addressed to it. Accordingly, at its session in November , the Committee made an urgent appeal to the Government to supply the information which it had sought from it. No reply having been received to this request, the Committee, at its session in February , in accordance with the rule of procedure contained in paragraph  of its th Report, informed the Government that it might submit a report on the substance of the case at its present session even if the information awaited from the Government had still not been received. To date, this information has not been received.
.Guatemala has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  April  the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions alleges that trade union rights are being violated as a result of a Decree (No. /) which, according to the complainant organisation, prohibits the operation of trade unions.
.In its communication dated  April , the National Confederation of Workers also refers to the suspension of trade union activities by Decree No. /. This organisation adds that after the state of emergency was proclaimed a number of people were apprehended, including the former Secretary-General of the Autonomous Trade Union Federation of Guatemala (FASGUA), Miguel Vldez Girn, at present a militant member of the Union of Tailors, who was taken violently from his home in the early hours of the morning. To date, the police deny having taken Mr. Vldez Girn and detained him.
.In its further communication dated  February , the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions adds that, following the state of siege proclaimed by the Government of Colonel Carlos Arana Osorio, approximately  persons, including trade unionists, were murdered as a result of their political, trade union or student activities. For example, continue the complainants, the leader of the Christian Democratic opposition, Adolfo Mijangos, and the leader of the peasants' trade union, Tereso de Jess Oliva, were recently gunned down in the centre of Guatemala City. Other trade union leaders were also being persecuted and an attempt was being made to eliminate all the organisations",-1,1970,Guatemala
258,".The complaint of the Iron and Steel Workers' Union of Colombia is contained in a communication dated  September  and sent direct to the ILO. This complaint was transmitted to the Government, which sent its reply in two communications dated  November  and  January .
.Colombia has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants refer in their complaint to a judgement rendered on  June  by the Supreme Court of Justice authorising the employers to submit proposals to the workers with a view to doing away with the social benefits that the workers had secured by means of collective labour agreements. The complainants consider that these proceedings were in breach of the ILO Conventions.
.In its reply, the Government states that the Supreme Court pronounced judgement with respect to a plea of unconstitutionality based on a certain provision (words in italics) contained in section , clause , of Act No.  of , which states: "" At any time before a strike is called, or while a strike is in progress, the trade union or unions to which over half of the workers belong, or, failing that, the workers at a general assembly, may request that the points at difference in respect of which no agreement has been reached between the parties in the stages of direct settlement and conciliation, contained in the workers' claims as the draft of a collective agreement or collective employment contract, should be submitted for judgement to a compulsory arbitration tribunal established in the manner described below."" The Supreme Court by a majority of its members ruled that the provision in question is contrary to the Constitution of the country. The Government draws attention to the separation of powers in Colombia, and sends the text of the judgement and of the dissenting opinions.
.In the light of this information, the Committee observes that the problem raised may be summed up as follows. In accordance with section  of the Labour Code a collective agreement of indefinite duration may be denounced by either side or both, but shall remain in force until a new agreement has been signed. According to the majority opinion of the Supreme Court, this implies that, in order to terminate an agreement in whole or in part, there is no other method than to conclude a new agreement. The judgement also states that, to give juridical effect to the denunciation of an agreement in the event of failure to reach a settlement during the stages of direct negotiation and conciliation, the position taken up by each of the parties during these stages should form the basis for the arbitral award. If, although an agreement has been denounced by the employers, the arbitrators may take into account for the settlement of the dispute only "" the workers' claims as the draft of a collective agreement or collective employment contract "", this is equivalent to denying the juridical effect of the denunciation. The judgement states that, if the employers' denunciation of an agreement lacks this juridical validity, this is a violation of article  of the Constitution, which provides that there shall not be in Colombia any irredeemable obligations, that is: obligations from which the obligor may in no way free himself.
.The Committee observes that the claimant in the case judged by the Supreme Court had alleged that the words referred to in Act No.  "" eliminate the employers' right to participate in collective bargaining, and to obtain a modification in the employers' favour of the economic conditions laid down in a previous collective agreement "". But the Iron and Steel Workers' Union seems to interpret the judgement rendered by the Supreme Court as legalising the presentation of proposals by the employers with a view to doing away with certain social benefits contained in previous collective agreements.
.The Committee is not called upon to examine whether various legal provisions and the interpretation placed upon them by judicial or administrative authorities are Constitutional or not, but only to examine whether the national legislation and the interpretation placed upon it by competent authorities are compatible with the international principles concerning freedom of association and trade union rights.
.The Committee considers that the fact that a court of arbitration must take into account, in rendering judgement, not only the claims of the workers but also the arguments and counter-proposals of the employers constitutes a normal situation which in no way affects the above-mentioned principles. On the other hand, the right to strike, which the Committee has always considered one of the essential means available to workers and their organisations of promoting and defending their occupational interests, would be affected if a legal provision were to allow employers to submit in every case for compulsory arbitral decision a dispute resulting from failure to reach agreement during collective negotiation and so prevent recourse to strike. In fact, while the Committee has accepted a temporary restriction of strikes during the procedures of conciliation and arbitration, or the prohibition of strikes in the civil service or in essential services (provided always that this is accompanied by procedures of conciliation and arbitration to protect the interests of the workers), it has pointed out that if a legislation imposes directly or indirectly the absolute prohibition of strikes, this prohibition can constitute an important restriction of the potential activities of trade unions, which would not be in conformity with the generally recognised principles of freedom of association.
.As for the possibility that the employers might have under the legislation of presenting proposals for the purposes of collective bargaining, the Committee considers that, if these proposals are merely to serve as a basis for the voluntary negotiation to which Convention No.  refers, they could not be considered a violation of the principles applicable to this matter.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to draw attention to the considerations and principles set out in paragraphs  to  above and to decide that the case does not call for further examination.",-1,1970,Colombia

.A number of allegations relating to searches and closing of trade union premises remained outstanding, with respect to which the Government has now forwarded its observations by a communication dated  September .
.In addition, on  and  January , the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) made further allegations concerning the infringement of trade union rights in connection with the Government's intention to make trade union membership compulsory and create a single union. These allegations, which constitute Case No. , will also be dealt with by the Committee in the present report, together with the Government's observations thereon, contained in its communication of  September .
.Panama has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.With regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the allegations relating to searches and closing of trade union premises, to take note of the fact that it would appear from the information supplied by the Government that all effects of the measures denounced in the allegations have now ceased, and to decide, subject to the reservations expressed in paragraph , that no useful purpose would be served by pursuing examination of this aspect of the case;(b) with regard to the allegations relating to the intention of the Government to make trade union membership compulsory and to create a single union, to decide, while reaffirming the principles set forth in paragraph , that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.",-1,1970,Panama
260,".This complaint, presented by the Federation of Electrical Workers of Venezuela, appears in a communication sent direct to the ILO and dated  April . The complaint was duly referred to the Government of Venezuela for its comments, which were received in a communication dated  August .
.Venezuela has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but it has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants allege (in rather general terms, incidentally) that persons employed by the C.A. de Administracin y de Fomento Elctrico (CADAFE)- a state Organisation have been the object of various harassments, attributable very largely to the differences of political ideology which exist between workers and management. In particular, so the complainants allege, there has been some encroachment on the workers' right democratically to elect their representatives, and some workers have, it is claimed, been dismissed.
.The Government's answer consists of copies of two communications; one from the complainant organisation and the other from CADAFE, addressed to the Minister of Labour.
.The communication from CADAFE states that an agreement has been reached between the complainant organisation and the company that "" any problems which might at one time have existed have now been settled "", and that "" the situation has now returned to normal "".
.The communication from the complainant organisation to the Minister of Labour reads as follows: "" The complaint which we presented to the International Labour Organisation had its origins in the serious disputes which occurred within the administration of the Hydro-electric Works Department of the Rio Santo Domingo Hydroelectric System. We now have the pleasure to inform you that, as a result of the inestimable assistance rendered by the labour authorities, a solution to the problem has been found which satisfied both parties.""
.In these circumstances, the Committee feels that there is no point in pursuing this matter further, and hence recommends the Governing Body to decide that the case calls for no further consideration.",1,1970,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
261,".The complaint by the International Federation of Employees in Public Service is contained in a communication dated  October  sent direct to the ILO.
.This communication was transmitted to the Government, which replied by means of two communications dated  December  and  January  respectively.
.Colombia has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complaint stated that the Minister of Labour had ordered the dismissal from the Ministry of Labour of Mr. Silvio Vela Valencia, General Secretary of the National Federation of Workers in Government Service (FENALTRASE) and President of the Ministry of Labour Staff Union. This act was described by the complainants as being designed to impede any form of intense trade union activity and as a reprisal against statements made by the trade union organisations in which Mr. Vela Valencia held office.
.In its communication of  December  the Government stated that it had attempted to take Mr. Vela Valencia back into the service of the Ministry, having offered him the post of Chief of Section in the Departmental Labour and Social Security Division at Medellin or Cali, but that he had rejected these proposals by a letter of  November . With its communication of  January  the Government supplied a copy of a letter from Mr. Vela Valencia. In it he stated that he could not accept the posts offered in view of his function as General Secretary of FENALTRASE, with headquarters in Bogot, which precluded his performing the relevant duties in another town. He added that the Executive Committee of the Federation had confirmed this position and had requested the right to the free exercise of trade union activities in a conversation with the President of the Republic. He stated that any change in his place of appointment would be harmful to freedom of association by preventing him from performing his functions as General Secretary of FENALTRASE.
.At its session in February  the Committee considered that both the dismissal of Mr. Vela Valencia and the offer of appointment to a different town from that in which he performed his trade union functions constituted acts which, unless fully justified, were liable to cause serious infringement of the principle that workers' organisations should enjoy the right freely to choose their representatives and to organise their administration and activities. The Committee accordingly, with a view to obtaining the elements it required in order to formulate conclusions, requested precise information from the Government concerning the motives which led to the dismissal of Mr. Vela Valencia and the subsequent offer to reinstate him in the Ministry, but elsewhere than in Bogot, where he performed his duties as General Secretary of FENALTRASE.
.In a further communication dated  April  the Government stated that, by Resolution No.  dated  February , Mr. Vela Valencia had been appointed lawyer in the Department of Labour Inspection of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security in the city of Bogot.
.In the circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) in drawing the attention of the Government to the principle expressed in paragraph  above, to note that Mr. Vela Valencia has been reinstated in a Government post in Bogot; and(b) to decide that the allegation, and accordingly the case as a whole do not call for further examination.",1,1970,Colombia
