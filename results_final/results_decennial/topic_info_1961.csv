These allegations, which constitute Case No. , will also be dealt with by the Committee in the present report, together with the Government's observations thereon, contained in its communication of  September .\n.Panama has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.With regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the allegations relating to searches and closing of trade union premises, to take note of the fact that it would appear from the information supplied by the Government that all effects of the measures denounced in the allegations have now ceased, and to decide, subject to the reservations expressed in paragraph , that no useful purpose would be served by pursuing examination of this aspect of the case;(b) with regard to the allegations relating to the intention of the Government to make trade union membership compulsory and to create a single union, to decide, while reaffirming the principles set forth in paragraph , that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.\n.The original complaints and the additional information supplied in these five cases are dealt with together because they involve the same type of allegation. The complaints are contained in the following communications: two from the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), dated  and  January , one from the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions (CLASC), dated  January , one from the International Federation of Secondary Teachers (FIPESO), dated  February , one from the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of the Workers of Latin America dated  March , one from the Trade Unions International of Workers of the Building, Wood and Building Materials Industry, dated  June  and one from the National Federation of Christian Peasants dated  September .\n.As these communications were received they were transmitted to the Government for its observations. These were presented in two communications dated  and  January .\n.Panama has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.In its communication dated  January  the WCL alleged that the following leaders of the Isthmian Federation of Christian Workers and the Peasant Federation were detained in prison: Jorge Emilio Chapote, Pedro Flix Montaez, Teodoro Martinez, Maximino Rodriguez, Domingo Castrelln, Pedro Snchez, Apolinario Snchez, Juan Senz, Rufino Snchez, Carlos Solis, Andrs Snchez, Victor Soto and Raimundo Snchez. In its communication dated  January  the WCL added that the Government was intercepting correspondence, censoring all communications and searching the trade union headquarters of the two organisations mentioned above. For its part, the CLASC confirmed the detention of some of the persons mentioned and added to the list the names of Jos Fiel Senz and Domingo Snchez. The CLASC stated that the Military Junta in power since October  had the headquarters of the Isthmian Federation of Christian Workers and the National Christian Peasant Federation searched and that applications for writs of habeas corpus made on behalf of the prisoners were rejected, some of the prisoners being given the alternative of being deported or remaining in prison.\n.The International Federation of Secondary Teachers alleged in its communication of  February  that Mr. Clarence Beecher, Secretary for International Affairs of the Panama Teachers' Association, had been imprisoned, together with other teachers, since  December . The FIPESO added that teachers' public meetings and the publication of their professional journal had been banned.\n.The Permanent Congress on Trade Union Unity of the Workers of Latin America stated in its communication dated  March  that since taking power the Military Junta had created a permanent state of repression directed against the trade union movement, behind the shield of the suspension of Constitutional guarantees. The complainants went on to say that the Federation of Workers' Unions of Panama had been the subject of a search by the National Guard, as well as other trade union premises, including those of the tailors', building workers' and bus drivers' unions, etc. On the occasion of these searches, members of the National Guard destroyed and seized trade union property and kept the trade union premises closed, thus obstructing all union activity. The complainants further alleged that the trade union leaders Angel Gmez, Jos del Carmen Tun, Florencio de Gracia, Sixto Valarezo, Ramn Diaz, Efigenio Arauz and Pedro Gonzlez, had already been in prison for more than three months.\n.The Trade Unions International of Workers of the Building, Wood and Building Materials Industries alleged in its communication of  June  that the Military Government had closed down the headquarters of the Trade Union Federation of the Workers of Panama and a number of affiliated organisations, including the premises of the Federation of Building Workers. The complainants added that several trade union leaders were being kept in prison and referred to the names of some of the persons mentioned in the preceding paragraph, in particular Mr. Angel Gmez, who was said to be critically ill with pneumonia and had been taken as a matter of urgency to a hospital but had since been taken back to prison.\n.Lastly, the National Federation of Christian Peasants of Panama stated in its complaint dated  September  that on  October  individual guarantees had been suspended by the Government with the result that rural and urban trade union leaders were being persecuted and imprisoned. The persons arrested were: Natividad Martinez, arrested on  September  in the district of Palmar in Cocl province, charged with possessing arms, after his house had been searched by the army; Bernab Reyes, Secretary General of the El Palmar Agrarian League, arrested on  September, the reason for his arrest not having been made known; Leonardo Montero, Secretary General of the Cao El Rey Agrarian League, accused by the judge and the mayor of the district of Donoso, Coln Province, as an act of reprisal. The complaining organisation added that pressure had been brought to bear on the peasants' organisations to give up any trade union activity not controlled by the Government and that every day more trade union leaders were being arrested.\n.In its communications dated  and  January  the Government stated that after careful examination of the various complaints presented, it had reached the conclusion that the allegations were unfounded and that the trade union organisations of the country had without interruption been functioning in accordance with the provisions of the law in force. The labour authorities had always been motivated by concern that the trade union movement should be vigorous and managed by the workers themselves. For its part, the Government had on no occasion arrested any citizen on account of his being a trade union leader, but only for participation in political activities entirely unrelated to trade union matters. The persons arrested on various occasions after  October  had been set at liberty, and the complaint relating to the present detention of trade union leaders was therefore inadmissible. The allegations relating to the persecution and imprisonment of leaders and pressure that had been exercised against the peasant organisations were also rejected, since the Government had placed at the disposal of the inhabitants of the interior of the country adequate facilities for them to organise and carry on proper trade union activities.\n.The Committee observes that the various complaints allege the detention of trade union leaders since the Military Government came into power and suspended Constitutional guarantees in October . Some of the allegations also refer to searches of the premises of various trade union organisations, in particular the Isthmian Federation of Christian Workers, the National Christian Peasants' Federation, the National Trade Union Federation of the Workers of Panama and the Building Workers' Federation, and in certain cases the closing of the premises affected. The complaints also refer to the persecution of trade union leaders and pressure exercised against the peasants' organisations. The Government, for its part, denies, in a general way, any persecution directed against trade unionists and states that no person has been arrested on account of his being a trade unionist, but only for participation in political activities.

Checa and Aroca, have been released at some time after the date on which the complaint was lodged, in view of the importance it has always attached, in all cases where trade unionists are detained for political offences or common law crimes, to the principle that the persons concerned should be tried with all the safeguards of regular judicial procedure, at the earliest possible moment and by an impartial and independent judicial authority, the Committee, in accordance with the practice it has followed hitherto in similar cases, recommends the Governing Body to draw the Government\'s attention to the dangers that measures for the detention of trade unionists might entail for freedom of association if such measures are not accompanied by proper judicial safeguards, and to the fact that every government should make it a rule to ensure respect for human rights and, in particular, the right of every detained person to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment by an impartial and independent judicial authority.""\n.With respect to the other three trade unionists, Messrs. Espinosa, Cajas and Reinoso, whose arrest has also been alleged by the complainants, the Government has not submitted any information up to the present.\n.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note that the trade unionists Pedro Moreno Rocha, Carlos Idovro Vergara, Mesias Zamora Prez, Francisco Checa and Carlos Aroca have been released;(b) to draw the Government\'s attention, however, to:(i) the importance the Committee has always attached to the opinion of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to the effect that trade unions should not be prohibited in general terms from engaging in any political activities, and that the judicial authorities should be entrusted with the task of repressing abuses which might be committed by organisations which had lost sight of the fact that their fundamental objective should be "" the economic and social advancement "" of their members;(ii) the dangers that measures for the detention of trade unionists might entail for freedom of association if such measures are not accompanied by proper judicial safeguards, and the fact that every government should make it a rule to ensure respect for human rights and, in particular, the right of every detained person to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment by an impartial and independent judicial authority;(c) to request the Government once again to forward, as a matter of urgency, its precise observations concerning the alleged detention of Messrs. Hugo Espinosa, Luis Cajas and Teodoro Reinoso, indicating further the present situation of these persons before the law;(d) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will report further when it has received the additional information from the Government, as indicated in subparagraph (c) above.\n.This case was examined by the Committee at its sessions in February and May  when it made interim reports. In the rd Report, approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session (May ), the Committee made definitive recommendations on allegations relating to the intervention of the authorities in a conflict which had arisen on the Huayllamba estate. In the present report the Committee examines the remaining allegations, which relate to the detention of a number of trade union officers and to the infringement of trade union rights by the authorities in the province of Chimborazo.\n.The original complaint was submitted by the Latin American Confederation of Christian Trade Unionists (C.L.A.S.C.) on  November . It was then forwarded to the Government, which sent in its observations on  January . The complainants submitted another complaint in a letter dated  December , which was also forwarded to the Government.\n.Ecuador has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with respect to the allegations regarding infringement of trade union rights in the province of Chimborazo, to take note of the statements made by the Government in its letter of  August and to decide, with the reservation expressed in paragraph  above, that there is no object in continuing to examine this aspect of the case;(b) with respect to the allegations regarding the arrest of the trade union leaders Francisco Checa, Carlos Aroca, Pedro Moreno Rocha, Carlos Idovro Vergara, Mesas Zamora Prez, Hugo Espinosa, Luis Cajas and Teodoro Reinoso, to take note of the statements made by the Government in the same letter and to ask the Government to send as soon as possible more complete information on this aspect of the case, including an account of the offences with which each of the trade unionists whose names are cited has been charged, and the result of the proceedings, and the text of any judgments given with their grounds;(c) to take note of this interim report on the understanding that the Committee will submit a further report as soon as it has received the additional information for which the Government is to be asked.\n.This case was examined by the Committee at its session in February , when it made an interim report which appears in paragraphs  to  of its st Report, approved by the Governing Body at its st Session (March ).\n.Ecuador has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.In examining this case the Committee noted that the Latin-American Confederation of Christian Trade Unionists (C.L.A.S.C.) had submitted its first complaint on  November . It was then forwarded to the Government, which sent in its observations on  January . The complainants had submitted another complaint in a letter dated  December , but the Government had not made any observations on it.\n.In its communication dated  November  C.L.A.S.C declared that the Ecuadorian Federation of Catholic Workers (C.E.D.O.C.) was being systematically subjected to discrimination and prosecution which constituted an infringement of freedom of association. In September  trade union leaders Francisco Checa and Carlos Aroca were incarcerated in Machachi on being apprehended attending a meeting of peasants convened to found a peasants\' league for that locality. At approximately the same time in Naranjito, trade unionists Pedro Moreno Rocha, Carlos Idovro Vergara and Mesias Zamora Prez were incarcerated for distributing leaflets to peasants with the aim of convening a meeting to found another peasants\' league. At a later date, in the province of Chimborazo, the civil and military chief of the area imprisoned a number of peasant leaders for forming a trade union on the Huayllamba estate and campaigning for their rights; he also threatened the C.E.D.O.C leaders in the province, sending a telegram to C.E.D.O.C reading as follows: "" Owner Huayllamba estate settled problems fairly. Demagogic party campaign you are conducting cannot be tolerated in any circumstances. Extremist agitators in your service will be treated as they deserve."" The complainants concluded their communication by declaring that the Ministry of Labour was pursuing a policy which was especially discriminatory against C.E.D.O.C and that in some areas the authorities prohibited trade union meetings and had also abolished the right to strike.\n.In its reply dated  January  the Government declared that C.E.D.O.C had never been subjected to any discrimination whatsoever, nor had its leaders been persecuted. The organisation concerned enjoyed the same safeguards for pursuing its trade union activity as other workers\' associations formed in compliance with the law and recognised by the Government. Furthermore, the Government rejected the allegation that a military chief used force to defend the estate owners. The Huayllamba estate case was finally settled by the intervention of an official sent by the Director-General of Labour, and an agreement between employer and agricultural workers was signed. Unfortunately the trade union backed by C.E.D.O.C, deviating from its specific objectives, engaged in incitement to violence and thus brought about the subsequent intervention of the police authorities after the labour aspect of the problem had been solved.\n.The Committee observed that the Government in its reply made no reference to the specific allegations contained in the complaint regarding the imprisonment of Messrs. Francisco Checa, Carlos Aroca, Pedro Moreno Rocha, Carlos Idovro Vergara and Mesias Zamora Prez.', 'of the courts"".\n.The Committee wishes to recall the importance it has always attached in all cases, including those where trade unionists are accused of political or common law offences that the Government considers to be unconnected with their trade union duties, to the principle that the persons concerned should receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment by an impartial and independent judicial authority. Where the information received by the Committee has made it clear that the persons concerned were tried by the competent judicial authorities with all the safeguards of normal judicial procedure, and sentenced for offences unconnected with their trade union activities or outside the scope of normal trade union activities, the Committee has considered that the cases in question did not call for further examination. Nevertheless, the Committee has insisted that the question as to whether the matter in respect of which sentences have been imposed is to be regarded as a matter relating to a criminal offence or as a matter relating to the exercise of trade union rights is not one which can be determined unilaterally by the government concerned, but that it is incumbent upon the Committee to decide this in the light of all the information, and in particular in the light of the text of the judgment.\n.With regard to the trial and sentence of Mr. Esguerra, the Committee has examined carefully the comments and information furnished by the Government, especially the text of the judgment. The Committee is of the opinion that the acts said to have been committed by Mr. Esguerra which led to his being found guilty of the offence of fraud are clearly quite outside the scope of any trade union activity.\n.The situation is not the same in the case of the acts on account of which he was found guilty of attempted homicide. These involved the intervention of Mr. Esguerra in an act of protest by workers and trade union officials in support of labour claims. The action he took consisted, first, in inducing these workers to stage a hunger strike, in which they were quite willing to participate. Later Mr. Esguerra is said to have tried to prevent the participants in the strike from abandoning it or from being given food and assistance, thus endangering their lives. As a result, according to the judgment, it was necessary for the forces of public order to intervene in order that the strikers might be taken to hospital. Nevertheless, the Committee also observes that the Government earlier supplied information (communication of  January ) to the effect that "" seven persons took part in a hunger strike at the doors of the United Nations office but lack of food was endangering their health and this induced them to give up the strike and seek medical treatment "". Of these seven persons, "" six were taken at their own request by staff of the Social Welfare Directorate to the general hospital in Mexico City. The remaining person preferred to go to a private clinic. ""\n.Since an appeal has been lodged with the High Court of Justice against the judgment whereby sentence was pronounced, concerning which the Government has not yet supplied the promised information, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to adjourn examination of the case and request the Government to be good enough to forward the text of the judgment pronounced by the court in question together with the grounds adduced therefor.\n.The last report to the Governing Body in respect of this case, which was examined by the Committee at its session in February , is contained in paragraphs  to  of its rd Report.\n.That report, which the Governing Body approved at its st Session (February-March ), contained the Committee\'s definitive conclusions with regard to some of the allegations made in this case, namely those relating to the imprisonment of a number of trade unionists and to interference by the undertaking "" Petrleos Mexicanos "" in the affairs of the Union of Temporary Workers of Petrleos Mexicanos (STTPM).\n.In the report in question the Committee also requested the Government to furnish its observations on other allegations made by the IFCTU in a communication dated  January . In reply to that request the Government made certain comments in a communication transmitted to the ILO on  September  by the Permanent Delegation of Mexico in Geneva, and brought to the Committee\'s attention at its session in November .\n.In its communication of  January  the IFCTU requested the ILO to approach the Mexican Government as a matter of urgency with a view to securing the release of a trade unionist who had been arrested and imprisoned "" for his trade union activities "". The person in question was said to be Mr. Rubn Carlos Esguerra, a leader of the STTPM, who, with some of his colleagues, had been sent to the Lecumberri prison.\n.In its observations the Government declared that "" since the so-called Union of Temporary Workers of Petrleos Mexicanos appears to have submitted no new information or facts concerning the complaint in question which could substantially change the previous situation, the Government considers that there is no need for presenting new observations and hopes that the interim decision referred to previously will be made definitive "".\n.After examining the case at its session in November  the Committee expressed its regret that the Government\'s reply made no reference at all to the specific allegation in the IFCTU\'s communication of  January  concerning in particular the imprisonment of Mr. Esguerra, and requested the Government to be good enough to forward its observations on this aspect of the case.\n.This request having been transmitted to the Government by a letter dated  November , the Government replied by a communication dated  January .\n.In its reply the Government states that since accusations had been made against Mr. Esguerra and others of offences defined in and punishable under the Penal Code, the Public Prosecutor undertook an investigation of the alleged facts and found that there were grounds for the institution of the appropriate criminal proceedings.\n.The Government continues by indicating that in these circumstances Mr. Esguerra and those accused with him were prosecuted within three days of their arrest-the time limit during which, under the Constitution, a person may be detained without being charged. Mr. Esguerra was formally charged with attempted murder and fraud; the other persons involved in this affair were charged with either fraud or threats, or both.\n.The Government then states that in view of the separation of powers the Executive Power can do nothing to have the accused persons sentenced or acquitted by the judiciary. Nevertheless, the Government says that it is in a position to state that the trial in question is taking place under conditions which afford all the guarantees of normal judicial procedure, as laid down in article  of the Federal Political Constitution.\n.In conclusion the Government indicates that the trial is expected to end shortly and states that it will communicate to the ILO the text of the judgment as soon as it is handed down.\n.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to take note of the Government\'s statement to the effect that the text of the judgment pronounced in the case in question will be communicated to the ILO; in accordance with its constant practice, the Committee further recommends the Governing Body to request the Government to communicate at the same time the text of the grounds adduced for the judgment in question; lastly, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to adjourn examination of the case pending receipt of the information referred to above.\n.This case was already examined by the Committee at its session in February . On that occasion the Committee submitted to the Governing Body the conclusions contained in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, which was approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (June ).\n.In this report the Committee presented its final conclusions on two aspects of the case with regard to the application of closed shop or union security clauses in the petroleum industry and the supposedly biased attitude of a government official.\n.In two communications dated  and  January  from the Permanent Delegate of Mexico to the international organisations in Geneva, the Government furnished its observations on the remaining aspects of the case and on new allegations made by the Union of Temporary Workers of Petrleos Mexicanos (S.T.T.P.M.).\n.In a communication dated  January  the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions submitted a complaint with regard to the case, the text of which was sent to the Government in a letter dated  February .\n.Mexico has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but has not ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.In these circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to decide, for the reasons given in paragraph ', 'system is applied more and more infrequently, due to the undisguised opposition of employers and Government, who are supported by those trade union organisations which have gone over to the side of the Government.\n.The Government replies to these allegations, which are couched in extremely general terms and unsubstantiated by specific examples, by explaining that the small number of strikes recorded is due to the efficiency of the conciliation procedure. The Government points out that one of the most important strikes to occur in the country was organised by C.U.T.V itself in , at which time the Ministry of Labour was only too anxious to lend its good offices for conciliation purposes, and the Government took no action which would interfere with the rights of the workers. As for collective bargaining, the Government states that during the past eight years , collective agreements have been signed, including  in  and  in , all of which is claimed to prove the falsity of the allegations that there has been a reduction in the number of collective agreements signed in the country.\n.Considering that the complainants have not supplied specific information in substantiation of their claims with respect to alleged restriction of the right to strike and to bargain collectively, which are couched in extremely general terms and which are denied by the Government, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.Allegations relating to the Infringement of Trade Union Privilege\n.The complainants claim that there has been infringement of the privileges conferred on members of the committees of federations, trade unions and works committees by the labour legislation and by collective agreements to protect them from arbitrary and unjust dismissal. They add that in countless cases not only have employers dismissed trade union leaders who should be protected by these privileges but the labour authorities themselves have condoned this practice in their subsequent rulings, which are nearly always in favour of the employers.\n.In its observations the Government does not refer specifically to this aspect of the case. Consequently, before proceeding with its examination thereof, the Committee considers that the Government should be requested to be good enough to forward its observations with respect to this point.Allegations relating to the Detention of Trade Union Leaders\n.The complainants allege that the unlawful detention of trade union leaders, militant workers and peasants is a common daily occurrence, which clearly shows the nature of the Government\'s policy of repression against the country\'s democratic and independent trade union movement. The aims of this policy are to sow terror among the workers, undermine their capacity for resistance and weaken the organisations they have formed for their economic defence. At present there are more than , political prisoners in various prisons throughout the country, the great majority being manual workers, salaried employees, students and peasants. Among the numerous national and regional leaders of C.U.T.V alleged by the complainants to be held in prison mention is made of Eloy Torres, Luis Felipe Ojeda, Julio Cabello, Eleazar Diaz Rangel, Efrain Blanco, Samuel Guidn, Aura Gamboa, Gustavo Villaparedes, Leoncio Granda, Humberto Arrieti and Justo Rafael Galindez. Eloy Torres is said by the complainants to be a former official of the Venezuelan Confederation of Workers and one of the founders of C.U.T.V, as well as being a member of the General Council of the World Federation of Trade Unions. He is alleged to have been summarily tried before a military court and sentenced to more than eight years\' penal servitude in May . He is now serving a sentence of rigorous imprisonment on the island of Tacarigua.\n.Repressive measures are said to have also been taken against other national and regional leaders of C.U.T.V, such as Horacio Scott Power, President of C.U.T.V, detained without trial for two months in ; Carlos Arturo Pardo, a member of the executive of C.U.T.V, arrested upon his return from the VIth Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions in Warsaw and taken to the concentration camp of Cachipo, where he was subjected to physical ill-treatment; and Jos Marcano, a member of the national secretariat of C.U.T.V and President of the National Federation of Salaried Employees of Venezuela, detained without trial on ten separate occasions. Others detained include Messrs. Mximo Gutirrez, Johnny Bid, Carlos Farias, Marco Aurelio Alegria, Manuel Luckert, Jess Mrquez, Fidias Marcano, Hctor Landez, Julio Casique, Eli Sal Puchi, Nicols Colorado, Vladimir Acosta and Luis Marcano.\n.Another national C.U.T.V leader, Mr. Juan Pablo Crespo, is alleged to have been arrested by the police as he was about to leave for abroad to undergo medical treatment. Some time later he was released, and he subsequently died in Moscow. The complaint also mentions the case of Mr. Luis Emiro Arrieta, another C.U.T.V leader who died in prison in Caracas after two years\' detention. In addition, a press cutting is appended to the complaint referring to the disappearance since  September  of Donato Carmona Natera, "" trade union leader in the building sector and militant revolutionary "": the General Directorate of Police announced first of all that he was in solitary confinement, later that he had been released and finally that "" the files would be carefully gone over "".\n.Mention is also made in the complaint of numerous other persons alleged to have been detained, but on the complainants\' own admission these are political leaders, students or ordinary citizens whose connection with the trade union movement is not established in the complaint.\n.According to the Government, this part of the complaint deals with questions unconnected with labour. The Government adds that none of the persons named by the complainants has been detained for carrying on lawful activities, whether connected with trade unionism or not. Most of the persons referred to have never been trade union officials. They have, however, been charged, tried and sentenced for proved offences under civil and military law in proceedings before judges on whom the Government has exerted no influence. The Government carries out to the letter the duties imposed on it by the Constitution and by the law of the land. It has dealt vigorously, but without overstepping the bounds of the law, with persons outside the trade unions who, acting not as trade unionists but as active agents of subversion, have endeavoured to undermine the Constitution and the law.\n.The Committee recalls that on many occasions in the past, where allegations that trade union leaders or workers had been arrested or detained for trade union activities have been met by governments with statements that the arrests or detentions were made for subversive activities, for reasons of internal security or for common-law crimes, it has followed the rule that the governments concerned should be requested to submit further and as precise information as possible concerning the arrests or detentions and the exact reasons therefor. The Committee also recalls that if, in certain cases, it has concluded that allegations relating to the arrest or detention of trade union militants did not call for further examination, this has been after it has received information showing sufficiently precisely and with sufficient detail that the arrests or detentions were in no way occasioned by trade union activities but solely by activities outside the trade union sphere, which were either prejudicial to public order or of a political nature. Finally, the Committee recalls that in matters which were the subject of judicial proceedings, where the Committee considered that such proceedings might make available information of assistance to the Committee in appreciating whether or not allegations were well founded, it has always followed the practice of requesting the governments concerned to supply the texts of the judgments given and the grounds adduced therein.\n.In consequence, before proceeding further with its examination of this aspect of the case, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to request the Government to be good enough to furnish as quickly as possible detailed observations with respect to the alleged detention of the persons whose names are given in paragraphs ,  and  above, together with the exact reasons therefor; to state whether each of these persons has been brought to trial on the charges which have been laid against him, and to communicate the results of any legal proceedings which have been initiated in this connection.\n.In these circumstances, with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the allegations relating to the right to strike and to bargain collectively, to decide, for the reasons set forth in paragraph  above, that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination;(b) with regard to the allegations relating to acts of repression and discrimination against certain trade union organisations and the allegations relating to the infringement of trade union privilege, to note that the Committee considers it necessary to request the Government to be good enough to furnish its observations on each of the matters referred to in paragraphs  and  above;(c) with regard to the allegations relating']"
2,1,51,1_works_honduras_paragraphs_th,"['works', 'honduras', 'paragraphs', 'th', 'majority', 'governments', 'costa', 'welfare', 'draw', 'decide']","['Topic: Labour Rights Violations in Ecuador and Honduras</assistant>|</s>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']","['of the State in accordance with the provisions of the Labour Code.\n.In its reply dated  February  the Government states that officials and employees of the public administration are in a relationship sui generis and cannot be identified with private workers; the former are not in an ""employment relationship"" with the State, since the State is not an employer, but they have to be protected by a special system of "" guarantees "", since their relationship is governed by statutes and regulations drawn up by the State. The Government goes on to say that there is no civil service in Honduras and therefore no officials or employees of the State are covered by public servants\' regulations, there are only de facto employees of the State who do not yet enjoy de jure guarantees. As de facto employees they enjoy the rights recognised by the Labour Code, subject to special conditions, and will be covered by the Civil Service Act soon to be promulgated. The Government states that SINASEPH has no legal personality for the reasons stated above and that its existence is therefore irregular and without validity within either the national or international sphere.\n.With regard to the violation of freedom of association alleged to be practised by the authorities against the members of SINASEPH, the Government states that it must not be forgotten that purely political activities, such as participation in electoral campaigns, agitation and acts of violence and subversion, do not, either in Honduras or abroad, come within the scope of lawful activities such as may be pursued by duly established trade unions; in no case are such activities lawful for de facto groups like SINASEPH. The only security measures or legal sanctions adopted by the authorities are of an individual character and in no way general or collective against any union or group of persons. The Government further states that Mr. Aristides Mejia Castro, who signed the complaint dated  November  as President of SINASEPH, was relieved of his functions as a public official on  August  by decision of the Secretariat for Foreign Relations.\n.The Committee observes that under existing legislation employees of the official services are entitled to establish trade unions. However, from the explanations provided by the Government, this right would seem to have been suspended, since state employees still do not enjoy the guarantees to which they should be entitled, since they are de facto employees in the absence of a regular civil service in Honduras. Until such time as the Civil Service Act comes into force, it wilt not be possible to reach a satisfactory solution concerning the status of officials and public servants. This is why the complainant organisation would not have been able to obtain legal personality, since its existence is unlawful according to the Government\'s statement.\n.The Committee has stated on more than one occasion that the purpose of the procedure for the examination of cases where violation of freedom of association is alleged is to promote respect for trade union rights, both de jure and de facto, and that the workers\' right freely to constitute organisations of their own choice cannot be considered to exist until such time as it is fully recognised and observed both de facto and de jure.\n.In view of the allegations made by the complainants and of the statement by the Government concerning the difference between officials and public employees on the one hand and private employees on the other, with regard to the character of their employment relationship, the Committee considers that it must draw the Government\'s special attention to the provisions of Article  of Convention No. , which Honduras has ratified, stating that workers and employers, without distinction whatsoever and without previous authorisation, shall have the right to establish and join organisations of their own choosing.\n.The Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has already pointed out that "" the principle of freedom of association might very often remain a dead letter if employers and workers were required to obtain any previous authorisation to enable them to establish an organisation, be it authorisation concerning the formation of the trade union organisation itself, need to obtain discretionary approval of the Constitution or rules of the organisation, or, again, authorisation for taking steps prior to establishment of the organisation "". This does not mean that the founders of an organisation are freed from the duty of observing formalities as to publicity or other similar formalities which may be prescribed by law. However, such requirements must not be such as to be equivalent in practice to previous authorisation, or as to constitute such an obstacle to the establishment of an organisation that they amount in practice to outright prohibition. Even in cases where registration is optional, if such registration confers on the organisation the basic rights enabling it to "" further and defend the interests "" of its members, the fact that the authority competent to effect registration has discretionary power to refuse this formality leads to a situation that is not very different from that in cases where previous authorisation is required.\n.The present case relates to public officials who established a trade union and applied for it to be registered and granted legal personality with a view to normal operation within the framework of the law. However, although there were no major formal obstacles to registration, according to the outline of events submitted to the Committee, the authorities did not register the union, nor did they consequently grant it legal personality without which the organisation cannot lawfully exist. In these circumstances the Committee must expressly emphasise, as it has on other occasions, the importance of ensuring that persons employed in the service of the State should be guaranteed the right to establish trade unions and to register them with a view to their lawful operation.\n.With regard to the allegations concerning the arrest of Mr. Salinas Rivera and his dismissal from the post he previously occupied in the public service, and the dismissal of Miss Barnica, the Government has not given any specific explanation, merely referring to certain purely political activities which could not be lawfully pursued by duly established trade unions, let alone de facto groups such as SINASEPH.\n.The Committee recalls, in the first place, that on many occasions in the past, where allegations that trade union leaders or workers had been arrested or detained for trade union activities have been met by governments with statements that the arrests or detentions were made for subversive activities, for reasons of internal security or for common law crimes, it has followed the rule that the governments concerned should be requested to submit further and as precise information as possible concerning the arrests or detentions and the exact reasons therefor. If, in certain cases, the Committee has concluded that allegations relating to the arrests or detentions of trade union militants did not call for further examination, this has been after it has received information showing sufficiently precisely and with sufficient detail that the arrests or detentions were in no way occasioned by trade union activities but solely by activities outside the trade union sphere, which were either prejudicial to public order or of a political nature. In all cases where trade unionists have been arrested for political offences or for offences under ordinary law the Committee has insisted on the importance of ensuring that such persons should be tried within the shortest possible period by an impartial and independent judicial authority.\n.In the second place the Committee has always attached great importance to the provisions of Article  of Convention No. , according to which workers shall enjoy adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment, such protection applying more particularly in respect of acts calculated to cause the dismissal of or otherwise prejudice a worker by reason of union membership or because of participation in union activities.\n.With regard to the Government\'s statement that "" purely political activities, such as participation in electoral campaigns ... do not, either in Honduras or abroad, come within the scope of lawful activities such as may be pursued by duly established trade unions; in no case are such activities lawful for de facto groups like SINASEPH "", the Committee refers to the comments by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations in . That Committee stated that if trade unions are prohibited in general terms from engaging in any political activities this may raise difficulties by reason of the fact that the interpretation given to the relevant provisions in practice may change at any moment and considerably restrict the possibility of action of the organisations. In this connection the Committee of Experts thought it useful to refer to the resolution adopted by the International Labour Conference at its th Session (Geneva, ) in which it stated that when trade unions undertake or associate themselves with political action this action shall not be "" of such a nature as to compromise', '.These cases were considered by the Committee at its session in February , when it submitted to the Governing Body its interim conclusions in paragraphs  to  of its rd Report, approved by the Governing Body at its st Session (February-March ).\n.In a communication dated  March  the Government sent certain additional observations, which had been requested by the Committee.\n.Ecuador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.The allegations still to be examined refer to two separate questions: first, that workers\' organisations have been obliged to provide the authorities with certain information, and secondly, that the rules of a workers\' organisation have been amended by order of the Ministry of Social Welfare and Labour.\n.As regards the first question, the complainants alleged that by order of the Director-General of Labour (December ) all the workers\' organisations had been compelled under threat of punishment to submit to the authorities, within a peremptory time-limit, a list of their members, a list of the members of the managing committees, and certified copies of the proceedings of the last general assembly and ordinary session held. In the complainants\' opinion this demand constituted interference by the authorities in the affairs of trade union organisations, in violation of freedom of association.\n.In its communication dated  March  the Government claims that the action taken by the Ministry of Social Welfare and Labour does not constitute a violation of trade union rights, since the aim had been to draw up full statistics of the workers\' and employers\' organisations in the country.\n.In view of the Government\'s reply, and of the fact that the complainants have submitted no further information in support of their claim that the demand for the information in question constituted interference by the authorities in the affairs of trade union organisations, the Committee considers that this particular aspect of the allegations does not call for further consideration.\n.The complainants also supplied a copy of a letter from the Ministry of Social Welfare and Labour to a trade union transmitting to it a copy of the "" amendments to the rules of this trade union "". Some of the amendments, which were apparently approved in  by Ministerial Order No. , appeared merely to involve points of form or wording; but one of them provided for the insertion of a clause in the rules whereby the union is required to forward annually to the Ministry a series of documents, namely a copy of the minutes of the last general assembly, with the names of those present, a copy of the General Secretary\'s report, as approved by the assembly, a copy of the Treasurer\'s report, etc. Failure to do so within the  days following the statutory date for the election of the new executive committee would result in the trade union\'s being deemed to have gone into liquidation.\n.At its session in February  the Committee observed that the Government had not furnished its observations on this aspect of the matter, but pointed out the importance that the Governing Body had always attached to the principle that workers\' organisations should be free to draw up their Constitutions and rules and to organise their administration and their activities, and that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which might restrict that right or impede the lawful exercise thereof.\n.On the basis of the evidence supplied by the complainants the Committee pointed out that amendment of a trade union\'s rules by ministerial order, in respect of matters which appear not to have been confined to points of pure form but to have also involved the insertion in these rules of provisions of substance which might jeopardise the very existence of the union, appeared incompatible with the aforementioned principle.\n.Nevertheless, before submitting its final conclusions, the Committee requested the Government, in paragraph  of its rd Report, to be good enough to forward its observations on this aspect of the case.\n.In its communication dated  March , as in its original reply, the Government failed to furnish its observations on this point.\n.According to the Labour Code of Ecuador, in order for a workers\' organisation to be granted legal personality it must be governed in accordance with rules approved by the Ministry of Social Welfare and Labour (section ), such approval being required for registration (section ). Section  of the Code lists ten subjects which trade union rules must deal with if they are to be approved. There is only one subject in this list with regard to which the Code specifies the purport of the statement which is to be included in the rules-namely a statement to the effect that any collective action of a political or religious kind is forbidden. In respect of none of the remaining nine subjects-which appears to leave the organisations concerned adequate freedom in drafting their statutes-is there anything relating to the submission of reports to the authorities.\n.In the absence of fuller information, and particularly of the Government\'s comments, the Committee finds it difficult to decide the extent to which, in practice, the Minister exercises the power conferred on him by the Code to approve trade union rules. The Committee has only the example referred to by the complainants and not denied by the Government, which would appear to show that the power may be exercised in a discretionary manner and not exclusively with regard to points of form but also with regard to points of substance.\n.Accordingly, the Committee wishes to point out that the principle mentioned in paragraph  above is incorporated in Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), Ecuador\'s ratification of which was registered on  May . With regard to this standard the Committee of Experts on the Application of the Conventions and Recommendations has pointed out that the right of organisations freely to draw up their own Constitutions and rules appears to be considerably restricted in countries, for instance, where the rules must be submitted for previous approval by the authorities, whose power of decision does not appear to be limited by any specific rules.\n.In these circumstances, and with regard to the two cases as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to decide, for the reasons set forth in paragraph  above, that the allegations relating to the submission by trade union organisations in general of certain information, as demanded by the authorities, do not call for further examination;(b) with regard to the amendments made by the authorities to the rules of a trade union, to draw the Government\'s attention, for the reasons set forth in paragraphs  to  above, to the importance of the standard contained in Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Ecuador, according to which workers\' and employers\' organisations shall have the right to draw up their Constitutions and rules and the public authorities shall refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof.\n.The Committee has deemed it appropriate to examine together the three cases relating to Ecuador which it has before it.\n.Case No.  has been examined by the Committee at a number of previous meetings, the last occasion being in May , when it submitted to the Governing Body a further interim report which is to be found in paragraphs  to  of the Committee\'s th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (May ). The only aspect of this case which remains outstanding concerns the fate of three trade unionists on whose alleged detention the Government had failed until recently to forward its observations.\n.Case No.  concerns a complaint presented to the I.L.O by the Ecuadorian Federation of Christian Trade Unions (C.E.D.O.C.) on  March  in which allegations were made concerning the imposition upon workers\' organisations of certain obligations which the complainants considered to constitute an infringement of freedom of association. In a letter dated  March  the International Federation- of Christian Trade Unions declared its support for the aforementioned complaint. The C.E.D.O.C supplied further information in a letter dated  March . The texts of all three of these communications were duly transmitted to the Government.\n.Case No.  concerns a complaint presented to the I.L.O by the Latin American Peasant Federation (F.C.L.) by a letter dated  March , followed by a further letter from the same organisation dated  April . The complaint alleged that legal personality had been refused to a workers\' organisation, that trade unionists had been imprisoned and that trade unions had been wrongfully compelled to comply with certain obligations. The texts of both these communications were duly transmitted to the Government.\n.By a communication dated  November  the Government has forwarded certain observations and information concerning the allegations mentioned in paragraphs  and  above.\n.Ecuador has not', '.These cases were considered by the Committee at its session in February , when it submitted to the Governing Body its interim conclusions in paragraphs  to  of its rd Report, approved by the Governing Body at its st Session (February-March ).\n.In a communication dated  March  the Government sent certain additional observations, which had been requested by the Committee.\n.Ecuador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.The allegations still to be examined refer to two separate questions: first, that workers\' organisations have been obliged to provide the authorities with certain information, and secondly, that the rules of a workers\' organisation have been amended by order of the Ministry of Social Welfare and Labour.\n.As regards the first question, the complainants alleged that by order of the Director-General of Labour (December ) all the workers\' organisations had been compelled under threat of punishment to submit to the authorities, within a peremptory time-limit, a list of their members, a list of the members of the managing committees, and certified copies of the proceedings of the last general assembly and ordinary session held.

The only aspect of this case which remains outstanding concerns the fate of three trade unionists on whose alleged detention the Government had failed until recently to forward its observations.\n.Case No.  concerns a complaint presented to the I.L.O by the Ecuadorian Federation of Christian Trade Unions (C.E.D.O.C.) on  March  in which allegations were made concerning the imposition upon workers\' organisations of certain obligations which the complainants considered to constitute an infringement of freedom of association. In a letter dated  March  the International Federation- of Christian Trade Unions declared its support for the aforementioned complaint. The C.E.D.O.C supplied further information in a letter dated  March . The texts of all three of these communications were duly transmitted to the Government.\n.Case No.  concerns a complaint presented to the I.L.O by the Latin American Peasant Federation (F.C.L.) by a letter dated  March , followed by a further letter from the same organisation dated  April . The complaint alleged that legal personality had been refused to a workers\' organisation, that trade unionists had been imprisoned and that trade unions had been wrongfully compelled to comply with certain obligations. The texts of both these communications were duly transmitted to the Government.\n.By a communication dated  November  the Government has forwarded certain observations and information concerning the allegations mentioned in paragraphs  and  above.\n.Ecuador has not']"

It begins by stating that when the dockers\' unions learned of the Government\'s intention of issuing new labour laws and regulations they submitted a memorandum on dockers\' problems in which they emphasised the need to create a national port policy and expressed their willingness to co-operate for that purpose. As the Government refused to consider this offer of conciliation and co-operation, the dockers\' unions declared a strike. Mr. Tolosa left the country for Montevideo to secure his personal safety and direct the strike from there.\n.According to the I.T.F, the Government continued to maintain an intransigent attitude even though the dockers\' unions had offered a solution including, among other points, the lifting of government control of the union, postponement of the enforcement of the new laws for  days, the creation of a tripartite committee of employers\', workers\' and government representatives to study the application of the new laws and the submission of any unresolved matters to arbitration.\n.The I.T.F states that on  October it sent its member unions a circular requesting "" the fullest possible manifestation of international solidarity in an effort to assist the Argentine dockers "". At the same time a cable was sent to President Ongania "" notifying him of the possibility of international action and offering him the assistance of the I.T.F in mediation and negotiation "". In order to ensure that the Government had a true picture of the interest of the I.T.F in the dispute, Mr. Medrano, I.T.F. Director in Latin America, met various Argentine authorities including the Labour Secretary, who told him that if the dockers accepted the new regulations on working conditions temporarily a tripartite committee would be set up to consider the matter. After consulting with the unions, Mr. Medrano drafted the terms of a solution and submitted it to the Labour Secretary, who informed him that the Transport Secretary would have to be consulted before the Government could give a reply. Finally, after further meetings were held, the Labour Secretary, the I.T.F states, accepted a text, a copy of which is attached to its communication.\n.The checkers\' and foremen\'s unions agreed unanimously to accept the solution and return to work on  December. A delegates\' conference of S.U.P.A was convened for Sunday,  December, which it was confidently expected would end the strike. When the delegates had assembled, the police arrested Mr. Tolosa on the grounds that he had left the country without permission; he was subsequently released on bail but re-arrested on a charge of acts harmful to the Argentine economy and finally released on  December.\n.Still according to the I.T.F, the unions decided, once Mr. Tolosa was free, to return to work on  December on the basis of the agreement reached with the Secretaries of Labour and Transport, but when the men reported for work they were prevented from entering the dock area by the police and the military. The strike thus became a lockout, which the complainant organisation affirms is proof of the Government\'s intention to impose unilaterally its own conditions of work on the trade unions. It also affirms that the Government tried to force the acceptance of strike breakers in the docks and allow only sufficient regular dockers to be registered to make up the number required for the working of the port. The figures proposed by the captain in charge of the port were as follows:Strike breakers\tRegular dockers\tTotalForemen\t\t\tCheckers\t\t\tDockers\t,\t\t,\n.These figures, the complainants say, show strike breakers were greatly in the majority, leaving most of the port workers of Buenos Aires without employment because they had acted in defence of their legitimate trade union rights.\n.In the meantime, a further warrant having been issued for Mr. Tolosa, he decided to give himself up on  January  and has been in prison ever since.\n.Lastly, the complainants state that despite several further approaches made by the Regional Director to the authorities and those made by a joint I.C.F.T.U.-I.T.F mission, the Government maintained its attitude. The complainants state that the facts set forth constitute infringements of I.L.O. Conventions Nos.  and , since the Government has: taken steps to modify conditions of work in ports without prior consultation with the unions concerned; refused to consider any proposals submitted by the dockers\' unions and in particular the memorandum on dockers\' problems; appointed an official to take charge of the dockers\' union (S.U.P.A.); recruited strike breakers; arrested the General Secretary of S.U.P.A, Mr. Eustaquio Tolosa, on  December  just as he was about to chair a meeting of his union, and again on  January ; locked out dockworkers, thereby victimising them for having taken part in a campaign ordered by their union; failed to honour the agreement reached by the representative of the complainant organisation and the Labour and Transport Secretaries.\n.In its reply dated  May  to the allegations put forward by the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions and the Argentine Trade Union Movement, the Government states that in connection with the dockers\' strike, Mr. Tolosa, who was on trial for his activities in the so-called Plan of Action of the C.G.T of , left the country without the necessary court authorisation to settle in Montevideo, where he began promoting the notion of an international boycott of Argentine ships and planes.\n.The Government goes on to say that after an agreement had been reached which was to be examined by a union meeting on  December , Mr. Tolosa returned to Argentina. When this came to the knowledge of the judge who was conducting the proceedings, he ordered Tolosa to be arrested by virtue of section  of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Federal Capital which stipulates that, in order to be released on bail, a person standing trial shall undertake to obey any summons emanating from the judge and to have a fixed place of residence from which he may not absent himself without the knowledge and authorisation of the judge; a breach of this provision is sufficient to cause the accused to be imprisoned again.\n.The Government supplies the text of a report by the federal police showing that the arrest was made in execution of an order from a national federal judge of the Criminal and Correctional Court of First instance in connection with Case No. / against various persons on charges of sedition and other offences. The report states that the arrest was made before the meeting convened by the leaders of the S.U.P.A began and that Mr. Tolosa complied with the order given by the police officer; although a few hot-heads tried to oppose his arrest, no one else was arrested and nobody was wounded or hurt.\n.From various press cuttings supplied by the Government it would appear that legal proceedings were subsequently taken against Mr. Tolosa before another court for a breach of section  of Act No. , which makes an Argentine citizen liable to imprisonment if he promotes economic or political measures against the interests of the State by any means whatsoever.\n.With regard to the dockers\' dispute, the Government supplies the following information. With a view to achieving full operation of the country\'s ports, rational regulation of dock work and the elimination of a wastage of human and material resources that was detrimental to the community, the President of Argentina exercised the powers conferred on him by the Statute of the Argentine Revolution to approve Acts Nos.  and  and Decree No. . The Government supplies the text of all these provisions.\n.The Government states that in this way dock work is brought within the scope of the general legislation regarding hours of work, days of rest and holidays which is applicable to all workers in the country. These measures modified the previous system which had also been set up unilaterally by the State (Legislative Decree No. / and Decree No. /) and distorted the principle of equality. In spite of these exceptional measures to regulate it, work in ports was constantly being perturbed by disputes arising out of futile motives and which led to an exorbitant rise in the cost of labour, so much so that the ports of Argentina became the most expensive in the world, particularly Buenos Aires which earned the name of "" dirty port "", with a resultant increase in freight rates. Act No.  and regulations thereunder lay down essential standards to enable port work to be brought back into the scope of the general labour law as already established.\n.The Government takes the view that there has been no breach of any international agreement, any canon, standard or principle of social justice, or any prior collective agreement with the trade union organisations.\n.It goes on to state that the Acts and decree in question were no sooner promulgated than the S.U.P.A declared a strike for the express purpose of paralysing port activities and solicited, through its representatives, the support of foreign trade unions in boycotting Argentine ships and planes and all the goods carried by them. According to the Government,', '.The Committee examined this case at its session in February , when it submitted to the Governing Body an interim report, contained in paragraphs - of its rd Report. The Governing Body approved this Report at its rd Session (May ).\n.In the said Report certain further information and comments were requested from the Government, which sent them in two communications dated  May and  August  respectively.\n.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.It will be recalled that the complainants referred, in their complaint dated  June , to a previous complaint relating to the Government\'s decision in January  to take over the Argentine Federation of Chemical and Allied Workers. On that occasion the Committee had recommended the Governing Body "" to take note of the Government\'s statement that it intends to restore the situation of the trade union organisation in question to normal as soon as possible "". The complainants went on to say that no measure was taken along these lines and that the authorities forcibly handed over the management of the Federation to Government supporters. The leaders imposed by the authorities proceeded to organise "" rigged "" elections at the end of November . The electoral Committee, made up of persons who had no connection with the organisation, produced no lists of candidates and refused to allow the ballot boxes to be kept on the Federation\'s premises, as was customary. As a result, the complainants alleged, a large number of members of the Federation abstained from voting.\n.In its reply dated  October , the Government referred to the elections held within the Federation, stating that there had been no electoral Committee and no allegations of electoral fraud. The government-appointed controller of the organisation, an official from the Secretariat of State for Labour, organised an election on  February  and, at the Congress held one month later, the new authorities of the Federation were elected, taking over the trade union organisation on  March . The Congress had submitted a single list of candidates, which obtained  votes from the  delegates.\n.At its session in February  the Committee observed, primarily, that the procedure whereby the leaders of the Federation were elected did not reach its culmination until two years after the takeover of the organisation by the public authorities. The Committee considered it necessary to emphasise in this respect the importance it attaches to the principle contained in Article  of Convention No. , which lays down that "" workers\' and employers\' organisations shall have the right to draw up their Constitutions and rules, to elect their representatives in full freedom, to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes "", and that "" the public authorities shall refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof "".\n.As regards the elections themselves, the Committee observed that, in their account of the events, the complainants referred to what appeared to have been primary elections, held in November  for the purpose of electing delegates to the Congress which was to have the actual task of electing the leaders of the Federation. The Government had supplied certain details about this Congress but, apart from stating that there had been no electoral Committee, it had made no comment on the remaining assertions of the complainants with regard to these primary elections, which concerned alleged irregularities in regard to the displaying of a list of candidates and the custody of the ballot boxes.\n.It would appear from certain trade union leaflets, of which copies were supplied to the Committee by the complainants, that the group of trade unionists ousted as a result of the takeover hold the takeover responsible, in particular, for the following facts: that the rolls listing the names and other particulars of the electors were not made available to those on the officially authorised lists of candidates; that the ballot boxes were not allowed to be kept on the Federation\'s premises; that the persons on the officially authorised list of candidates were not permitted to be on the electoral Committee (or board); and that no announcement was made as to when and where the voting was to take place. Accordingly, the group of trade unionists in question announced the withdrawal of their list of candidates and urged the workers to boycott the election.\n.The Committee recalled Decree No.  of , which was apparently in force at the time of the elections, and which contains certain provisions relevant to some of the points raised by the complainants. Section  of the Decree lays down certain rules with regard to elections which must be embodied in the by-laws of trade unions. As concerns electoral rolls, section  (d) stipulates that they must be made available to members and to candidates for office not less than  days prior to the date of the election. As for the places where the votes may be cast, section  (b) states that these must be specified in the notice of election and may not be changed.\n.Furthermore, the Committee noted the Government\'s observations to the effect that no allegations of electoral fraud had been made. In this respect the Committee pointed out that it had stated on many occasions that, while in view of the nature of its responsibilities it could not consider itself bound by the rule, normally applicable in international jurisdictions, that national procedures of redress must be utilised in the first instance, it must have regard, however, in examining the merits of a case, to the fact that a national remedy before an independent tribunal, whose procedure offered appropriate guarantees, had not been pursued.\n.In conclusion, the Committee recommended that the Government be requested: (a) to supply information concerning the administrative and judicial avenues open to the trade unionists involved in the present case whereby they could appeal against the decisions of the controller as regards the elections that had been held; (b) to forward its observations and comments on the points mentioned in paragraphs  and  above.\n.In its communication of  May  the Government states that the leaflets sent to the Committee by the complainants do not constitute authentic proof and that the electoral meeting and last ballot undertaken in the Chemical and Allied Workers\' Union were entirely normal and gave rise to no objections. The Committee understands that this refers to the primary elections mentioned by the complainants. The Government goes on to say that only one list of candidates was presented at the elections since the other lists, which had been officially approved, were withdrawn. Voting was secret and the Government gives the addresses of the places in which the  voting booths were installed. There were , names on the electoral roll and , persons voted. The list presented obtained , votes. Twenty-one votes were declared null and void and there were  blank votes. The Government adds that the leaflets sent to the ILO by the complainants are self-contradictory since, while one of them denounces irregularities, a subsequent one calls upon members to take part in the elections (which implies that the alleged irregularities had been made good) and that, lastly, one day before the elections began, a further leaflet called for non-participation in the elections.\n.In its communication of  August , the Government explains that the decisions taken by the government-appointed controller of an occupational association, as regards elections held therein, may be challenged if they contravene the provisions of the association\'s by-laws. Such decisions may be appealed against to the controller\'s hierarchical superiors (in accordance with Decree No. /). Moreover, recourse may always be had to court proceedings by any person who considers that his legitimate rights and interests have been abused. In cases where prompt and efficacious intervention is required to ensure the effective application of the guarantees embodied in the Constitution, the persons concerned may avail themselves of the amparo procedure to secure respect of a fundamental right (Act No. ). The Government explains that this was the interpretation given by the Supreme Court of Justice when it ruled that "" where acts already committed by administrative authorities constitute a present or imminent threat of actual harm, there are grounds for seeking the protection of the courts "".\n.The Committee observes that the further communications sent by the Government contain no specific information regarding the complainants\' allegations, mentioned in paragraph , or the relevant legislative provisions, referred to in paragraph . The Government confines itself to pointing out that the fact that in one of the trade union leaflets members were urged to participate in the voting implies that the irregularities denounced by the trade union concerned, in a previous leaflet, had been remedied. Nevertheless, the Committee notes that in the final leaflet, calling upon workers not to take part in the elections, the reasons given are the alleged irregularities', 'referred to in paragraph  above. Two of these irregularities would constitute infringements of the provisions of Decree No.  of  (see paragraph  above). The Committee consequently considers that, because of the lack of precision and detail in the information sent by the Government, it is impossible to throw sufficient light on the events complained about in this case. Nor is the Committee in a position to judge the extent to which the alleged irregularities would have rendered the electoral process fraudulent. In any case, they appear to have led to the withdrawal of various lists of candidates so that the trade union election could not be held in completely normal conditions. Moreover, the Committee observes that less than half of those who were entitled to vote actually did so.\n.The Committee considers it necessary to recall that the elections took place while the Argentine Federation of Chemical and Allied Workers (to which the Chemical and Allied Workers\' Union is affiliated) was under Government control and that the elections were organised by the official from the Secretariat of State for Labour who was acting as controller. The Committee has frequently had occasion to express its opinion (restated in paragraph  above) with regard to the taking over of trade unions by public authorities. As regards measures that can be taken by government-appointed controllers in the exercise of their functions, the Committee considers that these are liable to appear arbitrary, even though they may be called in question before the courts. This is why the Committee has repeatedly pointed out that, although the principles established in Article  of Convention No.  do not prevent the control of internal acts of a trade union, if it is considered that such acts constitute a breach of legal or statutory provisions, it is of the utmost importance, in order to guarantee an impartial and objective procedure, for such control to be exercised by the relevant judicial authority. This would avoid the risk to the free exercise of trade union rights caused by any type of administrative takeover of trade unions.\n.On the other hand, the Committee observes that the decisions taken by the government-appointed controller could have been appealed against in the courts in order to clarify the matters raised by the persons involved and, in view of the circumstances, to provide a timely remedy to any proved irregularity, but that the persons concerned did not avail themselves of this possibility.\n.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to regret the fact that the Government has not sent precise information regarding the allegations made by the complainants of irregularities in trade union elections;(b) to note that the persons concerned did not avail themselves in this case of their right of appeal to the judicial authorities to oppose the measures alleged to have affected them in the electoral procedure;(c) to draw the Government\'s attention to the considerations set forth in paragraphs  and  above as regards the specific question of trade union elections and the more general problem of the taking over of trade unions by the administrative authorities.\n.The complaint of the Trade Unions International of Chemical, Oil and Allied Workers is contained in a communication dated  June . It was brought to the attention of the Government, which forwarded its observations by a communication dated  October .\n.Argentina has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.The complainants begin by referring to an earlier complaint examined by the Committee, which related to the taking over by the Government, ordered in January , of the Argentine Federation of Chemical and Allied Workers. The Committee recommended the Governing Body in connection with that case "" to take note of the Government\'s statement that it intends to restore the trade union organisation in question to normal as soon as possible "".\n.The complainants go on to say that no action has been taken to this effect, and that the authorities have forcibly handed over the management of the Federation to pro-government collaborators. The General Secretary of the Federation, who had been arrested in July , was released only after mass demonstrations and a strike. According to the complaint, the leaders imposed upon the Federation by the authorities organised rigged elections at the end of November . The electoral committee, composed of people who had no connection with the Federation, displayed no list of candidates and even refused to allow the ballot boxes to be kept on the Federation\'s premises as was customary. In view of these facts, allege the complainants, the Federation\'s members abstained from voting in large numbers.\n.The complaint concludes with the statement that the last collective agreement was signed on behalf of the Federation by government officials.\n.In its reply the Government, referring to the General Secretary of the Federation, mentioned above, declares that he was arrested on account of activities presumed to be of subversive nature, and subsequently released.\n.As regards the elections held within the Federation, the Government states that there was no electoral committee and that no allegations were made of electoral fraud. The controller in charge of the taking over of the organisation, an official of the Secretariat of State for Labour, called for elections on  February , and at the Congress held a month later the Federation\'s new leaders were elected. They took office on  March . A single list of candidates was submitted to the Congress, and obtained  votes from the  delegates present.\n.As concerns the collective agreement to which the complainants refer, the Government explains that under Decree No. / a timetable was laid down for the renewal of collective agreements, that for the chemical industries being due for renewal in December . Since at that time the Federation was under government control, the Secretary of State for Labour designated the controller and two other persons to negotiate on its behalf, since otherwise the agreement in force would have been renewed without any possibility of securing better working conditions.\n.The Committee observes that the procedure whereby the leaders of the Federation were elected did not reach its culmination until two years after the taking over of this organisation by the public authorities, with the result that when the time came for the renewal of the collective agreement (towards the end of this period), the workers\' representatives had to be designated by the Secretariat of State for Labour, and included the controller himself-an official of the Secretariat. The Committee considers it necessary to emphasise in this respect the importance it attaches to the principle contained in Article  of Convention No. , which lays down that workers\' and employers\' organisations shall have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom, to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes, and that the public authorities shall refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof.\n.As regards the elections held within the Federation, the Committee takes note of the Government\'s observation to the effect that no allegations of electoral fraud were made at the time. The Committee has pointed out on many occasions that, while in view of the nature of its responsibilities it cannot consider itself bound by any rule that national procedures of redress must be exhausted, such as applies, for instance, to international claims tribunals, it must have regard in examining the merits of a case, to the fact that a national remedy before an independent tribunal whose procedure offers appropriate guarantees has not been pursued.\n.The Committee observes that in their account of the events in question the complainants refer to what appear to have been primary elections held in November  for the purpose of electing delegates to the Congress which was to have the actual task of electing the leaders of the Federation. The Government supplies certain details about this Congress, but apart from stating that there was no electoral committee, it makes no comment upon the remaining assertions of the complainants with regard to these primary elections, which concern alleged irregularities in regard to the displaying of a list of candidates and the custody of the ballot boxes.\n.It would appear from certain leaflets of which copies have been supplied to the Committee by the complainants that the group of trade unionists ousted as a result of the takeover hold the takeover responsible, in particular, for the following facts: the fact that the rolls listing the names and other particulars of the electors were not made available to those on the officially authorised lists of candidates, the fact that the ballot boxes were not allowed to be kept on the Federation\'s premises, the fact that the persons on the officially authorised lists of candidates were not permitted to be on the electoral committee (or board), and the fact that no announcement was made stating when and where the voting was to take place.']"
