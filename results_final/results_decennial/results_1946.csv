0,"Government interferes in the administration of trade unions.
.Without attempting at this stage to examine in detail the legislation mentioned in the Government's reply, the Committee would point out that this legislation is evidence only of the present legal situation of occupational organisations and not of the factual situation which is the principal element in the complaint.
.So far as the allegations relating to the factual situation of trade unions are concerned, the versions of the events given by the complainants and by the Government differ fundamentally and, without a preliminary enquiry on the spot, it would no doubt be impossible to decide as to their respective merits.
.It would however appear from the analysis of the facts in issue that the complaint is sufficiently precise to make possible and desirable a more-detailed examination of the facts.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends that the case merits further examination by the Governing Body.
.Neither the Venezuelan Government nor the Dominican Government has been formally requested to indicate whether it would be willing to consent to reference of the matter to the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission. Under the procedure laid down by the Governing Body this question does not arise until the Governing Body itself has decided that the Government concerned shall be asked to give its consent to reference of the matter to the Fact-Finding Commission. Although both Governments have indicated in their preliminary observations on the complaints that they would not be willing to consent to such reference, the Committee does not consider that such a preliminary reply precludes the Governing Body from discussing further whether it is advisable to make a formal request to the Government concerned that it should consent to reference of a case to the Fact-Finding Commission. They venture to hope that in future cases the preliminary observations of Governments will not anticipate any request which the Governing Body may or may not think it appropriate to make after it has had an opportunity of considering the facts of the case and expressing its views. In respect of these cases the Committee suggests that the Governing Body should authorise it to afford an opportunity to the Governments concerned to discuss with the Committee the questions at issue before the Committee attempts to formulate any further recommendations on the subject for consideration by the Governing Body. The Committee ventures to hope that such discussion might result in the Governments concerned indicating steps which they are taking or would be prepared to take to give effect to the principle of freedom of association.Geneva,  January .",-1,1950,Dominican Republic
1,".In this letter the Government declares that, in order to permit an impartial study of the allegations presented, it submits to the International Labour Organisation the following data:(a) True trade union organisation, that is to say the organisation of those elements among the workers which only seek the improvement of their lot, independently of harmful political activities, is effectively guaranteed and enjoys the support of the public authorities. Article  of the Constitution, furthermore, expressly recognises it.(b) On the other hand, activities whose sole object is to overthrow the present democratic Government under the pretext of "" freedom of association "" must be suppressed by the Government, whose imperative duty it is to secure its own preservation and the preservation of democratic institutions.(c) The general labour law and the Decree applying that law clearly establish the objectives of all trade unions (including, for example, representation of trade unions in collective agreements and in cases of conciliation and arbitration, the establishment of insurance funds, the organisation of cooperatives, etc.) ; they do not state that "" trade union "" objectives include the propagation of communist doctrine, insurrection against a Government based on popular support or the maintenance of a permanent spirit of revolution among trade union members leading to the commission of abominable crimes. The Bolivian State recognises trade union rights when they are exercised "" in accordance with law "", as is expressly provided in Article  of the Constitution. Article , however, provides that "" trade unions are forbidden to deal with other questions than those previously enumerated "".(d) The signatories of the complaints, who improperly call themselves "" leaders "" of the Bolivian Federation of Miners' Unions, are in reality the heads of revolutionary movements aiming at the overthrow of the Government and not at the protection of the legitimate rights of workers. The "" Thesis of Pulacayo "", the charter of the Revolutionary Workers' Party, which was approved by the congress of Bolivian miners, and which is invoked by the signatories, is not at all democratic since it is a synthesis of the most extreme and cynical communist rgime. In substantiation of its statement, the Government imputes to certain signatories of the complaint the personal commission of repeated acts of violence (in particular organisation of the ""assault groups "" in the mines for the purpose of taking forcible possession of the latter, armed attacks on a barracks, mining of communication lines, etc.).(e) The Government also refers to the Amnesty Law of  September  stating that if there were exceptions they were made in conformity with the very theory of amnesty which is intended to apply in cases of purely political events but which cannot be applied to ordinary misdemeanours. In such cases it is logical to await the decision of the ordinary courts. This law therefore is not a "" cruel mockery "", since it is the Bolivian people themselves who demand the punishment of those who for more than three years have troubled the peace and legally constituted order of the Bolivian Republic.
.In conclusion, the Government states that there can be no question of violation of trade union rights since the repressing action of the Government has not been directed against those trade union activities which are protected by the State but against revolutionary activities having for sole purpose the overthrow of the Constitutional Government and the establishment of a communist dictatorship. Accordingly, it expresses the hope that the International Labour Organisation, whose prestige and merit it recognises, may judge "" how false is the position of the former leaders of the miners who have wished to abuse its good faith "".
.In this letter the Bolivian Government sets forth the following considerations:(a) Since May  Bolivia has been governed by a Military Board, and all trade union organisations without exception enjoy full freedom and receive extensive co-operation in the development of their activities which are genuinely concerned with trade union matters. Furthermore, the trade unions and federations have publicly adopted resolutions expressing the satisfaction of the workers with the policy of social justice followed by the authorities at present in power.(b) The Government refers to the letter of  January , analysed above, which was sent to the International Labour Organisation by the Government which preceded it, in order to enable the Organisation to "" make an impartial study of the attitude of those authorities toward trade union rights "".(c) Measures will be taken to achieve progress in labour legislation in conformity with the recommendations and resolutions of the International Labour Organisation as also with the recommendations of the technical assistance mission of the United Nations headed by Dr. Keenleyside, taking into account the particular conditions obtaining in Bolivia.(d) The ratification by the new Bolivian Government of the instrument amending the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation constitutes further proof of this Government's aspiration towards social justice.
.The present case arises in very special circumstances.
.The complaints communicated to the Government of Bolivia all have reference to a situation of fact which existed previous to the Constitution of the present Government.
.The present Government indicates in its letter of  January  that henceforward "" all the country's trade unions without exception whatsoever enjoy full freedom and receive extensive co-operation in the development of their activities which are genuinely concerned with trade union matters "" ; that it has, as a "" proof of its aspiration toward social justice "", ratified the instrument amending the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation; and that "" measures will be taken to achieve progress in labour legislation for the benefit of the workers of Bolivia by the organisation of Government labour services in accordance with the Recommendations and resolutions of the International Labour Organisation and the Recommendations of the United Nations Technical Assistance Mission led by Dr. Keenleyside, taking into account the particular needs "" of the country.
.The mission led by Dr. Keenleyside to which the letter of the Bolivian Government refers was constituted under the aegis of the United Nations with the co-operation of certain specialised agencies, including the International Labour Organisation. An agreement between the United Nations and the Bolivian Government for the implementation of certain of the Recommendations made by the mission provides for the appointment by the Bolivian Government of a certain number of advisers nominated by the competent international organisations to assist the Government in its programme of social and economic development and reform. Two such advisers have been appointed on the nomination of the International Labour Office. The United Nations and specialised agencies co-operating with the Bolivian Government are represented in Bolivia by a special United Nations Representative for Technical Assistance who is a former Chairman of the Governing Body.
.Since the Bolivian Government expressly refers in its letter of  January  to the letter of  January  sent by the preceding Government, it would appear to recognise the continuity which exists before inter national bodies between the preceding and present Governments. Though the latter can obviously not be held responsible for events which took place under its predecessor, it clearly is responsible for any continuing consequences which they may have had since its accession to power.
.Bearing in mind these diverse considerations, the Committee, while recognising that the matter may have had a political character, regrets that serious interference with trade union rights would appear to have occurred under the preceding Government, and expresses the hope that the assurances given by the present Government will result in satisfactory protection for trade union rights ; in regard to the present situation, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide:(a) To express to the present Bolivian Government its appreciation of the information furnished in its letter of  January , which indicates particularly that measures are to be taken to achieve progress in labour legislation.(b) To draw its attention in this connection to the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, , and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, , the desirability of ratifying which might usefully be considered by the Bolivian Government.(c) To request the Director-General to communicate the part of this report concerning the case of Bolivia, together with all the documents relative to the case, to the United Nations Representative for Technical Assistance accredited to the Bolivian Government for information, in the hope that it may be taken into account in the course of the technical co-operation between the United Nations and the specialised agencies and the Bolivian Government.Geneva,  March .",-1,1950,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
2,"or if any of these provisions is contrary to the law; and(b) if any of the conditions required by the Code or by the statutes for the Constitution of trade unions are not met (Article ).
.It cannot, however, be deduced from the restrictions concerning certain categories of workers which are not covered by the Code that the latter are not granted the right of association by virtue of ordinary law in the matter of the rights of association in general.Trade Union Rgime
.Under the terms of Article  of the Code, any association of workers constituted in conformity with the Code for the purpose of studying, promoting and defending the common interests of its members is a trade union. The trade unions must be registered by the State Secretariat of Labour (Article ), failing which their actions are null and void (Article .). The request for registration must be accompanied by the rules of the trade union, the record of proceedings of the constituent assembly, and a list of the founding members. The Secretariat of Labour may, within ten days, return the documents to the persons concerned, pointing out the corrections that may need to be made. Registration may only be refused in the two following cases:
.The regulations concerning the operation of trade unions provided in Article  to  of the Code, to which the statutes of the trade unions must conform, are limited to specifying the essential conditions necessary to the normal operation of the trade union. In this connection, the Statement of Policy declares that the regulations concerning the organisation and operation of trade unions are based on those relating to joint-stock companies, subject, of course, to the modifications made necessary by the nature of trade unions.
.In commenting on the provisions of the Code relating to the Constitution of trade unions, the representative of the Government of the Dominican Republic told the Committee that registration may not arbitrarily be refused to trade unions which fulfil the conditions laid down by the Code. A trade union has the right to be registered. In case of dispute, recourse to the courts and, in the last resort, to the Supreme Court, is provided for.Purposes of Trade Unions
.The purposes of the trade unions, which are defined in a general way by Article  cited above (to study, promote and defend the common interests), are specified by Article , which assigns to them the following functions in particular : to study conditions of work ; to conclude collective agreements, defend the rights ensuing from them, and to revise the collective agreements in conformity with the provisions of the Code ; to settle economic labour disputes in equitable and peaceful fashion ; to improve conditions of work, life and production ; to study and prepare legislative reforms for the above purposes. This enumeration is not, however, exhaustive, for certain articles of the Code further provide the possibility for the trade unions to establish social and cultural services, mutual societies, etc. Furthermore, the Code recognises, in principle at least, the right to strike of the workers. It is, however, forbidden to the trade unions to intervene in political or religious questions.
.It would thus appear from the various provisions which we have analysed that the workers included in the scope of the Code are free to constitute organisations of their choice and to be members of them without previous authorisation:Operation of Trade Unions
.The Code contains no provisions empowering the administrative authorities to intervene in the activities of trade unions. Article  alone imposes on the trade unions the obligation to maintain certain records (membership list, inventory of movable and immoveable goods, daily record of receipts and expenditures, record of proceedings of the various trade union bodies), but it is solely incumbent on the competent justice of the peace to initial these records on their first and last pages.
.The Code, as noted above, has rescinded all previous regulations concerning trade unions including, consequently, any measure which, according to the allegation of the complainants, enabled the Government to intervene in the administration of trade unions. It seems, therefore, that the legislation currently in force is intended to ensure full autonomy to the trade unions.Dissolution of Trade Unions
.The dissolution of trade unions is regulated by Articles  and  of the Code ; according to the first of these provisions, a works union is automatically dissolved consequent upon the definitive closing of the undertaking for which it is constituted ; indeed, as it is constituted for the workers of a single undertaking, such a union has no further reason to exist if the undertaking itself ceases to exist. Under the terms of Article , the registration of a trade union may be voided by decision of the courts if the union engages in activities foreign to its legal purposes ; the voidance of the registration automatically entails the dissolution of the union.
.In connection with these provisions on the dissolution of trade unions, the representative of the Government of the Dominican Republic told the Committee that, apart from these cases, the Government does not have the right to void registration.
.It would seem from these articles that a union is not subject to suspension or dissolution by administrative action.Trade Union Federations and Confederations
.Articles  to  of the Code deal with trade union federations and Confederations. Under these provisions, the unions may form local, provincial, regional or national federations ; these federations may in turn form Confederations, subject to the condition that two-thirds of their members meeting in a general assembly declare themselves favourable. The federations and Confederations must be registered ; the provisions applicable to unions in general also regulate the federations and Confederations.
.It would appear that the Code ensures to workers' organisations the right to constitute federations and Confederations and to affiliate with them. This being so, it also seems that the legislation currently in force does not prevent the reconstitution of the former General Confederation of Dominican Workers, which was dissolved, according to the allegations of the complainants, in .
.The Code contains no provision respecting the affiliation of unions to international organisations. The representative of the Government of the Dominican Republic pointed out in this connection that Dominican law, being national law, cannot provide for such cases, but that it does not prohibit them. Failing a negative provision on this subject, employers' and workers' organisations do not thus appear to be deprived of the right to affiliate with such organisations.
.After having made a comprehensive analysis of the case and having noted the statements made by the representative of the Dominican Republic, the Committee reached the following conclusions, which it submits to the Governing Body:
.In denying that the four signatories of the complaint exiled from the country have any capacity as trade union representatives the Government considers that the complaint, emanating not from an organisation but from mere individuals, is not receivable. By the terms of the regulations governing the procedure, the only complaints receivable, with the exception of those officially transmitted to the International Labour Organisation by the General Assembly or the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations are those emanating either from workers' or employers' organisations or from Governments.
.The Committee has observed that the complaint was lodged not only by the four Dominican persons mentioned but also by the President of the Inter-American Confederation of Labour in the name of that organisation. It would appear, therefore, that on this ground alone the complaint is receivable whether the objections raised against the other signatories are justifiable or not. The fact that this organisation has since been dissolved and replaced by the Inter-American Regional Organisation of Workers, a regional organisation of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, does not, in the view of the Committee, affect the receivability of the complaint.
.Relying on the argument that the four Dominican signatories are "" politicians in exile, condemned by the courts "", the Government attributes a purely political character to the complaint. The Government states in particular: "" The attitude of these persons has always been to stir up revolt inside and outside Dominican territory and it is for this reason that the complaint which they have signed has a purely political character. "".
.In basing their complaint on the allegation that workers' organisations cannot exist or function freely, the complainants are submitting precise facts which, if proved, would make it impossible, seemingly, to reject the complaint on the ground that it is purely political in character, whatever the motive inspiring it may actually be.
.Basing their argument on a series of repressive measures directed especially against trade union leaders and on the fact that only a single central trade union organisation under the control of the Government is authorised, the complainants claim that workers in the Dominican Republic do not have the right to organise freely according to their own choice.
.Alleging, in the second place, that by virtue of a Decree of  January  existing organisations are placed under the control of the Government, the complainants claim that the",-1,1950,Dominican Republic
3,"placed under extremely strict governmental supervision. The Confederation of Dominican Workers alone, a factitious body in the service of the Government, was authorised.(c) A Decree of  June , instituting a ""Trade Union Day"", in fact placed the trade unions under the supervision of the administrative authorities.(d) Strikes occurring in  and in  were forcibly broken, and several trade union leaders were killed ; others were arrested and, after a year of imprisonment, interned in a village which they could not leave without authorisation from the Government ; yet others were obliged to seek refuge in an Embassy. From  to the present, the number of trade union leaders and of ordinary workers who have suffered a similar fate has steadily mounted.
.The Government of the Dominican Republic in its first reply, as well as the representative of the Government in his statement to the Committee, disputed the veracity of these allegations:(a) The Government did not dissolve the General Confederation of Dominican Workers in .(b) On the contrary, the Government, by a whole series of social welfare measures, has promoted the rise of the working class and of the trade union movement in particular. The proof of this is that many trade unions have been freely constituted in the various regions of the country and have affiliated themselves in the Confederation of Dominican Workers, which is the most representative organisation of workers and is entirely independent of the Government.(c) The Decree instituting Trade Union Day was rescinded in .(d) The Government limits itself to formally denying that strikes have been suppressed by violence and that reprisals were taken against leaders for their trade union activities alone.
.Finally, with respect to the legal status of trade unions, the Government emphasised that the Dominican workers have complete freedom under the legislation currently in force. The representative of the Government drew the attention of the Committee, on the one hand, to the provisions of the Constitution of the Republic guaranteeing freedom of association and, on the other, to the Labour Code of  June , a copy of which the representative submitted to the Committee on Freedom of Association.
.In examining the legal position of trade unions, the Committee therefore referred to the text of the Constitution, on the one hand, and to the Labour Code, on the other, which, by virtue of its Article , repeals all previous laws, including those concerning trade unions.Constitutional Guarantee of Freedom of Association
.Under the heading of "" individual rights "", Article , paragraph  of the Constitution promulgated on  January  recognises freedom of assembly for peaceful purposes as fundamental, inherent human rights.
.Paragraph  of the same Article guarantees individual security and, in this connection, provides as follows : No one may be imprisoned or have his liberty restricted without a written warrant stating the reasons therefor issued by the competent judicial official, except in the case of a person caught in the act of committing a crime. No sentence whatsoever may be passed on any person unless he has been given a public hearing and been duly summoned to attend such hearing. This provision, however, does not apply to cases within the competence of disciplinary tribunals. Any person deprived of his freedom must be brought before the competent court within forty-eight hours of his arrest, failing which he must be liberated. Every arrest ceases to have effect or is transformed into imprisonment in the forty-eight hours following the bringing of the person concerned before the competent court ; within the same period, the person concerned must be informed of the decision rendered to this effect. Any person deprived of his freedom without just cause or without the legal formalities prescribed having been observed or under any circumstances other than those laid down by law shall be liberated forthwith, either on his own demand or on the demand of any other person.
.Article  of the Constitution provides that the enumeration of the rights of the individual set forth in Article  is not limitative.
.In case of grave and imminent danger to national sovereignty, the Congress-the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate in joint session-may decree a state of emergency and suspend the guarantees of the individual mentioned in Article  of the Constitution, with the exception of those relating to the inviolability of human life. If the Congress is not in session, the President of the Republic may issue a similar decree ; he is obliged, however, to convene the Congress by the same measure, so that it may meet within ten days to decide whether the decree shall remain in force or be revoked. If this provision is not observed or if the Congress does not meet, the Presidential decree automatically ceases to have effect.
.In the event of danger to the public peace, the Congress is empowered, by paragraph  of Article  of the Constitution, to decree a state of siege and to suspend certain guarantees of the individual, including freedom of association and of assembly, freedom of travel and individual security, with the exception, however, of the guarantees relating to normal judicial procedure (Article , paragraph  (c) ). If the Congress is not in session, the President of the Republic exercises this power (Article , paragraph ).
.The Constitution may never be suspended or revoked by any power or authority, nor by popular acclamation. It may be amended only in accordance with the provisions laid down in the Constitution itself (Article ) ; no amendment may violate the political system, which must always be civil, republican, democratic and representative (Article ).
.Any law, decree, regulation or measure contrary to the Constitution is automatically null and void (Article ).
.It appears from the analysis of the above provisions that freedom of association is guaranteed by the Constitution and that this guarantee cannot be suspended except in the cases and subject to the conditions laid down in the Constitution itself. Moreover, any legislative or administrative measure contrary to the provisions of the Constitution is automatically null and void. It would appear, therefore, that any person who considers himself wronged by any such measure can bring his case before the courts.The Labour Code
.In order to judge of the importance of the new Labour Code of  June , one may examine the provisions relating to its scope which are contained in Title I of the Code and those relating to the status of trade unions contained in Title V.Scope of the Code
.The scope of the Code is determined by the definition of the word ""worker"" in its first article. According to its provisions, ""any physical person who furnishes material or intellectual service by virtue of a contract of labour "" is a worker. By reason of this very definition, the following persons are not considered as workers and do not, consequently, come within the scope of the Code:(a) persons exercising a liberal profession, unless they devote all their time to the exclusive service of a particular person ;(b) commission agents and salesmen ;(c) commercial representatives and travellers who do not work directly and exclusively for a single person; and(d) farmers and sharecroppers.In addition, the labour relations of public officials and employees are regulated by special laws. Certain categories of workers are subject to a special rgime. Thus, according to Article , the provisions relating to trade unions do not seem to apply to home workers. According to Article , the provisions of the Code are not applicable either to agricultural undertakings or to agricultural undertakings of an industrial nature or to stock-breeding or sylvicultural undertakings, if such enterprises do not employ more than ten workers. As for the maritime transport industry, it is for the Government to determine by means of regulations to what extent the provisions of the Code are applicable to sailors. Within these limits, the trade union rgime established by the Code applies to all workers, both manual and intellectual..It cannot, however, be deduced from the restrictions concerning certain categories of workers which are not covered by the Code that the latter are not granted the right of association by virtue of ordinary law in the matter of the rights of association in general.Trade Union Rgime.Under the terms of Article  of the Code, any association of workers constituted in conformity with the Code for the purpose of studying, promoting and defending the common interests of its members is a trade union. The trade unions must be registered by the State Secretariat of Labour (Article ), failing which their actions are null and void (Article .). The request for registration must be accompanied by the rules of the trade union, the record of proceedings of the constituent assembly, and a list of the founding members. The Secretariat of Labour may, within ten days, return the documents to the persons concerned, pointing out the corrections that may need to be made. Registration may only be refused in the two following cases:(a) if the statutes do not contain the essential provisions for the normal functioning of the association,",-1,1950,Dominican Republic
4,".The Governing Body will remember that the examination of these complaints has passed through several stages.
.At its th Session (Geneva, - March ), the Governing Body considered that the case called for further examination. The Governing Body also decided that the Government of the Dominican Republic should be afforded an opportunity to discuss with the Committee on Freedom of Association the various questions raised in the complaints before the Committee formulated any further recommendations on the subject.
.At its meeting on  May , the Committee heard Mr. Franco Franco, representative of the Dominican Republic, and took note of his statement to the effect that the Government consented to the sending of an I.L.O Mission and confirmed the invitation which had been addressed to the Director-General by the Confederation of Dominican Workers.
.This statement was confirmed by a letter dated  June  from the representative of the Dominican Republic to the Chairman of the Committee. This letter was as follows:
.At its th Session (May-June ), the Governing Body approved the conclusions reached by the Committee after it had heard the representative of the Dominican Republic. These conclusions were as follows:
.The Director-General, by a letter dated  July , communicated the decisions of the Governing Body to the Government of the Dominican Republic. The text of this letter was as follows:By a telegram dated  May  you were good enough, in response to the request which I had made to you in my letter No. TUR. - of  March , to appoint His Excellency Dr. Franco Franco as representative of your Government to discuss with the Committee on Freedom of Association the points contained in the complaints alleging infringements of trade union rights in the Dominican Republic.His Excellency Dr. Franco Franco was heard by the Committee on Freedom of Association on  May . Subsequently, he wrote to the Chairman of the Committee, on  June , informing him that your Government would be most pleased to welcome an I.L.O Mission for the purpose, in response to the invitation given by the Confederation of Dominican Workers, of examining objectively the situation as to the freedom accorded to trade unions, the social protection enjoyed by the workers and the work which has been achieved in the social field during a period of  years in the Dominican Republic.At the conclusion of its examination of the case, the Committee submitted to the Governing Body the recommendations which are contained in its Fifth Report (paragraphs  to ), a copy of which is enclosed. In particular, I would draw your attention to subparagraph  of paragraph , in which the Committee recommended the Governing Body to authorise the acceptance of the invitation received from the Dominican Government. This report, to which, you will observe, is appended the whole text of the statements made to the Committee by the representative of the Government of the Dominican Republic, was approved by the Governing Body on  June , during the course of its th Session.In accordance with the decision taken by the Governing Body, I have the honour to inform you that I should be happy to accept the invitation which you have been good enough to extend to me through His Excellency Dr. Franco Franco, and, on the conditions decided by the Governing Body, to send a Mission to the Dominican Republic to study the practical application of the legal provisions concerning freedom of association in force in your country.The Governing Body asked me, in this connection, to request you to be good enough to give me an assurance that every facility will be granted to the Mission in order to enable it to fulfil its mandate, that it will be permitted to make all necessary contacts for this purpose and that, on its return, it may submit a report to the Governing Body which may be published.I have no doubt that you will be in agreement with these proposals and, when you have kindly informed me accordingly, I shall not fail to communicate with you again with reference to the composition of the Mission,and the date on which it might visit your country.I am convinced that the sending of such a Mission to the Dominican Republic cannot fail to contribute greatly to the strengthening of the ties which exist between your country and the International Labour Organisation.
.On  November , Mr. Peynado, representative of the Dominican Republic, informed the Director-General that the Government of the Dominican Republic was not disposed to receive a Mission from the I.L.O, the sending of which might have the appearance of being a consequence of the complaint now pending before the Committee on Freedom of Association. The views of the Government of the Dominican Republic were embodied in a memorandum which Mr. Peynado handed to the Director-General during the conversation, and the text of which is as follows:The Government of the Dominican Republic has entrusted its diplomatic representative in Berne with the duty of informing the International Labour Organisation, through the Director-General, of its firm point of view with regard to an untruthful accusation submitted for examination to the Committee on Freedom of Association, which has given rise to a plan to send a commission of investigation to the national territory. The salient facts in this matter are as follows:Following the presentation of a complaint made by Dominican political agitators residing abroad alleging that restrictions are placed on freedom of association in the Dominican Republic, the Director-General invited the Government of this country to send a representative to the meeting of the Committee on Freedom of Association which had been called upon to examine and give a decision on the complaint in question. In his letter of invitation to the Dominican Government, the Director-General gave the text of a recommendation made by the Committee and approved by the Governing Body to the effect that, with reference to the case concerning the Dominican Republic, the Governing Body should give the Government an opportunity to discuss with the Committee the points raised in the discussions before the Committee made any recommendations on the case to the Governing Body. The recommendation added, and this must not be forgotten, that the Committee hoped that these discussions might result in the Government concerned indicating steps which it is taking or would be prepared to take to give effect to the principle of freedom of association.Out of deference for the Organisation and being anxious to respond favourably to the invitation made by the Director-General, the Dominican Government, without delay, entrusted the duty of representing it to His Excellency the Ambassador Tulio Franco Franco, being convinced that it would be easy for him to demonstrate to the Committee the lack of basis of this slanderous complaint and its ill-concealed political design and, at the same time, to inform the Committee as to the present legal situation with regard to freedom of association in the Dominican Republic. It also appeared to be a favourable opportunity to put the Committee on its guard against the danger of finding itself becoming involved in this political manoeuvre which might create a most unfortunate precedent. The Government also intended to take advantage of this opportunity to enable it by a more direct approach to make those responsible for the direction at the highest level of the I.L.O aware of the progress achieved in the Dominican Republic with regard to the protection of the workers, thanks to the industrious and continuous activity of the Government and thanks also to the fruitful lessons drawn from close contact for many long years with the I.L.O.Contrary to all expectations and in spite of the fact that the representative of the Government was able to demonstrate to the Committee why the complaint was irreceivable, both through its own defects and through defects in the procedure followed the matter has been allowed to develop until, as will be shown subsequently, it has given rise to a serious misunderstanding which must be cleared up.The Confederation of Dominican Workers felt that it should invite the I.L.O to send to the Dominican Republic a delegation chosen by the latter in order to obtain information on the spot as to the achievements attained in various fields of labour activity and of workers' protection. Having been informed of the step taken, the Ambassador made it known to the I.L.O that such a visit, for the purpose mentioned above, would certainly have the approval of the Government which has every reason to be proud of the social work which, without ignoring the manifold problems with which it had to cope, the Government has succeeded in achieving within the space of a few years in a young country in the full tide of development and without any previous experience of social affairs. The communication made by the Dominican representative gave rise to an erroneous impression that the Government of the Dominican Republic had addressed an official invitation to the I.L.O to send a commission of investigation to study on the spot the practical",-1,1950,Dominican Republic
5,".At the end of March , the three complainants laid before the I.L.O three identical complaints relating to the violent death of Mr. Luis Negreiros, Secretary of the Peruvian Confederation of Labour. Informed of these complaints by a telegram dated  May  the Peruvian Government replied by a telegram of  June  and letter of  June of the same year. In the meantime, by a letter of  May , Mr. Delaney, in the name of the American Federation of Labor, presented a further complaint against the Peruvian Government concerning the general situation of the trade union movement in Peru. This complaint was accompanied by two memoranda prepared by the Peruvian Confederation of Labour. By a letter dated  June  the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions associated itself with the complaint.
.In accordance with the procedure then in force, the case was laid before the Officers of the Governing Body. After consideration, it was decided, with the consent of the representative of the American Federation of Labor acting in agreement with the representative of the Inter-American Confederation of Labor, to suspend the preliminary examination of the complaints in view of the favourable developments in the trade union situation in Peru, developments which appeared likely to enable the matters in dispute to be settled by negotiation. Consequently, all action in the case was temporarily suspended and the second complaint concerning the general situation of trade unionism in Peru was not communicated at that time to the Government concerned. Subsequent to the January meeting of the present Committee the Peruvian Government was requested for its observations concerning this second complaint and replied by a letter of  March .
.Having regard to these facts corroborated by a number of documents which the Government annexed to its reply, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to:(a) take note of the formal assurances given by the Government with regard to its trade union policy and of the action taken with a view to the restoration of freedom of association ;(b) express its hope that the Government may envisage the possibility of ratifying the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (Convention No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (Convention No. ) ;(c) suggest that the Government may think it appropriate to re-examine its existing legislation in order to ascertain whether certain modifications of it might not be desirable in order to bring it completely into harmony with the principle of freedom of association embodied ;(d) decide that in all the circumstances of the case it would not be profitable for the Governing Body to pursue the matter further.",-1,1950,Peru

Employers' associations may be formed by employers who pursue the same or similar activities.Article  of the ConventionThis Article deals with the right which workers and employers should have to draw up their Constitutions and rules in full freedom without any interference.The guarantee prescribed by this Article of the Convention is ensured by articles  and  of our Code:Article . Industrial associations may prescribe in their rules further conditions in addition to those prescribed by the law for the admission of members.Article . All industrial associations shall be completely free to establish in their rules the manner of dismissing members. All decisions taken in this respect by the organs and officials of the association in conformity with its rules shall be final and shall not be subject to any appeal.Article  of the ConventionThis Article prohibits the dissolution or suspension of workers' and employers' organisations by administrative authority. The same principle is embodied in our legislation by articles  and  of the Code:Article . The rules may establish special grounds for the dissolution of the association.Where the rules do not contain any provisions for dissolution, the general meeting may decide on dissolution.Article . The registration of the association may be cancelled by a decision of the courts if the association pursues activities not connected with its lawful objectives.Cancellation of registration shall automatically entail dissolution of the association.It is evident from these two articles that our legislation provides for only two methods of dissolution or suspension of workers' and employers' organisations, namely : dissolution by agreement and dissolution or suspension by the courts. In other words, there can be no dissolution or suspension by the administrative authority.Article  of the ConventionThis Article establishes the right of workers' and employers' organisations to establish federations and Confederations. The same right is embodied in article  of our Code, which provides that:Article . Industrial associations shall be permitted to form communal, provincial, regional or national federations.Such federations shall be permitted in their turn to form Confederations on the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the members at a general meeting.Article  of the ConventionThis Article provides that the provisions of Articles ,  and  apply to federations and Confederations of workers' and employers' organisations. This provision is in fact applied by articles  (in fine) and  of the Code:Article . The provisions applying to industrial associations in general shall also apply to all federations and Confederations.Article . All federations and Confederations of industrial associations shall be subject to the rules respecting registration prescribed for industrial associations by this Code.Article  of the ConventionThis Article, which deals with the legal personality of workers' and employers' associations, is applied by virtue of article  of the Code:Article . All industrial associations shall by virtue of registration with the Secretariat of State for Labour acquire legal personality.Consequently, they shall have the right to sue and be sued, to acquire without administrative authorisation, either by gift or against payment, personal or real property and shall in general be entitled to perform any legal act or business having for its object the attainment of the objectives of the association.Article  of the ConventionThis Article establishes the principle that workers and employers and their respective organisations shall respect the law of the land. The same principle is affirmed by article  of the Code, which provides:Article . No industrial association shall directly or indirectly restrict the freedom to work or take any steps to compel any employee or employer to be a member of the association or to remain therein.Article  of the ConventionThe application of the guarantees provided for in Convention No.  to the armed forces and the police appears to be incompatible with the neutrality, impartiality and security which should characterise these institutions with respect to social and political matters.Article  of the ConventionThis Article, which defines the meaning of the term "" organisation "" in the Convention, corresponds to article  of our Code:Article . An "" industrial association "" shall mean any association of employees or employers constituted in accordance with this Code for the purpose of the study, advancement and protection of the common interests of its members.With respect to collective labour agreements, the Trujillo Code contains complete and detailed regulations in its articles  to .

.(a) As is apparent from the foregoing, the national legislation was amended during  in order to give effect to all the provisions of Convention No. , which, up to the present, has not been ratified by our country. This amendment of the earlier legislation, with a view to giving effect to Convention No. , is precisely the amendment made by the Trujillo Labour Code, which came into force on  October .(b) The ratification of Convention No.  presents no difficulty for our country which could prevent or delay such ratification. On the contrary, as indicated above, the Convention has already been put into application through our national legislation.(c) The reply to this question is apparent from the foregoing survey.
.Reports concerning the application of Convention No.  are always communicated to the Federation of Dominican Workers and to the Employers' Confederation of the Dominican Republic.
.The Committee, having noted the memorandum presented by Mr. Peynado, and having noted also a communication from the Director-General giving the date on which six separate despatches of copies of the Spanish version of the text of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, , were made to the Government of the Dominican Republic, and having noted, further, the report presented by the Dominican Government concerning the position under its national legislation and practice with regard to the matters dealt with in the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, , has reached the following conclusions.
.The Committee deplores that the Government of the Dominican Republic has refused to give its consent to the sending of a Mission under the conditions stipulated by the Governing Body at its th Session (May-June ), whereas it appeared evident from the letter sent by its representative on  June  to the Chairman of the Committee that the Government not only endorsed the invitation issued to the I.L.O by the Confederation of Dominican Workers but had also expressed its own willingness to receive the Mission. The Committee expresses its regret that the Government of the Dominican Republic has considered it necessary to retract the statement made by its representative to the Committee on Freedom of Association to the effect that it would be prepared to receive a Mission to study the practical application of the legal provisions in force with respect to the right to organise.
.The Committee notes that the provisions in the Constitution and in the Labour Code of the Dominican Republic at present in force with respect to the right of association and other fundamental liberties appear to be satisfactory. At the same time, the Committee wishes to emphasise the importance that it attaches to the fact that workers and employers should in actual practice be able to form and join organisations of their own choosing in full freedom.
.The Committee notes the formal assurance given by the Government of the Dominican Republic that workers' organisations may not be suspended or dissolved by administrative action. It also notes that the provisions in the Labour Code at present in force with respect to the suspension and dissolution of trade union organisations offer to those concerned all the guarantees afforded by normal judicial procedure. The Committee nevertheless wishes to emphasise the importance it attaches to the fact that these provisions should be fully applied.
.The Committee notes the assurance given by the Government of the Dominican Republic that there is nothing to prevent the Confederation of Dominican Workers from affiliating with an international organisation of workers. Here again, the Committee wishes to emphasise the importance that it attaches to the fact that no obstacle should be placed in the way of the affiliation of workers' organisations in the Dominican Republic, in full freedom, with any international organisation of workers of their own choosing.
.The Committee notes the assurance given by the Government of the Dominican Republic that it will take steps without delay with a view to ratifying the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, , and expresses the hope that the Government will be able to give effect rapidly to this intention in order thus to ensure to the workers the permanent guarantee of the free exercise of trade union rights.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that",-1,1950,Dominican Republic
7,"the foregoing observations should be communicated to the Government of the Dominican Republic.
.The Governing Body will remember that, at its th Session (Geneva, - March ), it took the view that the case concerning the Dominican Republic called for further examination (of. First Report of the Committee on Freedom of Association, paragraphs  to , and Third Report of the Committee, paragraph ). The Governing Body further decided that the Government of the Dominican Republic should be afforded an opportunity to discuss with the Committee on Freedom of Association the questions at issue before the Committee submitted further recommendations on the subject to the Governing Body (of. First Report of the Committee, paragraph ).
.By a letter dated  March , the Director-General informed the Government of the Dominican Republic of the Governing Body's decision and requested the Government to be good enough to appoint a representative who might be heard by the Committee at its third session.
.By a telegram dated  May , the Government of the Dominican Republic accredited His Excellency, Mr. Franco Franco, Ambassador of the Dominican Republic in Paris, as its representative to the Committee on Freedom of Association.
.The representative of the Government of the Dominican Republic made his statement to the Committee at its meeting on  May . The text of this statement is appended to the present document.
.The Committee, having taken note of the statement of the representative of the Dominican Republic, and having heard his oral explanations, came to the following conclusions concerning the various points at issue.Receivability of the Complaint
.The Government of the Dominican Republic in the first place contested the receivability of the complaint, both in its letter of  January  to the Director-General and through its representative to the Committee on Freedom of Association.
.In support of its contention the Government of the Dominican Republic puts forward the following arguments in particular:(a) the Dominican persons in exile are not qualified to present the complaint because they are not representatives of trade unions but political agitators who have been convicted of crimes or offences under ordinary law. As concerns two of the signatories to the complaint, the Government maintains that they have never exercised trade union functions but that they were members of proscribed political parties and had been convicted of crimes against the security of the State. As for the two other signatories to the complaint, the Government, while admitting that they were at one time trade union leaders, claims that they were relieved of their functions by their own constituents and, consequent upon abuses of their functions committed to the detriment of the members of the trade unions of which they were leaders, were sentenced for these abuses by the courts of ordinary law.(b) if-continues the Government of the Dominican Republic-the original complaint thus has a fundamental defect, the same is necessarily true of the complaint transmitted by the Inter-American Confederation of Workers (today the Inter-American Regional Organisation). The representative of the Government of the Dominican Republic admitted, however, that the question might take on a different aspect if the Inter-American Confederation of Workers had taken the complaint upon itself.
.The Governing Body decision establishing the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission deals in the following terms with the question of receivability of complaints:The only complaints receivable, with the exception of those officially transmitted to the I.L.O by the General Assembly of the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations, are those which come either from organisations of workers or employers or from Governments.
.The Committee on Freedom of Association, at its first session, and in the terms which will be recalled below, formulated its views on the question of receivability of complaints, which views the Governing Body made its own in adopting the First Report of the Committee on Freedom of Association
....Questions sometimes arise as to whether a particular complaint is to be regarded as having been made by an organisation of workers or employers. More particularly, it is sometimes suggested that persons purporting to act on behalf of such an organisation are not entitled to do so because the organisation has been dissolved or because the individuals lodging the complaint have ceased to be resident in the country concerned. The Committee considers that it would be altogether inconsistent with the purpose for which the procedure for the examination of allegations concerning the infringement of trade union rights has been established for it to admit that the dissolution or purported dissolution of an organisation by governmental action extinguishes the right of the organisation to invoke the procedure.
.Difficult questions may arise in such cases concerning the exact authority and knowledge of the facts of the persons claiming to act on behalf of the organisation concerned and the reliability of the testimony of persons no longer resident in the country concerned. The Committee will be prepared to consider such questions on their merits as necessary, but it will not regard any complaint as being irreceivable simply because the Government in question has dissolved or purported to dissolve the organisation on behalf of which the complaint is made, or because the person or persons making the complaint have taken refuge outside the country concerned. In taking this view it has been influenced by the conclusions unanimously approved by the Governing Body in  in the Labour Party of the Island of Mauritius Case when considering a representation under Article  of the Constitution of the Organisation (then Article ). In the Mauritius Case the Governing Body laid down the principle that it would exercise its discretion in deciding whether or not a body is to be regarded as an industrial association for the purpose of the Constitution of the Organisation and will not consider itself bound by any national definition of the term ""industrial association"". The Committee proposes to follow the same principles when considering the receivability of complaints which come before it.
.With respect more particularly to the case of the Dominican Republic, the Committee, having noted that the complaint was presented not only by the four Dominican persons, but also by the President of the Inter-American Confederation of Workers in the latter's name, reached the conclusion at its first session that, for this reason, the complaint was receivable, whether the objections raised against the qualifications of the Dominican persons in exile signatories to the complaint were justified or not.
.After careful examination of the new arguments presented by the representative of the Dominican Republic, the Committee maintained its previous decision for the reason that the Inter-American Confederation of Workers had not restricted itself to pure and simple transmission of the complaints of the four Dominican persons in exile, but had formally taken the matter over.
.In his letter of  October  to the Director-General, Mr. Bernardo Ibez did, in fact, state that:in his capacity of President of the Inter-American Confederation of Workers and Member of the Governing Body of the I.L.O, he wished to add his own request to the Governing Body of the I.L.O to study the above-mentioned request at its earliest opportunity and to submit it to the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Committee on Freedom of Association.
.Since the Inter-American Confederation of Workers (now succeeded by the Inter-American Regional Organisation) is clearly a workers' organisation within the meaning of the Governing Body decision establishing the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission, the Committee recommends to the Governing Body that it decide that the complaint is, for this reason, receivable, whatever the validity of the objections raised against the authors of the first complaint.Alleged Political Nature of the Complaint
.The Government of the Dominican Republic maintained, in the second place, that the complaint was purely political in nature, since the complainants were ""politicians in exile"" whose ""attitude has always been to stir up revolt within and without the Dominican territory "". The representative of the Government of the Dominican Republic specified that at least two of the signatories had been convicted of having taken part in the so-called Cayo Confites naval and military expedition of .
.For their part, the complainants have alleged-without, however, presenting any shadow of proof in support of their assertion-that one of the signatories to the complaint, residing in Cuba, had been kidnapped and probably murdered ""by the Dominican Government in order to deprive the working class of its principal leader and the Dominican people of one of its most active champions of democracy"".
.The Committee considered that these two sets of data were not within the competence of the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission on Freedom of Association and that it was not called upon to examine their merits.Allegations concerning the Suppression of the Free Trade Union Movement
.These allegations bear both on the legal status and on the factual situation of the Trade Unions.
.It will be recalled that the complainants alleged the following facts in particular:(a) The General Confederation of Dominican Workers was forcibly suppressed in . A demonstration protesting this measure was dispersed by the police, and several persons were killed on this occasion.(b) Certain trade unions were able to reconstitute themselves subsequently, but were",-1,1950,Dominican Republic
8,".At its meeting in January , the Committee had before it two complaints against the Venezuelan Government presented respectively by the American Federation of Labor, in May , and by the Venezuelan Workers' Confederation, in June , and observations relating to these complaints forwarded by the Government of Venezuela in a letter dated  February . The Committee then concluded that the case called for further examination by the Governing Body.
.At its meeting in March , the Committee, having been informed of the desire of the Government of Venezuela to submit further observations to it, recommended the Governing Body to postpone examination of the case in order to enable the Venezuelan Government to communicate its further observations to the Committee.
.When the Committee's two reports came before it, the Governing Body, at its th Session (Geneva, - March ) decided to postpone the examination of the case. By a letter dated  March , the Director-General informed the Government of Venezuela of this decision.
.In reply to this letter, the Director-General received two letters dated  May  from the Government of Venezuela transmitting the further observations to which it had referred.
.The Committee, at its meeting on  June , heard a statement by the representatives of the Government of Venezuela who received the observations of their Government and supplemented them with respect to certain points.
.The Director-General has received a further complaint against the Government of Venezuela, dated  April , from the Secretary-General of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (I.C.F.T.U.). Moreover, the complaints transmitted to the I.L.O by the Economic and Social Council at its th Session (New York, May ) also include a number of complaints against the Government of Venezuela.
.The Committee, at its meeting on  June , adjourned therefore its examination of the case in order to enable the Government of Venezuela to present its observations on the new complaints. These observations were transmitted to the Director-General by letter of  November . The Government of Venezuela also communicated to the Committee, by letter of  November , the summary of a speech delivered by the President of the Governing Committee (Junta de Gobierno) of Venezuela on the eve of the parliamentary elections of  November .
.The Committee, at its meeting in December , having taken note of the various communications submitted to it, requested the Government to transmit to it a statement on the trade union situation in general in Venezuela on the morrow of the parliamentary elections of  November .This decision was communicated to the Government by letter of  January . The Government transmitted to the Director-General, by letter of  February , a statement on the present position of Venezuelan trade unions.
.As the complaints presented by the American Federation of Labor and by the Venezuelan Workers' Confederation, as well as the Government's first replies, are already contained in the earlier reports of the Committee, it will be sufficient to analyse in this report the new complaints, the observations of the Government, dated  May , and made at the meeting of the Committee on  June , as well as the Government's replies of  and  November  and the letter, dated  February  on the present situation of Venezuelan trade unions.
.The complaint which the I.C.F.T.U addressed to the Director-General by a letter dated  April  tends to confirm and supplement a similar complaint addressed to the United Nations and transmitted to the I.L.O by the Economic and Social Council together with a number of other complaints presented against the Venezuelan Government by various trade union organisations.
.Associating itself with the complaints submitted earlier by the American Federation of Labor and by the Venezuelan Workers' Confederation, the I.C.F.T.U recalls, in particular, that several central organisations of workers were dissolved in  and that all the oilworkers' unions suffered the same fate in . The I.C.F.T.U and also the other complainants allege, further, that many trade union leaders have been detained for several months, and some of them even for several years. In certain cases, it is claimed, the prisoners have been ill-treated by the police.
.In conclusion, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to express the hope that the discussions on the measures necessary to secure a fuller application of the principles of freedom of association which have been taking place between the Venezuelan Government and the national and international trade union organisations concerned, will be continued, and, in this connection, to decide to draw the attention of the Government of Venezuela to the desirability of:(i) taking appropriate measures to ensure to employers and workers full freedom to form, within the limits of the law, organisations of their own choosing and to join such organisations ;(ii) re-examining the cases of trade union leaders who are stated still to be in custody under the provisions of emergency legislation, in order to ensure that no person shall, without having had the benefit of the guarantees afforded by normal judicial procedure, be deprived of his freedom because of his membership of a trade union or of his lawful trade union activities ;(iii) re-examining the legal provisions at present in force with respect to employers' and workers' organisations in order to bring them into harmony with the principles laid down in the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, , and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, , and, in particular, the provisions relating to the cancellation of the registration of trade unions and to the dissolution of trade unions by administrative authority.
.With regard to the allegations relating to the general situation of the trade union movement in Venezuela, the Governing Body has at its disposal the report of the I.L.O. Mission to Venezuela and the observations of the Government of Venezuela on the same report. The data necessary for appreciating the position are therefore available.
.The dissolution of the petroleum workers' unions, to which the second part of the complaint relates, took place after the events dealt with in the above documents and have therefore not been the subject of any similar examination. The versions given by the Government and by the complainants differ considerably with regard to the circumstances under which the events took place which gave rise to the dissolution of the petroleum workers' unions, but they are in agreement as to the dissolution having actually taken place. It is quite clear from the text of the dissolution Decree attached to the complaint that the measure was taken by the administrative authorities without the case first having been submitted to the competent courts.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends that the case merits further examination by the Governing Body.",-1,1950,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
9,"application in the country of the legal provisions respecting freedom of association and that the invitation had been issued as a consequence of the decisions taken by the Committee with respect to the complaint referred to above. In these circumstances, it is necessary to clarify the situation as follows:(a) It is with the keenest regret that the Government of the Dominican Republic finds it necessary to state that at no time has it addressed any invitation either to the Committee on Freedom of Association or to any other I.L.O body to send such a commission to its territory.(b) Whatever may be the decision adopted or to be adopted by the Committee on Freedom of Association with regard to the despatch of such a Mission or of a Mission in consequence of the complaint already referred to, it cannot in any way be binding upon the Government of the Dominican Republic as this country has not ratified Convention No.  concerning freedom of association. Consequently, the Dominican Government is not bound to accept any of the obligations which may result from ratification of international instruments dealing with this question.(c) The Dominican Republic wishes to emphasise once again that the sending of a representative to the meeting of the Committee must be regarded as a mark of courtesy to the Organisation and to its Director-General ; it does not mean in any way that it intends to encourage the malevolent actions of persons moved and blinded by political passion.The Government did its duty by giving information as to the present situation and with regard to its legislation respecting freedom of association. Likewise, it in no way failed to give the necessary assurances. In these circumstances, it had a right to hope that more credibility would be attached to the statements made by its delegate than to untruthful allegations made by persons whose earlier activities, being illegal, have been punished according to the law.(d) In the opinion of the Government of the Dominican Republic, the decisions adopted by the Committee on Freedom of Association in the present case and also the procedure which has been followed in order to reach these decisions are vitiated because they are null and void. In this connection it must be emphasised yet again that Convention No. , which may form the basis for the procedure which has been instituted, has not been ratified by the Dominican Republic and, consequently, cannot validly be applied to the present case. Furthermore, it may be useful to point out that one of the reasons for non-ratification of the said Convention is the fact that the certified Spanish copy requested from the I.L.O by the Government has not yet been received, with the result that its consideration by the competent authorities and any decisions which might be made with respect to the Convention have been delayed.(e) The attitude of the Dominican Government has been and will be that it will not interfere in any way in connection with the visit of any I.L.O commission organised as a consequence of and in the spirit of the initiative taken privately by the Confederation of Dominican Workers ; but the Government will never allow any commission to come to make investigations in its territory in connection with a complaint emanating from offenders who have been judged guilty of acts which endangered internal peace and the external security of the Republic and is even less disposed to allow it when, in order that such a visit may be made, the request for guarantees addressed to the Government is not free from prejudices and vexatious reservations which the Government of the Dominican Republic regards as inadmissible.(f) From the beginning, the Dominican Government considered, and its point of view has not changed, that the matter had been brought before the I.L.O under such irregular circumstances that, once this was explained, the rejection of the complaint and the suspension of the procedure would necessarily follow. But, even if the matter was not to develop as expected, the Government knew that it could go beyond the recommendation of the Committee by stating what it had already accomplished and not what it intended to do to ensure freedom of association according to the request made to it. The Dominican Government is astonished, moreover, by the fact that the I.L.O has already announced, without strict adherence to the true facts, that a commission of investigation, that is to say, a commission of an entirely different character from that proposed by the Confederation of Dominican Workers, would visit the country; this announcement was made even before the I.L.O had received the Government's reply to the request addressed to it by the I.L.O for its authorisation with respect to the publication of the information which the said commission might assemble. It is on the basis of these facts that the Government feels that it can only note with the deepest regret the lack of impartiality and responsibility with which this affair has been pursued against a Member which has never failed to demonstrate its adherence and fidelity to the International Labour Organisation.(g) The Dominican Government is happy to reiterate the formal and absolute assurance given to the I.L.O that, in the Dominican Republic, both under the Constitution and under the Trujillo Labour Code, the principles governing the application of which in the field of activities regulated by it are based on the Constitution, freedom of association exists, is exercised and is respected as it deserves. The Government is firmly convinced that this assurance in itself will be sufficient to provide a criterion on the basis of which the I.L.O can judge this case and, consequently, will be led to the conclusion that it must reject the unjust and baseless accusation on which it is founded.(h) In view on the foregoing considerations, the Dominican Government, having confidence in the spirit of justice and high understanding of the directive organs of the I.L.O, evidence of which other Members in similar circumstances had had the satisfaction of observing, repeats its demand that the complaint which forms the basis of this complaint, and the nature and objects of which are known to everyone, should be rejected.Geneva,  November .
.A further communication was subsequently received from the Dominican Government in the form of a report on Dominican legislation and practice concerning the questions dealt with in the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, , presented by the Dominican Government on  January  in accordance with Article  of the I.L.O Constitution. The text of this report is as follows:
.Under the rgime instituted by the Constitution of the Republic, which guarantees freedom of association as one of the inherent rights of man, industrial associations both of workers and of employers have developed in our country in complete freedom and in harmony with the essentially democratic character of our Government.Promulgated on  October , the Trujillo Labour Code, the crowning development in our labour legislation, lays down in its Fifth Book complete and uniform legal rules determining the organisation and operation of industrial association, in full conformity with the provisions of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention (No. ), this Convention, while it has not yet been ratified by our Government, is in fact applied in full under our legislation, having regard to the economic and social characteristics of our people.It should be pointed out that the procedure for ratifying this Convention has been initiated in anticipation of the receipt of the authentic Spanish text requested by our Government from the International Labour Office.The articles of the Trujillo Labour Code which are related to the provisions of the unratified Convention No.  and the measures adopted by our Government to improve the social conditions of the workers and the protection accorded by the Government to all registered industrial associations have created in our country an atmosphere which is favourable to the development of trade union activities in general.
.A brief analysis is given below of the provisions in the Labour Code which give effect to the provisions of the unratified Convention No. .The Code, while it is adapted to the characteristics of the Dominican people, is inspired by the universal principles enunciated by the International Labour Organisation. It includes a series of provisions which give full effect to Convention No.  concerning freedom of association, although that Convention has not yet been ratified by our country.As an example we analyse below the articles in the Trujillo Labour Code which are related to the Articles of the unratified Convention No. :Article  of the ConventionThis Article in the Convention embodies the principle that workers should freely constitute their organisations, subject only to the condition that the members shall conform to the rules of those organisations. This same principle is formulated in our legislation by articles  and  of the Trujillo Labour Code:Article . Industrial unions may be formed by persons who habitually follow the same occupation or business, or an",-1,1950,Dominican Republic
10,".In regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to decide that the complainants have not presented sufficient evidence to justify reference of the matter to the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission ;(b) to suggest that the Chilean Government may wish to re-examine certain Articles of the Law for the Permanent Defence of Democracy, in particular Articles  and , with a view to determining whether any modifications of them are desirable in the light of the provisions of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, , and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, .",-1,1951,Chile
11,".In a first communication, dated  February , addressed to the United Nations, the complainants made the following allegations:(a) By virtue of Decree No.  of May , the Brazilian Confederation of Labour was declared to be illegal, although it represented a majority of the trade unions,(b) Trade union elections were banned in . When it arranged for trade union elections in , the Government, in violation of Constitutional provisions, required candidates to make a sworn declaration as to their "" ideology "", the object being to prevent persons being candidates if they had participated in strikes or had presented demands to claims commissions or had ever been arrested on the ground of their union or political activities.(c) By Decree No.  of , strikes are declared to be anti-social acts and strikers are liable to be prosecuted.(d) During the year , there were certain occurrences in various Brazilian States which constituted specific violations of trade union rights, as, for example, the removal from office of several trade union leaders, the imprisonment of a number of other leaders, the searching of trade union premises, the suspension of the operations of a public employees' association, etc.(e) By virtue of the legislation in force in Brazil (Labour Law of  May ), workers are prohibited from promoting an independent trade union movement ; the existing unions are governmental organisations. The Ministry of Labour exercises control over the drafting of their Constitutions, their internal functioning and their financial administration. In particular, the Ministry collects a trade union tax to support the official unions.
.By a cable dated  March , also addressed to the United Nations, the World Federation of Trade Unions presented a second complaint protesting against a violation of trade union rights alleged to have been committed in connection with an aviation workers' strike.
.The Brazilian Government has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention (No. ) but not the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention (No ).Allegation concerning the Dissolution of the Brazilian Confederation of Labour
.The complainants allege that the Brazilian Confederation of Labour was declared illegal although it represented a majority of the trade unions. In its reply dated  December , the Brazilian Government maintains that this Confederation never represented a majority of the trade unions. In its communication dated  May , the Government gives details concerning the circumstances under which the Brazilian Confederation of Labour was dissolved and annexes thereto a copy of a decision of the Federal Supreme Court dated  October  and a copy of the judgment of the ordinary court which, on  January , pronounced the dissolution of that organisation.
.It appears from this documentation that the dissolution procedure passed through two successive phases.
.First, on the same day as that on which the Communist Party was declared illegal and, accordingly, dissolved, the Government, emphasising the close ties between the Party and the Brazilian Confederation of Labour, suspended the latter for a period of six months (Decree No. , D.O. No. ,  May , p. ).
.In taking this step the Government based its action on Legislative Decree No.  of  March  governing the registration of common law associations. In fact, the Brazilian Confederation of Labour never was an approved "" Confederation "" within the meaning of the Labour Law. It had simply been entered as a civil law society in the register of corporations. By virtue of the Legislative Decree of , the Government is authorised to suspend for a period not exceeding six months any association that pursues activities which are unlawful or contrary to the security of the State or to the public and social order. The actual dissolution of such an association, however, is a matter which falls within the competence of the courts, to which an application therefor must be made by the Attorney-General.
.The order for suspension was based essentially on the two following grounds. First, the Confederation was composed of organisations and delegations which were not registered in accordance with the requirements of the Labour Law. Contrary to the legal provisions, the Confederation thus carried out activities in defence of occupational interests which are reserved exclusively to approved trade union organisations. Secondly, in addition to this unlawful activity, the Confederation engaged in political action which is prohibited even in the case of approved trade union organisations.
.Hence, the Government suspended the Brazilian Confederation of Labour for a period of six months. At the same time, it instructed the Attorney-General's Office to make application to the competent court for the dissolution of the organisation.
.In the second phase, the dissolution procedure was initiated by the Attorney-General in the competent ordinary court.
.During these proceedings, the Confederation contested the legality of the suspension measure taken by the Government and, at the same time, demanded that the case should be referred to the Federal Supreme Court with a view to obtaining a "" security guarantee "" declaring the Government's decision to be contrary to the Constitution. By a judgment dated  October  the Supreme Court rejected this application. A majority of the judges considered, in fact, that the suspension measure was perfectly lawful. In their view, the Constitution, while guaranteeing freedom of association, leaves it to the legislature to determine the form under which trade union organisations may be established and function. The Confederation, not having complied with the formalities required by this Law, was therefore not legally constituted and so could not claim the right to be protected against a measure suspending it.
.But a minority of the judges considered that the Constitution authorises no restriction of freedom of association, that the case in question was not one of formal regulation and, consequently, that the guarantee order should be granted to the applicant.
.This point having been settled, the Court, by a decision dated  July , declared the dissolution of the Brazilian Confederation of Labour.
.It appears from the text of the judgment which the Government annexes to its reply that the Court based its decision essentially on the following grounds. First, the Brazilian Confederation of Labour did not obtain the approval required by the Labour Law-a law which has not been abrogated by Article  of the Constitution. Secondly, the Brazilian Confederation of Labour, having as its principal object the propagation of doctrines incompatible with the Constitutional institutions of Brazil and the carrying on of activities of a political nature, did not fulfil the required conditions to enable it to be approved under the provisions of the Labour Law. Thirdly, the Communist Party having been prohibited, the Confederation also became illegal.
.It appears from the explanation given by the Government that the suspension of the Brazilian Confederation of Labour by administrative action constituted only the first step in the judicial dissolution procedure. The Government emphasises that this procedure offers all the guarantees of law to those concerned.
.Considering that it is a generally accepted principle that the suspension or dissolution of an employers' or workers' organisation should be pronounced only by the courts, the Committee, while observing that dissolution was pronounced ultimately by the competent court in the present case, recommends the Governing Body to draw the Government's attention to the fact that, where suspension measures are issued by administrative authority, there may be a danger that they will appear to be arbitrary, even though they are issued only temporarily or for a limited time and as a preliminary to subsequent court action.Allegations concerning Trade Union Elections
.The complainants allege that trade union elections were prohibited in  and that, when they were authorised in , the Government forced the candidates to make a declaration of political loyalty. In its reply dated  December , the Government makes no allusion to the prohibition of trade union elections in  but states that the declaration as to political loyalty prescribed by Article  of the Labour Law has no longer been required since the entry into force of an Order of  April , a copy of which is annexed to its reply.
.It appears from the explanations given by the Government that applying Article  of the Labour Law, the Government, in its "" instructions "" for the  elections, did actually ask the candidates for a trade union executive post for a certificate delivered by the police affirming that they did not profess ideologies incompatible with the institutions or interests of the nation. But the Government adds that, by virtue of the Order of  April , such certificates are no longer required. Henceforth, candidates for elective posts simply have to declare that they are not ineligible for any of the reasons contained in the law.
.It would seem from the details given by the Government that the twofold allegation of the complainants (the prohibition of union elections in  and the obligation to present a certificate of political loyalty) has become purposeless since the coming into force of the Order of  April . Consequently, the Committee feels that it is not called upon to express any view",-1,1951,Brazil
12,"of the workers "", the Government "" has not only guaranteed them the freedom to strive in full dignity to defend their interests, but has taken the initiative by defending them in their trade union activities and granting them corresponding rights "". The Government also calls attention to the fact that the trade union movement has considerably developed since the promulgation of the Labour Law "" The trade union movement "", it declares, "" participating in the considerable development resulting from economic progress and the exploitation of the country's wealth, will create within two decades a society in which workers will play an important part...... ""
.There has been occasion to observe in several instances that the trade union legislation which seems originally to have been conceived as a part of a rgime of corporations-a rgime now abandoned-has been the subject in the last few years of important amendments which have rendered appreciably more flexible the previous rigid wording of many provisions.
.Moreover, certain other provisions which still subsist in the Labour Law and which, read literally, might be interpreted as placing restrictions on freedom of association, now seem in practice to have fallen into disuse.
.Finally, the Constitutional guarantee of freedom of association cannot fail to exercise a very great influence on future developments in trade union legislation.
.In these circumstances, the Committee considers that the complainants have not furnished sufficient proof to support the allegation that the legislation in force prevents the development of an independent trade union movement.
.In conclusion, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note with satisfaction the Brazilian Government's ratification of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, , and to draw the attention of the Government in particular to Articles  and  of that Convention, which prohibit any anti-union discrimination in respect of employment and provide for the full utilisation of machinery for negotiation ;(b) to suggest to the Government that it should examine, in the light of the principles laid down in the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, , and with a view to considering the possibility of ratifying that Convention, its existing trade union legislation, especially with regard to:(i) the distinction now drawn between associations which are simply registered and unions which are approved ;(ii) the affiliation of employers' and workers' organisations with international organisations of employers and workers; and(iii) certain other provisions concerning, especially, the objects of trade unions, their financial administration, and trade union federations and Confederations;(c) to decide that, subject to the observations contained in paragraphs ,  and  above, the case as a whole does not call for further examination.",-1,1951,Brazil
13,"accumulating and managing the property of the association and the purpose for which such property is to be used if the association is wound up ;(f) the conditions for the winding up of the association.
.These provisions relate to matters which are generally regulated by all trade union rules, with the sole object, it would appear, of ensuring the normal functioning of the organisation.
.It should be added, however, that by a decision of  August  (Diario Oficial of  August ) the Ministry of Labour published a model set of rules ; but it is perfectly clear from the introductory paragraph of this decision that, yielding to the repeated requests of the parties concerned, the Minister confines himself to recommending the adoption, mutatis mutandis, of the model text. The provisions of this Ministerial Order, therefore, are in no way compulsorily binding.
.The Committee considers therefore that the complainants have furnished sufficient proof in support of the allegation that trade unions cannot draw up their own rules.Provisions concerning Internal Trade Union Organisation
.The complainants allege that the Ministry of Labour exercises strict control over internal trade union affairs ; that it may prohibit meetings and intervene in connection with the placing of items on the agenda. The Law contains no special provisions on this point but Article  contains the following general rule:Persons who are not members of an industrial association shall not take part in any manner whatsoever in the management or services of the association.This prohibition shall not apply to the following persons:(a) delegates of the Ministry of Labour, Industry and Commerce specially appointed by the Minister or his representative.....The Brazilian Government, in its reply, states that no control is exercised over internal trade union affairs.
.The Brazilian Government, in its reply, states that no control is exercised over internal trade union affairs.
.The statement certainly, does not show that the above-mentioned provision in the Law has been repealed, but it would appear that in practice the provision has lapsed. Therefore, in the absence of any details furnished by the complainants, the Committee considers that sufficient proof has not been offered to support the allegation that the Government intervenes in the internal affairs of trade unions to the prejudice of their rights.Provisions concerning Trade Union Finances
.Assets. The complainants allege that the Government exercises control over trade union finances and collects an annual tax to support the official unions.
.Under the Labour Law, trade union assets consist mainly in the following : contributions of the members as fixed by the rules and contributions payable by workers belonging to the economic or occupational category represented by the union "" under the heading of industrial association tax "" (Article ).
.Regulations concerning this industrial association tax form the subject of Chapter III of Part V of the Labour Code. The principal provisions may be summarised as follows.
.The industrial association tax is levied in favour of the approved unions. Associations which are registered but not approved do not benefit from it. It is payable by all workers, whether union members or not. It is paid annually as a single lump sum and, in the case of employees, consists of an amount equal to one day's remuneration (Article  (a)) deducted from their pay by the employer (Article ) and deposited in the Bank of Brazil (Article ).
.The Bank of Brazil must open a special account for each of the approved trade union organisations and forward annually to the National Labour Department an extract from the accounts. Each organisation may withdraw funds by cheques signed by its treasurer and countersigned by its president (Article ).
.A deduction of  per cent for the benefit of the approved federations and Confederations is made annually from the amount collected by way of industrial association tax,  per cent being allotted to the federation and  per cent to the Confederation concerned. A further  per cent is transferred to the ""Industrial Associations Social Fund"" (Articles -), which is administered by a joint committee and utilised for purposes calculated to promote the general interests of the national industrial association system (Articles -).
.The remainder of the industrial association tax must be utilised by the approved trade unions for purposes defined by the Law, such as the maintenance of employment agencies, social assistance, vocational training, etc. Within these limits, the utilisation of the tax is left to the discretion of each trade union, which will always have to consider the particular interests of the category of workers it represents.
.Financial administration. The property and income of industrial associations must not be utilised otherwise than in the manner prescribed by the Law and by the rules. Their securities and real property must not be transferred except with the authorisation of the Minister of Labour (Article ). The annual estimates of receipts and expenditure must be approved by the Minister. The accounts must be approved by the competent organs of the Ministry. A report on the preceding financial year must be furnished each year to the Ministry (Articles -). Contraventions render those guilty thereof liable not only to the administrative or penal sanctions prescribed in this connection by the Labour Law (Article ) but also to special fines, if they relate to the industrial association tax, or to imprisonment, in the event of embezzlement or misappropriation, which are regarded as crimes against the wealth of the nation (Article ).
.It appears from these various provisions that the approved unions not only derive their financial resources from members' contributions but also benefit, as legal representatives of all the workers, by a special tax levied by the State. Although the utilisation of moneys derived from this tax is limited to purposes laid down in the Law, it nevertheless appears that unions remain free to use the revenues accruing from voluntary contributions in accordance with their own rules. However, analysis of the Law reveals that the Government exercises some degree of control not only over a union's utilisation of money derived from the industrial association tax but also over union financial administration as a whole.Provisions concerning Trade Union Federations and Confederations
.By Article  of the Labour Law, the expressions "" federation "" and "" Confederation "" are to be used exclusively by groupings of approved unions ; they are "" industrial organisations of higher rank "". Federations require the approval of the Minister of Labour, and Confederations that of the President of the Republic (Article ). If the President of the Republic considers it advisable in the interests of the organisation of industrial associations, he may order the Constitution of federations or Confederations (Article ). Federations are formed for the different States constituting the Republic. The Minister of Labour, however, may also authorise inter-State or national federations ; by way of exception, regional or municipal organisations are authorised. Confederations are national and industrial. The Law provides for the establishment of seven Confederations in the case both of employers and of workers (Article ). For the rest, the provisions relating to trade unions apply also to federations and Confederations.
.Under Article , approved industrial associations may not affiliate with or maintain relations with international organisations except with the previous consent of the National Congress. It should be remembered that the original version of the Law absolutely prohibited such affiliation. The present text of the provision was promulgated by a Legislative Decree of  July . It is pursuant to this provision that Congress was called upon to authorise the organisations of the second and third degrees to affiliate with the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.
.It appears from these provisions that the formation of federations and Confederations is the privilege of the approved unions. Like the latter, these bodies themselves require to be approved. Whereas the approval of federations is in the competence of the Minister of Labour, Confederations require the approval of the President of the Republic. Affiliation of trade union organisations with any international organisation is expressly subject to prior authorisation by Congress.
.It would appear, therefore, that the Law has given to the public authorities a considerable degree of control over the establishment of trade union organisations "" of higher rank "".
.It appears from this analysis that the trade union rgime is characterised by the co-existence of two kinds of workers' organisations : industrial associations which are simply registered, and those which are approved as trade unions. It is to the latter that the Law has reserved some of the functions normally performed by every industrial association. The Law has also conferred on them certain privileges, for example that of concluding collective agreements operating as binding regulations, that of representing all the workers belonging to the category for which the association is established, that of benefiting from an industrial association tax levied on all workers whether union members or not, and, finally, that of forming federations and Confederations.
.In its reply, the Government emphasises that these regulations have neither the object nor the consequence of muzzling the trade union movement, but on the contrary of promoting its development. "" Directly aware of the needs",-1,1951,Brazil
14,"doctrines incompatible with the institutions and interests of the nation or in favour of candidates for elective offices not connected with the union ;(b) an elective office shall not be held simultaneously with an employment for remuneration paid by the union ;(c) the elective offices shall be honorary ;(d) all activities shall be prohibited which are not included in the objects referred to in the Law (Article ), including activities in favour of any political party ;(e) it shall be prohibited from handing over its premises to any agency of the nature of a political party.
.In addition to the rights accorded to industrial associations mentioned above, the approved trade union has the following prerogatives:(a) to represent before the public authorities the general interests of the category in question ;(b) to enter into collective agreements ;(c) to appoint representatives of the category in question ;(d) to levy contributions on all persons engaged in the economic or occupational category in question.
.It has, on the other hand, the following obligations:(a) to co-operate with the public authorities in the furtherance of social solidarity ;(b) to maintain legal aid services for its members;(c) to promote conciliation in labour disputes ;(d) to promote the establishment of co-operative societies;(e) to set up and maintain elementary and vocational schools.
.It would appear from these provisions that workers have in principle the right to establish organisations of their own choosing without previous authorisation. However, the legislation does not place on the same basis the two kinds of organisation : industrial association and approved trade union. The first is formed freely subject only to registration, which seems to ensue as of right if the legal conditions-of a purely formal kind-are fulfilled. The second is the industrial association officially approved as a trade union by the Government. Whereas an organisation of the first kind is entitled only to defend the individual interests of its members, the approved union is endowed with the power to represent and defend the collective interests of all the workers belonging to the category in respect of which the union is established, whether they are members of the union or not.
.It would seem from the above that no organisation is obliged to obtain approval. It is free to ask for it or to refrain ; if it makes no such request this will not render it illegal ; it will not benefit from the advantages conferred by the Law, but neither will it have to assume the obligations which the Law prescribes.
.Under these circumstances, approval cannot be assimilated to previous authorisation, because it applies to existing, freely established organisations which, in exchange for the advantages thereby conferred, freely submit to the conditions of form and substance which the Law prescribes when approval is obtained.
.It may, however, be asked whether, simply because the approved unions enjoy, to the exclusion of other organisations, privileges of paramount importance in the defence of occupational interests, wage earners are not indirectly obliged to belong to the approved unions. It does happen that the legislature in other countries without any intention of discrimination confers on recognised unions, which are in fact the most representative, certain privileges in connection with the defence of occupational interests which only they are in a position to perform effectively. But the granting of such privileges may not be made subject to conditions of such a nature as to bring into question through their operation the fundamental guarantees of freedom of association.
.It must therefore be considered whether, in the case under review, the conditions attached to the grant of approval do not indirectly bring into question the workers' right to establish and joint organisations of their own choosing.Conditions attached to the Approval of the Trade Union
.The industrial association, in order to be approved, must have as members, as indicated earlier, at least one-third of the workers in the category concerned. In addition to the minimum membership requirement, the social services set up by the organisation and the value of its property are the essential elements which the Government must take into consideration. Finally, the Law expressly provides that the competent authority shall always approve the most representative association.
.It may be added that the Industrial Association Membership Board provided for in Article  of the Law is called upon ""to settle all doubts and disputes relating to industrial association organisation "". The composition of this body would seem to ensure that cases are examined objectively. In fact, under the chairmanship of the Director-General of the Labour Department, the Board comprises the following persons : one representative of the National Institute of Technology, one representative of the Actuarial Service, one representative of the Statistics Service, one representative of the National Department of Industry and Commerce and one representative of the Industrial Associations Organisation and Assistance Division of the National Labour Department appointed by the Minister of Labour, one representative of the Ministry of Agriculture and two employers' representatives and two employees' representatives appointed from lists presented by their respective national Confederations.
.It appears from the foregoing that the decision as to approval is based on a number of objective criteria which would seem to exclude any arbitrary intervention on the part of the authorities.Conditions relating to Trade Union Objects
.Article  of the Law provides that the rules of approved trade union associations must contain a statement that "" the association will act as a body for co-operation with the public authorities and other associations for the furtherance of social solidarity and the subordination of economic and occupational interests to the national interests "".
.Such a provision, of course, is capable of various interpretations. Interpreted in a liberal sense, it may be understood as merely obliging the trade union to respect existing public order. Interpreted restrictively, however, it might imply some degree of subordination of the trade unions to the Government's economic and social policy. This would seem to have been the intention of the authors of the Law as the original text of Article , paragraph (c), provided for the withdrawal of approval where a union did not obey the instructions of the competent "" corporative authorities "" or comply with the guiding principles of economic policy issued by the President of the Republic, or where it prevented the carrying out thereof. However, by a Legislative Decree dated  October, this provision was replaced by a new text according to which approval will be withdrawn where a union "" places obstacles in the way of the carrying out of the economic policy adopted by the Government "". This new provision no longer requires the unions to make their policy comply absolutely with that of the Government as it provides for the withdrawal of approval only if unions directly place obstacles in the way of the carrying out of State economic policy. It may be, therefore, that the legislator, in adopting this formula, intended it to apply only to acts unlawful at common law, as for example acts of sabotage, etc.
.In these circumstances, the Committee considers that the complainants have not proved that this provision is applied in such a way as to infringe the right which employers' and workers' organisations should enjoy to draw up their programmes in full freedom. However, the Committee wishes to emphasise that because it is imprecise such a formula might imply some restriction of the freedom of action of the trade unions in the field of industrial relations, as trade union policy may not exactly correspond with Government policy, although that does not mean that it interferes with public order.Allegations concerning Infringements of Trade Union Autonomy
.In support of the complaint that the functioning of trade unions is controlled by the Ministry of Labour, the complainants make the three following allegations:(a) the Law regulates internal trade union affairs so strictly that they cannot freely draw up their own rules ;(b) trade union problems may be discussed only at union headquarters and with the consent of the Ministry, which has the right to prohibit meetings and, where it authorises them, to intervene with regard to the placing of items on the agenda ;(c) the Ministry of Labour also exercises control over trade union finances and collects an annual tax equal to one day's pay to support the official trade unions.
.A survey will be made of the provisions in the Law relating to these respective points but it may be observed at the outset that all of them apply solely to approved trade unions and not to industrial associations which are simply registered.Provisions relating to Trade Union Rules
.Paragraph  of Article  provides that trade union rules must contain, apart from the statement as to the objects of the union analysed earlier (see paragraph  above), the following particulars:(a) the style and address of the association ;(b) the economic or occupational category which is to be represented;(c).................................................................................................................................................(d) the powers and duties of the executive officers, the method of electing them and the rules for voting, and the grounds on which they may be removed from office or replaced ;(e) the method of",-1,1951,Brazil
15,"on the question of principle involved in cases in which declarations as to loyalty may be prescribed.Allegation concerning the Right to Strike
.The complainants allege that strikes are considered to be anti-social acts and that all strikers are liable to prosecution before the courts. To this allegation should be added another, dated  March , whereby the complainants protest against the violation of trade union rights on the occasion of an aviation workers' strike.
.In its reply dated  December , the Brazilian Government points out that a strike is not regarded as an anti-social act except in a case in which it is called before the legal means provided for the settlement of labour disputes have been exhausted. In its communication dated  May , the Government refers expressly to this earlier statement in connection with the aviation workers' strike.
.In support of their allegation the complainants make reference to Decree No.  of  March , which therefore requires to be considered.
.Under the regulations in question, collective labour disputes are compulsorily submitted to preliminary conciliation procedure or to the labour court. Collective cessation of work is authorised only within the limits prescribed by the law. It is regarded as a serious misdemeanour if a strike occurs in economic branches designated as "" essential occupations "" by the legislature, that is to say, in public utility services such as water, gas, electricity, hospitals, etc. The definition also includes transport and communications-including therefore air transport-banks, agriculture, schools, etc. The Ministry of Labour may issue Orders to add further occupations to the list. All occupations not classified as essential occupations are deemed to be "" accessory occupations "". In the latter occupations strikes are authorised in principle but become unlawful if the employees cease work "" without proper regard to the conciliation and court procedure prescribed "" by law.
.It appears from the text of the Decree of  March  that not all strikes are deemed to be "" anti-social "" acts. Strikes are illegal if they occur in any of the occupations regarded by the legislature as vital to the national economy. Further, a strike may also become illegal if it is called in a manner which contravenes the provisions concerning the settlement of labour disputes, that is if the prescribed time limits are not observed or if there is failure to comply with decisions of the labour courts (Articles - of the Labour Law). It is in fact to the labour judiciary that Article  of the Constitution entrusts the task of settling individual and collective disputes between employees and employers.
.It should be added that the right to strike is recognised by Article  of the Constitution, with the provision that its exercise shall be regulated by law.
.It appears from this analysis that strikes are prohibited only in occupations which the Government designates as "" essential "", but that, in accessory occupations, strikes are authorised within the limits prescribed by voluntary conciliation and arbitration procedures.
.In these circumstances, the Committee considers that the allegation that "" all strikes are declared to be anti-social acts and legal prosecution is applied to all strikers "" is not well founded, but recommends the Governing Body to draw the attention of the Government to the importance which it attaches, in cases in which strikes are prohibited in essential occupations, to ensuring adequate guarantees to safeguard to the full the interests of the workers thus deprived of an essential means of defending occupational interests.Allegations concerning Certain Specific Cases of Infringement of Freedom of Association
.Finally, the complainants list a number of cases of infringements of freedom of association alleged to have taken place in several regions of the country during the year .
.In its reply dated  December , the Government stated that it had asked the competent regional authorities for information, but in its second communication makes no reference to the results of these enquiries. On the other hand, the Government has supplied the Committee with data concerning the trade union rgime in general and the application of the laws, annexing thereto the texts of important judgments and those of certain authoritative legal opinions. It is made clear that the Government is fully aware of the need to guarantee freedom of association to the workers in all the regions of the country. On many occasions it emphasises that the workers enjoy this freedom fully provided that, in exercising their rights, they observe the requirements of the law. "" In Brazil "", states the Government, "" trade unions are free to engage in any lawful action in defence of the interests of the workers. They enjoy full freedom of action provided that they do not threaten public order or the rights and freedoms of other persons.""
.In view of the general explanations furnished by the Government, the Committee considers that it is not necessary to ask it for further information, but recommends the Governing Body to draw the attention of the Government to the need for ensuring that the principles of freedom of association are applied throughout the whole country by all the authorities and administrations under its control.Allegations relating to the Legislation concerning Trade Unions
.The complainants allege, in the first place, that under the provisions of the legislation concerning trade unions the promotion of the establishment of an independent trade union movement is prohibited, and that, also, existing organisations are under the control of the Government.
.In support of this allegation, the complainants refer to the Legislative Decree of  May  to approve the consolidation of labour laws. In order to examine these two grounds of complaint, it is necessary to make reference to this text.Allegations relating to the Restriction of the Workers' Right to Form Trade Unions.
.Part V of the Legislative Decree of  May , which relates to the rgime governing trade unions, provides for the establishment of two clearly distinct kinds of trade union organisations : () registered industrial associations, and () approved trade unions.
.Registered industrial associations. Under the terms of Article , associations for the purpose of the study, protection and co-ordination of the economic or occupational interests of all persons who are engaged as employees in the same activity or occupation or in similar or allied activities or occupations are lawful.
.Every industrial association is bound to have itself registered. Registration with the competent labour authorities takes place following the filing of a request therefor, accompanied by an authenticated copy of the rules and a statement indicating the number of members, the value of the property of the association and the social services set up and maintained. Registration confers on the industrial association the rights enumerated in the Law : it may represent before the administrative and judicial authorities the individual interests of its members in connection with the activity or occupation carried on by them ; it may co-operate with the State as a technical and advisory body in the investigation and solution of problems relating to the category of persons for whom it has been established ; it may also set up employment exchanges (Article ).
.Approved trade unions. However, registration alone is not enough to enable an industrial association to become a "" trade union "" within the meaning of the Law. It becomes a trade union only when it is approved as such by the competent authorities, and this confers upon it the rights and obligations reserved to trade unions (Articles  and ).
.In order to understand the difference drawn by the legislator between the industrial association which is simply registered and the approved trade union, it is necessary to examine, in the light of the legal provisions, first, the conditions under which an industrial association may be approved as a trade union, and secondly the rights and obligations of approved trade unions.
.The industrial association, in order that it may be approved as a trade union, must have as members at least one-third of the persons constituting the category for which it is established. These categories are defined by the Ministry of Labour on the proposals of an Industrial Association Membership Board, which includes, in addition to representatives of the public services concerned, two workers' and two employers' representatives appointed from lists presented by their respective national Confederations. As an exceptional measure, the Ministry of Labour may approve an association with a lesser membership.
.In order to be approved, the industrial association must be, in the view of the Minister of Labour, the most representative. He bases his view on, among other things, the number of members, the social services set up and maintained and the value of the property of the association. However, not more than one industrial association shall be approved as representative of each economic or occupational category in any given area.
.The Ministry of Labour fixes the area for each industrial association. Associations may be district, municipal, inter-municipal, State or inter-State ; by way of exception, national associations may be recognised.
.An approved trade union must comply with the following provisions:(a) it shall not engage in any propaganda in favour of",-1,1951,Brazil
16,".The complaint, presented in the form of a telegram to the United Nations, alleges, without giving further details, that certain trade union leaders, including Mr. Carlos Arayas, have been persecuted by the Colombian Government.
.The Government states that investigations which have been made show that there is no basis for the allegations. Hence it is a question of a purely propagandist campaign against the Government's trade union policy.
.At its meeting on  and  December , the Committee requested the Director-General to ask the Colombian Government for further information, in particular, with reference to the question whether judicial proceedings have been instituted against Mr. Carlos Arayas and other trade union leaders and, if so, with reference to the grounds for the judgments given by the courts.
.In its reply dated  February , the Colombian Government states that it has addressed a careful enquiry to the labour and judicial authorities but that no trace can be found of the name and antecedents of Mr. Carlos Arayas. The Government expresses the view that the World Federation of Trade Unions is mistaken or that a malicious attempt is being made to compromise the good reputation of the Government.
.The Colombian Government gives a formal assurance that, after addressing an enquiry to the administrative and judicial authorities, it has been unable to trace the name of the person-Mr. Carlos Araya-alleged to have been persecuted because of his trade union activities. It may be, as the Government itself admits is possible, that some confusion as to the name exists, but it is evident that the responsibility for a mistake of this kind must be borne by the complainant because he has not given adequate details in his complaint.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that the allegations made are too vague to permit a consideration of the case on its merits.",-1,1952,Colombia
17,".The complainants allege that trade union rights have been infringed by the following measures:(a) adoption of anti-union legislation ;(b) declaration of a state of siege in the mining region.
.This complaint was transmitted to the I.L.O by the Economic and Social Council, at its th Session, and, so far as the first allegation is concerned, relates, as is explained below, to matters which came before the Committee at its meeting in May . The second allegation, therefore, is the only one, which raises new matters for consideration by the Committee.
.In reply to the complainants' two allegations, the Chilean Government puts forward the following arguments:(a) The only recently adopted law dealing with trade union organisation is the Law for the Permanent Defence of Democracy, the codified text of which was promulgated by Decree No.  of  September . This law was the subject of an earlier complaint by the W.F.T.U. The Governing Body of the I.L.O decided that case in favour of the Chilean Government.(b) With regard to the second allegation, the Government states that in no region of the Republic has a state of siege been proclaimed by the present Government during its last six years of activity.
.The complainants have given no details in support of the allegation of the adoption of anti-union legislation. The Chilean Government states that the complaint apparently refers to the Law for the Permanent Defence of Democracy. In fact, promulgated in the form of a code in , this text constitutes the most recent measure dealing with trade union rights.
.It will be remembered that the above law was the subject of Case No. , dealt with in the Committee's fourth report to the Governing Body. In this connection the Committee recommended the Governing Body:(a) to decide that the complainants had not presented sufficient evidence to justify reference of the matter to the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission ;(b) to suggest that the Chilean Government might wish to re-examine certain Articles of the Law for the Permanent Defence of Democracy, in particular Articles  and , with a view to determining whether any modifications of them are desirable in the light of the provisions of the Conventions concerning freedom of association and protection of the right to organise (), and concerning the right to organise and to bargain collectively ().
.At its th Session (May ), the Governing Body endorsed the Committee's recommendation.
.In the present complaint the W.F.T.U raises no new considerations. In these circumstances the Committee considers that there is no ground for re-examining the allegation relating to the Law for the Permanent Defence of Democracy, concerning which the Committee has already reached a decision.
.In view of the Chilean Government's categorical statement that no state of siege has been proclaimed in any region of the country during the last six years, the Committee is of the opinion that, in the absence of sufficient evidence being offered by the complainants, the second allegation does not call for further examination by the Governing Body.
.With regard to the case as a whole, therefore, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(i) to draw the attention of the Government of Chile once again to the suggestion contained in its fourth report and cited in paragraph  (b) above;(ii) to decide that the case does not call for further examination.",-1,1952,Chile
18,".It would appear from the analysis of the case as a whole that the emergency measures taken by the Government, pursuant to article  of the Constitution, were submitted without delay for approval by Parliament and were revoked as soon as the situation returned to normal. It would also appear that certain fundamental rights of the workers, for example the right of free trade union meeting and the right of habeas corpus, had also been temporarily restricted in consequence. While expressing the hope that governments, desiring to see labour relations develop in an atmosphere of mutual confidence, will have recourse, when dealing with situations resulting from strikes and lockouts, to measures provided for under common law rather than to emergency measures, which, even though taken in accordance with the national Constitution and applied subject to Parliamentary control, involve a danger, by reason of their very nature, of certain restrictions being placed on fundamental rights, the Committee observes that freedom of association, traditionally guaranteed in Uruguay, appears now to be re-established.
.In these circumstances, the Committee, subject to the observations made in paragraph  above, recommends the Governing Body to decide that the case as a whole does not call for further examination.",-1,1952,Uruguay
19,".The complainant alleges, in a first communication dated  July , that Mr. Lzaro Pea, Vice-President of the World Federation of Trade Unions and a Cuban union leader, and Mr. Jos Morera, Secretary of the Confederation of Latin American Workers, were arrested on  July  at Havana Airport on their return from a meeting of the W.F.T.U Executive Committee, and considers that their arrest constitutes a clear violation of trade union rights.
.In a second communication dated  September  the complainant states that the Government unleashed at the end of July  a wave of persecution against the trade union and democratic movement in Cuba. Several trade union and democratic leaders, among whom were Mr. Lzaro Pea and the workers' leaders in the tobacco and transport industries, namely, Joaquin Ordoqui, Jorge Garcia Gallo, Gonzalo Collado, Carlos Fernndez and Jos Maria Prez, were thrown into prison. The premises of several trade unions and the residence of Lzaro Pea were ransacked by the police. The workers' daily newspaper Noticias de Hoy was banned. All Constitutional guarantees were suppressed on pretext of a plot which had no connection with the trade union or democratic movement. The real reason for these persecutions and repression is to be found in the intention of the Government to strike a blow against the unified struggle of the workers for their economic and social demands and for the maintenance of trade union and democratic freedom.
.In these circumstances the Committee, having regard, first, to the highly political character of these events, and, secondly, to the fact that the complaint is now purposeless since the Constitutional guarantees have been restored, recommends the Governing Body, subject to the observations made in paragraphs , ,  and  above, to decide that the case as a whole does not call for further examination.",-1,1952,Cuba
20,".The complaints, dating respectively from  to , may be grouped under the three following heads : (a) complaint concerning the maritime industry presented by the International Transportworkers' Federation ; (b) complaints concerning the railroad industry presented by the International Federation of Land and Air Transport Workers' Unions and other organisations ; (c) complaints concerning the trade union situation in general presented by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.
.In view of the fact that these complaints relate to different questions, it is desirable to analyse them separately.Complaint concerning the Maritime Industry
.The complaint contains the following principal allegations.
.The Government has taken repressive measures against the General Confederation of Maritime and Allied Trade Unions (C.G.G.M.A.), whose leaders face arrest on the pretext that they act on instructions from the I.T.F, which the Government has described as a communist organisation. The C.G.G.M.A is the victim of the systematic hostility of the General Confederation of Labour (C.G.T.), which organisation occupies a privileged position and is officially supported by the Government. In contradiction with the spirit of free trade unionism and with a statement made on  April  by President Pern to the effect that "" No Argentine trade union leader has been or ever will be subject to any pressure whatsoever to make him change his way of thinking as regards his organisation's requirements for the attainment of its high trade union aims "", the Minister of Labour declared ten days later that the C.G.G.M.A had no legal status, that it was not identified with the social policy pursued by the national Government, that its activities were disturbing in nature and were contrary to the national interest, and that its programme was inspired from abroad by reason of its affiliation with the International Transportworkers' Federation.
.The functioning of the bodies for negotiation successively established between  and  to settle labour disputes in the maritime industry-bodies on which the C.G.G.M.A was represented-was paralysed by the hostility of the C.G.T. In , a new joint committee was set up without any representatives of the C.G.G.M.A and in direct violation of an agreement signed with the Director of the Ministry of Transport in .
.Owing to the absence of machinery for negotiation, the C.G.G.M.A was obliged to resort to strike action in support of its claims. In one strike, the crew members who had participated in it having been dismissed by the company, an official of the Ministry of Transport called in representatives of the unions affiliated with the C.G.G.M.A and told them that the dismissed sailors would be reinstated if the unions repudiated the C.G.G.M.A. Such a condition, according to the complainants, is contrary, not only to the principle of freedom of association, but to the Argentine Constitution as well.
.Measures of personal victimisation were employed against the strikers, and the personal effects of those leaving the ships were retained.
.The C.G.G.M.A was subjected to a campaign of the vilest nature in the newspapers controlled by the Government.
.In conclusion, the complainant asks that the I.L.O investigate the observance of trade union rights in the Argentine Republic.Complaints concerning the Railroad Industry
.The various complaints submitted in this connection, being similar in substance, may be analysed together.
.The majority of them are limited to the making of general allegations to the effect that, following the railway workers' strikes which took place between November  and January  and in August , the Government took repressive measures in decreeing the mobilisation of the railway workers, in making mass dismissals, and in arresting a large number of railway workers.
.In the memorandum joined to his complaint, one of the complainants alleges that more than  railway workers were arrested, that they are detained in inhuman conditions, and that the majority of them are shortly to be tried before military courts. He protests against the statement of the Government that the railway workers, in striking without authorisation from the General Confederation of Labour and the Railway Workers' Union, violated the provisions of the Industrial Associations Act and took part in a strike which had been declared illegal by the Minister of Labour because, according to the explanatory preamble to the Mobilisation Decree of  January , it had been "" started and directed by persons unrepresentative of the railway workers "". Adducing a statement made by General Pern, the complainant declares that the strike was desired by almost all the railway workers who, as a result of the refusal of their official leaders to support their claims, themselves set up an "" Emergency Advisory Committee "" which was the only body representative of the railway workers, the official leadership of the Railway Workers' Union having lost the confidence of its members. The complainant claims that the strike was motivated by the material situation of the railway workers, which had become impossible, and by various anti-labour measures taken by the Government (appointment to administrative posts of generally incompetent political protgs, unjustified dismissals in violation of the Railway Workers' Code). The strike was started only after a period of two years, during which the railway workers vainly hoped for the satisfaction of their claims, and was wholeheartedly supported by the Argentine people. The strike was twice discontinued when the Government undertook to satisfy the workers' claims, thus implicitly recognising not only the justice of those claims but also the fact that the strike was definitely economic in character.
.The Decree of  January , which ordered the mobilisation of the railway workers, is a real wartime enactment which should not have been applied in time of peace and constitutes an annulment of the right to strike and a violation of the Argentine Constitution.
.A list-stated to be incomplete-was appended to this memorandum, containing  names of workers who were to be tried in connection with the railway workers' strike of November -January .
.In conclusion, the complainants request intervention with the Government to end the measures of repression, to achieve the reinstatement of the dismissed railway workers, to liberate the prisoners and to repeal the Railway Workers' Mobilisation Decree.Complaints concerning the Trade Union Situation in General
.A complaint presented by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, dated  April , which takes up and summarises again a number of other complaints addressed earlier by the same complainants to the Economic and Social Council, groups under the four following heads the infringements of trade union rights alleged to have been committed by the Government of the Argentine Republic:(a) infringements of trade union rights by legislative action;(b) violation of the right to organise by administrative action;(c) infringement of the individual liberties of trade union members ;(d) violence employed by the authorities against workers in their character as trade union members.Infringements of Trade Union Rights by Legislative Action.The complainant alleges that trade union rights have been violated by legislative measures relating, first, to the right to organise and, secondly, to the right to strike.
.The complainant alleges that trade union rights have been violated by legislative measures relating, first, to the right to organise and, secondly, to the right to strike.
.Infringements of the right to organise. With regard to the alleged infringements of the right to organise, the complainant, referring especially to Articles  and  of a Decree of  October , maintains that its provisions "" open the way to arbitrary action since they empower the Minister of Labour to void, at any moment, the right of a workers' trade union to operate as such "".
.Infringements of the right to strike. With regard to the alleged infringements of the right to strike, the complainant alleges, first, that, by virtue of Articles , , and  of the Decree of  January  for the repression of crimes against the security of the State, all kinds of strikes could be prohibited, and, secondly, that by virtue of Articles  and  of the Decree of  October  respecting the suppression of espionage, sabotage and treason, a Government wishing to end a strike would be able to arrest and sentence to very severe penalties trade union leaders who had decided to resort to a strike for strictly occupational reasons.Violation of the Right to Organise by Administrative Action
.The complainant alleges that the General Confederation of Labour was established on  March  at a time when freedom of association existed in law and in fact. But, after the assumption of power by General Pern, the two largest national federations, the Railway Workers' Union, established in , and the Railway Workers' Brotherhood, established in , were placed under the immediate supervision of the military authorities. An administrator was imposed on both organisations, who decided on their disaffiliation from the C.G.T. Subsequently, the Government used these two national federations, as reorganised, in its coercive campaign against the C.G.T in order to establish the domination of the trade union movement as a whole by the State. The unions, once placed under supervision, reconstituted the C.G.T, following which, those unions which up to that time had been independent were obliged to affiliate with the new C.G.T controlled by",-1,1952,Argentina
21,"the Government and by it supplied with servile administrators who shortly made them inoffensive. The national occupational federations which opposed absorption into the new C.G.T were dissolved one after another or forcibly placed under the control of an administrator and by him reorganised. The same thing was done to the local branches of these federations and the identical fate befell the regional federations and the independent trade unions. By way of example of these interventions of the administration in violation of the right to organise, the complainant cites the appointment of administrators to head several unions of mariners. Although they were apparently nominated by the leaders of the C.G.T, they were, in fact, appointed by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security.
.Another example of the intervention of the Government in the life of trade union organisations is alleged to be given by the following occurrences which took place on the occasion of the last presidential electoral campaign. The Railway Workers' Brotherhood, together with the other unions, was invited to promise its unconditional support for the re-election of General Pern. Invoking its regulations, the Brotherhood refused and decided to raise the question in its annual assembly, which was to take place on  May . The authorities, fearing that the Railway Workers' Brotherhood, oldest trade union organisation in Argentina, following the example of other unions, would also declare itself opposed to the re-election of General Pern, ordered units of the army to occupy the premises of the Brotherhood a week before the general assembly. The order came from above and was executed with the complicity of the police. Numerous trade union members were arrested. The Brotherhood decided to resist, and set up a provisional committee charged with the reconstitution of a Brotherhood independent of Government control and with demanding the liberation of those of its members who had been imprisoned in connection with previous strikes. On  August  the Railway Workers' Brotherhood started a strike in spite of the Decree of  January  which ordered the mobilisation of the railway workers. The strike was suppressed by the police and hundreds of railway workers were arrested and maltreated in the police stations of Buenos Aires and on the premises of the police in the district of Azul, province of Buenos Aires.
.The Government continually intervenes in the life of the trade unions, supervises them and makes clear its intention of directing them.
.Among the most recent violations of freedom of association the complainant cites the seizure by armed troops, supported by police, on  November , of the furnishings and records of the secretariat of the Workers' Committee for Independent Trade Union Action (W.C.I.T.U.A.), of the Shoe Industry Trade Union and of the Graphic Arts Trade Union. These three trade union organisations had, since  December , been dissolved by order of the Bicameral Committee of the Argentine Congress.Infringement of the Individual Liberties of Trade Union Members
.The complainant alleges that, in violation of freedom of association and without respect for human rights as they are defined in the Declaration of Human Rights which was adopted with the support of Argentina by the Assembly of the United Nations in , arbitrary arrests of trade union members, prolonged detentions without trial, torture and other ill-treatment by the police, banishment from the country by simple administrative decision, compulsory domiciling away from the ordinary residence and other acts of violence were employed against a very large number of trade union members.
.Two hundred workers were arrested for so-called violation of the Decree of  January  respecting the security of the State at the time of the railway workers' strike in January . They were imprisoned without trial for many months.
.In support of the allegation, the complainant cites the names of several arrested persons particularly well-known in the trade union world. They were all held incommunicado for two weeks, then tried for "" illegal association "" and violation of the Decree respecting the security of the State mentioned above. In reality, the charge of "" illegal association"" was, quite obviously trumped up for the occasion, for up to the time of their arrest the prisoners were officially recognised as representatives of the Railway Workers' Provisional Committee, and it was with them that the Government negotiated. A number of detainees were conditionally freed, but many trade unionists had to flee the country to escape certain arrest.
.Finally, the complainant alleges that several members of the Railway Workers' Brotherhood, whose names are given, were arrested on the occasion of the strike of  August  and are still detained.Violence employed by the Authorities against Workers in their Character as Trade Union Members
.The complainant alleges that the Minister of Labour and Social Security employed every means to prevent strikes from taking place. He succeeded in doing so from  to . Since that time, however, strikes were started in several industries to obtain better working or living conditions, or also for the defence of trade union rights or of the right to elect trade union leaders. The Minister of Labour, having been unable to prevent the strikes from taking place, attempted to win the leaders of the strikes to his side by corruption or otherwise. Being unsuccessful, he inflicted the most cruel ill-treatment on them, adding violence and torture to imprisonment, resulting, in some cases, in death.
.The complainant cites several examples in support of the allegation, including the case of Mr. Cipriano Reyes, Member of Parliament, stated to have been imprisoned without trial for two years for having demanded the restoration of trade union freedom.
.In its letters of  December ,  April  and  September , the Government first presents a number of general observations and then refers in more detail to the allegations concerning the maritime industry, the railroad industry and the trade union situation in general.General Observations
.Recalling the opinion expressed by the Employers' member of the Officers of the Governing Body to the effect that "" the only obligation which Governments have expressly undertaken entitling us to question their action is where they have ratified a Convention and are said not to be carrying it out "", which opinion is in agreement with that upheld by the Argentine delegate in the Economic and Social Council in , when the question of violation of trade union rights was discussed, the Government states that since it has not ratified the Convention on freedom of association it makes the most express reservations as to the competence of the I.L.O to examine a question of exclusively internal character which has already been settled in a satisfactory manner by means of absolutely legal procedures.
.The Government next states that freedom of association is absolute in the Argentine Republic, that it is regulated by legal rules which are not only prescribed in special regulations establishing the legal status of occupational associations but which are also contained in the Constitutional law which guarantees the rights of the worker. It states that it fully supports trade union rights and that they have been adopted as fundamental principles of the doctrine of "" justicialism "", and that the policy followed by the Government in this connection won for it an overwhelming majority at the last elections. For these reasons the Government considers that the complaints are motivated by exclusively political considerations, that they are lacking in proof since the complainants have not been able, nor will be able, to furnish any, and that they should not be taken into consideration.Allegations concerning the Maritime Industry
.The good faith of the International Transportworkers' Federation has been abused and the Federation has served as an instrument of the C.G.G.M.A, which organisation is almost entirely controlled by communist elements.
.The Government makes no observations respecting the attitude of the C.G.T towards the C.G.G.M.A and respecting the attitude of the press, in view of the fact that these two questions in no way engage the responsibility of the Government.
.As concerns the operation of the bodies for negotiation, it is incorrect to say that negotiations cannot achieve any result, since any representative workers' organisation may at any time negotiate directly with employers in respect of working conditions without any need for the intervention of the State ; if the employers refuse to negotiate, an organisation may appeal to the Industrial Relations Council to declare the existence of an "" unfair practice "", which procedure makes it possible to surmount the obstacles which may in practice be encountered in negotiations. In view of these provisions, the Government considers that it is unnecessary to comment on the attitude of the officials which was brought into question in this connection in the complaint.
.With respect to the strike in the maritime industry, it was justifiable to declare it illegal since it was started in violation of the regulations concerning the exercise of the right to strike, which provide that collective demands must be made in writing and that no change may be made in the existing situation while negotiations are in progress.
.The Government considers it unnecessary to take into",-1,1952,Argentina
22,"consideration the allegations concerning the attitude of an official of the Ministry of Transport during the strike and concerning the victimisation of strikers, in view of the vague and imprecise character of these allegations.
.Finally, it states that no one is either detained or under charges consequent upon the disputes in the maritime industry.Allegations concerning the Railroad Industry
.The intervention of the Minister of Labour in the dispute in the railway industry, both as concerns mediation and the declaration of legality or illegality of the strike, was made in conformity with the legal provisions in force. The strike was declared illegal in accordance with the opinions held on the matter both by jurisprudence and legal doctrine. The establishment of an emergency committee endangered the rights of the workers and the stability of the institutions recognised by Argentine public law. This is a matter of internal law which falls exclusively within the competence of natural judges who will be called upon to apply the penal sanctions should such be pronounced. With respect to the list of names which was joined to the complaint, the Government declares that only five persons have been proceeded against for misdemeanours under ordinary law and by virtue of a warrant for preventive detention issued by the competent judge and confirmed by the Appeals Court. The strike having been declared illegal for the reason that the workers' claims were under consideration, the Mobilisation Decree constituted a normal measure which has also been adopted in other countries where the national economy was seriously endangered and in view of the characteristics of the public services.Allegations relating to the Trade Union Situation in General
.In its letter dated  September , the Government declares that the complaint of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions refers in substance to allegations contained in earlier complaints and that, consequently, it seems unnecessary to examine it with a view to making further observations. However, out of deference to the Committee on Freedom of Association, the Government makes a number of supplementary observations which are summarised below.
.The Government maintains that the complainant, in referring to Article  of Act No. , which regulates the activities of occupational associations, has incompletely quoted the text with the obvious intention of abusing the good faith of the I.L.O. In its reply, the Government quotes the whole text of the Article and claims that the allegation, therefore, is erroneous and tendentious.
.It is on the basis of the incomplete quotation of Article  that the complainant has been able to allege that () "" this text can mean almost anything in the hands of a dictatorial Government "", and () that trade union rights have been totally suppressed in Argentina.
.With regard to these last two allegations the Government wishes to bring the following elements of appreciation to the notice of the Committee on Freedom of Association.
.With regard to the so-called "" dictatorial Government "", it states that the triumph of General Pern in the elections of  was gained as the result of entirely free elections, the regularity of which was recognised both by the five political parties in opposition and by foreign observers. The same was true of the last elections (subsequent to the presentation of the complaints), in the course of which the Presidential mandate of General Pern was renewed a second time by a considerably increased majority. This affords irrefutable proof that the present Government of the Argentine Republic is the expression of the will of the great majority of the Argentine people which has thus demonstrated its gratitude to a Government which "" has made of Argentina a country of social justice, economic liberty and political sovereignty "".
.With regard to the allegation concerning "" the total suppression of trade union rights "", its lack of foundation is apparent from the fact that the complainant has given only an incomplete citation of Article  and has referred, out of their context, to Articles of other enactments which have no connection with the matter in question.
.With regard to the allegation that, in the Argentine Republic, only unions affiliated to the C.G.T have the right to conclude legally recognised collective agreements, the Government declares that it has never made any distinction in this connection between trade unions affiliated to the C.G.T and independent trade unions. It points out that the organ of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security responsible for registering collective agreements and for co-operating in the settlement of disputes between employers and workers has always exercised the greatest impartiality, in conformity with the legal principles governing labour matters.
.In support of its statement the Government gives a list of collective agreements to which independent organisations not affiliated to the C.G.T are stated to have been parties and some of which were concluded thanks to the intervention of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security.
.From the foregoing the Government concludes that the autonomous or independent organisations enjoy, within the limits of the law, full freedom of organisation, functioning and action with regard to the defence of their occupational interests. They are, moreover, entirely free to conclude legally recognised collective agreements.
.With regard to Act No.  for the suppression of espionage, sabotage and treason, and Decree No. / for the repression of crimes against the security of the State, the Government maintains that these enactments have no relation to the right to organise or to the lawful exercise of the right to strike. The Articles on which the complainant's case is based relate exclusively to acts of espionage, sabotage, etc., which are repressed in every democratic country whose Government desires to safeguard public order. The Government adds that the necessity to apply these Articles has never arisen.
.With regard to the case of Mr. Cipriano Reyes, the Government maintains that he was convicted by the civil courts of the country of participation in a conspiracy both revolutionary and political and not on the grounds of his political and trade union activities.
.It is apparent from the analysis that several of the complaints, although emanating from different sources, deal with similar questions, while others, although emanating from the same complainant, deal with questions which are widely different.
.The Government, for its part, in its three communications, first raises certain prejudicial questions before presenting its observations on the substance of the complaints transmitted to it.
.In these circumstances, it has appeared necessary to group the allegations and observations together according to their subject matter.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:",-1,1952,Argentina
23,".By a letter dated  July  the World Federation of Trade Unions, at the request of the Argentine League for Human Rights, has brought the following case before the I.L.O.
.Thirty-one workers of Spanish, Italian, Yugoslav, Russian, Polish and other national origins, detained in the prison of Villa Devoto in Buenos Aires, are stated to be threatened with expulsion under the Argentine Act No. , the so-called "" Residence "" Act, by reason of their participation in the making of demands of an economic and social character.
.The application of the measure is claimed to involve particular hardship in the case of these persons who, although of foreign origin, have lived for many years in Argentina ; several of them would even be placed in serious danger if they had to return to their countries of origin which are at present subject to dictatorial rgimes.
.Act No. -the abrogation of which, it is contended, has been demanded in vain by trade union organisations in Argentina-is alleged to constitute a permanent threat to foreign workers who have emigrated to Argentina and who may take part in collective action. In view of the large number of immigrant workers, the Act could cause harm to Argentine labour in general.
.The author of the communication concludes that Act No.  is contrary to the spirit of the Declaration of Philadelphia and to international Conventions concerning migrant workers.
.The Director-General referred this case to the Committee prior to communicating the complaint to the Argentine Government.",-1,1952,Argentina
24,".The Committee had occasion to submit conclusions to the Governing Body on a number of complaints relating to alleged violation of trade union rights in Venezuela in its First and Sixth Reports. A brief summary of these is given below.Complaints of the American Federation of Labor and, the Venezuelan General Confederation of Labour
.These complaints, analysed in the First Report of the Committee related to the general situation of the trade union movement in Venezuela following the assumption of power by a Military Junta on  November . The trade union movement was alleged to have been the subject of a campaign of repression culminating in the dissolution, by administrative action, of the Venezuelan General Federation of Labour and its affiliated federations of trade unions. Many trade union leaders were stated to have been imprisoned ; it was alleged that trade union premises were closed and the goods of all the dissolved associations seized. The trade union press was suppressed ; workers were persecuted on the pretext of participation in subversive political activities. The remaining trade union organisations which were not then dissolved were alleged to have been obliged, by ministerial order, to renew their executive bodies, the former officials being declared ineligible for re-election.
.The remaining allegations related to the dissolution of  petroleum workers' organisations-again by administrative action. The reason for this dissolution is alleged to have been a strike in the oilfields. The workers are alleged to have been subjected to measures of repression, including the incarceration of more than , of them.
.With regard to these two allegations, the Government presented a number of observations' to the effect that the dissolution of the General Confederation of Labour was ordered because of the participation of that organisation in an illegal political strike. The Government took this measure only when it was apparent that the Confederation had been turned into an instrument for political agitation, its unlawful activities having culminated in the presentation of an ultimatum to the Government on  February  threatening resort to direct action. In the face of such a challenge the Government proceeded to dissolve the organisation. The illegal character of the activities of the Confederation contravened the provisions of the Labour Code and the regulations issued under it relating to the procedure laid down for initiating collective disputes. The freezing of trade union funds was ordered so as to prevent them being used for purposes foreign to trade union activity. The detention of trade union leaders, ordered as a security measure, was a measure taken exclusively on the ground of their political activities.
.With regard to the dissolution of the petroleum workers' unions, the Government stated that this dissolution was ordered because the unions concerned ordered a strike contrary to formal provisions contained in the collective agreements then in force. The sanctions taken for illegal strikes were based on provisions of the Labour Code and the Government considered that similar measures had been taken in other countries and had not, in its view, constituted an infringement of freedom of association. According to the Government, a considerable number of the petroleum workers' unions subsequently reorganised and initiated new collective agreements.Conclusions of the Committee in Its First Report
.In its First Report the Committee adopted the following conclusions:
.With regard to the allegations relating to the general situation of the trade union movement in Venezuela, the Governing Body has at its disposal the report of the I.L.O Mission to Venezuela and the observations of the Government of Venezuela on the same report. The data necessary for appreciating the position are therefore available.
.The dissolution of the petroleum workers' unions, to which the second part of the complaint relates, took place after the events dealt with in the above documents and have therefore not been the subject of any similar examination. The versions given by the Government and by the complainants differ considerably with regard to the circumstances under which the events took place which gave rise to the dissolution of the petroleum workers' unions, but they are in agreement as to the dissolution having actually taken place. It is quite clear from the text of the dissolution decree attached to the complaint that the measure was taken by the administrative authorities without the case first having been submitted to the competent courts.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends that the case merits further examination by the Governing Body.
.With respect to the future policy to be followed, the Committee made the following pronouncement in the same report:
.The Venezuelan Government has not been formally requested to indicate whether it would be willing to consent to reference of the matter to the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission. Under the procedure laid down by the Governing Body this question does not arise until the Governing Body itself has decided that the Government concerned shall be asked to give its consent to reference of the matter to the Fact-Finding Commission. Although the Government has indicated in its preliminary observations on the complaint that it would not be willing to consent to such reference, the Committee does not consider that such a preliminary reply precludes the Governing Body from discussing further whether it is advisable to make a formal request to the Government concerned that it should consent to reference of a case to the Fact-Finding Commission. They venture to hope that in future cases the preliminary observations of governments will not anticipate any request which the Governing Body may or may not think it appropriate to make after it has had an opportunity of considering the facts of the case and expressing its views ....Decision of the Committee Contained in Its Third Report
.The conclusions adopted in its First Report were amended by the Committee in its Third Report, as follows:
.The Committee also had before it a letter from Mr. Montoya, Venezuelan Government representative on the Governing Body, informing the Committee that he had further observations to present on behalf of his Government relating to Case No.  (Venezuela). Under these circumstances, the Committee decided to amend the recommendation which it had submitted to the Governing Body in its First Report and, accordingly, recommends the Governing Body to postpone examination of this case in order to enable the Venezuelan Government to transmit its supplementary observations to the Committee. The Committee will report further on this case to the Governing Body when the observations in question have been transmitted to it.
.The Governing Body, at its th Session (Geneva, March ), considered the First and Third Reports of the Committee and decided to postpone the examination of the case.Complaints of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions and Other Trade Union Organisations
.In the meantime, a complaint dated  April  was received from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions and communicated to the Government of Venezuela which confirmed and supplemented similar complaints against the Government of Venezuela presented to the Economic and Social Council by various trade union organisations.
.These complaints which, in part, repeat the allegations made in the earlier communications from the American Federation of Labor and the Venezuelan Confederation of Labour, related especially to the dissolution of various trade unions in  and to the dissolution of the petroleum industry trade unions in . They also alleged the detention of trade union leaders.
.With respect to these new complaints, as with respect to the earlier complaints, the Government presented a series of observations in separate communications forming a continuous whole and, through its representative, presented verbal statements at the Committee's meeting on  June .
.In its communication dated  May  the Government stated that there had been important developments in the trade union situation in Venezuela. Since January  a large number of trade unions had been legally constituted and by the middle of  there existed a total of  trade unions and four federations. In the view of the Government, these figures demonstrated that the Government favoured the development of trade unionism but did not mean that it could tolerate the affiliation of trade union organisations to national or foreign political parties or their engaging in political activities foreign to the purposes expressly assigned to them by the Labour Law. The exercise of the right of meeting had also been facilitated, previous authorisation no longer being required. The number of collective agreements had increased appreciably between  and . In particular, the Government had paid particular attention to negotiations in the petroleum industry, the Ministry of Labour having obtained from the petroleum undertakings a promise not to alter working conditions during the negotiation of the new contracts. The Government had given aid to the trade union organisations by assuming the costs of premises and materials. With reference to the freezing of the funds of the dissolved organisations, the administrative commission charged with administration of the funds had returned a considerable sum to new trade unions formed by workers who had belonged to the dissolved organisations. Each case of devolution of funds had been thoroughly studied.
.In the same communication, the Government analysed the jurisprudence of the Committee",-1,1953,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
25,"on Freedom of Association in other cases, particularly with respect to Case No.  concerning the complaint presented by the World Federation of Trade Unions against the Government of the United Kingdom (Cyprus). The Government considered that the complaints presented against the Government of Venezuela were similar to those examined in Case No. , dealing with associations of a clearly political character.
.In a second communication of the same date,  May , the Government of Venezuela called attention to the report of the Credentials Committee of the th Session of the International Labour Conference. In that report, the Credentials Committee recommended the rejection of the protest presented against the credentials of the Venezuelan Workers' delegate to the Conference.
.In the statements presented verbally by the representative of the Venezuelan Government at the meeting of the Committee on  June , the Government declared that the strike which had led to the dissolution of the petroleum workers' unions was, from the juridical point of view, an illegal movement, because the trade unions which caused it were bound by collective agreements. The Government had warned the trade unions of this before it proceeded to dissolve them, but in view of their refusal to take heed, the Government found itself obliged to dissolve the trade unions in order to maintain production in the petroleum industry which was vital to the country.
.In its later communications, dated  November ,  November  and  February , the Government repeated its earlier statements, because it considered that the new complaints which had been transmitted to it-the complaint of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions and similar complaints-did not contain any new allegations. The Government transmitted to the Committee the text of a speech made by the President of the Government Junta on the eve of the elections on  November , in which he stated that the policy of the Venezuelan Government was to re-establish in the country a Constitutional rgime expressed through the will of the people. In its last communication, dated  February , the Government presented a memorandum on the evolution of the trade union situation. It stated that the Ministry of Labour had adopted a liberal policy and that no restrictive measure had been taken against the trade union movement. With the creation of new trade unions in various regions of the country the ground was prepared for the Constitution of a national Confederation. The freedom of action enjoyed by the trade unions was demonstrated by the extensive amount of collective bargaining being undertaken, particularly in the petroleum industry. The draft Constitution then being examined by the National Constituent Assembly contained clauses guaranteeing freedom of association, recognising the right to strike, authorising collective agreements, etc.Conclusions of the Committee in Its Sixth Report
.The Committee, after noting that from the information presented by the Government there appeared to have been some improvement in the trade union situation as a whole, formulated conclusions with reference to the two principal allegations.
.With regard to the dissolution of the petroleum workers' unions, the Committee, after finding that "" the penalties provided for under the Labour Code in case of strikes called in violation of the legislation in force were imposed only on the persons actually responsible for the strikes but not upon the trade union organisations "", concluded:
.The Committee, on the basis of the actual facts of the case, found that the dissolution of the oilworkers' union had not been carried out in accordance with the provisions of article .
.The Committee reached the same conclusion with respect to article , which provides that an industrial association should not be affiliated to or associated with a national or foreign political group, a fact which has never been proven.
.With reference to the allegations relating to the dissolution of the petroleum workers' unions, the Committee reached the following conclusions:
.The Committee therefore considers that the explanations given by the Government have not invalidated the conclusion which the Committee reached at its meeting in January , namely that the oilworkers' unions were dissolved by administrative action.
.The Committee has nevertheless taken account of the new information communicated by the Government in its reply of  May . This information tends to show that the situation in the petroleum industry has again become normal. The Government emphasises the fact that the oilworkers' unions, which had been dissolved in , have been reconstituted in the same districts and with the same membership. Furthermore, the Government points out that the collective agreements concluded in  were kept in force and that, if it was forced to intervene in the negotiations between the employers and the unions, it was in the interest of the workers themselves, as the Government has succeeded in getting better working conditions embodied in the collective agreements. Finally, the Government has called upon the representatives of the trade unions to collaborate with the authorities and the employers in various bodies set up in the petroleum industry.
.It therefore appears that the oilworkers' unions have been enabled to be reconstituted and are in a position to carry on their functions normally.
.With respect to the allegations relating to the trade union situation in general, the Committee reached the following conclusions, which were approved by the Governing Body when it adopted the Sixth Report of the Committee at its st Session:
.From its examination of the case as a whole, the Committee has reached the following conclusions:
.In conclusion, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to express the hope that the discussions on the measures necessary to secure a fuller application of the principles of freedom of association which have been taking place between the Venezuelan Government and the national and international trade union organisations concerned will be continued, and, in this connection, to decide to draw the attention of the Government of Venezuela to the desirability of:(i) taking appropriate measures to ensure to employers and workers full freedom to form, within the limits of the law, organisations of their own choosing and to join such organisations ;(ii) re-examining the cases of trade union leaders who are stated still to be in custody under the provisions of emergency legislation, in order to ensure that no person shall, without having had the benefit of the guarantees afforded by normal judicial procedure, be deprived of his freedom because of his membership of a trade union or of his lawful trade union activities ;(iii) re-examining the legal provisions at present in force with respect to employers' and workers' organisations in order to bring them into harmony with the principles laid down in the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, , and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  and, in particular, the provisions relating to the cancellation of the registration of trade unions and to the dissolution of trade unions by administrative authority.OBSERVATIONS PRESENTED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF VENEZUELA ON CERTAIN OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE COMMITTEE IN CASE No. .In a communication dated  October  the Government of Venezuela transmitted a study made by the Ministry of Labour containing a comparison between the recommendations put forward by the Committee in subparagraphs (i) and (iii) of paragraph  of its Sixth Report and the legal provisions in force in Venezuela.
.In a communication dated  October  the Government of Venezuela transmitted a study made by the Ministry of Labour containing a comparison between the recommendations put forward by the Committee in subparagraphs (i) and (iii) of paragraph  of its Sixth Report and the legal provisions in force in Venezuela.
.With reference to the first recommendation concerning the desirability of taking appropriate measures to ensure to employers and workers full freedom to form, within the limits of the law, organisations of their own choosing and to join such organisations, the Government cites article  of its Labour Law, which accords the right to form industrial associations to persons of either sex in the same undertaking or in the same trade or occupation or in similar or related trades or occupations whether of an intellectual or manual character. Article  provides that industrial associations may be composed of employers, salaried employees or wage-earning employees or both, or persons engaged in liberal professions or independent occupations. Articles  and  prohibit various acts of interference by the authorities in the operation of trade unions and acts of anti-union discrimination. The Government declares that these provisions not only implement the principles enunciated in the Committee's recommendations but go beyond them, and that the application of the provisions of the Labour Law is effectively ensured by the Ministry of Labour being made responsible for its enforcement and by the labour inspectors being given the duty of seeing that the provisions of the Law are complied with in their areas of jurisdiction.
.With respect to the recommendation in subparagraph (iii) of paragraph  of the Committee's Sixth Report as to the desirability of the Government re-examining its legislation with a view to bringing it into harmony with the principles laid down",-1,1953,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
26,"in the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Government explains the position in Venezuela as follows. With respect to the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, , the Government considers that the principle of Article  thereof is applied by articles , ,  and  of the Labour Law referred to above, and that the right of associations to draw up their Constitutions and rules (Article  of the Convention) is provided for in articles ,  and  of the Labour Law, the duty of the labour inspectors to examine the Constitution and rules of an association being intended solely to verify the lawfulness of the organisation's Constitution, in conformity with Article  of the Convention and, therefore, being calculated to protect and not to impair the guarantees of freedom of association. The right to form federations and Confederations (Article  of the Convention) is embodied in article  of the Labour Law and regulated in detail in articles  and .
.Trade unions are prohibited from federating with political associations or parties affiliated thereto. Under article  of the Law, the Federal Government shall lay down rules to govern all matters connected with employers' or employees' Conventions or congresses.
.The definition of "" organisations "" as organisations for furthering or defending the interest of workers or employers (Article  of the Convention) is met by the definition of the objects of industrial associations contained in article  of the Law, while the undertaking to ensure that the right to organise is freely exercised (Article  of the Convention) is implemented by the provisions in Venezuelan law making the labour authorities responsible for ensuring compliance with legal provisions. The principle of industrial associations not being liable to administrative dissolution or suspension (Article  of the Convention) is applied, in the Government's view, by the fact that when dissolution occurs as an exceptional measure by order of the administrative authorities, the trade unions have a right of appeal to the Federal Chamber of the Court of Appeal.
.Finally, the provision in Article  of the Convention concerning its application to the armed forces and police is in accordance with the provision in the Labour Law (article ) excluding from its application members of the armed forces and officials and salaried employees in public service.
.With respect to the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Government relates its commentary to the principles as to the protection of workers against anti-union discrimination (Article ), the protection of workers' and employers' organisations against acts of interference by each other or each other's agents or members (Article ), the establishment of machinery to ensure respect for the right to organise (Article ), and the taking of measures, where necessary, to encourage and promote the development and utilisation of machinery for voluntary negotiation. With these provisions the Government compares a number of provisions in the Venezuelan Labour Law which prohibit acts of interference with the operation of trade unions and the exercise of the right to organise (articles  and ) ; article  lays down, among other things, that the aims of industrial associations shall be to conclude collective agreements and to uphold their members' rights under such agreements and to represent their members in labour negotiation, conciliation and arbitration. Article  affords protection against dismissal or prejudice to the intending founders of trade unions and members of trade union executive committees except in cases where the labour inspector decides, on the evidence, that a particular dismissal is reasonable. Article  obliges an employer whose employees are organised to conclude a collective agreement if requested by the workers concerned. Finally, the Government refers to the provisions in articles  and  ensuring the continuity of application of a collective agreement if an employer ceases to be affiliated to the contracting employers' association or if a contracting union or group of employees is dissolved. The Government claims that these provisions in the Labour Law embody and even go beyond the corresponding provisions contained in the said Convention.
.At its Seventh Session (November ) the Committee examined the observations presented by the Government of Venezuela and considered that they did not contain any elements which should cause it to modify the conclusions formulated in its Sixth Report (paragraphs  and ). Whereas the partial observations presented by the Government of Venezuela consisted in the main of a comparative analysis of the provisions of international Conventions relating to freedom of association and the Venezuelan legal system, the conclusions of the Committee in its Sixth Report related exclusively to a situation of fact in respect of which no new elements of information had been presented by the Government of Venezuela.
.Having regard to these considerations, the Committee, while thanking the Government of Venezuela for its observations, considers that they do not call for any modification of the conclusions formulated in paragraph  of its Sixth Report.FURTHER COMPLAINTS PRESENTED BY THE INTERNATIONAL CONFEDERATION OF FREE TRADE UNIONS, THE INTER-AMERICAN REGIONAL ORGANISATION OF WORKERS, THE WORLD FEDERATION OF TRADE UNIONS, THE PERUVIAN PETROLEUM WORKERS' FEDERATION, THE INTERNATIONAL LONGSHOREMEN'S AND WAREHOUSEMEN'S UNION (SAN FRANCISCO), THE TRADE UNION INTERNATIONAL OF WORKERS IN THE CHEMICALS PETROLEUM AND ALLIED INDUSTRIES AND THE INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION OF CHRISTIAN TRADE UNIONS
.Subsequent to the adoption of its Sixth Report the Committee received a number of complaints of violations of trade union rights in Venezuela with respect to which it has not had the opportunity of reporting to the Governing Body. The first, dated  December , was presented by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions to the Secretary-General of the United Nations and transmitted by him to the I.L.O. The second, dated  April , was presented directly to the I.L.O by the Inter-American Regional Organisation of Workers. The third, dated  March , was presented by the World Federation of Trade Unions to the Secretary-General of the United Nations and transmitted by him to the I.L.O. The fourth, dated  October , was presented directly to the I.L.O by the Peruvian Petroleum Workers' Federation. The fifth, dated  November , was presented to the Secretary-General of the United Nations by the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union (San Francisco) and referred by him to the I.L.O. The sixth, dated  January , was presented directly to the I.L.O by the Trade Union International of Workers in the Chemical, Petroleum and Allied Industries. Finally, the seventh, dated  June , was presented directly to the I.L.O by the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions. These complaints are analysed separately in the following pages.Complaint of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (Communication dated  December )Analysis of the Complaint
.In its complaint, the I.C.F.T.U, after referring to the Venezuelan general elections in , stated that the people of Venezuela "" has courageously affirmed its existence in spite of the suppression of the rights of the workers and of freedom of association."". The complainant demanded a thorough investigation into the violations of trade union rights in Venezuela.
.As the complaint of the I.C.F.T.U contained allegations of a general character similar to those already examined in its Sixth Report, the Committee, at its meeting on  June , decided to communicate the complaint to the Venezuelan Government for information, in the light of the recommendations approved by the Governing Body.Analysis of the Reply (Communication dated  October )
.In this communication the Government confirmed the observations which it had made with respect to the Sixth Report of the Committee, and declared, with respect to this complaint and to the complaint presented on  April  by the Inter-American Regional Organisation of Workers, that in no case had the activities of legally constituted trade union organisations been restricted ; the Government firmly defended the rights of trade union organisations provided that they acted within the limits of their legally specified duties.Complaints of the Inter-American Regional Organisation of Workers (Communication dated  April ), the World Federation of Trade Unions (Communication dated  March ) and the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union (Communication dated  November )Analysis of the Complaints
.On the basis of a letter of protest from Mr. Augusto Malav Villalba, General Secretary of the Venezuelan Confederation of Workers, which is affiliated to the Inter-American Regional Organisation of Workers (I.R.O.W), the complaint presented by the latter organisation alleged that, in spite of the efforts made by the I.L.O, following repeated complaints, to persuade the Venezuelan Government to fully recognise trade union rights, the Government was still pursuing a policy of repression of trade unions. Hundreds of trade union leaders were still in prison, including, in particular, Mr. Prez Salinas, the President of the Venezuelan Workers' Confederation. Mr. Ramn Quijada, the General Secretary of the Confederation, responsible for agricultural questions and deputy of Mr. Prez Salinas, had also been arrested.
.The complaint presented by the World Federation of Trade Unions",-1,1953,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
27,".In the complaints submitted it is alleged that the Colombian Government is pursuing a policy of repression of trade union rights and that agricultural workers who carry on trade union activity are arrested and sentenced for so doing. In support of this general charge, the complainants have put forward two specific allegations:(a) In one of the complaints it is alleged that Mr. Elsia Molina, an agricultural worker, has been condemned to three years' hard labour, while another agricultural worker, Mr. Carlos Arias, has been court-martial led and sentenced to one year's imprisonment without being given a chance to defend himself.(b) In the other five complaints it is alleged that Mr. Luis Hortiz, the leader of the peasants, has been assassinated after being brutally tortured because he refused to denounce other leaders of the democratic trade union movement.
.In its reply dated  September  the Colombian Government dealt only with the allegation concerning the torture of Mr. Luis Ortiz, stating that the accusation was absurd and tendentious. The Ministry of Labour, which had care fully inquired into the matter, had found nothing to give rise to any supposition that the alleged offence had been committed. In the course of the inquiry the Ministry consulted the register of trade unions, which contains the names of the officials of the different trade unions in Colombia; three persons named Luis Ortiz were on the register but none of them had undergone the torture referred to. The Government had therefore come to the conclusion that the sole purpose of the complaint was to discredit internationally the social progress achieved by the Colombian Government.
.When examining the case at its meeting in November  the Committee observed that the Government's reply contained no observations with respect to the allegation relating to the arrest of Messrs. Elsia Molina and Carlos Arias. With respect to the allegation relating to Mr. Luis Hortiz the Committee took the view that the statement by the Government to the effect that three persons named Luis Ortiz appeared on the register of trade unions and were in good health did not in itself exclude the possibility that a leader of the peasants, who might perhaps have belonged to an organisation which had been deprived of legal personality under the legislation in force so that the names of its officials would not appear on the trade union register, might have been tortured.
.The Committee, therefore, decided to request the Director-General to ask the Colombian Government for further information.
.The Director-General conveyed this request to the Colombian Government by a letter dated  December .
.In its reply dated  March  the Government reaffirms that the complainants' allegations are entirely unfounded. In particular, it appears as a result of the further inquiries which the Government has conducted with the greatest care that none of the persons whose trade union rights are alleged to have been infringed appears in the trade union register or is known to the labour authorities. Persons bearing the name of Carlos Araya or Arias, Elsia Molina and Luis Ortiz or Hortiz, or any similar name, are enjoying all the rights and freedoms accorded to them by law.
.The Committee recalls that, in its Sixth Report, it examined a complaint presented by the World Federation of Trade Unions in which it was alleged that certain Colombian trade union leaders, including Mr. Carlos Araya, had been persecuted by the Colombian Government.
.The conclusions reached by the Committee in that case were as follows:
.The Colombian Government gives a formal assurance that, after addressing an inquiry to the administrative and judicial authorities, it has been unable to trace the name of the person -Mr. Carlos Arayas - alleged to have been persecuted because of his trade union activities. It maybe, as the Government itself admits is possible, that some confusion as to the name exists, but it is evident that the responsibility for a mistake of this kind must be borne by the complainant because he has not given adequate details in his complaint.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that the allegations made are too vague to permit a consideration of the case on its merits.
.This recommendation was approved by the Governing Body at its st Session (- March ) and the Colombian Government was informed accordingly by the Director-General by a letter dated  March .
.The Committee notes that the Colombian Government, relying on the repeated inquiries which it has made, has not only affirmed that no person answering to the name of Carlos Arayas or Arias, Elsia Molina or Luis Ortiz or Hortiz appears in the register of trade unions or is known to the labour authorities, but has emphasised once again that persons bearing these or similar names are in full enjoyment of their rights and liberties.
.In view of the formal and repeated assurances of the Colombian Government that none of the persons mentioned in the complaints have suffered any prejudice on account of their exercise of trade union rights, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that the complainant has not furnished sufficient evidence to call for any further examination of the case.",-1,1953,Colombia
28,"(W.F.T.U.) alleged that Mr. Federico Rondn, a member of the Central Committee of the Confederation of Latin American Workers, was arrested on  December  on his return from the Third World Trade Union Congress (W.F.T.U.) and subjected to brutal torture. His wife was also arbitrarily imprisoned. The complaint emphasised that no charge had been brought against Mr. Federico Rondn and that he left the country in October  with a regular passport issued by the Government of Venezuela. The complaint also protested against the arrest, on  February , of Mr. Rodolfo Quintero, President of the Federation of Workers for the Federal District and the State of Miranda, although no valid charge had been or could be brought against him.
.The complaint of the W.F.T.U presented a series of allegations concerning measures taken by the authorities against the Union of Petroleum Workers in the Ribas and Zaraza districts. According to the complainant, a collective agreement similar to the one concluded between the main petrol companies and the "" Independent Trade Union Movement "", an organisation controlled by the Government, was signed on  September  by the Atlantic Refining Company and the executive committee of the above-mentioned union in the presence of the regional delegates of the Ministry of Labour. The signature was ratified in the presence of the civil authorities at Caracas in accordance with the provisions of the Labour Code. At that meeting, in accordance with the decisions reached by the Union Assembly held on  September , the members of the executive committee lodged a written protest against the conditions under which the agreement had been forced upon them. This protest was made public on  October. On the same day, they were imprisoned and the union offices were searched by the police. Six days later some of them were set free and the civil authorities gave them documents stating that they had been held in preventive detention and were not guilty of any crime. The other members of the executive committee (Claudio Chacn, Fernando Bolivar, Ramn Lozada and Carlos Laza) were detained for  days, then dismissed from their employment with the consent of the labour inspectorate. Later they were taken to the Gurico State prison. The secretary of the union, Mr. Rafael Castillo, one of the leaders who had been released, was forced to draw up an inventory of the assets of the union and to leave the union under the threat of prosecution. On  October the funds and documents of the union were seized by the police ; on  October, the labour inspectorate gave the local delegate of the Ministry of Labour a document attesting that, at a meeting held on  October, the workers had decided to dissolve the union and hand over all its funds to the independent trade union. In actual fact, declared the complainant, no such meeting ever took place, but the authorities attempted to give some show of legality to the arbitrary dissolution of the union and the transfer of its funds to the Government-controlled trade union by forcing the workers, under threats of imprisonment, to sign the document. The complainant considered that these facts clearly showed that the administrative and police authorities had openly interfered in the functioning of a trade union organisation and had attempted to destroy it. By a letter dated  June  the W.F.T.U was informed that, in accordance with the procedure in force, it might furnish further information in substantiation of its complaint within a period of one month. In a letter dated  July  the W.F.T.U stated that, in its view, the facts cited in its original complaint convincingly established the infringements of the exercise of trade union rights committed in Venezuela.
.The complaint presented by the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union (San Francisco) protested against the arrest, in order to impede their trade union activities, of several Venezuelan trade union leaders and, in particular, Messrs. Jess Faria, Federico Rondn, Luis Emiro Arrieta and Alicedes Hurtado. On being informed that, according to the procedure in force, it was entitled to present further information within one month, the complaining organisation stated, in a letter dated  January , that in its view it was not necessary to furnish proof in support of the facts alleged in the complaint because the Government had not refuted the allegations made against it and because the persons mentioned in the original complaint were still in prison.Analysis of the Government's Replies (Communications dated  October ,  February  and  October )Communication dated  October 
.In this communication, relating also to the I.C.F.T.U complaint of  December  analysed above, the Venezuelan Government presented its observations on the complaint submitted by the I.R.O.W.
.In no case had workers been the victims of repressive acts on grounds of trade union membership or activities. Workers belonging to trade union organisations sanctioned in the past in accordance with the Labour Law were not subject to disability and many, and in some cases all, of the workers who had belonged to unions dissolved on legal grounds had joined existing trade unions or created new ones. The measures taken by the Government, including measures taken to maintain public order, were based on Constitutional provisions and the Government denied that international organisations were competent to discuss them because such discussion would mean an infringement of the national sovereignty of Venezuela.First request for further information. . At its Seventh Session (November ), the Committee, while noting with satisfaction the assurances given by the Government in its communication of  October  that it had not interfered with the activities of trade union organisations and that the organised workers had not been subjected to repressive measures because of their trade union affiliation, observed that the Government gave no information with reference to the allegation that certain trade union leaders had been arrested. The Committee consequently decided, before examining the case as a whole, to request the Director-General to ask the Venezuelan Government for more detailed information on the imprisonment of the trade union leaders mentioned in the communication of  April  from the I.R.O.W. This request was conveyed to the Venezuelan Government by the Director-General in a letter dated  December .Communication dated  February 
.In this communication the Venezuelan Government referred to its first reply and reaffirmed that not only did it not place any restriction on the activity of legally constituted trade union organisations, but that on the contrary one of the principles of its social policy was to protect the rights of trade unions in so far as they confined their activity to the functions assigned to them by law.
.In connection with the arrest of Mr. Prez Salinas and Mr. Ramn Quijada, the Government contended that those persons were no longer trade union leaders. The Venezuelan Workers' Confederation and its affiliated organisations were dissolved by Executive Decree No. , dated  February , which was subsequently ratified by the National Constituent Assembly of the United States of Venezuela when it approved the reports of the Ministry of Labour. Consequently, a complaint relating to a violation of trade union rights could not be based, according to the Government, on the detention of persons who were no longer trade union leaders. Similarly, Mr. Augusto Malav Villalba could no longer lay claim to the title of General Secretary of a Confederation which ceased to exist nearly four years before.
.The Government stated, more specifically, that Mr. Prez Saunas and Mr. Ramn Quijada were arrested for illegal activities punishable by law, which not only had no connection with trade union activities but were, on the contrary, quite incompatible with such activities. The Government considered that these acts were all the more serious as attempts were made to conceal them under cover of trade union activities and thus to obtain for them the protection given by law to these activities.
.The Government concluded by emphasising that, under the powers granted to it by the Constitution, it alone was entitled to decide the course of action to be followed in relation to the persons in question and reaffirmed that the measures taken to maintain public order were not matters which could be discussed by international organisations because "" to accept such a course would mean an infringement of the principles of national sovereignty "".Second request for further information. . At its Eighth Session (March ) and at its Ninth Session (May ), the Committee decided to adjourn its examination of the above complaints in the hope of receiving certain further information from the Government of Venezuela on the I.R.O.W complaint and observations on the complaint of the W.F.T.U, dated  March , communicated to the Government by a letter dated  July .Communication dated  October 
.In this communication the Venezuelan Government presented further observations concerning the complaint of the W.F.T.U and the further information requested by the Committee with reference to the complaint of the I.R.O.W.
.With reference to the allegations of the W.F.T.U relating to the arrest",-1,1953,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
29,".In support of the allegations that the arrest of Messrs. Rafael Lovett and Lucio Sandoval constituted a violation of trade union rights, the first complainant states that the case in point deals with the arrest of two Peruvian trade union leaders who took part in a session of an I.L.O Industrial Committee as members of the Workers' group, and that their arrest on their return from Geneva was actually occasioned by a strike called in the textile industry at Arequipa. The alleged political character of this strike has been denied by the Peruvian Workers' Confederation.
.The second complainant adds that the arrest and expulsion from the country of Mesrs. Lovett and Sandoval were made without any proceedings being taken according to law and without allowing the accused to defend themselves.
.In its first reply the Government merely emphasised that the measures taken against these persons, whose status as trade union leaders it does not question, were taken in view of their Communist activities, which came to light in the course of a thorough inquiry. The purpose of the measures complained against, according to the Government, was to safeguard the security of the country and they were taken in accordance with the policy of co-operation in the fight against communism on the American continent.
.At its Eighth Session the Committee noted that the Government, while emphasising that a thorough inquiry had been made, did not give any details as to the facts which caused it to take the measures mentioned in the complaints against certain trade union leaders or as to the procedure followed in the application of these measures. Since the complaints were sufficiently detailed and the Government did not question either the fact that measures were taken or the status as trade union leaders of the persons concerned, the Committee considered that, before taking a decision on the case, it was desirable to obtain further details as to the circumstances in which these measures were taken and as to the procedure according to which they were put into application.
.In its second reply the Government stated that it possessed irrefutable proof that the trade union leaders in question took part in political activities which were entirely distinct from their trade union activities and were calculated to endanger the external safety of the country. The Government declared that this very fact obliged it not to divulge the information which enabled it to establish the guilt of the persons concerned. In this connection it stated in its reply that "" the nature of the information and the methods of obtaining it pertain to the system of protection of national security which cannot be communicated to any government, as thereby the national security which is to be protected may be endangered, and the methods used to preserve internal order, which are in many cases tied up with international peace, may not be made known "".
.After the despatch of this second reply the Peruvian Government, by a telegram dated  September , informed the Director-General that it had decided to authorise Mr. Lucio Sandoval to return to his country and that it was considering the case of Mr. Rafael Lovett.
.At its th Session (November ) the Committee decided to adjourn its further examination of the case until its present session, pending the receipt of information as to the decision to be taken by the Peruvian Government with respect to Mr. Rafael Lovett.
.By a communication dated  January  the Government informed the Director-General that Mr. Rafael Lovett, also, had been authorised to return to his country. By a telegram dated  May  the Peruvian Confederation of Labour informed the Director-General that Messrs. Lovett and Sandoval had returned to Peru and resumed their trade union activities.
.In these circumstances, while regretting the action taken by the Peruvian Government, the delay which occurred in authorising the return of Messrs. Sandoval and Lovett to Peru and the fact that the Government has not considered it possible to furnish the information requested by it, the Committee notes that the measure banning Messrs. Sandoval and Lovett has been revoked and that they have now returned to Peru and resumed their trade union activities.
.In these circumstances, the Committee considers that the complaint has become purposeless and recommends the Governing Body to decide that it does not call for further examination.",-1,1953,Peru
30,"of Mr. Federico Rondn and Mr. Rodolfo Quintero, the Government declared that, although these two persons were known to be Communist leaders and although the Communist Party was dissolved by Decree No.  of  May , they continued, while occupying their positions as trade unionists, to enjoy the rights which labour legislation and the authorities accorded to all workers in Venezuela. The facts which occasioned the measures taken with respect to these two persons had no relation whatever with their status as trade unionists, and the Government repeated its earlier statement to the effect that the measures which it took to protect social tranquillity and the security of the State in the exercise of its Constitutional powers could not be the subject of discussion by any international organ.
.With regard to the allegation of the W.F.T.U relating to the dissolution of the trade union of petroleum workers of the district of Ribas and Zaraza and the detention of the members of its executive committee, the Government declared that the situation of this trade union was carefully examined by the competent officials of the Ministry of Labour and its registration was cancelled because it did not fulfil the requirements laid down in article  of the Labour Law, which provides that trade unions shall not continue to exist if they do not have the number of members required under article  of the same Law. Everything done with respect to the cancellation of the registration of the trade union concerned, including the disposal to be made of its funds and property, was carried out in accordance with the provisions of labour legislation and is shown in the relevant records, in accordance with the communication dated  October  addressed to the Labour Inspector of the State of Gurico by the members of the Winding-Up Committee, Messrs. Gabriel Ramirez, Finance Secretary of the trade union concerned, Rafael Castillo, Secretary, and Luis Pedro Alvarez. The assembly which decided on the winding-up of the trade union and the appointment of the above-mentioned Winding-Up Committee was held at Tucupido, capital of the district of Ribas, on  October , according to the record drawn up on that occasion. On  October , the Winding-Up Committee agreed to transfer the remaining property to the trade union of employees and workers of the petroleum industry and related industries of the State of Gurico, in pursuance of the decision of the above-mentioned assembly, since the majority of the workers belonging to the trade union that was being wound up had joined this union. Only obligations contracted by the trade union were deducted from the funds remaining, including the advance granted by the Executive Committee with respect to the travel expenses to Vienna in October  of Mr. Luis A. Snchez, General Secretary of the trade union, who attended the Third Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions. The Government observed that the trade union of petroleum workers of the districts of Ribas and Zaraza of the State of Gurico could not legally continue in existence since it had decided upon its liquidation. This was the decision of the plenary assembly which was held normally on the date mentioned above. Moreover, the workers who composed the trade union that was being wound up became members of other trade union organisations. The Government added that the documents to which reference was made were at the disposal of the Committee.
.With regard to the request for further information with reference to the complaint presented by the I.R.O.W, the Government declared that it had already furnished its observations and had no further information to offer.Complaints of the Peruvian Petroleum Workers' Federation (Communication dated  November ) and the Trade Union International of Workers in the Chemical, Petroleum and Allied Industries (Communication dated  January )Analysis of the Complaints
.The complaint of the Peruvian Petroleum Workers' Federation, based also on a communication from the Venezuelan Confederation of Labour in exile, contained a request to the I.L.O, prior to any inquiry which might appear appropriate, to make representations to the Government of Venezuela to secure the re-establishment of freedom of association, so that the Fifth Session of the Petroleum Committee, due to be held in Caracas in the summer of , might take place in an atmosphere of freedom.
.The complaint of the Trade Union International of Workers in the Chemical, Petroleum and Allied Industries, also presented very shortly before the pending meeting in Caracas of the Petroleum Committee, contained allegations of a general nature relating to violations of freedom of association in Venezuela and asked for measures to be taken to secure the liberation of imprisoned trade unionists, the closing of concentration camps, respect for freedom of association and the ending of violent police action and of governmental interference with the functioning of trade unions.
.The complaint of the Peruvian Petroleum Workers' Federation was communicated to the Government of Venezuela on  December . The complaining organisation was informed on  November  of its right to present further information, but did not avail itself of this right. With regard to the complaint of  January  from the Trade Union International of Workers in the Chemical, Petroleum and Allied Industries, the Committee decided, at its th Session (May ), not to transmit this complaint to the Government of Venezuela because it did not contain any specific new allegations not already contained in complaints transmitted previously.
.The Government of Venezuela has not presented any observations on the complaint of the Peruvian Petroleum Workers' Federation.Complaint of the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions (Communications dated  June  and  September )Analysis of the Complaint
.In its communication dated  June  the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions stated that its executive committee had decided to regard the communication dated  April  from the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions as a complaint alleging violation of trade union rights presented to the I.L.O in its name. In this communication, the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions alleges a number of events "" which amount to flagrant and intolerable persecution of the free trade union movement completely at variance with the undertaking to preserve liberty given by Venezuela "". The General Secretary of C.O.F.E.T.R.O.V (Committee for the Federation of the Organised Workers of Venezuela), Mr. Elio Aponte, is alleged to have been arrested on his return to Venezuela after the First Congress of the Latin American Christian Trade Union Movement, held in Santiago in . On  February  the leaders of the Christian Oilworkers' Union (S.T.O.P) at Cabimas (Zulia State) were summoned by the local Labour Commissioner. This official demanded to see the account books and invited the members of the union executive to join the trade unions of the Independent Trade Union Movement, affiliated to the government-sponsored National Workers' Confederation. They did not accept this invitation, which would have implied the loss of the independence of the trade union, and the same day the trade union premises were invaded by persons who were not members of the union and who were led by leaders of the Independent Trade Union Movement. The Labour Commissioner, who was also present, stated that the fusion of the two organisations should take place at once. Mr. Csar Vergel Lozano, a representative of C.O.F.E.T.R.O.V, refused to accept this arbitrary command ; the premises were then occupied by force and all the goods and property of the union, including a considerable quantity of cash, were confiscated.
.The following day, representatives of the Independent Trade Union Movement took similar action against the Union of Organised Oilworkers (U.T.O.P) of Bachaquero (Zulia State), also a Christian trade union. The property of this union was transferred to the local police station. The Oilworkers' Union (S.T.O.P), in the Simn Rodriguez district of Anzotegui State, another affiliate of C.O.F.E.T.R.O.V, was also subjected to action of a similar kind, and Mr. Francisco Fernndez, a representative of C.O.F.E.T.R.O.V, and its executive committee were detained. The Oilworkers' Union (S.T.O.P) of the Sotillo district of Anzotegui State is alleged to have been treated in the same way.
.In the name of the Independent Petroleum Workers' Union, an affiliate of the Independent Trade Union Movement, threats were publicly made on  February  against the S.T.O.P Oilworkers' Union branches in Carirubana, Los Taques and Punto Cardn, in the Falcn district of Falcn State. These threats have been carried out, various leaders of these trade unions having been attacked.
.C.O.F.E.T.R.O.V lodged a complaint (without any result) with the Minister of Labour against these attacks, because it is alleged that officials of the Ministry of Labour in the different localities had helped the persons concerned in making the attacks.
.The International Federation of Christian Trade Unions was informed of its right to furnish further information and did so by a communication dated  September . By the same communication it transmitted photo-copies of documents emanating from the Direction of the Cabinet of the Ministry of Labour of Venezuela and from the National Executive Committee of the Independent Trade",-1,1953,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
31,"Union Movement. The first document states that Mr. Temilio A. Chirinos "" carries out special missions in relation to trade union matters on the orders of the Ministry of Labour "". The second document states that the same person is authorised to represent the executive committee of the Independent Trade Union Movement in all the transactions which it may be required to perform before the civil and military authorities of the State. In the complaint in question it is specifically stated that elements of the Independent Trade Union Movement, commissioned for this purpose by the Department, have exercised repression against Christian trade union organisations. In the opinion of the complainant, the documents presented prove that the Ministry of Labour has entrusted "" special missions in trade union affairs "" to persons acting as officers of the Independent Trade Union Movement. This implies, the complainant continues, a clear intervention by the Government in trade union affairs and demonstrates the collaboration existing between the Government and the Independent Trade Union Movement.
.The communications from the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions were transmitted to the Government of Venezuela by a communication dated  November . So far, the Government of Venezuela has not transmitted any observations on this complaint.
.In the light of the foregoing facts and circumstances the Committee considers that it has fulfilled its responsibility for making a preliminary examination of the matter and it now transmits the case to the Governing Body for consideration of the action to be taken and of the advisability of possibly referring the matter to the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission.Geneva,  June . (Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.",-1,1953,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
32,".The Committee had occasion to submit conclusions to the Governing Body on a number of complaints relating to alleged violation of trade union rights in Venezuela in its First and Sixth Reports. A brief summary of these is given below.Complaints of the American Federation of Labor and, the Venezuelan General Confederation of Labour
.These complaints, analysed in the First Report of the Committee related to the general situation of the trade union movement in Venezuela following the assumption of power by a Military Junta on  November . The trade union movement was alleged to have been the subject of a campaign of repression culminating in the dissolution, by administrative action, of the Venezuelan General Federation of Labour and its affiliated federations of trade unions. Many trade union leaders were stated to have been imprisoned ; it was alleged that trade union premises were closed and the goods of all the dissolved associations seized. The trade union press was suppressed ; workers were persecuted on the pretext of participation in subversive political activities. The remaining trade union organisations which were not then dissolved were alleged to have been obliged, by ministerial order, to renew their executive bodies, the former officials being declared ineligible for re-election.
.The remaining allegations related to the dissolution of  petroleum workers' organisations-again by administrative action. The reason for this dissolution is alleged to have been a strike in the oilfields. The workers are alleged to have been subjected to measures of repression, including the incarceration of more than , of them.
.With regard to these two allegations, the Government presented a number of observations' to the effect that the dissolution of the General Confederation of Labour was ordered because of the participation of that organisation in an illegal political strike. The Government took this measure only when it was apparent that the Confederation had been turned into an instrument for political agitation, its unlawful activities having culminated in the presentation of an ultimatum to the Government on  February  threatening resort to direct action. In the face of such a challenge the Government proceeded to dissolve the organisation. The illegal character of the activities of the Confederation contravened the provisions of the Labour Code and the regulations issued under it relating to the procedure laid down for initiating collective disputes. The freezing of trade union funds was ordered so as to prevent them being used for purposes foreign to trade union activity. The detention of trade union leaders, ordered as a security measure, was a measure taken exclusively on the ground of their political activities.
.With regard to the dissolution of the petroleum workers' unions, the Government stated that this dissolution was ordered because the unions concerned ordered a strike contrary to formal provisions contained in the collective agreements then in force. The sanctions taken for illegal strikes were based on provisions of the Labour Code and the Government considered that similar measures had been taken in other countries and had not, in its view, constituted an infringement of freedom of association. According to the Government, a considerable number of the petroleum workers' unions subsequently reorganised and initiated new collective agreements.Conclusions of the Committee in Its First Report
.In its First Report the Committee adopted the following conclusions:
.With regard to the allegations relating to the general situation of the trade union movement in Venezuela, the Governing Body has at its disposal the report of the I.L.O Mission to Venezuela and the observations of the Government of Venezuela on the same report. The data necessary for appreciating the position are therefore available.
.The dissolution of the petroleum workers' unions, to which the second part of the complaint relates, took place after the events dealt with in the above documents and have therefore not been the subject of any similar examination. The versions given by the Government and by the complainants differ considerably with regard to the circumstances under which the events took place which gave rise to the dissolution of the petroleum workers' unions, but they are in agreement as to the dissolution having actually taken place. It is quite clear from the text of the dissolution decree attached to the complaint that the measure was taken by the administrative authorities without the case first having been submitted to the competent courts.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends that the case merits further examination by the Governing Body.
.With respect to the future policy to be followed, the Committee made the following pronouncement in the same report:
.The Venezuelan Government has not been formally requested to indicate whether it would be willing to consent to reference of the matter to the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission. Under the procedure laid down by the Governing Body this question does not arise until the Governing Body itself has decided that the Government concerned shall be asked to give its consent to reference of the matter to the Fact-Finding Commission. Although the Government has indicated in its preliminary observations on the complaint that it would not be willing to consent to such reference, the Committee does not consider that such a preliminary reply precludes the Governing Body from discussing further whether it is advisable to make a formal request to the Government concerned that it should consent to reference of a case to the Fact-Finding Commission. They venture to hope that in future cases the preliminary observations of governments will not anticipate any request which the Governing Body may or may not think it appropriate to make after it has had an opportunity of considering the facts of the case and expressing its views ....Decision of the Committee Contained in Its Third Report
.The conclusions adopted in its First Report were amended by the Committee in its Third Report, as follows:
.The Committee also had before it a letter from Mr. Montoya, Venezuelan Government representative on the Governing Body, informing the Committee that he had further observations to present on behalf of his Government relating to Case No.  (Venezuela). Under these circumstances, the Committee decided to amend the recommendation which it had submitted to the Governing Body in its First Report and, accordingly, recommends the Governing Body to postpone examination of this case in order to enable the Venezuelan Government to transmit its supplementary observations to the Committee. The Committee will report further on this case to the Governing Body when the observations in question have been transmitted to it.
.The Governing Body, at its th Session (Geneva, March ), considered the First and Third Reports of the Committee and decided to postpone the examination of the case.Complaints of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions and Other Trade Union Organisations
.In the meantime, a complaint dated  April  was received from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions and communicated to the Government of Venezuela which confirmed and supplemented similar complaints against the Government of Venezuela presented to the Economic and Social Council by various trade union organisations.
.These complaints which, in part, repeat the allegations made in the earlier communications from the American Federation of Labor and the Venezuelan Confederation of Labour, related especially to the dissolution of various trade unions in  and to the dissolution of the petroleum industry trade unions in . They also alleged the detention of trade union leaders.
.With respect to these new complaints, as with respect to the earlier complaints, the Government presented a series of observations in separate communications forming a continuous whole and, through its representative, presented verbal statements at the Committee's meeting on  June .
.In its communication dated  May  the Government stated that there had been important developments in the trade union situation in Venezuela. Since January  a large number of trade unions had been legally constituted and by the middle of  there existed a total of  trade unions and four federations. In the view of the Government, these figures demonstrated that the Government favoured the development of trade unionism but did not mean that it could tolerate the affiliation of trade union organisations to national or foreign political parties or their engaging in political activities foreign to the purposes expressly assigned to them by the Labour Law. The exercise of the right of meeting had also been facilitated, previous authorisation no longer being required. The number of collective agreements had increased appreciably between  and . In particular, the Government had paid particular attention to negotiations in the petroleum industry, the Ministry of Labour having obtained from the petroleum undertakings a promise not to alter working conditions during the negotiation of the new contracts. The Government had given aid to the trade union organisations by assuming the costs of premises and materials. With reference to the freezing of the funds of the dissolved organisations, the administrative commission charged with administration of the funds had returned a considerable sum to new trade unions formed by workers who had belonged to the dissolved organisations. Each case of devolution of funds had been thoroughly studied.
.In the same communication, the Government analysed the jurisprudence of the Committee",-1,1953,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
33,"on Freedom of Association in other cases, particularly with respect to Case No.  concerning the complaint presented by the World Federation of Trade Unions against the Government of the United Kingdom (Cyprus). The Government considered that the complaints presented against the Government of Venezuela were similar to those examined in Case No. , dealing with associations of a clearly political character.
.In a second communication of the same date,  May , the Government of Venezuela called attention to the report of the Credentials Committee of the th Session of the International Labour Conference. In that report, the Credentials Committee recommended the rejection of the protest presented against the credentials of the Venezuelan Workers' delegate to the Conference.
.In the statements presented verbally by the representative of the Venezuelan Government at the meeting of the Committee on  June , the Government declared that the strike which had led to the dissolution of the petroleum workers' unions was, from the juridical point of view, an illegal movement, because the trade unions which caused it were bound by collective agreements. The Government had warned the trade unions of this before it proceeded to dissolve them, but in view of their refusal to take heed, the Government found itself obliged to dissolve the trade unions in order to maintain production in the petroleum industry which was vital to the country.
.In its later communications, dated  November ,  November  and  February , the Government repeated its earlier statements, because it considered that the new complaints which had been transmitted to it-the complaint of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions and similar complaints-did not contain any new allegations. The Government transmitted to the Committee the text of a speech made by the President of the Government Junta on the eve of the elections on  November , in which he stated that the policy of the Venezuelan Government was to re-establish in the country a Constitutional rgime expressed through the will of the people. In its last communication, dated  February , the Government presented a memorandum on the evolution of the trade union situation. It stated that the Ministry of Labour had adopted a liberal policy and that no restrictive measure had been taken against the trade union movement. With the creation of new trade unions in various regions of the country the ground was prepared for the Constitution of a national Confederation. The freedom of action enjoyed by the trade unions was demonstrated by the extensive amount of collective bargaining being undertaken, particularly in the petroleum industry. The draft Constitution then being examined by the National Constituent Assembly contained clauses guaranteeing freedom of association, recognising the right to strike, authorising collective agreements, etc.Conclusions of the Committee in Its Sixth Report
.The Committee, after noting that from the information presented by the Government there appeared to have been some improvement in the trade union situation as a whole, formulated conclusions with reference to the two principal allegations.
.With regard to the dissolution of the petroleum workers' unions, the Committee, after finding that "" the penalties provided for under the Labour Code in case of strikes called in violation of the legislation in force were imposed only on the persons actually responsible for the strikes but not upon the trade union organisations "", concluded:
.The Committee, on the basis of the actual facts of the case, found that the dissolution of the oilworkers' union had not been carried out in accordance with the provisions of article .
.The Committee reached the same conclusion with respect to article , which provides that an industrial association should not be affiliated to or associated with a national or foreign political group, a fact which has never been proven.
.With reference to the allegations relating to the dissolution of the petroleum workers' unions, the Committee reached the following conclusions:
.The Committee therefore considers that the explanations given by the Government have not invalidated the conclusion which the Committee reached at its meeting in January , namely that the oilworkers' unions were dissolved by administrative action.
.The Committee has nevertheless taken account of the new information communicated by the Government in its reply of  May . This information tends to show that the situation in the petroleum industry has again become normal. The Government emphasises the fact that the oilworkers' unions, which had been dissolved in , have been reconstituted in the same districts and with the same membership. Furthermore, the Government points out that the collective agreements concluded in  were kept in force and that, if it was forced to intervene in the negotiations between the employers and the unions, it was in the interest of the workers themselves, as the Government has succeeded in getting better working conditions embodied in the collective agreements. Finally, the Government has called upon the representatives of the trade unions to collaborate with the authorities and the employers in various bodies set up in the petroleum industry.
.It therefore appears that the oilworkers' unions have been enabled to be reconstituted and are in a position to carry on their functions normally.
.With respect to the allegations relating to the trade union situation in general, the Committee reached the following conclusions, which were approved by the Governing Body when it adopted the Sixth Report of the Committee at its st Session:
.From its examination of the case as a whole, the Committee has reached the following conclusions:
.In conclusion, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to express the hope that the discussions on the measures necessary to secure a fuller application of the principles of freedom of association which have been taking place between the Venezuelan Government and the national and international trade union organisations concerned will be continued, and, in this connection, to decide to draw the attention of the Government of Venezuela to the desirability of:(i) taking appropriate measures to ensure to employers and workers full freedom to form, within the limits of the law, organisations of their own choosing and to join such organisations ;(ii) re-examining the cases of trade union leaders who are stated still to be in custody under the provisions of emergency legislation, in order to ensure that no person shall, without having had the benefit of the guarantees afforded by normal judicial procedure, be deprived of his freedom because of his membership of a trade union or of his lawful trade union activities ;(iii) re-examining the legal provisions at present in force with respect to employers' and workers' organisations in order to bring them into harmony with the principles laid down in the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, , and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  and, in particular, the provisions relating to the cancellation of the registration of trade unions and to the dissolution of trade unions by administrative authority.OBSERVATIONS PRESENTED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF VENEZUELA ON CERTAIN OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE COMMITTEE IN CASE No. .In a communication dated  October  the Government of Venezuela transmitted a study made by the Ministry of Labour containing a comparison between the recommendations put forward by the Committee in subparagraphs (i) and (iii) of paragraph  of its Sixth Report and the legal provisions in force in Venezuela.
.In a communication dated  October  the Government of Venezuela transmitted a study made by the Ministry of Labour containing a comparison between the recommendations put forward by the Committee in subparagraphs (i) and (iii) of paragraph  of its Sixth Report and the legal provisions in force in Venezuela.
.With reference to the first recommendation concerning the desirability of taking appropriate measures to ensure to employers and workers full freedom to form, within the limits of the law, organisations of their own choosing and to join such organisations, the Government cites article  of its Labour Law, which accords the right to form industrial associations to persons of either sex in the same undertaking or in the same trade or occupation or in similar or related trades or occupations whether of an intellectual or manual character. Article  provides that industrial associations may be composed of employers, salaried employees or wage-earning employees or both, or persons engaged in liberal professions or independent occupations. Articles  and  prohibit various acts of interference by the authorities in the operation of trade unions and acts of anti-union discrimination. The Government declares that these provisions not only implement the principles enunciated in the Committee's recommendations but go beyond them, and that the application of the provisions of the Labour Law is effectively ensured by the Ministry of Labour being made responsible for its enforcement and by the labour inspectors being given the duty of seeing that the provisions of the Law are complied with in their areas of jurisdiction.
.With respect to the recommendation in subparagraph (iii) of paragraph  of the Committee's Sixth Report as to the desirability of the Government re-examining its legislation with a view to bringing it into harmony with the principles laid down",-1,1953,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
34,"in the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Government explains the position in Venezuela as follows. With respect to the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, , the Government considers that the principle of Article  thereof is applied by articles , ,  and  of the Labour Law referred to above, and that the right of associations to draw up their Constitutions and rules (Article  of the Convention) is provided for in articles ,  and  of the Labour Law, the duty of the labour inspectors to examine the Constitution and rules of an association being intended solely to verify the lawfulness of the organisation's Constitution, in conformity with Article  of the Convention and, therefore, being calculated to protect and not to impair the guarantees of freedom of association. The right to form federations and Confederations (Article  of the Convention) is embodied in article  of the Labour Law and regulated in detail in articles  and .
.Trade unions are prohibited from federating with political associations or parties affiliated thereto. Under article  of the Law, the Federal Government shall lay down rules to govern all matters connected with employers' or employees' Conventions or congresses.
.The definition of "" organisations "" as organisations for furthering or defending the interest of workers or employers (Article  of the Convention) is met by the definition of the objects of industrial associations contained in article  of the Law, while the undertaking to ensure that the right to organise is freely exercised (Article  of the Convention) is implemented by the provisions in Venezuelan law making the labour authorities responsible for ensuring compliance with legal provisions. The principle of industrial associations not being liable to administrative dissolution or suspension (Article  of the Convention) is applied, in the Government's view, by the fact that when dissolution occurs as an exceptional measure by order of the administrative authorities, the trade unions have a right of appeal to the Federal Chamber of the Court of Appeal.
.Finally, the provision in Article  of the Convention concerning its application to the armed forces and police is in accordance with the provision in the Labour Law (article ) excluding from its application members of the armed forces and officials and salaried employees in public service.
.With respect to the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Government relates its commentary to the principles as to the protection of workers against anti-union discrimination (Article ), the protection of workers' and employers' organisations against acts of interference by each other or each other's agents or members (Article ), the establishment of machinery to ensure respect for the right to organise (Article ), and the taking of measures, where necessary, to encourage and promote the development and utilisation of machinery for voluntary negotiation. With these provisions the Government compares a number of provisions in the Venezuelan Labour Law which prohibit acts of interference with the operation of trade unions and the exercise of the right to organise (articles  and ) ; article  lays down, among other things, that the aims of industrial associations shall be to conclude collective agreements and to uphold their members' rights under such agreements and to represent their members in labour negotiation, conciliation and arbitration. Article  affords protection against dismissal or prejudice to the intending founders of trade unions and members of trade union executive committees except in cases where the labour inspector decides, on the evidence, that a particular dismissal is reasonable. Article  obliges an employer whose employees are organised to conclude a collective agreement if requested by the workers concerned. Finally, the Government refers to the provisions in articles  and  ensuring the continuity of application of a collective agreement if an employer ceases to be affiliated to the contracting employers' association or if a contracting union or group of employees is dissolved. The Government claims that these provisions in the Labour Law embody and even go beyond the corresponding provisions contained in the said Convention.
.At its Seventh Session (November ) the Committee examined the observations presented by the Government of Venezuela and considered that they did not contain any elements which should cause it to modify the conclusions formulated in its Sixth Report (paragraphs  and ). Whereas the partial observations presented by the Government of Venezuela consisted in the main of a comparative analysis of the provisions of international Conventions relating to freedom of association and the Venezuelan legal system, the conclusions of the Committee in its Sixth Report related exclusively to a situation of fact in respect of which no new elements of information had been presented by the Government of Venezuela.
.Having regard to these considerations, the Committee, while thanking the Government of Venezuela for its observations, considers that they do not call for any modification of the conclusions formulated in paragraph  of its Sixth Report.FURTHER COMPLAINTS PRESENTED BY THE INTERNATIONAL CONFEDERATION OF FREE TRADE UNIONS, THE INTER-AMERICAN REGIONAL ORGANISATION OF WORKERS, THE WORLD FEDERATION OF TRADE UNIONS, THE PERUVIAN PETROLEUM WORKERS' FEDERATION, THE INTERNATIONAL LONGSHOREMEN'S AND WAREHOUSEMEN'S UNION (SAN FRANCISCO), THE TRADE UNION INTERNATIONAL OF WORKERS IN THE CHEMICALS PETROLEUM AND ALLIED INDUSTRIES AND THE INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION OF CHRISTIAN TRADE UNIONS
.Subsequent to the adoption of its Sixth Report the Committee received a number of complaints of violations of trade union rights in Venezuela with respect to which it has not had the opportunity of reporting to the Governing Body. The first, dated  December , was presented by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions to the Secretary-General of the United Nations and transmitted by him to the I.L.O. The second, dated  April , was presented directly to the I.L.O by the Inter-American Regional Organisation of Workers. The third, dated  March , was presented by the World Federation of Trade Unions to the Secretary-General of the United Nations and transmitted by him to the I.L.O. The fourth, dated  October , was presented directly to the I.L.O by the Peruvian Petroleum Workers' Federation. The fifth, dated  November , was presented to the Secretary-General of the United Nations by the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union (San Francisco) and referred by him to the I.L.O. The sixth, dated  January , was presented directly to the I.L.O by the Trade Union International of Workers in the Chemical, Petroleum and Allied Industries. Finally, the seventh, dated  June , was presented directly to the I.L.O by the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions. These complaints are analysed separately in the following pages.Complaint of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (Communication dated  December )Analysis of the Complaint
.In its complaint, the I.C.F.T.U, after referring to the Venezuelan general elections in , stated that the people of Venezuela "" has courageously affirmed its existence in spite of the suppression of the rights of the workers and of freedom of association."". The complainant demanded a thorough investigation into the violations of trade union rights in Venezuela.
.As the complaint of the I.C.F.T.U contained allegations of a general character similar to those already examined in its Sixth Report, the Committee, at its meeting on  June , decided to communicate the complaint to the Venezuelan Government for information, in the light of the recommendations approved by the Governing Body.Analysis of the Reply (Communication dated  October )
.In this communication the Government confirmed the observations which it had made with respect to the Sixth Report of the Committee, and declared, with respect to this complaint and to the complaint presented on  April  by the Inter-American Regional Organisation of Workers, that in no case had the activities of legally constituted trade union organisations been restricted ; the Government firmly defended the rights of trade union organisations provided that they acted within the limits of their legally specified duties.Complaints of the Inter-American Regional Organisation of Workers (Communication dated  April ), the World Federation of Trade Unions (Communication dated  March ) and the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union (Communication dated  November )Analysis of the Complaints
.On the basis of a letter of protest from Mr. Augusto Malav Villalba, General Secretary of the Venezuelan Confederation of Workers, which is affiliated to the Inter-American Regional Organisation of Workers (I.R.O.W), the complaint presented by the latter organisation alleged that, in spite of the efforts made by the I.L.O, following repeated complaints, to persuade the Venezuelan Government to fully recognise trade union rights, the Government was still pursuing a policy of repression of trade unions. Hundreds of trade union leaders were still in prison, including, in particular, Mr. Prez Salinas, the President of the Venezuelan Workers' Confederation. Mr. Ramn Quijada, the General Secretary of the Confederation, responsible for agricultural questions and deputy of Mr. Prez Salinas, had also been arrested.
.The complaint presented by the World Federation of Trade Unions",-1,1953,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
35,".In accordance with paragraph  of a resolution adopted by the Economic and Social Council on  April , the Secretary-General of the United Nations transmitted to the I.L.O by letter dated  January  the text of two communications regarding sundry infringements of human rights in Cuba, one from the "" Confederacin de trabajadores de Amrica Latina "" (C.T.A.L) dated  August , and the other dated  November  from the "" Comit de Ejidatarios de Tapachula "" (Committee of Peasant Farmers of Tapachula) (Chiapas, Mexico), the ""Sindicato Unico de la Construccin"" (United Building Workers' Union) (Fresnillo, Mexico), and the "" Sindicato National de Trabajadores de la Educacin "" (National Teachers' Union).
.For all these reasons the Committee considers that the complaint as a whole calls for no action on its part, either because the allegations do not relate to specific infringements of trade union rights or because they have already been examined in connection with Case No. .",-1,1953,Cuba
36,"(W.F.T.U.) alleged that Mr. Federico Rondn, a member of the Central Committee of the Confederation of Latin American Workers, was arrested on  December  on his return from the Third World Trade Union Congress (W.F.T.U.) and subjected to brutal torture. His wife was also arbitrarily imprisoned. The complaint emphasised that no charge had been brought against Mr. Federico Rondn and that he left the country in October  with a regular passport issued by the Government of Venezuela. The complaint also protested against the arrest, on  February , of Mr. Rodolfo Quintero, President of the Federation of Workers for the Federal District and the State of Miranda, although no valid charge had been or could be brought against him.
.The complaint of the W.F.T.U presented a series of allegations concerning measures taken by the authorities against the Union of Petroleum Workers in the Ribas and Zaraza districts. According to the complainant, a collective agreement similar to the one concluded between the main petrol companies and the "" Independent Trade Union Movement "", an organisation controlled by the Government, was signed on  September  by the Atlantic Refining Company and the executive committee of the above-mentioned union in the presence of the regional delegates of the Ministry of Labour. The signature was ratified in the presence of the civil authorities at Caracas in accordance with the provisions of the Labour Code. At that meeting, in accordance with the decisions reached by the Union Assembly held on  September , the members of the executive committee lodged a written protest against the conditions under which the agreement had been forced upon them. This protest was made public on  October. On the same day, they were imprisoned and the union offices were searched by the police. Six days later some of them were set free and the civil authorities gave them documents stating that they had been held in preventive detention and were not guilty of any crime. The other members of the executive committee (Claudio Chacn, Fernando Bolivar, Ramn Lozada and Carlos Laza) were detained for  days, then dismissed from their employment with the consent of the labour inspectorate. Later they were taken to the Gurico State prison. The secretary of the union, Mr. Rafael Castillo, one of the leaders who had been released, was forced to draw up an inventory of the assets of the union and to leave the union under the threat of prosecution. On  October the funds and documents of the union were seized by the police ; on  October, the labour inspectorate gave the local delegate of the Ministry of Labour a document attesting that, at a meeting held on  October, the workers had decided to dissolve the union and hand over all its funds to the independent trade union. In actual fact, declared the complainant, no such meeting ever took place, but the authorities attempted to give some show of legality to the arbitrary dissolution of the union and the transfer of its funds to the Government-controlled trade union by forcing the workers, under threats of imprisonment, to sign the document. The complainant considered that these facts clearly showed that the administrative and police authorities had openly interfered in the functioning of a trade union organisation and had attempted to destroy it. By a letter dated  June  the W.F.T.U was informed that, in accordance with the procedure in force, it might furnish further information in substantiation of its complaint within a period of one month. In a letter dated  July  the W.F.T.U stated that, in its view, the facts cited in its original complaint convincingly established the infringements of the exercise of trade union rights committed in Venezuela.
.The complaint presented by the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union (San Francisco) protested against the arrest, in order to impede their trade union activities, of several Venezuelan trade union leaders and, in particular, Messrs. Jess Faria, Federico Rondn, Luis Emiro Arrieta and Alicedes Hurtado. On being informed that, according to the procedure in force, it was entitled to present further information within one month, the complaining organisation stated, in a letter dated  January , that in its view it was not necessary to furnish proof in support of the facts alleged in the complaint because the Government had not refuted the allegations made against it and because the persons mentioned in the original complaint were still in prison.Analysis of the Government's Replies (Communications dated  October ,  February  and  October )Communication dated  October 
.In this communication, relating also to the I.C.F.T.U complaint of  December  analysed above, the Venezuelan Government presented its observations on the complaint submitted by the I.R.O.W.
.In no case had workers been the victims of repressive acts on grounds of trade union membership or activities. Workers belonging to trade union organisations sanctioned in the past in accordance with the Labour Law were not subject to disability and many, and in some cases all, of the workers who had belonged to unions dissolved on legal grounds had joined existing trade unions or created new ones. The measures taken by the Government, including measures taken to maintain public order, were based on Constitutional provisions and the Government denied that international organisations were competent to discuss them because such discussion would mean an infringement of the national sovereignty of Venezuela.First request for further information. . At its Seventh Session (November ), the Committee, while noting with satisfaction the assurances given by the Government in its communication of  October  that it had not interfered with the activities of trade union organisations and that the organised workers had not been subjected to repressive measures because of their trade union affiliation, observed that the Government gave no information with reference to the allegation that certain trade union leaders had been arrested. The Committee consequently decided, before examining the case as a whole, to request the Director-General to ask the Venezuelan Government for more detailed information on the imprisonment of the trade union leaders mentioned in the communication of  April  from the I.R.O.W. This request was conveyed to the Venezuelan Government by the Director-General in a letter dated  December .Communication dated  February 
.In this communication the Venezuelan Government referred to its first reply and reaffirmed that not only did it not place any restriction on the activity of legally constituted trade union organisations, but that on the contrary one of the principles of its social policy was to protect the rights of trade unions in so far as they confined their activity to the functions assigned to them by law.
.In connection with the arrest of Mr. Prez Salinas and Mr. Ramn Quijada, the Government contended that those persons were no longer trade union leaders. The Venezuelan Workers' Confederation and its affiliated organisations were dissolved by Executive Decree No. , dated  February , which was subsequently ratified by the National Constituent Assembly of the United States of Venezuela when it approved the reports of the Ministry of Labour. Consequently, a complaint relating to a violation of trade union rights could not be based, according to the Government, on the detention of persons who were no longer trade union leaders. Similarly, Mr. Augusto Malav Villalba could no longer lay claim to the title of General Secretary of a Confederation which ceased to exist nearly four years before.
.The Government stated, more specifically, that Mr. Prez Saunas and Mr. Ramn Quijada were arrested for illegal activities punishable by law, which not only had no connection with trade union activities but were, on the contrary, quite incompatible with such activities. The Government considered that these acts were all the more serious as attempts were made to conceal them under cover of trade union activities and thus to obtain for them the protection given by law to these activities.
.The Government concluded by emphasising that, under the powers granted to it by the Constitution, it alone was entitled to decide the course of action to be followed in relation to the persons in question and reaffirmed that the measures taken to maintain public order were not matters which could be discussed by international organisations because "" to accept such a course would mean an infringement of the principles of national sovereignty "".Second request for further information. . At its Eighth Session (March ) and at its Ninth Session (May ), the Committee decided to adjourn its examination of the above complaints in the hope of receiving certain further information from the Government of Venezuela on the I.R.O.W complaint and observations on the complaint of the W.F.T.U, dated  March , communicated to the Government by a letter dated  July .Communication dated  October 
.In this communication the Venezuelan Government presented further observations concerning the complaint of the W.F.T.U and the further information requested by the Committee with reference to the complaint of the I.R.O.W.
.With reference to the allegations of the W.F.T.U relating to the arrest",-1,1953,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
37,".The complainant alleges that the telephone staff in Mexico went on strike in  in order to obtain the renewal of their collective agreement, and that the Government, violating the rights which the workers had been guaranteed, broke the strike by calling in the military and the police.
.In its reply the Government declares that this complaint made against, a Government which has always endeavoured to defend the rights of the workers is entirely without foundation. The Government relies, in particular, on the following facts.
.The strike of the telephone union, to which the complaint refers, took place on  April and lasted until  April . At no time was public order disturbed either by the workers or by the undertaking or by third parties. Consequently, the Government did not find it necessary to have recourse to the services of the police or of the armed forces.
.The Government observes, further, that article  of the Labour Code authorises the conciliation and arbitration boards, which are competent to settle labour disputes, to order workers who are indispensable to continue to perform duties the suspension of which would seriously compromise the resumption of work or the safety of the undertaking. Where this is necessary the conciliation and arbitration board may enlist the aid of the police in order that other workers may ensure the carrying on of such services if the strikers refuse to do so.
.In the present case, the Government emphasises, both the workers and the employers willingly submitted to the measures prescribed by the regulations. There was, therefore, no need to make use of the measures provided for in the aforesaid article of the Labour Code.
.Moreover, the telephone workers' union in the Republic of Mexico, which is not affiliated to the complaining organisation, has not made, either directly or through the intermediary of any third party, any protest against the Mexican Government. It has never complained of any infringement of trade union rights. In fact, the strike ended in an agreement between the parties without any pressure having been exercised on either of them. On the contrary, the workers' demands were met to a considerable degree.
.With regard to the dispute which gave rise to the strike the Government gives the following information.
.In accordance with article  of the Labour Code collective agreements must be revised every two years. Two months before the expiry of an agreement the parties are obliged to enter into negotiations with a view to such revision. In the present case the collective agreement between the telephone workers' union and the Mexican telephone undertaking came to an end on  March . During the two months prior to that date the parties negotiated for a new contract but, no agreement having been reached, the union presented a list of demands and, at the same time, threatened that a strike would be called on  April . According to information given by the federal conciliation and arbitration board the strike actually commenced on  April  at noon, when negotiations between the parties were being carried on in the presence of a representative of the Secretariat of Labour and Social Welfare. These negotiations ended in an agreement which terminated the dispute. The new agreement provides for a  per cent wages increase and certain other advantages, as is apparent on comparing the text of the old agreement with that of the new, these texts having been annexed by the Government to its reply. The new contract was signed on  April  before the conciliation and arbitration board. At the request of the parties the board ratified the agreement and, in this way, in accordance with the law, gave binding force to the agreement. The union withdrew its list of demands and called off the strike and work was resumed.
.On  April  the Government of Mexico ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ).
.It appears both from the complainant's allegations and from the explanation given by the Government that the telephone workers in Mexico went on strike on  April . Whereas the complainant alleges that the Government broke this strike with the aid of the police and the armed forces, the Government maintains not only that the strike was not broken by force but that, on the contrary, the trade union concerned willingly terminated the strike when an agreement had been reached between the parties.
.The Government points out, in particular, that public order was not disturbed at any time throughout the period of the strike. Consequently, there was no necessity to call in the police or the armed forces.
.The Government also observes that the Code authorises the use of the police to ensure the continuation of work which is indispensable to security when strikers refuse to continue to carry out such work.
.Under article  of the Labour Code strikers are bound to maintain, and the employer is bound to accept, the number of employees indispensable in the opinion of the conciliation and arbitration board for the continuation of operations the suspension of which would be seriously detrimental to the resumption of work or to the safety of the workshops or establishments. The board may request the assistance of the police, if necessary, to enable other employees to perform these duties if the strikers refuse to provide for them.
.The Government emphasises that in this case no reason arose which made it necessary to call in the police, as the parties were in agreement in ensuring safety services.
.Finally, it appears from the detailed explanation of the events given by the Government that a labour dispute was the cause of the strike which is the subject of the complaint and that the strike was only one of the stages through which this dispute passed. In fact, the collective agreement binding the parties was coming to an end. Direct negotiations with a view to its renewal not having succeeded, the trade union concerned called a strike. The dispute was brought before the conciliation agency. New negotiations were opened, in the course of which the parties reached an accord with respect to the terms of a new Agreement which was more advantageous than the previous one, and the strike came to an end. These precise facts, therefore, would seem to indicate that the Mexican authorities did not intervene in order to break the strike as the complainant alleges but in order to conciliate the parties concerned in the dispute, an intervention which was crowned with success as the strike ended with a voluntary agreement being reached.
.The Committee also notes that the trade union concerned, which is not affiliated to the complaining organisation, has not lodged any complaint against the Mexican Government.
.In view of the precise and detailed explanations given by the Government and having regard to the fact that the principle of freedom of association traditionally guaranteed in Mexico has been formally recognised by the Government's ratification of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, , the Committee considers that the complaint is without foundation.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to dismiss the case.",-1,1953,Mexico
38,".In a communication presented on  August , the complainant alleges that in , , telephone girls employed by the Telephone Company (Light and Power Concern) took action in Rio de Janeiro to obtain payment of a minimum wage. The police are alleged to have expelled the telephonists who remained on the premises where the service was carried on with such brutality that one of them went mad,  others being injured and all the employees under  years of age being arrested.ANALYSIS OF THE REPLY
.In its reply dated  January , the Government declares the complaint to be without foundation and adduces, in particular, the following arguments.
.At the beginning of , four employees of the Companhia telefnica brasileira were legally dismissed by the Company. On  April , wishing to protest against the measure taken against them, they entered the staff refectory on the Company's premises, where some  persons were gathered together, and organised a meeting, in the course of which seditious speeches were delivered. The responsible supervisors were unable to restore order and had to call in the police, who sent an official of the Federal Department of Public Security, who was booed and even attacked. At the same time, another employee organised another meeting near the door leading to the Company's premises. As a general disturbance threatened to develop, the public security official called on the police for help. Ten telephonists were detained on charges of disorderly behaviour, committing damage and inciting others to abandon work. Warrants were issued for the arrest of four of them, whose names are given by the Government, while the six others, being minors, were committed to the Juvenile Court. The ten telephonists arrested were immediately admitted to bail.
.The Government states that no person was injured and that no minor was imprisoned.
.On  November , the Brazilian Government ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention (No. ), . Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention (No. ), .
.The complainant alleges, in particular, that on the occasion of a strike called for the purpose of obtaining payment of a minimum wage by the Rio de Janeiro Telephone Company, the police intervened with such violence that several employees were injured and one young girl went mad. All the employees under  years of age are alleged to have been arrested.
.The Government declares that the case in question was not one of a strike but of a disturbance committed on the premises of the Telephone Company by four employees, who entered in order to protest against their dismissal, which had been legally effected. The responsible supervisors were unable to restore order and had to call in the police. Ten telephonists were arrested on charges of disorderly behaviour, committing damage and inciting others to abandon work. These ten persons, including the six minors committed to the Juvenile Court, were immediately admitted to bail. The Government emphasises that no person was injured nor were any minors imprisoned.
.The complaint consists essentially of the allegation that on the occasion of a collective action taken by telephonists in order to obtain payment of a minimum wage, violence was exercised against the strikers by the police and that, for this reason, there was an infringement of the free exercise of trade union rights.
.The Government, on the other hand, denies that there was any strike. According to the Government, disturbances broke out as a result of the intrusion in the Company's premises of four telephonists who had been legally dismissed, and who had consequently ceased to belong to the staff of the undertaking. As the responsible supervisors could not control the disturbance, they asked for the police to intervene to restore order. It is stated that no one was injured as a result of this intervention. The ten persons concerned were arrested on charges which have no direct relation to trade union rights : committing damage, disorderly behaviour, inciting others to abandon work ; they were immediately admitted to bail.
.In view of the explanation given by the Government that the Brazilian authorities intervened solely in order to restore order on the premises of the Telephone Company, the Committee considers that the complainant has not offered sufficient proof to show that any infringement of the free exercise of trade union rights occurred in the case in question and, therefore, recommends the Governing Body to decide that the case does not call for further examination.",-1,1953,Brazil
39,"of Mr. Federico Rondn and Mr. Rodolfo Quintero, the Government declared that, although these two persons were known to be Communist leaders and although the Communist Party was dissolved by Decree No.  of  May , they continued, while occupying their positions as trade unionists, to enjoy the rights which labour legislation and the authorities accorded to all workers in Venezuela. The facts which occasioned the measures taken with respect to these two persons had no relation whatever with their status as trade unionists, and the Government repeated its earlier statement to the effect that the measures which it took to protect social tranquillity and the security of the State in the exercise of its Constitutional powers could not be the subject of discussion by any international organ.
.With regard to the allegation of the W.F.T.U relating to the dissolution of the trade union of petroleum workers of the district of Ribas and Zaraza and the detention of the members of its executive committee, the Government declared that the situation of this trade union was carefully examined by the competent officials of the Ministry of Labour and its registration was cancelled because it did not fulfil the requirements laid down in article  of the Labour Law, which provides that trade unions shall not continue to exist if they do not have the number of members required under article  of the same Law. Everything done with respect to the cancellation of the registration of the trade union concerned, including the disposal to be made of its funds and property, was carried out in accordance with the provisions of labour legislation and is shown in the relevant records, in accordance with the communication dated  October  addressed to the Labour Inspector of the State of Gurico by the members of the Winding-Up Committee, Messrs. Gabriel Ramirez, Finance Secretary of the trade union concerned, Rafael Castillo, Secretary, and Luis Pedro Alvarez. The assembly which decided on the winding-up of the trade union and the appointment of the above-mentioned Winding-Up Committee was held at Tucupido, capital of the district of Ribas, on  October , according to the record drawn up on that occasion. On  October , the Winding-Up Committee agreed to transfer the remaining property to the trade union of employees and workers of the petroleum industry and related industries of the State of Gurico, in pursuance of the decision of the above-mentioned assembly, since the majority of the workers belonging to the trade union that was being wound up had joined this union. Only obligations contracted by the trade union were deducted from the funds remaining, including the advance granted by the Executive Committee with respect to the travel expenses to Vienna in October  of Mr. Luis A. Snchez, General Secretary of the trade union, who attended the Third Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions. The Government observed that the trade union of petroleum workers of the districts of Ribas and Zaraza of the State of Gurico could not legally continue in existence since it had decided upon its liquidation. This was the decision of the plenary assembly which was held normally on the date mentioned above. Moreover, the workers who composed the trade union that was being wound up became members of other trade union organisations. The Government added that the documents to which reference was made were at the disposal of the Committee.
.With regard to the request for further information with reference to the complaint presented by the I.R.O.W, the Government declared that it had already furnished its observations and had no further information to offer.Complaints of the Peruvian Petroleum Workers' Federation (Communication dated  November ) and the Trade Union International of Workers in the Chemical, Petroleum and Allied Industries (Communication dated  January )Analysis of the Complaints
.The complaint of the Peruvian Petroleum Workers' Federation, based also on a communication from the Venezuelan Confederation of Labour in exile, contained a request to the I.L.O, prior to any inquiry which might appear appropriate, to make representations to the Government of Venezuela to secure the re-establishment of freedom of association, so that the Fifth Session of the Petroleum Committee, due to be held in Caracas in the summer of , might take place in an atmosphere of freedom.
.The complaint of the Trade Union International of Workers in the Chemical, Petroleum and Allied Industries, also presented very shortly before the pending meeting in Caracas of the Petroleum Committee, contained allegations of a general nature relating to violations of freedom of association in Venezuela and asked for measures to be taken to secure the liberation of imprisoned trade unionists, the closing of concentration camps, respect for freedom of association and the ending of violent police action and of governmental interference with the functioning of trade unions.
.The complaint of the Peruvian Petroleum Workers' Federation was communicated to the Government of Venezuela on  December . The complaining organisation was informed on  November  of its right to present further information, but did not avail itself of this right. With regard to the complaint of  January  from the Trade Union International of Workers in the Chemical, Petroleum and Allied Industries, the Committee decided, at its th Session (May ), not to transmit this complaint to the Government of Venezuela because it did not contain any specific new allegations not already contained in complaints transmitted previously.
.The Government of Venezuela has not presented any observations on the complaint of the Peruvian Petroleum Workers' Federation.Complaint of the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions (Communications dated  June  and  September )Analysis of the Complaint
.In its communication dated  June  the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions stated that its executive committee had decided to regard the communication dated  April  from the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions as a complaint alleging violation of trade union rights presented to the I.L.O in its name. In this communication, the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions alleges a number of events "" which amount to flagrant and intolerable persecution of the free trade union movement completely at variance with the undertaking to preserve liberty given by Venezuela "". The General Secretary of C.O.F.E.T.R.O.V (Committee for the Federation of the Organised Workers of Venezuela), Mr. Elio Aponte, is alleged to have been arrested on his return to Venezuela after the First Congress of the Latin American Christian Trade Union Movement, held in Santiago in . On  February  the leaders of the Christian Oilworkers' Union (S.T.O.P) at Cabimas (Zulia State) were summoned by the local Labour Commissioner. This official demanded to see the account books and invited the members of the union executive to join the trade unions of the Independent Trade Union Movement, affiliated to the government-sponsored National Workers' Confederation. They did not accept this invitation, which would have implied the loss of the independence of the trade union, and the same day the trade union premises were invaded by persons who were not members of the union and who were led by leaders of the Independent Trade Union Movement. The Labour Commissioner, who was also present, stated that the fusion of the two organisations should take place at once. Mr. Csar Vergel Lozano, a representative of C.O.F.E.T.R.O.V, refused to accept this arbitrary command ; the premises were then occupied by force and all the goods and property of the union, including a considerable quantity of cash, were confiscated.
.The following day, representatives of the Independent Trade Union Movement took similar action against the Union of Organised Oilworkers (U.T.O.P) of Bachaquero (Zulia State), also a Christian trade union. The property of this union was transferred to the local police station. The Oilworkers' Union (S.T.O.P), in the Simn Rodriguez district of Anzotegui State, another affiliate of C.O.F.E.T.R.O.V, was also subjected to action of a similar kind, and Mr. Francisco Fernndez, a representative of C.O.F.E.T.R.O.V, and its executive committee were detained. The Oilworkers' Union (S.T.O.P) of the Sotillo district of Anzotegui State is alleged to have been treated in the same way.
.In the name of the Independent Petroleum Workers' Union, an affiliate of the Independent Trade Union Movement, threats were publicly made on  February  against the S.T.O.P Oilworkers' Union branches in Carirubana, Los Taques and Punto Cardn, in the Falcn district of Falcn State. These threats have been carried out, various leaders of these trade unions having been attacked.
.C.O.F.E.T.R.O.V lodged a complaint (without any result) with the Minister of Labour against these attacks, because it is alleged that officials of the Ministry of Labour in the different localities had helped the persons concerned in making the attacks.
.The International Federation of Christian Trade Unions was informed of its right to furnish further information and did so by a communication dated  September . By the same communication it transmitted photo-copies of documents emanating from the Direction of the Cabinet of the Ministry of Labour of Venezuela and from the National Executive Committee of the Independent Trade",-1,1953,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
40,"Union Movement. The first document states that Mr. Temilio A. Chirinos "" carries out special missions in relation to trade union matters on the orders of the Ministry of Labour "". The second document states that the same person is authorised to represent the executive committee of the Independent Trade Union Movement in all the transactions which it may be required to perform before the civil and military authorities of the State. In the complaint in question it is specifically stated that elements of the Independent Trade Union Movement, commissioned for this purpose by the Department, have exercised repression against Christian trade union organisations. In the opinion of the complainant, the documents presented prove that the Ministry of Labour has entrusted "" special missions in trade union affairs "" to persons acting as officers of the Independent Trade Union Movement. This implies, the complainant continues, a clear intervention by the Government in trade union affairs and demonstrates the collaboration existing between the Government and the Independent Trade Union Movement.
.The communications from the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions were transmitted to the Government of Venezuela by a communication dated  November . So far, the Government of Venezuela has not transmitted any observations on this complaint.
.In the light of the foregoing facts and circumstances the Committee considers that it has fulfilled its responsibility for making a preliminary examination of the matter and it now transmits the case to the Governing Body for consideration of the action to be taken and of the advisability of possibly referring the matter to the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission.Geneva,  June .

41,".The following complaints were before the Committee : a communication from the World Federation of Trade Unions, dated  December , together with a supplementary letter dated  February  ; a communication from the Metal Trades Workers' Federation (C.G.T, France), dated  January  ; and a communication dated  February  from the Metal Trades Workers' Union of the Democratic Republic of Germany. These complaints were communicated to the Argentine Government. To these complaints must be added several other communications drawn up in similar terms, some, dated  and  February and  April , emanating from the Free Trade Union Confederation of the Democratic Republic of Germany, and the rest, dated  March , presented by the National Trade Union for the Metal Trades of Hungary. These communications, which added no new elements to the complaints previously mentioned, were accordingly not transmitted to the Argentine Government. As all these different complaints relate to identical or related questions, they may conveniently be examined together. The complainants make the following allegations.
.A Spanish worker, Bautista Nuez, was expelled by the Argentine Government because of his political and occupational activities, and placed by force on a boat sailing to a Spanish port in order to be handed over to the authorities in that country. The World Federation of Trade Unions declared subsequently, however, that the person concerned had been put ashore in Brazil.
.In the course of May and June  the Argentine Government, with the aid of the police, repressed a strike of metal workers who were struggling for better living conditions, and made numerous arrests. In this way, the Argentine Government infringed the trade union rights of the workers.ANALYSIS OF THE REPLY
.In its communication dated  April , the Government presented its observations with respect to the second allegation (paragraph  above), with the reservation that further supplementary information would be sent later.
.Not having ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention (No. ), , or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention (No. ), , the Argentine Government, referring to the opinion which it expressed in an earlier case, makes express reservations with respect to the competence of the Committee on Freedom of Association to consider questions which are not dealt with in a Convention ratified by the Argentine Republic. Desiring, however, to clarify the matter, the Government does not press this question, considering the ratification or non-ratification of a Convention as a matter of pure form.
.Before entering into the details of the matter, the Government declares that, while the State must guarantee the full exercise of trade union rights - a question which is no longer a matter for discussion in Argentina-and ensure that the decisions of a trade union organisation, adopted by a majority in accordance with its Constitution and rules, shall be respected, it must also protect the community against any act by an organisation which is contrary to public order or to law.
.The Government then explains the facts which are the subject of the complaints. During April  negotiations took place at the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare between the Metal Trade Workers' Union and the Argentine Metal Industries Federation. These negotiations failed, and the employees of the undertakings in the metal industry started a go-slow strike. On  April , the union formally decided to call a strike, which was to develop progressively. By  May, the strike was general throughout the metal trades industry. On  May, a collective agreement was signed before the labour authority and submitted for approval to an extraordinary congress of delegates from the various sections of the union. On  June , the matter was discussed by the assembly, but a section of those present opposed the ratification of the collective agreement and the discussions had to be suspended on several occasions. On  June, the general secretary of the union announced to the delegates that several sections had resumed work. On  June, on the occasion of a further meeting of the delegates, demonstrators tried to enter the room and, in the disturbance which followed, several persons were injured. When the meeting actually became riotous, the police were called in. When calm was restored, the general secretary announced that a decision had been taken to raise the strike as from  June. This decision was approved by the majority of the assembly. Those who opposed, however, demonstrated in the street, convened meetings and appointed a strike committee. These demonstrations continued for several days, but the police did not actively intervene, but simply limited themselves to maintaining order. But on  June, the day fixed for the resumption of work, a serious incident occurred when a group of workers forcibly attempted to prevent other workers from entering a factory. Two people were killed and several injured. Similar incidents took place at other spots. After these occurrences, the police arrested  persons, including elements who were not employed in the trade in question. Those detained were handed over to justice on charges of homicide and committing bodily harm, in accordance with articles  and  of the Penal Code. Order was quickly restored and normal work was resumed in all the undertakings of the Argentine metal trades. The Government concludes that these facts show clearly that the workers were freely able to make use of their rights and that, while the police arrested a number of persons, who, moreover, did not belong to the industry concerned in the dispute, it was not in order to break the strike but to protect the life of citizens. Accordingly, declares the Government, it cannot admit that these measures should be the subject of an examination, as the Government alone has sovereign responsibility to apply general legislation in its territory.
.Having regard to all the circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that, subject to the observations contained in paragraphs  and  above, the case as a whole does not call for further examination.Geneva,  May . (Signed) Paul RAMADIER, Chairman.",-1,1954,Argentina

.In these circumstances, for the reasons indicated in paragraphs  to  above and subject to the observations contained in those paragraphs, the Committee, while regretting that the Government replied only after considerable delay and repeated reminders, recommends the Governing Body to decide that the case does not call for further examination.",-1,1954,El Salvador
43,".In a communication dated  March  addressed to the Secretary-General of the United Nations and transmitted by him to the I.L.O, the World Federation of Trade Unions presented a complaint alleging infringements of freedom of association in El Salvador, which, in its view, constitute a violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ).
.More specifically, the complainant alleges that on  November  Mr. Cayetano Carpio, a leader of the Union of Bakery Workers of El Salvador and a member of the El Salvador Trade Union Reorganisation Committee, was arrested in San Salvador. It is alleged that the examining magistrate concerned considered that the charge brought against Mr. Cayetano Carpio was unfounded and that, consequently, he had been wrongfully arrested. Further, it is contended that the authorities have denied that the person in question was detained from September  to November , although this in fact was the case. Finally, the World Federation of Trade Unions demands the immediate liberation of the person concerned.
.In accordance with the procedure in force the Director-General, in a letter dated  June , informed the complaining organisation that any further information which it might wish to furnish in substantiation of its complaint should be forwarded to him within a period of one month. In a communication dated  July  the World Federation of Trade Unions stated in reply that the information contained in its complaint constituted sufficient proof of the violations alleged and that it had, therefore, nothing to add to its original communication.
.The Director-General communicated the complaint of the World Federation of Trade Unions to the Government of El Salvador by a letter dated  June , requesting the Government to forward any observations which it might wish to make.
.At its th, th, th, th and th Sessions, the Committee, having received no observations from the Government, adjourned its examination of the case. Letters of reminder were sent to the Government on  December ,  March ,  June ,  November  and  July .ANALYSIS OF THE REPLY
.The Government of El Salvador presented its observations on the complaint of the World Federation of Trade Unions in a communication dated  August .
.In its reply the Government begins by stating that the reason why it refrained in the first place from making any observations on the complaint was the fact that it regards the complaint as being completely without foundation. The Government then states that, contrary to what the complainant appears to allege, the Government of El Salvador has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) ; it adds that, as El Salvador was not even represented at the session of the Conference at which that Convention was adopted, it cannot in any way be bound by an instrument in the approval of which it took no part.
.Recalling that the policy followed by the Government of El Salvador is characterised by the democratic spirit by which it is inspired and by social tolerance, the Government makes the following comments in its reply on the facts in issue. On  December  Mr. Cayetano Carpio was proceeded against in the Criminal Court of Second Instance on a charge of having disseminated subversive propaganda. On  December  the Court ordered the preventive detention of the accused; on  April , having decided that the facts alleged against the person concerned did not constitute a penal offence, the Court dismissed the case. An appeal was lodged against this decision and was dismissed by the Supreme Criminal Court of Appeal on  June . Consequently, on the same date, Mr. Carpio was again set free.
.According to the Government, these facts show that there has been no violation of freedom of association. The competent authorities did no more than their duty in instituting proceedings which they considered to be justifiable and the fact that the person against whom proceedings were taken was a trade union leader was quite independent of the measures taken. Further, adds the Government, the status of a trade union leader which a person may enjoy cannot absolve him from having to observe the law or shelter him from proceedings to which he may render himself liable by infringing the law.
.The World Federation of Trade Unions alleges that Mr. Cayetano Carpio, a leader of the Union of Bakery Workers of El Salvador, was arrested on the pretext of having disseminated subversive propaganda and implies that the trade union status of the person concerned was the real reason for the measures which were taken against him. The complainant adds that the Government's attitude in the case is all the more serious when it is remembered that the Government has approved the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ).
.The Government states that his status as a trade unionist had no connection with the measures taken against the person concerned and adds further that, the facts alleged against Mr. Carpio having been adjudged not to constitute an offence, he was released from custody. The Government then points out that it has neither ratified nor approved the above-mentioned Convention and that, in consequence, that instrument imposes no obligation upon it.
.With respect to the last point raised in the Government's reply and having regard to the fact that one of the reasons given by the Government for its delay in replying to the accusations made against it appears to have lain in the fact that, in its view, non-ratification of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, , made it unnecessary for it to furnish any such reply, the Committee recalls' that, in discharging the responsibility which has been entrusted to it to promote the application of the principles contained in the Declaration of Philadelphia-which now constitutes an integral part of the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation-it should be guided in its task, among other things, by the provisions relating thereto approved by the Conference and embodied in the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), which afford a standard of comparison when examining particular allegations, more particularly as Members of the Organisation have an obligation under article  () (e) of the Constitution to report to the Director-General of the International Labour Office, at appropriate intervals as requested by the Governing Body, the position of their law and practice in regard to the matters dealt with in unratified Conventions, showing the extent to which effect has been given, or is proposed to be given, to any of the provisions of the Conventions and stating the difficulties which prevent or delay the ratification of such Conventions.
.In these circumstances, while recognising that the provisions of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) are not binding upon El Salvador, the Committee considers that it should examine the allegations made in the present case and report thereon to the Governing Body and notes with satisfaction that the Government of El Salvador has seen fit to furnish observations on the substance of the complaint.
.With regard to the specific allegation made by the complainant, the Committee recalls that, in several earlier cases in which it has had to examine allegations relating to the prosecution and arrest of trade union leaders, it has taken the view that the only question which arose was to know what was the true reason for the measures complained against and that only in the event of such measures being taken in consequence of genuinely trade union activities could there be an infringement of freedom of association.
.In the present case the complainant simply lets it be understood that the measures taken against Mr. Carpio had their origin in his status as a trade union leader. The Government, on the other hand, affirms that there was no connection between those measures and the trade union activities or affiliation of the person concerned, who was prosecuted on a charge of having disseminated subversive propaganda. The Government adds, further, that when the charge had been dismissed Mr. Carpio was liberated immediately.
.Having regard to the imprecise nature of the allegations made by the complainant and to the statement of the Government that there was no relationship of cause and effect between the trade union status of Mr. Carpio and the measures taken against him and, especially, to the fact that Mr. Carpio was liberated as soon as the court had found that the facts alleged in the charges against him did not constitute an offence, the Committee, while drawing the attention of the Government to the importance which it attaches to the principle that it should be the policy of every government to ensure the right of a detained person to receive a fair",-1,1954,El Salvador
44,".The Committee had before it the three following complaints : a protest addressed to the President of the Military Junta of the Guatemalan Government on  August  by the Burma Trade Union Congress, a copy of which was transmitted to the I.L.O; a complaint dated  September  presented by the Pancyprian Federation of Labour and transmitted to the I.L.O by the United Nations ; a complaint dated  October  presented by the General Netherlands Seafarers' Union, also transmitted to the I.L.O by the United Nations.
.These complaints contain the following two allegations:(a) a number of trade union leaders have been arrested or persecuted by the Government of Guatemala;(b) the General Confederation of Labour and the Confederation of Peasants of Guatemala have been illegally prohibited.
.With regard to the first allegation the Committee, after noting the observations presented by the Government, recommended the Governing Body, in an interim report, to decide that the allegation does not call for further examination.
.With regard to the allegation relating to the dissolution of the General Confederation of Labour and the Confederation of Peasants of Guatemala, the Committee, noting that the Government of Guatemala had not furnished observations on this point, recommended the Governing Body simply to take note of the interim report, it being understood that it would present a further report when it was in possession of the observations of the government concerned.
.The Government of Guatemala having presented its observations, on  April , with respect to the dissolution of the General Confederation of Labour and the Confederation of Peasants of Guatemala, the Committee is now in a position to proceed with its examination of the second allegation.ANALYSIS OF THE GOVERNMENT'S REPLY
.The Government states that the General Confederation of Labour and the Confederation of Peasants of Guatemala were dominated by Communist political leaders. They installed a reign of terror which gave rise to a revolutionary movement culminating in the overthrow of the Government in power. All the leaders of the two organisations took refuge in the premises of the different diplomatic missions ; having obtained safe-conducts, they left the country.
.In these circumstances the Government, through the organ endowed with legislative power by virtue of the Political Statute at present in force, promulgated Decree No.  dissolving the General Confederation of Labour and the Confederation of Peasants of Guatemala.
.The Government maintains that in decreeing the dissolution of the two organisations it has not intended to infringe freedom of association or, in particular, to act in a manner contrary to the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention (No. ), , ratified by Guatemala. In support of this argument it points out that the two organisations were dissolved in accordance with the provisions of the laws in force. Further, the measure was decreed by legislative means, a method which, in the view of the Government, is not contrary to Articles  and  of Convention No. .
.It would appear, however, that the situation in Guatemala is now tending to return to normal. In these circumstances the Committee, having regard to the fact that the Government of Guatemala has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention (No. ), , and is therefore bound to apply its provisions, recommends the Governing Body
.To draw the attention of the Government of Guatemala to the desirability of taking all necessary measures to ensure:(i) that free and independent central workers' and peasants' organisations, as well as their affiliated unions and federations, may reconstitute themselves in accordance with the provisions of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention (No. ),  ;(ii) that the organisations enjoy freedom to draw up their statutes and rules, to elect their representatives, to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes in accordance with the principles laid down in Articles  and  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  ;(iii) that these organisations may affiliate freely with international organisations of workers, in accordance with the principle laid down in Article  of that Convention.
.To express its desire to be kept informed as to the results of the measures taken by the Government with a view to giving full effect to the provisions of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention (No. ), .
.Three complaints have been presented : the first consists of a copy of a protest addressed to the President of the Military Junta of the Government of Guatemala by the Burma Trade Union Congress, this copy having been transmitted to the I.L.O on  August  ; the second is a complaint dated  September  from the Pancyprian Federation of Labour transmitted to the I.L.O by the United Nations ; the third, dated  October , from the General Netherlands Seafarers' Union, was also transmitted to the I.L.O by the United Nations.
.These complaints, having a similar purpose, may be analysed together. They contain the following principal allegations:(a) Forty-five trade union leaders of the United Fruit Co. who were directing a strike of the workers in the banana plantations were illegally arrested and shot, together with other workers ; among them was Felix Moreno, General Secretary of the United Fruit Co. Workers' Union.(b) Thousands of democratic workers have been arbitrarily arrested and cast into prison by the Military Junta.(c) The General Confederation of Labour and the Confederation of Peasants of Guatemala have been illegally prohibited.
.In accordance with the procedure in force, the complainants were informed that any further information which they might wish to present in substantiation of their complaints should be addressed to the Director-General within one month ; none of them has forwarded any such further information.ANALYSIS OF THE REPLY
.By a letter dated  February  the Government of Guatemala communicates the following observations to the Director-General.
.The complainants give an absolutely false interpretation of the facts, because, while it is true that in July , before the victory of the movement for national liberation, battles took place in the course of which both parties inevitably suffered losses, the casualties were combatants and not trade union leaders. Since the victory of the movement for national liberation no one has been shot. If in the future any person should be executed, this could occur only in the circumstances prescribed by law, pursuant to sentence pronounced by the competent court under penal legislation in accordance with the procedure in force, which lays down many conditions which must be fulfilled before a sentence can be carried out.
.According to a statement sent to our Ministry by the Department of Labour Administration, which maintains the public register of trade unions, Mr. Felix Moreno is not and never has been a leader of the United Fruit Co. Workers' Union ; at present, Mr. Felix Moreno is actually alive and is living at Llano Chapulco, a municipal district of Los Amades, in the Province of Izabal, as is proved by an attestation sent to our Ministry by the Governor of the Province in question.
.The allegations contained in the complaint presented by the General Netherlands Seafarers' Union with reference to the detention in the prisons of Guatemala of more than , persons and to the persecution of trade union leaders are absolutely contrary to the truth. The labour laws are still in force and prohibit any discrimination against persons exercising trade union rights.
.Accordingly, the complaints in question are without any foundation and have been presented for the sole purpose of infringing the honour of the Government of Guatemala.
.The Government of Guatemala has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention (No. ), , and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention (No. ), .Allegations relating to the Arrest and Execution of  Trade Union Leaders and to the Detention of Thousands of Democratic Workers
.In several earlier cases, in which it has had before it allegations relating to the prosecution and sentencing of trade union leaders, the Committee has taken the view that the only question to be decided was the real reason for the measures complained of being taken, and that only if these measures were taken by reason of legitimate trade union activities could there be any infringement of freedom of association. In several of these cases the Committee has taken the view that it must examine the allegations presented having regard to the exceptional circumstances which may subsist as a result of a situation of internal crisis or of hostilities.
.In the present case, while the complainant alleges that the arrests, executions and measures of internment in question constitute infringements of freedom of association, the Government affirms that the persons who died in July  were killed in the course of a civil war which inevitably occasioned loss of human life on both sides. It declares that, since the victory of the movement for national liberation, no person has been shot and that the carrying out of a death sentence is now possible only",-1,1954,Guatemala
45,".The complaint presented directly to the I.L.O on  July  by the General Confederation of Costa Rican Workers alleges that the President of the Legislative Assembly of Costa Rica, an influential personality in the present Government, has laid before the Assembly a Bill which would prohibit an entire sector of the working class from performing official functions in trade union organisations.
.It is alleged that the Bill is contrary not only to the provisions of the Costa Rican Constitution but also to the principles enunciated in the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ). In particular, it brings into question the right to establish and join occupational organisations without previous authorisation, the right of workers' and employers' organisations to elect their representatives in full freedom without interference on the part of the public authorities, the guarantee provided against the dissolution or suspension of workers' or employers' organisations by administrative authority, the right to establish federations and Confederations and the right to affiliate with international organisations of workers and employers, etc.
.The complainant requests the I.L.O to intervene to persuade the executive authority to ensure that the Bill will not be submitted to the Legislative Assembly in the course of its extraordinary session, or, in the event of the Bill being adopted, to make use of its right of veto. The complaint is accompanied by a declaration presented to Parliament by the complaining organisation, in which it is alleged that the real purpose of the proposed enactment is to suppress those trade unions which are not affiliated to the Confederation of Labour Rerum Novarum, and by an issue of La Gaceta containing the text of the Bill.
.In accordance with paragraph  of the Ninth Report of the Committee on Freedom of Association, the Director-General informed the complaining organisation that any further information which it might care to present in substantiation of its complaint should be communicated to him within one month, but no further information has been received from the complaining organisation.ANALYSIS OF THE REPLY
.In its letter dated  September  the Government of Costa Rica states that the Bill criticised by the complainant was submitted to the Legislative Assembly by its President exercising the right to introduce Bills which is enjoyed by all Members of Parliament. Until such time as the Bill may be adopted by the Assembly the executive authority cannot pronounce upon it. At the present time the Bill is only in course of being examined by the Assembly.
.The essential allegation by the complainant relates to the submission to the Legislative Assembly, by one of its members, of a Bill which, if it should be adopted, would, according to the complainant, place several restrictions on freedom of association. The proposed enactment, the text of which is attached to the complaint, would in particular amend the Labour Code by forbidding persons who have been members of or sympathisers with any of the political parties prohibited by the Constitution or by Parliament to act as trade union officers. In addition, the Minister of Labour would have power to dissolve trade unions which did not comply with this provision. Persons who had been members of or sympathisers with the Communist Party could not join or represent a trade union. The fact that it had more than two members who were Communist sympathisers would justify the dissolution of a union, and the fact that it had not complied with a provision in the proposed enactment would render it liable to fairly serious penalties.
.The complainant maintains that the provisions in the Bill would constitute infringements of the right to organise guaranteed by the Constitution of Costa Rica at the national level and by the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) at the international level.
.The Government, without commenting on the substance of the provisions of the Bill, points out that, as it is simply a question of a Bill having been submitted to Parliament by one of its members in the exercise of his ordinary parliamentary functions (article  of the Constitution : "" the initiative in presenting Bills is a right of any member of the Legislative Assembly and, through the ministers, of the Executive ""), responsibility cannot be imputed to the Government. It is only after a Bill has been approved by Parliament that the Government can express its attitude towards it.
.In two previous cases (Case No.  : Belgium, and Case No.  : Federal Republic of Germany), in which allegations with respect to pending legislation came before it, the Committee took the view that it should take no action on the ground that the vagueness of the allegations concerning legislative intentions made in those cases, and the considerable uncertainty whether any action would in fact be taken at all, made it unprofitable to attempt to examine the allegations on their merits. At first sight, the position would appear to be different in the present case, because the complaining organisation has annexed to its complaint the text of the proposed enactment against which complaint is made.
.In the present case, as the Government observes, it is not a question of a proposed enactment introduced by the Government, as in Case No.  relating to Greece, but simply of a Bill presented by a Member of Parliament exercising his normal functions, which has not, for the moment, been adopted by Parliament. In these circumstances, while emphasising again the importance which it attaches to the principles that workers should have the right to join organisations of their own choosing and that their organisations should not be liable to be dissolved by administrative authority, but noting the assurance given by the Government that the Bill in question in the present case is not a Government proposal, the Committee, without prejudging any examination as to the merits which it might be called upon to make as the result of a further complaint being presented in the event of the Bill being adopted, considers that it would be premature for it to take any action on the present complaint.",-1,1954,Costa Rica
46,"in accordance with conditions prescribed by penal legislation and pursuant to a judgment of the competent court and in accordance with a procedure attended by numerous conditions.
.The Government also observes that the complainant gives no detailed support to the allegations, beyond mentioning the name of Mr. Felix Moreno, General Secretary of the United Fruit Co. Workers' Union, as having been among the victims. But the Government states, firstly, that Mr. Felix Moreno has never been a leader of this trade union and, secondly, that he is still alive and at present living in a locality the name of which is given.
.In these circumstances, the Committee considers that, having regard to the troubled situation prevailing in Guatemala at the period when the events complained about took place, it is impossible to determine to what extent the arrests, executions and measures of internment which took place at this period were connected with trade union activities or the course of the civil war and, in view of the highly political character of the events in question, recommends the Governing Body to decide that it appears undesirable to pursue this aspect of the case further.Allegation relating to the Prohibition of the General Confederation of Labour and of the Confederation of Peasants of Guatemala
.The complaint presented by the Burma Trade Union Congress alleges that the General Confederation of Labour and the Confederation of Peasants of Guatemala have been illegally prohibited.
.In its reply, the Government has refrained from making any observations on this point.
.The allegation made referring by its very nature to the exercise of freedom of association, the Committee has requested the Director-General to ask the Government of Guatemala to furnish its observations on this matter.",-1,1954,Guatemala
47,".In its communication dated  March  relating to alleged violations of trade union rights in seven different countries, the World Federation of Trade Unions alleged that the Government of Peru had introduced a reign of terror in the country which is contrary to the interests of the workers and, in particular, of the Peruvian trade union movement. The allegation was in broad and general terms but also included specific allegations relating to two named persons. Mr. Simn Herrera Farfani, General Secretary of the Workers' Federation of Southern Peru and an officer of the Trade Union Reorganisation Committee of Peruvian Workers, is alleged to have been arrested at Cuzco in February  and, after a period in prison in Lima, to have died in the El Frontn concentration camp as a result of the torture and harsh treatment to which he was subjected. The complainant states that the persons detained in this concentration camp exist under terrible conditions and have no buildings in which to live, being forced to seek shelter among the rocks and being subjected to torture. The trade union leaders sent to El Frontn are said to include Mr. Ral Acosta Salas, General Secretary of the Arequipa Workers' Federation, who is alleged to be subjected to particularly brutal torture "" on account of the leading part he had played in the organisation of the Peruvian workers' movement and in particular in the glorious struggle of the Arequipa workers for their rights and liberties "".
.The complaining organisation was informed in a letter dated  June  of its right to furnish further information in substantiation of its complaint. In a communication dated  July  the complaining organisation stated that it considered that sufficient proof was furnished by the details contained in its original complaint.ANALYSIS OF THE REPLY
.In its communication dated  January  the Government declares that it has taken all necessary measures to guarantee the normal exercise of the right to organise, which is embodied in the Constitution of Peru. Trade union organisations and their leaders enjoy the greatest freedom. The President of the Republic, in a message on  January , declared among other things that there were no political prisoners in Peru ; he added that no publication is subject to censorship. The Government will endeavour to establish "" a clear definition of the rights of strike and lockout within the limits of their legitimate exercise ; free trade union organisation, which must be prevented from oscillating between inertia and deviation.."". The Government annexed to its reply the text of the Supreme Decree of  July , which repealed all the internal security laws and other exceptional legislation and accorded an amnesty to all those sentenced for political reasons. According to article  "" a political amnesty is decreed and, consequently, judicial proceedings are suspended and sentences cancelled in the case of all persons, civilian or military, prosecuted or sentenced by courts martial, emergency tribunals, war councils of all kinds, military, naval, army, air or police and ordinary courts, for political and social reasons "". Article  orders the immediate release of all citizens covered by the amnesty.
.In its later communication, dated  February , the Peruvian Government adds that, up to that date, nobody had been detained because of his trade union activities. On the assumption of power by the present Government on  July  all political-social detainees were liberated and persons in exile were authorised to return to the country without any necessity for visas. The Government considers that the adoption of all these measures and the certainty that freedom of association is now respected in the country should enable the Committee to terminate a case which relates to events that occurred during a period which has come to an end.
.The allegations before the Committee in the present case relate to events which took place in  and  ; the then Peruvian Government is alleged to have introduced a reign of terror harmful to the trade union movement. Many workers and trade unionists are stated to have been detained and tortured. As examples, the complaining organisation mentions the names of two trade union leaders as having been tortured and sent to a concentration camp. One of these -Simn Herrera Farfani-is stated to have died as a result of ill-treatment. The reply, at a date three years later than the dates of the events referred to in the complaint, comes from the new Government, which assumed power in July . On assuming power the present Government ordered the immediate release of all political-social detainees and authorised all exiles to return to the country unconditionally. The amnesty law of  July  terminated all the political-social cases then pending before the courts. The Government's reply cites a statement made by the President of the Republic on  January , relating to its social policy and to respect for trade union rights.
.In a number of earlier cases the Committee took the view that it was purposeless to examine further complaints relating to a political situation which had ceased to exist. In Case No.  relating to Bolivia, the Committee, having before it allegations relating to violations of trade union rights by an earlier Government, took the view that though the Government in power could obviously not be held responsible for events which took place under its predecessor it clearly was responsible for any continuing consequences which they may have had since its accession to power. In the present case, the allegations relate to measures of trade union repression occurring some years prior to the accession to power of the present Government. That Government has legally terminated, by an amnesty law, all proceedings pending in respect of political and social matters, and has given full assurances that no persons are being detained because of their trade union activities.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body, having regard to the change in the political situation which has taken place in Peru and to the assurances given by the present Government concerning respect for freedom of association, to decide that no useful purpose would be served by taking any further action in this case.",-1,1954,Peru
48,".The Committee on Freedom of Association has before it the following complaints which, for the sake of clarity, are divided into two separate groups. The first group (Cases Nos.  and ) includes : () a verbal protest made on behalf of the Workers' group of the Governing Body by its President at the st Session of the Governing Body (Geneva, March ) ; () complaint of  February  by the World Federation of Trade Unions supplemented by additional information dated  March and  May  ; () complaint of  March  by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions supplemented by additional information of  May  ; () complaint of  February  by the National Bakers' Federation of Chile supplemented by additional information of  June  ; () complaint of  March  by the Confederation of Latin American Workers supplemented by additional information of  April  ; () complaint of  March  by the Maritime Confederation of Chile ; () complaint of  May  by the National Bakers' Federation of Chile and  other national trade union federations of Chile, quoting article  of the Constitution of the I.L.O. ; () complaint of  February  by the Sole Union of Chilean Workers ; () complaint of  November  by the ""Sekretariat D.P.P. Sebda "" (the Pan-Indonesian Central Council of Trade Unions) ; () complaint of  November  by the Posts and Communications Trade Union of the Free German Trade Unions (Berlin) ; () complaint of  March  by the Inter-American Regional Organisation of Workers ; and () a telegram of  March  from the People's Socialist Party of Chile. This group of complaints was communicated by the Director-General of the I.L.O to the Chilean Government by letters dated  January ,  and  March,  May,  June and  July  and  March , with the exception of the Inter-American Regional Organisation of Workers and the telegram of the People's Socialist Party which reproduce the allegations presented by the National Bakers' Federation of Chile. Since the whole of this group deals with related complaints they are examined together. The second group of complaints (Cases Nos.  and ) consists of the following : () complaint of  October  from the Association of Bank Employees of Uruguay ; () complaints of  October and  November  from the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions ; () complaint of  October  from the Miners' Trade Unions International (W.F.T.U) supplemented by additional information dated  November  ; () complaint of  November  from the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions of Salaried Employees, Technicians, Managerial Staff and Commercial Travellers ; and () complaint of  November  from the Inter-, national Confederation of Free Trade Unions. This group of complaints was communicated by the Director-General of the I.L.O to the Chilean Government by letters dated  October,  November and  December  ; they refer particularly to the strike of Chilean bank employees in September  and the strike in the nitrate mines of Pedro de Valdivia, also in September .
.In all the circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the attention of the Government of Chile to the provisions contained in article  of the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation that members of the Governing Body shall enjoy such privileges and immunities as are necessary for the independent exercise of their functions in connection with the Organisation and to decide that, subject to the observations made in paragraphs  to  above, this aspect of the case does not call for further examination ;(b) to draw the attention of the Government of Chile to the recommendations made by the Governing Body when approving the Committee's previous reports concerning Cases Nos.  and  that it should examine the desirability of reconsidering the Law for the Permanent Defence of Democracy in the light of generally accepted principles relating to freedom of association ;(c) for the reasons indicated in paragraphs  and  above, to draw the urgent attention of the Government of Chile to the conclusions of the Conference Committee on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, approved by the International Labour Conference at its th Session, and of the Committee of Experts in , with respect to the application in Chile of the Right of Association (Agriculture) Convention, , ratified by Chile, and to emphasise the importance of its taking steps without further delay to bring its national legislation into harmony with the obligations solemnly undertaken by the ratification of the Convention ;(d) to draw the attention of the Government of Chile to the desirability of taking the necessary steps to ensure that a freely constituted central organisation of workers can function freely and, with this end of view, of examining the possibility of bringing Chilean legislation into conformity with the principle that workers' and employers' organisations should have the right to establish and join federations and Confederations ;(e) for the reasons indicated in paragraph  above, to draw the attention of the Government of Chile to the incompatibility of article  of the Chilean Labour Code with the principle that workers, including those employed by the State, should have the right to establish organisations of their own choosing without prior authorisation ;(f) for the reasons indicated in paragraph  above, to draw the attention of the Government of Chile to the fact that Decree No.  of  September  which requires candidates for trade union office to have obtained the approval of the Provincial Governor, given on the basis of a report from the police investigation department, is incompatible with the principle that employers' and workers' organisations should have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom ;(g) to decide that the allegations relating to the exercise of the right to strike (subject to the observation made in paragraph  above), violations of the freedom of expression, obstacles placed in the way of the Constitution of trade unions, the disqualification of trade union leaders in the province of Concepcin and the application of the law for the stabilisation of salaries, wages and prices do not call for further examination, for the reasons indicated in paragraphs , ,  and  above ;(h) for the reasons indicated in paragraphs  and  above, to take note of the present interim report of the Committee with respect to the allegations relating to the detention of trade unionists, it being understood that the Committee will report further thereon when it has received the supplementary information that it is requesting from the Government of Chile ;(i) to request the Chilean Government to be so good as to consider the advisability of making a comprehensive examination of its existing legislation in the light of the preceding recommendations and the provisions of the Right of Association (Agriculture) Convention, , the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, , and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  ; and(j) to take note of the present interim report of the Committee with respect to the second group of complaints analysed above (Cases Nos.  and ), it being understood that the Committee will report further thereon when it has received the observations requested from the Government of Chile.",-1,1955,Chile

50,"than democratic trade unionism free from any separatist influence.
.With respect to the breaking of the pact of unity between the trade union federations, the Government states that this pact had no connection with its mediation in the banana industry dispute. That is a gratuitous statement by the complainant which rests on no foundation.
.The essence of the allegations is that, when the two federations of banana workers' unions united to call a strike, declared by the competent court to be lawful, the Government intervened, in a manner circumventing the provisions of the Labour Code, to mediate the dispute, and addressed itself for this purpose to the leaders of the minority organisation (FETRABA), refusing to have any dealings with the leaders of the more representative organisation (F.O.B.A). The complainant does not object to the Government intervening to mediate, even though it exercised its initiative in a manner not exactly corresponding to law, but objects to the alleged discrimination by the Government between the two organisations and to the making of public statements by leading members of the Government which, it is alleged, caused FETRABA to denounce its pact of unity with F.O.B.A. The Government declares that, while it encourages only the democratic trade unions, it has respected the right of workers of all tendencies to organise. Under the Labour Code of Costa Rica, however, no trade union organisation as such is a participant in disputes-a fact admitted by the complainant-because the dispute procedure laid down requires the formation of an ad hoc organisation representing at least  per cent of the workers in the undertaking, and a strike can be lawful only when this procedure has been followed. The Government admits that it intervened to mediate, although no provision for mediation by the administrative authorities is made in the law, and states that it hoped in this way to avoid the effects of a strike which would have been disastrous. In its first reply the Government states that it approached the leaders of the workers irrespective of their trade union affiliation. In its second reply, while adhering to the statement that it did not discriminate between trade union organisations but between leaders of the workers of different ideologies, the Government admits that, among other things, the President did state that the inter-union agreement was not a happy manoeuvre, as it linked F.O.B.A, which he called Communist, with FETRABA, which he called non-Communist. The Government denies that the measures it took had anything to do with the breaking of the pact of unity between the two federations.
.It would appear to be clear that the discrimination made by the Government in its mediation in the dispute-whether it was a discrimination between organisations, as the complainant alleges, or between individual persons on an ideological basis irrespective of their union affiliation, as the Government contends-raises an issue which was directly political in origin. In several earlier cases the Committee has been called upon to give a decision with regard to the application of measures which, although of a political nature and not intended to restrict trade union rights as such, might nevertheless affect the exercise of such rights. In the present case, while the Government contends that the action which it took involved no discrimination between trade unions, the Committee considers that it has before it precise allegations to the effect that, directly or indirectly, the action of the Government resulted in the leaders of a smaller organisation being consulted to the exclusion of the leaders of a larger one in a matter which was clearly of an occupational nature, and that it should, therefore, examine the substance of the allegations made.
.It would appear that the two federations, in order to secure the adherence to their strike movement within the law, made a pact which resulted in a united front representing more than  per cent of the workers concerned, and that this united front seems to have been regarded legally as an "" ad hoc association "" for the purposes of the disputes provisions of the Labour Code, because the Government has not refuted the claim that the strike which it proposed to call was authorised by the competent court.
.The Government contends that, when it mediated, it consulted leaders of the workers concerned irrespective of their trade union affiliation. Because of this, and because under the law trade unions are not parties to disputes, the Government argues that any discrimination between the persons with whom it chose to deal made on ideological grounds did not constitute a discrimination between trade unions. As it admits that its ideological considerations led it to regard it as sufficient to deal only with those leaders of the workers whom it considered to be "" inspired by sound democratic doctrine "" and stands by a public statement of the President that F.O.B.A is Communist and FETRABA non-Communist and that their fusion was an unhappy manoeuvre, it appears to the Committee that the natural consequence of this was that the leaders of the workers consulted by the Government in the mediation proceedings must of necessity have been leaders of FETRABA rather than of F.O.B.A.
.In these circumstances, the Committee draws attention to the fact that it is a generally accepted principle that workers should have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom and that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof and, also, that the law of the land should not be such as to impair, nor should it be so applied as to impair, these rights. Where a body representing the workers in a dispute is elected by those workers, the Committee considers that the right to elect their representatives in full freedom is restricted if some only of those representatives, on the basis of their political opinions, are chosen by a government as persons with whom it will deal in an effort to mediate in the dispute. Where the law of the land provides that the Government may address itself to those who appear to be the representatives of the workers of an undertaking and, in effect, to choose those with whom it will deal, any selection on such a political basis as to eliminate from those dealings, even indirectly, the leaders of the organisation most representative of the class of workers concerned would appear to result in the law of the land being so applied as to impair the right of the workers to choose their own representatives.
.In the present case, while it is contended by the complainant but denied by the Government that the Government's actions and public statements made by its members caused the pact of unity between the two federations to be denounced by one of them, it appears to be common ground that the solidarity of the workers in the dispute was not affected.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to draw the attention of the Government to the importance which it attaches to the principles expressed in paragraph  above, but to decide that, subject to this reservation, having regard to the fact that the complainants themselves do not appear to object to the law of the land as such with respect to trade union rights but only to the manner of its application by the Government for political reasons on a particular occasion, it would appear purposeless to examine the question further, and the case does not call for further examination.",-1,1955,Costa Rica
51,".There are four complaints before the Committee : one, dated  October , from the Congress of Industrial Unions of Japan ; one, dated  October , from the Union of Administration, Banking and Insurance Employees (East Berlin) ; one, dated  October , from the Railway Workers' Union (East Berlin) ; and one, dated  November , from the Postal and Telegraph Union of the German Free Trade Unions (East Berlin). All these complaints were transmitted to the I.L.O by the Secretary-General of the United Nations. As the four complaints contain similar allegations, they may be analysed together.
.According to the complainants, the authorities in Guatemala have taken a number of repressive measures against certain trade union leaders. In particular, the Government is stated to have instituted proceedings for subversive activities (an offence involving the death penalty) against Messrs. Alvarado Monzn, formerly Secretary of the Guatemalan Confederation of Labour, and Jaime Zavala, General Secretary of the Railway Workers' Union. In addition to these two names, some of the complaints also give the following : Francisco Hernndez, Gabriel Camey, Andrs Tobar, Aristeo Sosa and Arsenio Conde, stating that this list is incomplete. According to the complainants what these persons really did was to take part in the struggle to defend the rights of the workers and of the Guatemalan people and to regain the land held by the United Fruit Company and other North American monopolies.
.The complaining organisations were informed - in the case of the Congress of Industrial Unions of Japan, by a letter dated  November , and in the case of the three other complainants, by letters dated  January  - that they might present further information in substantiation of their complaints within the time allowed by the Committee's procedure. None of them have availed themselves of this right.ANALYSIS OF THE REPLIES
.In its first reply dated  January , the Government states that Messrs. Bernardo Alvarado Monzn and Jaime Zavala Cordero were not prosecuted in the Supreme Court for their trade union activities but were tried by the Committee of National Defence against Communism as a result of their Communist activities and sentenced to six months' imprisonment as a security measure. The Government denies that it has prosecuted trade union officers because of their union activities and affirms that the authorities have fully respected freedom to organise. In its second communication dated  February , relating to the three complaints transmitted subsequently, the Government merely repeats its first reply, considering that the later complaints resemble the first one.
.At its th Session (Geneva, - May ) the Committee, after noting the Government's replies summarised above, considered that it would require additional information on a number of points before formulating final conclusions. These points were as follows : the exact nature of the alleged subversive activities of Messrs. B. Alvarado Monzn and Jaime Zavala ; the evidence upon which these persons were sentenced to six months' imprisonment ; what procedural guarantees were available to the persons brought before the Committee of National Defence against Communism ; and, lastly, what action and sentence (if any) was there against Messrs. Francisco Hernndez, Gabriel Camey, Andrs Tobar, Aristeo Sosa and Arsenio Conde, on whom the Government has submitted no comments. The request for further information was sent to the Government of Guatemala by a letter from the Director-General dated  June . The Government submitted fresh comments in a letter dated  October , which is analysed below.
.In this letter the Government submits new material to show that Alvarado Monzn and Jaime Zavala were not prosecuted or punished for trade union activity. B. Alvarado Monzn is stated to have been a member of the Communist Party, as proved by his public acts : in  he was one of the founders of the Freedom Popular Front Party (Partido Frente Popular Libertador) and of the Alliance of Democratic Youth, the latter being controlled by the World Federation of Democratic Soviet Youth. He headed the Marxist-line periodical El Libertador, organ of the Revolutionary Action Party (Partido Accin Revolucionaria). He was a member of the Saker-Ti group controlled by Communist artists. In  he actually joined the Communist Party and was arrested when he was at the Communist training school called "" Jacobo Snchez "". He held card No.  of the base unit "" Luis Carlos Prestes "" of the First Sectional Committee of the Department of Guatemala of the Communist Party. He was candidate for the Central Committee of the Communist Party on the Presidium of the Second Party Congress. When the party changed its name to "" Guatemalan Labour Party "" Alvarado Monzn dealt with the organisation of its central committee, being a member of the elections board. He gave lectures on the Malenkov Report to the XXth Congress of the U.S.S.R. Communist Party ; on the thirtieth anniversary of Lenin's death, he gave lectures in praise of Lenin. As regards Jaime Zavala Cordero the Government states that he used trade unionism as a cloak for underground work in forms of communism. He campaigned for the interests of the unionised workers, against the economic exploitation and intervention of the United States but not against that of the Soviet Union. He has been a registered member of the Communist Party since .
.The Government of Guatemala ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ) on  February  ; the Conventions came into force for Guatemala on  February .
.In its th Report, the Committee examined a complaint against the Government of Guatemala relating to the detention of trade union officers. On that occasion, the Committee pointed out that "" In several earlier cases, in which it had had before it allegations relating to the prosecution and sentencing of trade union leaders, the Committee has taken the view that the only question to be decided was the real reason for the measures complained of being taken, and that only if these measures were taken by reason of legitimate trade union activities could there be any infringement of freedom of association"".
.In the present case, it appears from the Government's replies that security action was indeed taken against Messrs. Alvarado Monzn and Zavala Cordero by the National Committee of Defence against Communism, not (according to the Government) because of their trade union activities but because of their subversive activities. From the personal history data of B. Alvarado Monzn, as given by the Government, it appears that he was a person "" with an extreme left ideology "" and had actively participated in various Communist or Marxist organisations. Similarly, in the case of Zavala, the Government states that trade union activities were used by him to defend Communism.
.In several earlier cases the Committee has had to give an opinion on the application of measures which, although of a political nature and not directly intended to impede the exercise of trade union rights, in fact involve a limitation of trade union liberties. In such cases, the Committee has, before ruling out a complaint, always insisted that the information given by governments should be so precise and detailed as to enable it to conclude that the grounds of detention were genuinely unrelated to trade union activities and that other considerations were involved (protection of public order, political reasons, etc.).
.In the present case the sentencing of Messrs. Alvarado Monzn and Zavala Cordero to security measures by the Committee of National Defence against Communism for subversive activities seems precisely to be one of those measures of a political character which are in principle not intended to limit the free exercise of trade union rights as such. In Case No.  (India) and again in later cases such as Case No.  (Union of South Africa) the Committee examined allegations on the preventive detention of certain persons under public security laws. In the latter case the Committee pointed out that "" measures of preventive detention may involve serious interference with trade union activities, which it would seem necessary to justify by the existence of a serious emergency and which would be open to criticism unless accompanied by adequate judicial safeguards applied within a reasonable period "". In particular, the Committee has emphasised that every person detained should fully enjoy the guarantees of due legal process to ensure his right of defence.
.In the present case the Committee considers that the information received from the Government does not enable it to conclude that the proceedings of the Committee of National Defence against Communism provide a guarantee of due legal process in the manner recommended by the Committee in other cases, and, therefore, considers that the attention of the Government of Guatemala should be called to the importance of ensuring that trade union officers are not detained on charges of subversive activities without enjoying the guarantees afforded by due legal process.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to draw the attention of the",-1,1955,Guatemala
52,"to the principle that it should be the policy of governments to ensure the right of all detained persons to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment.
.In the present case, noting that the arrests of trade union leaders complained of appear to have been made in connection with an investigation of subversive activities but that the Government has confined itself in its observations to the statement that the persons arrested received "" the assistance allowed by law in cases of this kind "", the Committee considers that, before it formulates its final recommendations to the Governing Body on this aspect of the case, it should, while thanking the Government for the observations already presented, request the Government to furnish further information as early as possible as to the precise nature of the activities which led to the arrests being made, as to whether the persons arrested have been released or brought to trial and, in the latter event, as to the nature and outcome of the judicial proceedings taken against them.Allegations relating to the Search of the Premises of the Movimento Sindical Mundial and the Gazeta Sindical
.It is alleged that the premises of these two publications were "" attacked "" by the police. The Government states that the police, investigating subversive activities, searched the premises in question, in accordance with the law, and found thereon Communist propaganda material. It adds that the two publications are pro-Communist and are not "" declared organs "" of the World Federation of Trade Unions.
.The Committee considers that it is not called upon to examine questions affecting the freedom of the press in general, but that it is concerned only with questions related to the trade union press in particular, in the light of the principle which it has expressed on previous occasions, and especially in Case No.  relating to the United Kingdom-British Guiana, ""that the right to express opinions through newspapers or publications is certainly an essential element in trade union rights "". In that case, however, the Committee expressed the view that trade union organisations, when issuing their publications, should have regard, in the interests of the development of the trade union movement, to the principles enunciated by the International Labour Conference at its th Session "" for the protection and independence of the trade union movement and the safeguarding of its fundamental task of advancing the social and economic well-being of the workers "", and, in view of the fact that the complainant had offered no evidence to show that the circulation of trade union publications of a purely occupational nature had been restricted, recommended the Governing Body to decide that the allegations made on this subject did not call for further examination-a recommendation approved by the Governing Body when it adopted the Committee's th Report.
.In the present case, while the complainant does not specifically state that the two publications involved are trade union publications-although their titles would imply that they are trade union newspapers-the Government states not only that they are not ""declared organs of the World Federation of Trade Unions"" but that they are political in character, in that they are pro-Communist, and that the search made in connection with an investigation into subversive activities revealed the existence on the premises in question of Communist propaganda material.
.Having regard to the fact that the complaining organisation has confined itself to a statement in a telegram simply to the effect that the premises of the publications were searched and has not availed itself of the opportunity afforded to it to furnish further information in substantiation of its complaint, whereas the Government has made specific statements which make it appear improbable that these publications, whether trade union organs or not, confined themselves to occupational matters, and also to the fact that no evidence has been offered to show that the search effected resulted in any prevention of further publication or of circulation being restricted, the Committee considers that no sufficient evidence has been offered to show that the trade union right to issue publications dealing with occupational questions was infringed in this particular case, and, therefore, recommends the Governing Body to decide that these allegations do not call for further examination.
.In all the circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note the present interim report of the Committee with respect to the allegations concerning the arrest of trade union leaders, it being understood that the Committee will report further thereon when it has received the further information requested from the Government ;(b) to decide, for the reasons indicated in paragraph  above, that the allegations relating to the search of the premises of the Movimento Sindical Mundial and the Gazeta Sindical do not call for further examination.",-1,1955,Brazil
53,".On  August  the World Federation of Trade Unions presented a complaint against the Government of Brazil, and this was transmitted to the I.L.O by the Secretary-General of the United Nations on  August of the same year. The complaint contained allegations relating to entry by the police into the office of trade union publications and the arrest of trade unionists. The allegations were communicated to the Government, which presented its observations on  May .
.At its th Session (May ) the Committee decided to adjourn its examination of the case until its next session (November ), when it submitted an interim report recommending the Governing Body to decide that the allegations regarding entry into the premises did not call for further examination and postponing final consideration of the case pending receipt of additional information on the arrested trade union leaders. The Governing Body approved this report at its rd Session (Geneva, November ).
.The Government was asked for additional information in a letter dated  November . It replied on  February , stating that proceedings were being taken against the persons mentioned in the complaint.
.At its th, th, th and th Sessions the Committee, not having yet received the information expected from the Government as to the result of the said proceedings, decided to postpone consideration of the case until this information should arrive. The Government finally communicated the result of the proceedings in a letter dated  July .
.Having regard to what is stated in paragraph , only the allegation concerning the arrest of trade unionists is examined below.
.The World Federation of Trade Unions stated on  August  that the Rio de Janeiro police authorities had arrested several trade union leaders, including Ramiro Lucchesi, Roberto Morena and Moacyr Ramos Silva. This complaint, addressed to the United Nations, was transmitted to the I.L.O on  August .
.In its reply of  May  the Brazilian Government states that the police had raided the offices of a periodical-devoted in theory to trade union questions-with the object of investigating subversive activities; this operation had been carried out with due regard for the legal provisions in force, and the persons detained received the assistance allowed by law in such cases. On  February  the Government amplified its reply, stating that proceedings were being taken against the persons mentioned in the W.F.T.U complaint, in respect of acts punishable under sections  and  of Law No. ; and that they were provisionally at liberty.
.The relevant sections of Law No.  read as follows:Section . Those crimes are regarded as crimes against the State and the political and social order which are defined in and punishable under ... this Law, namely: ...Section . To reorganise or to attempt to reorganise, in fact or in law, to attempt to put into immediate and effective operation, even under a false name or simulated farm, a political party or association dissolved in accordance with legal provisions, or to cause it to function in the same conditions when it has been legally suspended. Penalty : imprisonment for from two to five years-to be reduced by half in the case of an offence against the second part of this section.The grant of registration to a new party, once approved by judgment, will terminate any proceeding or penalty based on this section.Section . To affiliate with or to aid by services or gifts, openly or secretly but, in any event, unequivocally, any association reconstituted of functioning according to the provisions of the preceding Article. Penalty : imprisonment from one to four years.
.In a letter dated  July  the Brazilian Government transmitted the full text of the judgment in these proceedings. This stated that Ramiro Lucchesi, Roberto Morena, Agostinho Jos de Carbalho, Jos Lelis da Costa and Moacyr Ramos Silva had been charged with carrying on subversive activities in the interests of the Communist movement, organising and fomenting strikes, holding political discussions, steering these into tendentious channels, pursuing disruptive aims, and for these purposes claiming to be leaders of the dissolved Brazilian Confederation of Labour. Allegations relating to the dissolution of that Confederation in  were examined by the Committee in  in Case No.  relating to Brazil I and have not again been raised in the present case, in which the complaint relates only to the arrests of certain trade unionists in .
.In the final part of his judgment the magistrate reached the conclusion that a crime within the meaning of section  of Law No.  could only be held to have been committed if the activities in question constituted a definite reorganisation or attempted reorganisation of a political party or association which had been dissolved by law. This had not been proved during the proceedings, nor had the acts specified and sanctioned in section , which could only follow those mentioned in section . Accordingly, the magistrate dismissed the charge and acquitted the accused.
.In these circumstances the Committee, while emphasising the importance which it has always attached to due process of law, and drawing attention, as it has done in previous cases, to the danger that arrest by the police of trade unionists concerning whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found may cause considerable prejudice to the activities and interests of their organisations, and to the importance of the police authorities having instructions appropriate to eliminate the danger of detention for trade union activities, recommends the Governing Body to note that the persons mentioned in the complaint have been acquitted after a previous provisional release, and to decide that for this reason no useful purpose would be served by examining the case further.
.In its communication dated  August  the World Federation of Trade Unions alleges that the police authorities in Rio de Janeiro have arrested Messrs. Ramiro Luchesi, Roberto Moreno, Moacyr Ramos and other trade union leaders. The publishing offices of the Movimento Sindical Mundial and the Gazeta Sindical are alleged to have been attacked by the police.
.In a letter dated  September  the Director-General of the I.L.O informed the complaining organisation of its right to furnish further information in substantiation of its complaint, but it has not presented any further information. The complaint was communicated on  September  to the Government of Brazil, which forwarded its observations thereon to the Director-General on  May .ANALYSIS OF THE REPLY
.In its communication dated  May  the Government states that the complaint "" originates in a mere police measure ""-a search of the publishing offices of the two periodicals referred to by the complainant, which the Government described as being of a Communist tendency, made by the police when investigating subversive activities. The Government states that Communist propaganda material was found on the premises, that the search was conducted with proper regard for the legal provisions in force and that those detained received the assistance allowed by law in cases of this kind. The periodicals in question are not, according to the Government, declared organs of the World Federation of Trade Unions. In conclusion, the Government declares that the complaint is without foundation and reaffirms its intention to continue to respect individual rights.
.The Government of Brazil ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), on  November . The Convention, accordingly, came into force for Brazil on  November . The Government of Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ).Allegations relating to the Arrest of Trade Union Leaders
.The complainants allege that a number of trade union leaders, including Ramiro Luchesi, Roberto Moreno and Moacyr Ramos, have been arrested. In its reply the Government does not state specifically why the persons in question were arrested but implies that the arrests took place in connection with a police investigation of subversive activities having a political connection, declaring that those detained received "" the assistance allowed by law in cases of this kind "".
.In several earlier cases the Committee has been called upon to give a decision with regard to the application of measures which, although of a political nature and not intended to restrict trade union rights as such, might nevertheless affect the exercise of such rights. In the present case the Committee considers that, as the Government does not deny the statement that the persons arrested are, in fact, trade union leaders, their arrest may, even if that were not the intention, have affected the exercise of trade union rights.
.If, in certain cases, the Committee has concluded that allegations relating to the arrest of trade union militants did not call for further examination, this has been after it has received information from the governments showing sufficiently precisely and with sufficient detail that the arrests were in no way occasioned by trade union activities but solely by activities outside the trade union sphere which were either prejudicial to public order or of a political nature. The Committee has, moreover, consistently emphasised the importance which it attaches",-1,1955,Brazil
54,".In its communication dated  September  the complaining organisation alleges that the Government of Costa Rica has violated the International Labour Conventions relating to the trade union rights of the workers. The complainant states that two workers' federations-the Banana and Associated Workers' Federation (F.O.B.A) and the Banana Workers' Federation (FETRABA) -decided to join forces in order to take collective economic and occupational action against the Chiriqui Land Company. In accordance with the Labour Code of Costa Rica the Superior Labour Court recognised the lawfulness of their action.
.It is alleged that the Government, in order to favour the Company, offered its mediation to seek a settlement of the dispute, but that it refused from the outset to recognise the F.O.B.A as the most representative organisation, although its representative character was simply a question of fact. The Minister of Labour stated, it is alleged, that the Government would negotiate only with the leaders of FETRABA, ignoring the leaders of F.O.B.A in the action undertaken by these two organisations. Thus, states the complainant, the Government has shown itself to be the worst enemy of the unity of the working class and nothing more than a servile instrument of the Company.
.In a communication dated  September  the complaining organisation presented further information in substantiation of its complaint. It states that a pact of unity between F.O.B.A and FETRABA was the only means available to the worker of starting a collective dispute in the banana industry in accordance with the requirements of the laws. The dispute followed the procedure prescribed by law ; recourse was had to conciliation proceedings and then the workers' representatives secured from the labour courts a ruling that their strike was legal. It was then that the Government decided to intervene on its own initiative circumventing the statutory procedure-to prevent the strike from spreading. The complaining organisation was not averse to government intervention because it desired to reach a settlement by negotiation. But, the complainant declares, the intervention was not limited to an attempt to mediate, being intended to break the united front of the workers by a move against the agreement which was needed to make the strike legal. In this connection the complainant states that, while it is true under Costa Rican law that trade union organisations as such have no place in a dispute, it is also true that the Minister did not address himself directly either to the workers or to their legal representatives, but to one only of the federations concerned-FETRABA-to the exclusion of the other. While intervention by the administrative authorities is not provided for under the law, the complainant admits the right of the Minister to approach one of the organisations concerned for the purpose of negotiating ; in the present case, however, it is alleged that the choice made was discriminatory because it did not take account of the fact that F.O.B.A is the majority and, therefore, the more representative organisation. The pact of unity between the two organisations concerned was attacked and it was stated publicly-without, it is alleged, the Minister of Labour denying it-that the Minister refused to deal with the F.O.B.A on the ground that it was Communist. In fact, the Minister dealt only with FETRABA. It is contended that the Minister of Labour, in statements to the press, attacked F.O.B.A and its leaders and spoke only against the inter-union pact. On  August , declares the complainant, the Minister stated that he had decided "" to prevent persons to whom the workers' fate is of no consequence -and by that I mean the Communists-from trying to add grist to their mill simply to promote the class struggle and to maintain a state of constant unrest in the banana plantations "". It is alleged that the President of the Republic directly attacked the pact in an interview, stating : "" The recent amalgamation of the F.O.B.A unions (directed by the Communists) and the FETRABA unions (non-Communist) was not exactly a happy manoeuvre for the democratic workers, because I feel convinced that they can greatly improve their working conditions without having to resort to communism. We always foster the growth of strong and democratic workers' movements when they are not tainted with communism.""
.All these statements and measures against the pact of unity were intended, according to the complainant, to divide the working class. The Government pressure caused the President of FETRABA to denounce the pact without notice. This denunciation, however, had no effect on the solidarity of the banana plantation workers themselves, who, states the complainant, thus gave the lie to the Government's assertions.ANALYSIS OF THE REPLIES
.In its communication dated  September  the Government states that, while administrative reasons have made it impossible for it to ratify the Conventions concerned with freedom of association, both national law and practice afford all the guarantees laid down in these Conventions. In support of this the Government refers to article  of the Labour Code, which provides that "" the lawful Constitution of social organisations, whether industrial associations or co-operative societies, is hereby declared to be in the public interest as one of the most efficacious means of contributing to the maintenance and development of popular culture and democracy in Costa Rica "", adding that the present Government has faithfully respected this principle by recognising without restriction the right of the workers to form trade unions. The Government states that all trade unions have the right to take action in matters relating to the study, improvement and protection of the economic and social interests of their members, and that no person or trade union organisation has been discriminated against with respect to the recognition of these rights. The Government claims that it has shown tolerance in this respect even at times when the safety of the nation has been in danger. Although the Constitution of Costa Rica prohibits the formation of political parties-such as the Communist Party which seek to undermine the foundations of the country's democratic rgime, the Government has allowed former adherents of the Communist Party to work in the trade unions. Despite the links between the Communist Party and such persons, the Government has refrained from interfering in the affairs of the trade unions to which they belong. According to the Government, the person behind the present complaint is one of these persons.
.With respect to the specific complaint the Government states that, legally speaking, the occupational organisations had no place in the dispute between the banana plantation workers and the Chiriqui Land Company. The law states that for a collective dispute to arise the workers concerned have to form an ad hoc association representing at least  per cent of all the persons employed in the undertaking. The dispute must be submitted to the employer with a view to an amicable settlement ; if such settlement proves impossible it is submitted to a tripartite conciliation board, whose recommendations are not binding on the parties. If no agreement can be reached the workers may apply to a court of law to authorise them to call a strike. If this authorisation is given the strike is legal.
.The law does not provide for intervention by the administrative authorities in relations between employers and workers. However, in the present case, in order to avoid the harm resulting from a strike, the Government saw fit to intervene on its own initiative with the workers and with the company without considering-contrary to the complainant's statement-their membership or non-membership of one organisation or another. The intervention of the Ministry of Labour was made in all good faith without preference being given to any particular trade union. The Ministry consulted different persons, regardless of their trade union affiliations.
.In conclusion to its first reply, the Government declares that its policy of protecting the workers is well known and that it does not see the use to refer to the other aspects of the complaint, which it considers to be unfounded, dishonest and the product of anti-democratic ideologies.
.In its second communication, dated  February , the Government refers again to the observations contained in its first reply. It also points out that in Costa Rica the right to declare a strike is not a trade union right but a right of workers in general. When the Government proposes to mediate a dispute it does not have to choose between trade union leaders ; it is sufficient to deal with workers inspired by sound democratic doctrine who enjoy the confidence of their comrades. The statements by the President of the Republic and the Minister of Labour mentioned by the complainant are substantially correct and were justified because the intervention in the dispute of Communist leaders and agitators was a secret to nobody. The Government did not discriminate between trade unions but with respect to ideological groups tainted with communism. When the Government takes measures against the members of such groups it cares little for their trade union affiliation. The Government, however, cannot support any form of trade unionism other",-1,1955,Costa Rica

56,".At its th Session (Geneva, May ), the Committee had before it a series of complaints, constituting Cases Nos. , ,  and , relating to Chile. The cases were considered together.
.The Committee's conclusions regarding the different allegations made by the complainants are contained in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, and its recommendations to the Governing Body in paragraph . The Committee's th Report was approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (Geneva, May-June ).
.On three of these allegations the Committee submitted only interim conclusions. The allegations in question are those relating to the imprisonment of trade unionists, with regard to which the Government was asked to supply additional information, and those relating to violation of trade union rights and to reprisals against trade unionists in connection with a strike of bank employees and a strike in the nitrate mines, with regard to which the Government had not Yet forwarded its observations
.These three groups of allegations are the only ones still before the Committee for consideration, and the following analyses relate exclusively to these three groups.
.In all the circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to reaffirm the observations which it made in paragraphs  and  of the th Report of the Committee concerning the severity of the Law for the Permanent Defence of Democracy with respect to the question of strikes, and to suggest to the Government once again that it might consider the possibility of re-examining the provisions of that Law in the light of the generally accepted principles with respect to freedom of association ; but to decide, for the reasons indicated in paragraphs  to  above and having regard to the fact that all the five persons concerned have been liberated, that it is inappropriate to pursue further the examination of the allegations relating to the arrest and sentencing of the leaders of the Sole Union of Chilean Workers (C.U.T.CH) ;(b) to take note with satisfaction, with respect to the arrests of the hundred or so persons alleged by the World Federation of Trade Unions, of the Government's statement that all the persons in question were liberated on  February  and to decide that this aspect of the case does not, therefore, call for further examination ;(c) to draw the attention of the Government to its view that acts of discrimination in connection with a peaceful strike are inconsistent with the maintenance of satisfactory industrial relations and incompatible with the best industrial practice and to the undesirability of persons appointed temporarily by the Government to control the banks falling below this standard ;(d) to draw the attention of the Government to its view that the initiation of the measures against Mr. Goldsack Donoso in his absence by the government controller of the bank by which he was employed is inconsistent with the duty of the Government both to refrain itself from taking measures calculated to interfere with a delegate to an I.L.O.

.The Committee on Freedom of Association has before it the following complaints which, for the sake of clarity, are divided into two separate groups. The first group (Cases Nos.  and ) includes : () a verbal protest made on behalf of the Workers' group of the Governing Body by its President at the st Session of the Governing Body (Geneva, March ) ; () complaint of  February  by the World Federation of Trade Unions supplemented by additional information dated  March and  May  ; () complaint of  March  by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions supplemented by additional information of  May  ; () complaint of  February  by the National Bakers' Federation of Chile supplemented by additional information of  June  ; () complaint of  March  by the Confederation of Latin American Workers supplemented by additional information of  April  ; () complaint of  March  by the Maritime Confederation of Chile ; () complaint of  May  by the National Bakers' Federation of Chile and  other national trade union federations of Chile, quoting article  of the Constitution of the I.L.O. ; () complaint of  February  by the Sole Union of Chilean Workers ; () complaint of  November  by the ""Sekretariat D.P.P.

This group of complaints was communicated by the Director-General of the I.L.O to the Chilean Government by letters dated  January ,  and  March,  May,  June and  July  and  March , with the exception of the Inter-American Regional Organisation of Workers and the telegram of the People's Socialist Party which reproduce the allegations presented by the National Bakers' Federation of Chile. Since the whole of this group deals with related complaints they are examined together. The second group of complaints (Cases Nos.  and ) consists of the following : () complaint of  October  from the Association of Bank Employees of Uruguay ; () complaints of  October and  November  from the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions ; () complaint of  October  from the Miners' Trade Unions International (W.F.T.U) supplemented by additional information dated  November  ; () complaint of  November  from the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions of Salaried Employees, Technicians, Managerial Staff and Commercial Travellers ; and () complaint of  November  from the Inter-, national Confederation of Free Trade Unions. This group of complaints was communicated by the Director-General of the I.L.O to the Chilean Government by letters dated  October,  November and  December  ; they refer particularly to the strike of Chilean bank employees in September  and the strike in the nitrate mines of Pedro de Valdivia, also in September .
.In all the circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the attention of the Government of Chile to the provisions contained in article  of the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation that members of the Governing Body shall enjoy such privileges and immunities as are necessary for the independent exercise of their functions in connection with the Organisation and to decide that, subject to the observations made in paragraphs  to  above, this aspect of the case does not call for further examination ;(b) to draw the attention of the Government of Chile to the recommendations made by the Governing Body when approving the Committee's previous reports concerning Cases Nos.  and  that it should examine the desirability of reconsidering the Law for the Permanent Defence of Democracy in the light of generally accepted principles relating to freedom of association ;(c) for the reasons indicated in paragraphs  and  above, to draw the urgent attention of the Government of Chile to the conclusions of the Conference Committee on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, approved by the International Labour Conference at its th Session, and of the Committee of Experts in , with respect to the application in Chile of the Right of Association (Agriculture) Convention, , ratified by Chile, and to emphasise the importance of its taking steps without further delay to bring its national legislation into harmony with the obligations solemnly undertaken by the ratification of the Convention ;(d) to draw the attention of the Government of Chile to the desirability of taking the necessary steps to ensure that a freely constituted central organisation of workers can function freely and, with this end of view, of examining the possibility of bringing Chilean",-1,1956,Chile

58,".At its th Session (Geneva, May ), the Committee had before it a series of complaints, constituting Cases Nos. , ,  and , relating to Chile. The cases were considered together.
.The Committee's conclusions regarding the different allegations made by the complainants are contained in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, and its recommendations to the Governing Body in paragraph . The Committee's th Report was approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (Geneva, May-June ).
.On three of these allegations the Committee submitted only interim conclusions. The allegations in question are those relating to the imprisonment of trade unionists, with regard to which the Government was asked to supply additional information, and those relating to violation of trade union rights and to reprisals against trade unionists in connection with a strike of bank employees and a strike in the nitrate mines, with regard to which the Government had not Yet forwarded its observations
.These three groups of allegations are the only ones still before the Committee for consideration, and the following analyses relate exclusively to these three groups.
.In all the circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to reaffirm the observations which it made in paragraphs  and  of the th Report of the Committee concerning the severity of the Law for the Permanent Defence of Democracy with respect to the question of strikes, and to suggest to the Government once again that it might consider the possibility of re-examining the provisions of that Law in the light of the generally accepted principles with respect to freedom of association ; but to decide, for the reasons indicated in paragraphs  to  above and having regard to the fact that all the five persons concerned have been liberated, that it is inappropriate to pursue further the examination of the allegations relating to the arrest and sentencing of the leaders of the Sole Union of Chilean Workers (C.U.T.CH) ;(b) to take note with satisfaction, with respect to the arrests of the hundred or so persons alleged by the World Federation of Trade Unions, of the Government's statement that all the persons in question were liberated on  February  and to decide that this aspect of the case does not, therefore, call for further examination ;(c) to draw the attention of the Government to its view that acts of discrimination in connection with a peaceful strike are inconsistent with the maintenance of satisfactory industrial relations and incompatible with the best industrial practice and to the undesirability of persons appointed temporarily by the Government to control the banks falling below this standard ;(d) to draw the attention of the Government to its view that the initiation of the measures against Mr. Goldsack Donoso in his absence by the government controller of the bank by which he was employed is inconsistent with the duty of the Government both to refrain itself from taking measures calculated to interfere with a delegate to an I.L.O. Conference in the exercise of his functions and to use its influence and take all reasonable steps to ensure that such a delegate is not in any way prejudiced by his acceptance of functions as a delegate or by his conduct as a delegate ; that measures on other grounds should not be taken against him in his absence but should await his return, so that he may be in a position to defend himself ; that in the above circumstances it is insufficient for the Government to dissociate itself from the future course and consequences of the measures taken, and that it would be appropriate for the Government to take steps to ensure either that the measures taken against Mr. Goldsack Donoso are revoked or that he is fully compensated ;(e) to request the Government to be good enough to inform the Governing Body whether a committee of investigation was instituted for the purpose of determining the responsibility for the incidents connected with the strike in the nitrate mines and, if so, to inform the Governing Body as to the results of its inquiry.
.The Committee on Freedom of Association has before it the following complaints which, for the sake of clarity, are divided into two separate groups.

This group of complaints was communicated by the Director-General of the I.L.O to the Chilean Government by letters dated  January ,  and  March,  May,  June and  July  and  March , with the exception of the Inter-American Regional Organisation of Workers and the telegram of the People's Socialist Party which reproduce the allegations presented by the National Bakers' Federation of Chile. Since the whole of this group deals with related complaints they are examined together. The second group of complaints (Cases Nos.  and ) consists of the following : () complaint of  October  from the Association of Bank Employees of Uruguay ; () complaints of  October and  November  from the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions ; () complaint of  October  from the Miners' Trade Unions International (W.F.T.U) supplemented by additional information dated  November  ; () complaint of  November  from the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions of Salaried Employees, Technicians, Managerial Staff and Commercial Travellers ; and () complaint of  November  from the Inter-, national Confederation of Free Trade Unions.

.In all the circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the attention of the Government of Chile to the provisions contained in article  of the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation that members of the Governing Body shall enjoy such privileges and immunities as are necessary for the independent exercise of their functions in connection with the Organisation and to decide that, subject to the observations made in paragraphs  to  above, this aspect of the case does not call for further examination ;(b) to draw the attention of the Government of Chile to the recommendations made by the Governing Body when approving the Committee's previous reports concerning Cases Nos.  and  that it should examine the desirability of reconsidering the Law for the Permanent Defence of Democracy in the light of generally accepted principles relating to freedom of association ;(c) for the reasons indicated in paragraphs  and  above, to draw the urgent attention of the Government of Chile to the conclusions of the Conference Committee on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, approved by the International Labour Conference at its th Session, and of the Committee of Experts in , with respect to the application in Chile of the Right of Association (Agriculture) Convention, , ratified by Chile, and to emphasise the importance of its taking steps without further delay to bring its national legislation into harmony with the obligations solemnly undertaken by the ratification of the Convention ;(d) to draw the attention of the Government of Chile to the desirability of taking the necessary steps to ensure that a freely constituted central organisation of workers can function freely and, with this end of view, of examining the possibility of bringing Chilean",-1,1956,Chile
59,"the Committee recommends the Governing Body to draw the attention of the present Government to the views which it expressed previously with regard to this matter and to ask the Government to be good enough to furnish the information requested.
.In all the circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note that on  May  a complete change of Government took place in Colombia, the previous Government having been replaced by a new Government which is making preparations for the holding of elections in a few months' time ;(b) to note that, while the events complained of took place during the lifetime of the previous Government, the present Government has given no information which makes it possible to judge how far the events complained of may have had any continuing consequences which have not yet been remedied, and, in these circumstances, to decide, having regard to the importance which the Governing Body has always attached to the fundamental civil liberties proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and to due process in the examination of charges of violations of the law of the land which may have a bearing on the exercise of trade union rights, to request the Government to be good enough to furnish information concerning the action which it is taking to remedy any consequences of the events complained of which may have continued ;(c) to draw the attention of the Government to the possibility of abuse present in the application of the provisions of Decree No.  of  April , and to request the Government to furnish information as to the extent to which use as been made of the provisions in question and as to the existing jurisprudence of the Council of State relevant to this matter ;(d) to suggest to the Government that it might care to examine its law and practice in the light of the provisions contained in the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), with a view to applying and ratifying those Conventions.
.The allegations made by the Confederation of Workers of Latin America (C.T.A.L) are contained in two communications dated  May and  June  respectively ; these are analysed separately below.Communication dated  May 
.The complainant alleges that the Colombian Government has adopted a repressive policy in violation of the principles laid down in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and that in so doing it has trampled on the workers' fundamental rights. The Government is stated to be preparing a military campaign against the peasants in the department of Tolima.
.The Government is alleged to have issued two decrees making free expression of opinion an offence and abolishing the Constitutional right to strike. The first of these decrees prevents trade unions from being led by workers "" who genuinely represent their fellow workers' interests "" ; under penalty of from two to ten years' imprisonment the receipt or circulation of the publications of international democratic organisations or membership of these organisations is forbidden.
.It is stated that in the second decree the Government has tried to prevent workers from acting in support of their economic claims. In particular, the complaining organisation mentions the following provision which, in its opinion, completely abrogates the right to strike recognised by the Colombian Constitution, and is contrary to the resolutions adopted at various I.L.O meetings which have been endorsed by the Colombian Government:The public service shall be deemed to include, inter alia, the following forms of employment:(a) any branch of the government service ;(b) land, water or air transport undertakings, water supply, electric power and telecommunications ;(c) health establishments of all kinds, such as hospitals and clinics ;(d) social assistance, charitable and welfare institutions ;(e) dairies, markets, slaughter-houses and all public or private distributive outlets of such establishments ;(f) all public hygiene and cleansing services ;(g) the extraction, processing and distribution of salt ;(h) the extraction, refining, transport and distribution of oil and its by-products when, in the opinion of the Government, these are intended to maintain normal supplies of fuel ;(i) any others that in the opinion of the Government affect the safety, health, education and economic or social life of the population. The Government shall decide in consultation with the Council of State which forms of employment fall within the category defined in this subsection.Communication dated  June 
.In this connection the complainant describes a series of events constituting "" the most appalling crimes in the history of Latin America "" ; these involve violations of trade union and democratic rights, large-scale massacres of workers and peasants, and genocide. United Nations intervention is urged to put an end to this situation. It is stated that on  April a wave of murders "" without reason or justification "" took place in a number of places-which the complainant mentions by name-in the department of Tolima. It is alleged that these murders formed part of a plan to "" pacify "" the country. The massacre was carried out by a military force totalling , men. The bulk of the victims (some of whom are mentioned by name in the complaint) were in Santo Domingo ; it is alleged that before being put to death a number of peasants were castrated and forced to dig their own graves. In Los Brazuelos, Calarma and Guaipa,  peasants were brutally murdered, while women were assaulted and beaten. Many workers were murdered while they were working in the coffee plantations. The prisons in these towns contain a number of prisoners who are minors. Many prisoners disappear mysteriously and are probably put to death. The Government is alleged to consider that "" political prisoners are a problem because they may become a focus for agitation whereas once they are dead they can only be used in this way for a few days "". The church authorities have protested without result to the military authorities against these crimes ; thousands of people are stated to have fled for their lives to other areas.ANALYSIS OF THE REPLY
.In its communication dated  September  the Colombian Government makes its comments on the complaint dated  May . It begins by saying that as a general principle it rejects any type of interference in the country's internal jurisdiction, since no international organisation has the power to encroach on this field which belongs exclusively to individual States, as is clearly specified in article  () of the United Nations Charter. However, out of deference towards the International Labour Organisation, to which Colombia has belonged since it was founded, the Government, while completely rejecting accusations made by a Communist-inspired organisation "" which systematically sets out to discredit democratic governments "", is prepared to comment on the charges made.
.The first decree referred to by the C.T.A.L must be the Extraordinary Decree No.  of  March , which the Government reproduces in its reply and which was issued under Act No.  passed in  to reform the National Constitution and "" to prohibit international communism "". The sole purpose of this anti-Communist legislation is to safeguard democracy and Christian civilisation and it is a distortion of the facts to allege that it is an attempt to prevent ""representative workers "" from reaching positions of leadership in the unions. There are in Colombia two Confederations, a number of federations and some  unions which exercise their rights freely and democratically. This fact is acknowledged by the Inter-American Regional Organisation of Workers (O.R.I.T) in a letter which is quoted in the Government's reply. This letter states, inter alia, that "" documentary evidence supplied by our affiliate ... proves that the free and independent trade unionism that you advocate for your country coincides with the O.R.I.T.'s conception of genuine trade unionism "". The Colombian Workers' delegate at the th Session of the International Labour Conference, who is now Vice-Chairman of the Colombian Workers' Union, stated in plenary sitting : "" Freedom of association is absolute. In the last  months, , trade union meetings and workers' congresses have been held, and in the same period there have been founded and put into operation the new National Confederation and  workers' unions. At present there are three trade union centres, grouping almost all the trade unions. All operate quite freely as regards their policy and activities without interference from the State or from one another. ""The Government's policy - as enunciated in various public statements - supports "" free and democratic trade unionism as against a government-dominated or totalitarian movement ... ; a non-political trade union movement, i.e. one that is concerned with the interests of its members and has no party preoccupations ... ; a national trade unionism having no contact with communism or any other pernicious foreign doctrines by whatever name they may be called ... ; and a trade unionism that shows respect for the catholic feelings of Colombians "". In accordance with",-1,1956,Colombia
60,"the Governing Body at its st Session (March ).
.The second allegation of the I.C.F.T.U referred to the trade union leaders who were stated to be government officials at the same time ; this allegation was based on an error and an untrue statement of fact. The provisions attributing trade union functions to certain public officials-those of Act No.  of  May -had been repealed many years ago, as the Committee had recognised in paragraph  of its Fifth Report. The third allegation, regarding the lack of freedom of the Confederation of Dominican Workers, also proceeded from imaginary facts. The Confederation of Dominican Workers held congresses every two years in accordance with its own rules, and the agenda of these meetings consisted of trade union matters ; many of the aspirations proclaimed at these congresses had been converted into legislation for the benefit of the working class. Political parties, political leaders and members of the armed forces did not intervene in any way in these congresses.
.As regards the allegations dealing with exercise of the right to strike - i.e. that the union must inform the Secretariat of State for Labour of its reasons for deciding to call a strike this was an aspect of the dispute which should be examined in the light of the sovereign rights of the State. The Dominican Republic had a political rgime established by the free will of its people. In virtue of sovereign Constitutional powers the Executive, when issuing the Trujillo Labour Code, had considered that it was indispensable to afford absolute autonomy to trade union organisations, but that it was not appropriate to the vital interests of the country for such organisations to be able to engage in political activities. Such a view had been confirmed by experience in some other countries, where trade union organisations really operated on behalf of causes contrary to public peace. The limitation imposed by Dominican legislation on the activities of trade unions in no way infringed the independence to which they were legitimately entitled. In other words, a trade union as a legal person could not engage in political activities, but this rule in no way prevented the members of the union as natural persons from freely entering the political field. The right to strike was recognised, but in regulating this right the Legislative Power had thought fit to restrict its exercise to cases of economic dispute. These regulations had not been the object of any observation in the Fifth Report of the Committee on Freedom of Association. The restrictions had been imposed in virtue of sovereign Constitutional powers and of the elementary duty of every government to ensure the maintenance of public peace. The prescribed waiting period between notification and declaration of a strike, and the rule that only the courts of law may appreciate the character of a strike, did not involve an infringement of trade union rights. The I.C.F.T.U had also pointed out that the trade unions were prohibited from directly or indirectly restricting freedom to work, alleging that this was an interference in the operation of trade unions. Such an allegation was quite unspeakable. Freedom to work was an essential attribute of the individual laid down in the Constitution of the Dominican Republic. A law which permitted trade union organisations to restrict this fundamental freedom would be in flagrant conflict with the highest Constitutional principles. Every worker, whether a trade union member or not, was free to engage in the activity which was most attractive to him or best suited his interests ; this freedom was guaranteed by the Labour Code, which prohibited employers from exerting influence over workers to induce them to join or refrain from joining trade unions ; and section  of the Code expressly made it illegal for any person applying for employment to be required to enter or refrain from entering a trade union. These safeguards were in conformity with the standards of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, , which had been ratified by the Dominican Republic on  June . The same principle had been laid down in a special resolution adopted by the International Labour Conference at its th Session. As already recognised by the Committee in the Fifth Report, Dominican legislation gave trade union organisations all the safeguards required by these international instruments. Trade unions could not establish political relations with political parties, nor could the Government seek to obtain the political co-operation of the unions. Similarly, prohibitions were to be found in the legislation of many of the States Members of the I.L.O, as had been indicated in the report of the Committee on Freedom of Employers' and Workers' Organisations. Special reference should be made to the case of Cuba, whose legislation prohibited trade unions from engaging in political activity, because the Cuban Workers' Confederation had been "" the evident instigator of the I.C.F.T.U's complaint "".
.The I.C.F.T.U also alleged that the legislation of the Dominican Republic violated freedom of association because it permitted registration of a trade union to be cancelled by the courts, followed by dissolution of the union, if it engaged in activities not connected with its lawful activities. The only obligation of States Members of the I.L.O was to guarantee complete independence to the trade unions so that they might perform the functions proper to them ; it was no infringement of this independence to prohibit engagement in activities foreign to the said functions. To sanction the cancellation of a union's registration if it pursued improper objectives was a normal course, provided the cancellation was ordered as the result of a judicial and not of an administrative procedure. This was, moreover, the rule specified in Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, , which had been ratified by the Dominican Republic.
.The last allegation by the complainant organisation referred to collective agreements. As it was necessary to handle this question in a manner varying with national conditions, no uniform international standards had been adopted on the subject. Article  of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), only stated that, where necessary, appropriate measures should be taken to encourage and promote the full development and utilisation of machinery for voluntary negotiation. Every collective agreement must have regard to the rules of public order, introduced to protect the workers' rights. Therefore, before a collective agreement was put into effect and even during its currency, the administrative authorities must exercise supervision thereover. The intention of the previous approval required by section  of the Trujillo Labour Code was only to make it possible to ascertain whether a draft agreement was or was not contrary to the current rules of public order. Similar provisions applied in many other countries belonging to the I.L.O. Furthermore, refusal to grant approval was subject to appeal to the courts of law.
.The Government closed its first communication by referring to the conclusions of the I.C.F.T.U's complaint. The complainant, as such, must bring proof of what it alleged. It had not done this. Dominican legislation surrounded freedom of association with full safeguards and the autonomy enjoyed by the trade unions was in no way infringed. Such a situation had been reached by legislative action and by the personal initiative of Generalissimo Trujillo. The Government did not claim that its legislation was perfect, but it did emphatically state that this legislation embodied the legitimate aspirations of the working class. Proof of this was the ratification of Convention No. , as reported by the Committee on Freedom of Association in its Sixth Report.
.In its second letter dated  January  in reply to the I.C.F.T.U's communication of  January , the Dominican Government stated that the complaining organisation had not adduced any new evidence but had merely recapitulated a case which the Committee on Freedom of Association had already dealt with. The only new feature was the proposed procedural measures which could only be justified once the Committee had passed on the substantive question, and not before. The complainant organisation, the Government concluded, was not pursuing any constructive designs in preferring its charges, its sole aim being to secure, for obviously political reasons, a verdict detrimental to the Dominican Government. The I.C.F.T.U itself admitted that the Government had ratified the international Conventions on freedom of association, and to say that such ratification had come lately did not obscure the fact that the principles given international recognition in those Conventions had been the law of the land in the Dominican Republic ever since . The Government therefore considered that the Committee should not proceed with the case "" owing to the clearly political character of the complaint "", coupled with the lack of evidence to support the charges.
.In all the circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to decide, subject to the reservation made in paragraph  above, that the allegations relating to recognition of trade unions, the subordination of trade unions to the Government,",-1,1956,Dominican Republic

Mr. Bermdez, ex-Councillor of State, has at no time been imprisoned ; Mr. Pineda Gmez is at liberty ; Mr. Manuel de Jess Pineda, lawyer at Santa Rosa de Copn, was attacked by a personal enemy ; Mr. Pompeyo del Valle is at complete liberty in San Pedro Sula and there is no record of his ever having been detained ; and Mr. Fonseca is working freely in Tegucigalpa as a student leader. It has not been possible to identify the person cited by the complainant as "" Dr."" Paredes.

.As regards the detention of the officials of the Melcher Estate Committee in Tela, on the orders of the local military commandant, the Government states that the investigations (as evidenced by the police records and other documentary proof) showed that on  March  the foreman Santiago Olivera of the Melcher Estate was assaulted by the secretary of the union of that Estate and by three other men in the local police station during a discussion. The assaulted man asked the authorities to intervene, and they ordered the attackers to be apprehended and held for the competent criminal judge. The documents submitted show that on  March the persons detained had already been released. This was therefore a detention for the purpose of clearing up an ordinary misdemeanour of armed aggression.
.As regards the detention of Arturo Cardona and Daniel Ramos of the Standard Fruit Company Union, the Government states that the local subcommandant at La Paz detained them when he found them holding a trade union meeting in preparation for a labour congress to be held in La Ceiba. When the Minister of Labour was informed by telegram by another trade union official on  March  he communicated with the commandant of the armed forces in the Department, asking him to release the detained persons and to order sanctions to be taken against the subcommandant. On the same day an order was given for the release of the detained persons and the subcommandant responsible for the illegal detention was removed from his post. The released trade union officials themselves thanked the Minister of Labour for his intervention in a telegram dated  March . This fact, adds the Government, constitutes proof of the confidence felt by the trade union officials in the authorities.
.Lastly, as regards the allegation that the workmen Abraham Castillo Flores, Conrado Ziga Zepeda and Rubn Rodriguez Andrade were detained on  March  and sent to the Central Penitentiary, and that on the same day a warrant of commitment was issued for the offence of subversive activity against the trade unionists Rodolfo Lpez, Francisco Aguilar Martinez, Samuel Aguilera Bohrquez, Carlos Martinez Velzquez and Guadalupe Reyes Guzmn, the Government refers to the document issued by Criminal Court No.  of the Francisco Morazn Department on  May , showing that all the persons are undergoing preventive detention in the Central Penitentiary in virtue of orders dated  February and  March . The Government emphasises that the Executive has no power to intervene in acts of the judiciary since judges and courts are subordinate exclusively to the High Court of Justice and are completely independent in their functions.
.Having regard to all these considerations, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to take note of the ratification by Honduras of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ) ;(b) to decide that, subject to drawing the attention of the Government of Honduras to the observations contained in paragraphs ,  and  above, the case as a whole does not call for further examination.",-1,1956,Honduras
62,"School in El Zamoramo.Allegations relating to Legislative Decree No. , dated  February , respecting the Defence of the Democratic System
.The decree in question which is entitled "" Law for the Defence of the Democratic System Prevailing in the Republic "" has no relationship whatever to trade union matters. None of the guarantees enjoyed by workers' organisations as such, and none of the guarantees against discrimination on the grounds of trade union membership, are diminished in the least through the operation of the decree. The scope of the decree cannot come into conflict with the scope of the Trade Unions Law. If in a concrete case any question of this sort were to arise, the case would be settled in the following manner : since the Trade Unions Law is a special law it must be applied to the case in question, thus excluding the application of Legislative Decree No. , which is a general law of the penal type.
.The Government states, nevertheless, that it must be recognised that the promulgation of the law for the defence of the democratic system is the fundamental cause of the hostility shown by the Confederation of Latin American Workers towards the Honduras authorities. That law is not directed against the working class and democratic forces, as the complaint alleges, but against international communism. Its aim is limited to the prohibition of the Communist Party and related organisations and to defining acts constituting an offence against national security.Allegations relating to the Detention of Trade Unionists and Other Persons
.As regards the detention of Carlos M. Velzquez, Guadalupe Reyes and Samuel Aguilera, the Government states that Messrs. Velzquez and Aguilera cannot be officials of the alleged Butchers' and Tailors' Unions respectively, as there is no record of the existence of these unions in the register of workers' organisations kept in the Labour Department of the Office of the Secretary of State (of which the Government submits duly legalised documentary evidence). The status of these persons as trade union officials is merely affirmed by the Confederation of Latin American Workers without proof or foundation. Guadalupe Reyes is, indeed, the General Secretary of the Building Workers' Union, but his status as a trade union official does not exempt him from ordinary criminal liability. A legalised document issued by Criminal Court No.  of the Francisco Morazn Department, dated  May , shows that the three persons in question were prosecuted on  January  in that Court by the Office of the Director-General of Police, for the offence of Communist activity. The same Court, on  February  (as shown by a document also issued on  May ), issued an order for the preventive detention of the same persons "" by reason of the offence of Communist activity for the purpose of establishing a Communist system in Honduras, the acts being committed in Tegucigalpa in the last months of last year () and the first months of this year "". The detention order is based on Legislative Decree No.  of  February  and the ordinary legislation on judicial procedure. The Government stated that these proceedings are matters within the normal jurisdiction of the judiciary and that the head of the State has no power to intervene in them owing to the separation of powers. The three persons in question are at present held at the pleasure of the judge in the Central Penitentiary.
.As regards the alleged detention of Humberto Laitano, the Government submits a document issued by the same Court on  May , showing that information against this person was lodged by the Office of the Director-General of Police for the offence of Communist activity and that he is now a fugitive from justice. On the other hand there is no "" Boot and Shoe Industry Union "" in Honduras and therefore Laitano cannot be regarded as a militant worker for a non-existent organisation. As regards the alleged detention and torture of the ""workman "" Parker (whose full name and trade union are not given by the complainant organisation), the Government states that this is probably a man named Douglas Parker who was tried in Criminal Court No.  at San Pedro Sula (Corts Department) for the attempted kidnapping of a minor. Because of the infrequency of this offence in Honduras the local press devoted considerable space to it, and the Government feels that the Confederation of Latin American, Workers extracted these references from the newspapers, adding the words ""workman"" and ""trade union official"" to the name of the offender.
.The Government has been unable to obtain any information on the alleged seizure of Professor Julio C. Rivera, except that the weekly Jornada (the source mentioned by the complainant organisation) and the Teachers' Union (of which Professor Rivera is stated to be an official) are unknown in Honduras. Mr. Francisco Rios does not appear in the books of the Tela Railroad Company Workers' Union according to a certificate issued by the secretary of this organisation on  May . Messrs. Francisco Aguilar Martinez, Rubn Rodriguez and Rodolfo Lpez (the person called "" Santos Velzquez "" is probably Mr. Carlos M. Velzquez already mentioned) do not appear in the membership lists of the trade union organisations and are detained at the Central Penitentiary under imprisonment orders made by Criminal Court No.  of the Francisco Morazn Department on  February and  March  for the offence of Communist activity. According to the relevant documents issued by that court, they were prosecuted by the Office of the Director-General of Police on  January .
.As regards the allegation relating to the detention and torture of Medardo Garcia, Efrain Irias Durn and Hctor Romero, officials of the Standard Fruit Company Workers' Union, the Government states that there is no such person as Medardo Garcia among the officials of this union. Durn and Romero submit affidavits (which the Government encloses after legalisation), both dated  May . Durn stated "" It is true ... that I was detained on  February but it is not a fact that I was tortured by the Director of Police or by any other authority "". Romero states ""We were not beaten by the Director of Police ; on the contrary, we were treated with great consideration and were not interfered with by any of the authorities"". The Government explains that when these officials attempted to start a strike last February before carrying out the mediation and conciliation procedures prescribed by law, they were summoned to the office of the Director of Police in La Ceiba and informed that the authorities would not permit illegal strikes. When the Ministry of Labour learned of this, it took the necessary action to ensure that Durn and Romero were not interfered with in their trade union activity and an official of the Ministry was sent to La Ceiba. With the assistance of this official an agreement was reached between the union and the undertaking, and both trade union officials took an active part in the negotiations. The Government emphasises that paragraph III of this agreement signed in La Ceiba on  January  states that "" the discussions took place in complete harmony and both sides were able to express their points of view quite freely "". The Government has submitted a copy of the agreement and states that Messrs. Durn and Romero are continuing to act as trade union officials.
.As regards the detention of members of the executive committee of the Tela Railroad Company Workers' Union at the end of February in the port of Tela, the Government states that Messrs. Ral Edgardo Estrada, Roberto Pancham, Cleo Gonzlez, Rufino Sosa and Jos Cubas Gross were detained by the Tegucigalpa police for six days, which is the term permitted by the Honduras criminal procedure legislation for inquiries in cases of reported attempts to subvert public order. It was found that, despite the statutory provisions prohibiting the intervention of trade unions in political activities, "" these persons had been having lengthy interviews with the director of the anti-Government campaign for the purpose of successfully co-operating in an armed revolt or in a general strike of a political character "". When the Ministry of Labour learned of this detention, it intervened in view of the fact that the detainees were trade union officials, so that they might be freed at the end of the time allowed for inquiry. As certified by the Director of the Central Penitentiary, they were released and are continuing to carry out their trade union functions. The Government adds that the police, as the authority responsible for public order, makes no distinction between presumed offenders according to membership or non-membership of trade unions.
.Although these cases have nothing to do with the exercise of trade union rights, as is apparent from the text of the complaint, the Government offers the following explanations as regards Messrs. Francisco Milla Bermdez, ""Dr. "" Paredes, Jos Pineda Gmez, Manuel de Jess Pineda, Lon Adalberto Custodio, Pompeyo del Valle and",-1,1956,Honduras
63,".The allegations made in a letter, dated  March , of the Confederation of Latin American Workers, as supplemented by its second letter of  April , are as follows.Allegations relating to Trade Union Policy and General Policy
.The Government of Honduras is said to have initiated a policy of repressing the trade union movement, and to have attacked the democratic Press, the students and the "" representatives of democratic movements fighting for democratic and trade union rights "". Hundreds of patriots are claimed to have been imprisoned without reason. The University is stated to have been occupied by police on  February  and a number of students to have been arrested and beaten up. The Government is said to have issued a series of decrees prohibiting public meetings, ordering forcible entry into private houses and permitting the seizure and violation of private correspondence. Members of the Government and of the foreign undertakings are said to have declared that they would "" shoot up "" any movement by workers in support of their claims, and to have organised punitive expeditions, with forces from the Basic Military School, against the banana workers. The Government is alleged to have declared its intention of seeking the armed intervention of the United States to stifle any attempt at national liberation. The Basic Military School is claimed to be under the command of United States officers and to have been established with funds from the United Fruit Company.
.In its second letter, dated  April , the Confederation of Latin American Workers adds-in connection with the specific allegations described later in this paper-that "" trade union and democratic rights, freedom of assembly, freedom of the press, freedom of association, freedom of movement and respect for human life are being subjected to serious limitations in Honduras "".Allegations relating to Legislative Decree No. , dated  February , respecting the Defence of the Democratic System
.The complainant organisation alleges that Legislative Decree No. , dated  February , was aimed principally at the working class and other democratic forces, and that through it "" the precarious individual and social guarantees have been totally liquidated "".Allegations relating to the Detention of Trade Unionists and Other Persons
.According to reports published in the daily El Cronista of  February , the police in Tegucigalpa detained on  February  and thereafter tortured Carlos M. Velzquez, official of the Tegucigalpa Butchers' Union, Guadalupe Reyes, General Secretary of the Building Workers' Union and Samuel Aguilera, General Secretary of the Tegucigalpa Tailors' Union. On  February, Humberto Laitano of the Boot and Shoe Industry Union is said to have been detained and "" savagely beaten up "" by the Tegucigalpa police. The "" workman "" Parker, a trade union official, is stated to have been also detained and tortured by the police of the same town.
.According to reports in the weekly Jornada of  February , Professor Julio C. Rivera of the Teachers' Union is alleged to have been arrested in Tegucigalpa on that day, Francisco Rios of the Tela Railroad Company Workers' Union is said to have been detained in La Ceiba on  January , Francisco Aguilar Martinez, Rubn Rodriguez, Santos Velzquez and Rodolfo Lpez, all workmen, are reported to have been arrested in Tegucigalpa at the end of February.
.Medardo Garcia, Efrain Irias Durn and Hctor Romero, officials of the Standard Fruit Company Workers' Union, are stated to have been detained and tortured at La Ceiba on  February  and have later been imprisoned in the Tegucigalpa penitentiary.
.Ral E. Estrada, Roberto Pancham, Cleo Gonzlez, Rufino Sosa and Jos Cubas Gross, members of the executive committee of the Tela Railroad Company Workers' Union (a union affiliated to the Inter-American Regional Organisation of Workers), are said to have been detained at the Port of Tela at the end of February .
.At the end of the same month the engineer Francisco Milla Bermdez, "" Dr. "" Paredes, and a university graduate named Jos Pineda Gmez, persons belonging to "" militant democratic and liberal circles "" were detained ; Manuel de Jess Pineda, a journalist, is reported in the local press to have been mortally wounded in reprisal for criticisms of the Government ; Len Adalberto Custodio and the "" poet "" Pompeyo del Valle, both progressive newspaper men, are stated to have been beaten up by the police of Tegucigalpa ; Buda Gautama Fonseca, university student, and other leaders of the Honduras University Students' Federation are said to have been threatened by the military commandant of Tegucigalpa because of a student meeting.
.The officials of the Melcher Estate Committee in Tela (La Lima area), which is a unit of the Tela Railroad Workers' Union, are stated to have been detained on  March  by order of the military commandant of the town. On  March Arturo Cardona and Daniel Ramos, railway workers who are General Secretary and Secretary of Minutes respectively of Section  of the Standard Fruit Company Union, are stated to have been detained at Los Planes (La Ceiba area). On  March three workmen, Abraham Castillo Flores, Conrado Ziga Zepeda and Rubn Rodriguez Andrade, are stated to have been detained in Tegucigalpa and sent to the Central Penitentiary. On the same day a warrant of commitment was issued by Criminal Court No.  of Tegucigalpa, for the alleged offence of "" subversive activity "", against the trade unionists Rodolfo Lopz, Abraham Castillo Flores, Conrado Ziga Zepeda, Francisco Aguilar Martinez, Samuel Aguilera Bohrquez, Carlos Martinez Velzquez, Guadalupe Reyes Guzmn and Rubn Rodriguez Andrade (all already mentioned in connection with their detention).ANALYSIS OF THE REPLY
.The Government of Honduras presented its comments on the above allegations in letters dated  May and  June  ; the second of these letters consists of an analysis of the documentary evidence transmitted by the Government. The following is a combined summary of the Government's comments and the documentary evidence submitted.Allegations relating to Trade Union Policy and General Policy
.The Government states on this point that it has at no time carried out a policy of repressing the trade union movement and that on the contrary it is the only government in the history of the country which has promoted social progress ; it has brought Honduras into the International Labour Organisation ; issued laws, such as the Charter of Labour Guarantees and the Trade Unions Law prepared with the technical advice of the I.L.O, which provide for a trade union system of the most authentic liberal pattern ; moreover, since the time of the alleged occurrences mentioned in the complaint of the Confederation of Latin American Workers it has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ). This legislation, including the provisions relating to freedom of association, has been fully implemented and it is hardly likely that the Government would ratify international Conventions if it were unable to apply them, or would repress a trade union movement which it had encouraged itself. The Government points out that the complainant organisation has not cited a single fact which can be regarded as an actual violation of the above national and international provisions.
.As regards the other allegations of a general character (apart from those relating to university matters which the Government-while rejecting them -considers to be outside the question of free exercise of trade union rights) the Government states that in Honduras both nationals and aliens enjoy and exercise all the liberties of the person in the same way and to the same extent as in the other democratic countries. A glance at the local papers would show the extent to which the right of assembly and freedom of speech are exercised, and no case of their limitation has been reported. It would be inconceivable, continues the Government, that any authority should issue decrees, as the complainant organisation maintains, ordering forcible entry of private houses, violation and seizure of correspondence, etc. Such acts may be carried out but only a cynical and ignorant dictatorship would issue decrees on the subject.
.The Government emphasises that the allegations of the Confederation of Latin American Workers respecting alleged declarations by "" individuals in the Government and foreign undertakings "" on the shooting up of any movement by workers in support of their claims are entirely unspecific. Who are these "" individuals "" in the Government and foreign undertakings ? Where are the victims of the alleged "" punitive "" methods practised ? The allegation that the Government has asked for the open armed intervention of the United States to suppress any attempt at national liberation represents a gratuitous insult against a free and independent State whose citizens will never accept intervention from a foreign power. The United Fruit Company has nothing to do with the Basic Military School. The only schools maintained by this undertaking are those prescribed by the law for the education of the workers' children, such as the Pan American Agricultural",-1,1956,Honduras
64,".At its rd Session (Geneva, November ) the Governing Body approved the recommendations submitted by the Committee on Freedom of Association in an interim report on Case No.  (the complaint submitted on  May  by the Confederation of Workers of Latin America). These recommendations were as follows
.In all these circumstances, the Committee:(a) recommends the Governing Body to decide that the allegations regarding violations of human rights and Guatemalan labour legislation and the imprisonment and persecution of trade union leaders do not call for further examination ;(b) recommends the Governing Body, in accordance with the conclusions stated in paragraphs  and :(i) to call the attention of the Government to the fact that the existing Labour Code imposes restrictions on agricultural trade unions which are incompatible with the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), which has been ratified by Guatemala, and to the necessity for ensuring that the future regulations provided for in the  Constitution will abolish these restrictions, and to request the Government to keep the Governing Body informed as to the contents of such regulations when they are promulgated;(ii) to draw the matter to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations ;(c) recommends the Governing Body, in accordance with the conclusions stated in paragraphs  and :(i) to call the Government's attention to the fact that the existing ban on the formation of trade unions by civil servants and government employees and workers is contrary to the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), which has been ratified by Guatemala, and to the necessity of taking steps to ensure that the final version of the public service regulations shall be in conformity with the Convention, and to keep the Governing Body informed as to the contents of such regulations when they are promulgated ;(ii) to draw the matter to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations ;(d) recommends the Governing Body, in accordance with the conclusion stated in paragraph , to call the attention of the Government to the Committee's recommendation in Case No. -which was endorsed by the Governing Body when it approved the Committee's th Report-to take all necessary measures to enable free and independent central workers' and peasants' organisations, as well as their affiliated unions and federations, to re-establish themselves in accordance with the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), which has been ratified by Guatemala;(e) recommends the Governing Body to take note of the present provisional report in so far as it refers to allegations regarding the confiscation of the assets of the Educational Workers' Union, on the understanding that the Committee will make a further report as soon as it receives the information requested in paragraph .
.The information requested in paragraph  related to the legal grounds for the confiscation of the property belonging to the Educational Workers' Union, the use made of these funds and the means of defence available to the members of the dissolved union, and whether or not the Government intended to restore this property to the parties concerned when, as recommended by the Committee, the dissolved organisation was allowed to re-form.
.The Director-General wrote to the Guatemalan Government on  December  asking for the information requested by the Committee. At its th and th Sessions (Geneva, February and May ) the Committee noted that the Guatemalan Government had not replied to the request for information made to it. At the second of these two sessions the Committee decided to make a further request to the Government for this information as a matter of urgency, and the Director-General notified this decision to the Government on  June . The Guatemalan Government presented its observations on the subject on  August .
.This analysis is confined to those points of the complaint which are still outstanding and on which the Committee requested information. The Confederation of Workers of Latin America alleges that agricultural workers are forbidden to form unions and that the unionisation of state employees is also prohibited. Furthermore, hundreds of workers, particularly schoolmasters and road and construction workers, are stated to have been dismissed without being given an opportunity of defending their own interests. The Educational Workers' Union is alleged to have been dissolved arbitrarily and its assets (totalling , quetzales), made up of its members' contributions, have been confiscated.ANALYSIS OF THE REPLIESCommunications of  June and  September 
.These communications are analysed solely in relation to the points still at issue. The Government states that under article  () of the Constitution freedom of association for both workers and employers is recognised as a fundamental principle. The law, however, may regulate this right having regard to the nature of the association concerned and the differences between the conditions of workers and employers in the towns and in the countryside. With regard to public employees a new set of regulations is now being drafted ; in the meantime, the Government Decree of  February  (No. ) concerning state employees is still in force. This decree provisionally regulated the position of these workers. Dealing with the confiscation of the assets of the Educational Workers' Union, the Government states that it was forced to dissolve the union owing to its infiltration by Communists. The union's assets had become state property as provided in the union's own by-laws.Communication of  August 
.In this communication, which was in reply to repeated requests for additional information from the Committee, the Guatemalan Government stated that the question of agricultural trade unions and the right of association of state employees was being reviewed as a preliminary to implementing the provisions of the Constitution and that meanwhile the Labour Code remained in force. With regard to the confiscation of the assets of the Educational Workers' Union, the Government stated that these assets had been sequestrated while the position of the union was being investigated. A board of trustees had been set up to look after these assets. The Government attached to its reply a copy of the dissolved union's by-laws.
.The Guatemalan Government ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), on  February  ; these instruments entered into force on  February .Allegations concerning the Right of Agricultural Workers to Form Trade Unions
.In its interim report on this case the Committee made a detailed examination of the position of agricultural trade unions under the  Labour Code (sections -). In reply to the Committee's request for information the Government now states that, although the legal position has not changed, the matter is being reviewed in order to bring the legislation into line with the Constitution.
.The Committee in its earlier report commented that the agricultural trade unions provided for under the Labour Code were organised for specific purposes (co-operation, the elimination of illiteracy, etc.) and that unless they had over  members and a proportion of literate members of not less than  per cent they did not possess the powers normally granted to trade union organisations. For example, they could not conclude collective contracts or collective agreements dealing with conditions of work, which under the Code remain the prerogative of urban trade unions. The Committee pointed out that Convention No. , ratified by Guatemala, states emphatically that "" workers ... without distinction whatsoever "" have the right to join organisations of their own choosing. The Committee concluded that the regulations in force in Guatemala involved a restriction of this right which was contrary to the instrument ratified by the Government.
.Following the Committee's interim report the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations also had an opportunity (April ) of expressing its opinion on this question. In its report the Committee of Experts states as follows : "" The legislation in force contains provisions which are not compatible with the standard laid down in the Convention. This is the case, for example, with respect to the two following texts, which draw distinctions between workers, whereas, under Article  of the Convention, workers shall enjoy the rights and guarantees provided for without distinction whatsoever. () ... the provisions of sections  to  of the Labour Code considerably restrict the rights of agricultural workers by providing, among other things, that such workers may conclude collective agreements only if their union fulfils certain particularly stringent conditions (the union must exist within an estate employing at least  members, of whom  per cent at least must be able to read and write and must first of all have organised a cooperative society or established an institution for assistance and social welfare)."" Lastly, the Committee of Experts asked the Government to keep it informed of the steps it was taking to rescind or amend these provisions.
.This being",-1,1956,Guatemala
65,"so, and bearing in mind that the legal position of Guatemalan agricultural trade unions has undergone no change since that date, and having regard to the conclusions of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations referred to above, which coincide with the conclusions of the Committee in its own preliminary examination of this case, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to call the attention of the Guatemalan Government to the need to take steps to amend those provisions of the Labour Code that are incompatible with the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), which was ratified by Guatemala, so that agricultural workers can be enabled to exercise their trade union rights without any discrimination whatsoever.Allegations regarding the Right of State Employees to Form Trade Unions
.In its interim report on this case the Committee examined the position of workers in the public service who were covered by the Government Decree of  February  (No. ). In reply to the Committee's request for information the Government now states that there has been no change in the legal position although a new set of public service regulations is now being drafted.
.The Committee in its report referred to earlier noted that section  () of the Decree of  February  prohibited the formation of trade unions by public employees and workers in state services. The Committee considered that this ban was clearly contrary to the provisions of Convention No. ^t, which had been ratified by Guatemala.
.For its part the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations considered, when it examined this question in April , that this provision of the Decree of  February  was incompatible with the terms of the Convention ratified by Guatemala, in view of the fact that workers are entitled to the rights and safeguards provided for in the Convention without any distinction whatsoever. A number of members of the Committee on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations at the th Session of the International Labour Conference (June ) expressed the view that some of the sections of the decree in question were "" in flagrant contradiction to the provisions of the Convention "". The Guatemalan Government representative replied that "" the Government had had to face a particularly delicate situation which led it to forbid public officials to form trade unions, but that nevertheless the right of association of such officials would be recognised within a short time "". The Committee "" expressed the hope that the necessary amendments would be made to the legislation "" s
.Accordingly, in view of the legal position of state employees and workers, which has undergone no change, i.e. they are still forbidden to form organisations of their own choosing, and having regard to the fact that both the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations and the Committee on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations of the International Labour Conference have concluded that this prohibition is contrary to Convention No. , which has been ratified by Guatemala, and have recommended that the relevant national legislation should be repealed, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to call the attention of the Guatemalan Government to the need to take steps to rescind the provisions forbidding the formation of trade unions by state employees, so as to bring Guatemalan legislation into line with the obligations that were solemnly accepted when the Convention was ratified.Allegations regarding the Confiscation of the Assets of the Educational Workers' Union
.The Committee also examined this allegation in its interim report. On that occasion the Committee noted that Decree No.  issued in  dissolving the union ordered its assets to be sequestrated. The Government for its part stated in its first communication that "" the assets of this union automatically became state property, since the union's by-laws stated that in the event of dissolution its assets should revert to the State "". In its second communication, however, replying to the Committee's request for information, the Government stated that the assets had not been confiscated but had been "" placed on deposit while the position of the dissolved trade union is being investigated "". At the present time these assets are being looked after by a liquidation board.
.The by-laws of the Guatemalan Educational Workers' Union (a copy of which was supplied by the Government at the Committee's request) contain the following provisions dealing with dissolution:Article . The Educational Workers' Union of Guatemala shall be dissolved when two-thirds of its members so resolve and decide ; in such case, the executive committee shall communicate the resolution to the Department of Labour, together with a copy of the minute in which the dissolution decision is embodied and which must be signed by all the members of the executive committee. At the same time, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Labour must be requested to appoint a liquidation board consisting of a labour inspector and two reputable persons elected from among the workers.Article . In case of the dissolution of the Educational Workers' Union of Guatemala its property shall pass to the federation to which it is affiliated or to the Confederation to which such federation is affiliated.
.It must be pointed out that this question of the assets belonging to the dissolved union has still not been settled three years after the Government ordered the dissolution. Even though the Government in its second communication withdrew its earlier statement that the union's assets had been appropriated by the State, it is clear from a reading of the union's by-laws that in the event of dissolution the organisation's assets were to be disposed of in a specified way, viz. they were to be transferred to the federation or to the Confederation to which the latter was affiliated. This principle embodied in the by-laws is in line with the criterion followed by the Committee in all cases where it has been called upon to examine questions relating to the protection of trade union funds. The Committee has considered on a number of occasions that when an organisation is dissolved its assets must temporarily be sequestrated and finally distributed among its members or transferred to its successor organisation. In the present case, moreover, the by-laws of the dissolved union stipulate that the number of trustees must be composed of two workers and a labour inspector and must be appointed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Labour at the request of the union's executive board. The Committee does not possess sufficient evidence to judge whether or not the board of trustees was appointed in accordance with these provisions ; in any event in view of the compulsory administrative dissolution imposed on the Educational Workers' Union by Decree No.  issued in  there can be no doubt that this board was not appointed at the request of the parties concerned.
.The question of the appropriation of the assets of the Educational Workers' Union-which has still not been settled three years after its dissolution is only one feature of that organisation's dissolution. In its th Report the Committee found that this dissolution had taken place in exactly the same circumstances as those examined in Case No.  (Guatemala); in this latter case the Committee recommended the Governing Body to draw the attention of the Government to the desirability "" of taking all necessary measures to ensure that free and independent central workers' and peasants' organisations, as well as their affiliated unions and federations, may reconstitute themselves in accordance with the provisions of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention (No. ), ..."".
.Accordingly, the Committee, in view of the fact that during the three years since the Government dissolved the Educational Workers' Union the latter's assets have not been finally disposed of, recommends the Governing Body to call the attention of the Guatemalan Government to the need for the earliest possible action to restore the assets of the aforesaid organisation to the parties concerned in accordance with the union's by-laws.
.In its communication dated  May  the Confederation of Workers of Latin America (C.T.A.L) alleges that various provisions of the  Labour Code have been ignored to the detriment of the workers and in violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the resolutions of the I.L.O. The workers have suffered wage cuts and may now be dismissed without compensation, and in addition they have lost the right to a day off a week with pay, to holidays with pay and to compensation for overtime.
.An arbitrary order has been issued forbidding the unionisation of agricultural workers and placing these workers at the mercy of the landowners. It is alleged that murders of agricultural workers by employers or their agents have only been punished by fines. The workers employed by the Government are also unable to form trade unions ; this makes it difficult for them to insist on their lawful rights and claims in the event",-1,1956,Guatemala
66,"to organise co-operative societies among its members and to create and stimulate the co-operative spirit in its members by all means in its power ... ;(b) to establish, administer or encourage institutions for assistance and social welfare in the mutual interest of its members ... ;(c) by all means in its power to provide the necessary instruction for those of its members and their families who cannot read and write.
.An association of agricultural workers shall not be formed with a membership of less than .
.The Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare, acting through the General Labour Inspectorate, shall facilitate the work of agricultural associations and shall give them advice constantly in all matters relating to their activities and working.The said Ministry shall ensure that agricultural associations do not engage in any activities other than those specified in section  and in subparagraph (b) of section , so long as the associations in question fail to furnish evidence that they are engaged in one of the two forms of activity specified in subparagraphs (a) and (b) of the said section  and that they have amongst their members not less than  per cent who are able to read and write. For this last-mentioned purpose, agricultural associations shall be bound to indicate, in their Constitution and in the annual list of members, opposite the name of each member, whether he can read and write ; the statements respecting this must be countersigned by a teacher in the service of the Ministry of Education who is employed in the locality where the association concerned is domiciled or has its offices.
.The provisions laid down in Chapter I of Part VI of this Code [""General Provisions and Urban Associations ""] shall apply to associations of agricultural or stock-raising undertakings which have not less than  employees in their service.
.The Committee notes from the foregoing sections that under Guatemalan legislation agricultural associations are organisations with specific purposes (cooperation and the abolition of illiteracy) and that, except when they have more than  members and not less than  per cent of literate members, they do not possess the powers normally granted to trade unions, e.g. the right "" to conclude collective contracts of employment and collective agreements respecting conditions of employment "" which section  of the Code grants to urban associations. In this connection it should be pointed out that the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) which has been ratified by Guatemala, emphatically states that "" workers ... without distinction whatsoever "" are entitled to form organisations of their own choosing, whereas section  of the Guatemalan Labour Code imposes a restriction incompatible with this principle in that it requires  per cent of the members to be literate. Article  of the Right of Association (Agriculture) Convention,  (No. ) :which has not been ratified by Guatemala-confirms this principle : "" Each member of the International Labour Organisation which ratifies this Convention undertakes to secure to all those engaged in agriculture the same rights of association and combination as to industrial workers.."".
.In the present case the existence of special regulations for "" agricultural associations "" implies prima facie the existence of restrictions on the right of workers "" without distinction whatsoever "" to establish organisations, and the right of all unions in accordance with Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) to conduct their affairs freely. When a complaint refers to the application of a Convention which has been ratified the Committee is called upon, even if the allegations are couched in general terms, to inquire whether there has been an infringement of the obligation assumed by States to comply scrupulously with the Conventions they have ratified.
.Owing, however, to the fact that the restrictions were imposed by an Act passed in  before Convention No.  was ratified, while the complaining organisation refers to a more recent violation of the freedom of association of agricultural workers without supplying any evidence to show that the right of agricultural workers to form unions has recently been the subject of any further restrictive regulations, and since, moreover, according to section  of the  Constitution the question of the regulation of agricultural associations will be specifically dealt with in new regulations, the Committee, in view of the fact that the existing regulations impose restrictions on agricultural trade unions which are contrary to Convention No.  which has been ratified by Guatemala, considers it necessary to call the attention of the Government to the disparity between the provisions of the Convention and the national legislation and to the necessity of taking steps to bring such legislation into conformity with the Convention.
.As the Committee was informed that the first report sent by the Government of Guatemala on the application of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), in accordance with article  of the Constitution of the I.L.O, was recently received by the International Labour Office and that it will be examined by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations at its next session (March ), the Committee considers it desirable that the above observations should be drawn to the attention of the Committee of Experts.Allegations relating to the Right to Organise of Workers Employed by the Government
.The complainant alleges that workers in government service, such as school teachers and road construction workers, cannot form associations to protect themselves against the arbitrary dismissals ordered by the present Government. The latter, for its part, states that it is at present drafting a set of public service regulations and that in the meantime the Government Workers' Decree No.  of  February  is applicable. The Government states that since this decree has been in force none of the unions of government workers have lost their incorporated status.
.Section  () of Decree No. -which deals with civil servants, public employees and government workers - states : "" the formation of trade unions by the workers referred to in this decree shall be prohibited "". In this respect it should be noted that the right of all workers without distinction whatsoever to establish trade unions is specifically recognised by the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), which has been ratified by Guatemala. Article  of this Convention stipulates that "" workers ... without distinction whatsoever shall have the right to establish and ... to join organisations of their own choosing without previous authorisation "". This right is confirmed a contrario by the provision in Article  which, as the only exceptions, allows freedom of association to be restricted in the armed forces and the police.
.This being so, the Committee, in view of the specific ban on the formation of trade unions by government workers embodied in current Guatemalan regulations, considers it advisable, bearing in mind the principle laid down in Case No.  (India) regarding "" the right of state and local government employees to constitute and register trade unions "", to point out the incompatibility of the ban contained in section  of Decree No.  with Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), which has been ratified by Guatemala. Although Decree No. , according to the Government's own statement, is merely a provisional measure pending the introduction of a set of public service regulations and no existing trade union has been dissolved since it was promulgated, the Committee notes that the present ban, under that decree, on the formation of trade unions by civil servants and government employees and workers is contrary to the above-mentioned Convention ratified by Guatemala and calls the attention of the Government to this fact and to the necessity of taking steps to ensure that the final version of the public service regulations shall be in conformity with the Convention.
.For the same reasons as were indicated in paragraph  above, the Committee considers it desirable that these observations should be drawn to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.Allegations relating to the Imprisonment and Persecution of Trade Union Leaders
.The complainant alleges in general terms that the free trade union movement is harassed and persecuted and that, under pretext of combating communism, trade union leaders are persecuted, illegally imprisoned, and driven into exile. The Government denies this allegation and quotes a number of Constitutional provisions stipulating that no person may be arrested without a warrant, exiled or refused entry into the country, etc.
.The Committee notes that the complaint does not refer to any specific cases of imprisonment or persecution of any individual trade union leader and draws attention to the fact that it has submitted its conclusions concerning certain specific cases of this character to the Governing Body in paragraphs  to  of this report dealing with",-1,1956,Guatemala
67,"Case No. . In these circumstances, while once more emphasising the importance it attaches to ensuring that every trade unionist on arrest is afforded all the safeguards of due process of law, the Committee considers that the allegations made in the present case are too vague to permit of an examination of this aspect of the case on its merits.Allegations relating to the Dissolution of the Educational Workers' Union and Other Bodies
.The C.T.A.L alleges that the Educational Workers' Union has been arbitrarily dissolved, together with the General Confederation of Labour and the Confederation of Peasants of Guatemala. The Government states that it was forced to take these measures because of Communist infiltration into these organisations, and it does not consider that it has violated the spirit of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), which Guatemala has ratified.
.The Committee has already had occasion in Case No.  to make a special examination of the dissolution of the General Confederation of Labour and the Confederation of Peasants. This measure was ordered by Decree No.  of  August  issued by the Government Junta. The text of this decree, which is analysed in Case No. , can be summarised as follows : section  states that  trade union and political organisations are dissolved together with "" any other political parties or organisations or associations that have supported Arevalo or Arbenz or have served the Communist cause "". The General Confederation of Labour is referred to in subsection (a), the Confederation of Peasants of Guatemala in subsection (b) and the Educational Workers' Union in sub section (e). Under section  legal personality is withdrawn from all the dissolved organisations, while section  states that the decree is a security measure.
.In Case No.  the Committee found that, according to the Guatemalan Labour Code, the only bodies with power to dissolve trade unions are the labour courts on submission of proof that the unions have committed some illegal act (e.g. interference in political affairs or religious or racial disputes, activities detrimental to democracy, etc.) (section ). Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) (which has been ratified by Guatemala) states that workers' and employers' organisations shall not be liable to be dissolved or suspended by administrative authority, while Article  stipulates that this provision also applies to federations and Confederations. When Decree No.  was promulgated by the Government Junta, the Committee observed that "" Decree No.  pronouncing the dissolution of the General Confederation of Labour and the Confederation of Peasants of Guatemala was promulgated by the Government and considers that dissolution by the executive branch of the Government acting in the exercise of legislative functions with which it is endowed by virtue of its act of Constitution, like dissolution by virtue of administrative powers, does not ensure the right of defence which normal judicial procedure alone can guarantee and to which the Committee continues, in accordance with the views which it has expressed in other cases, to attach the greatest importance "". Nevertheless, in view of the political situation in Guatemala at the time, the Committee recommended the Governing Body to draw the attention of the Government "" to the desirability of taking all necessary measures to ensure (i) that free and independent central workers' and peasants' organisations, as well as their affiliated unions and federations, may reconstitute themselves in accordance with the provisions of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ).... "" This recommendation was endorsed by the Governing Body when it adopted the th Report of the Committee on Freedom of Association on  November  ; the Guatemalan Government was informed of it by the Director-General of the I.L.O by a letter dated  December .
.In the present case the Committee notes that the complaint of the C.T.A.L adduces no new evidence regarding the dissolution of the General Confederation of Labour and the Confederation of Peasants, apart from the fact, which is confirmed in the Government's reply, that the position, despite the recommendation made by the Committee in November  in Case No. , had not changed by the date of the complaint (May ). The Committee notes that the Government also states in its reply that "" this measure [dissolution] does not violate the spirit of Conventions Nos.  and  which have been ratified by Guatemala "" ; on this point the Committee draws the attention of the Government once more to the view it expressed in Case No.  and which it now reiterates.
.With regard to the dissolution of the Educational Workers' Union - which was not included in the complaint dealt with in Case No.  and was not, therefore, examined by the Committee - the position both in fact and in law is exactly the same as in the case of the organisations referred to in the previous paragraph, since this Union was also dissolved administratively by Decree No. , upon which the Committee has already stated its views.
.In these circumstances the Committee, noting that the complaint under review makes no new allegation concerning those dissolutions not already examined in Case No. , reiterates its earlier recommendation and draws the attention of the Guatemalan Government once more to the aforementioned recommendation regarding the desirability of taking all necessary measures to ensure that free and independent central workers' and peasants' organisations, as well as their affiliated unions and federations, may reconstitute themselves in accordance with the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ).Allegations relating to the Confiscation of the Assets of the Educational Workers' Union
.The complainant alleges that the Guatemalan Government confiscated the assets of the Educational Workers' Union when it was dissolved ; it is stated that these assets totalled , quetzales, made up of members' contributions. The Government, for its part, states that "" the assets of this Union automatically became State property, since the Union's own by-laws stated that in the event of dissolution its assets should revert to the State "".
.Section  of Decree No.  of , which dissolved the Union in question, states : "" An inventory of the property and funds of the bodies referred to in subsections (k), (l), (m), (n), () and (o) (viz. : University Democratic Front, Guatemalan Labour Party, Guatemalan revolutionary Party, Revolutionary Action Party and National Reconstruction Party) of section  of the present decree shall be compiled by the Ministry of the Interior; in the case of the bodies referred to in other subsections it shall be compiled by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Labour. Both Ministries shall carry out the dissolution of these bodies and shall sequestrate their property and funds. ""
.It should be noted in the first place that section  of the Dissolution Decree by no means orders the straightforward confiscation of the property of the dissolved organisations, but merely instructs the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Labour and the Ministry of the Interior to compile an inventory and to sequestrate these assets. Moreover, the Committee notes that according to the Government the confiscation was ordered in accordance with the by-laws of the dissolved organisation, although it has not supplied the Committee with a copy of these by-laws. In the circumstances, the Committee is bound to feel some doubts about the interpretation placed upon this clause which is quite unusual in the by-laws of any trade union. Even assuming that such a provision existed whereby the assets reverted to the State in the event of dissolution, the Committee doubts whether such a clause could be regarded as applicable in the event of a forced dissolution which took place under a procedure at variance with the laws and regulations in force at the time when the by-laws were adopted ; these laws and regulations, as has been seen, made no provision for forced dissolution at the order of the administrative authorities ; and it is particularly difficult to regard such a clause as applicable in a situation in which the authorities may derive financial benefit from a dissolution imposed in circumstances that the dissolved organisation was unable to foresee.
.The Committee in its First Report stated that one of the questions calling for further study was the protection of trade union funds against misuse and it has been called upon to deal with a number of cases in which such funds had been blocked or confiscated. The principle followed by the Committee in examining these cases was the universally accepted criterion that, when an organisation is dissolved, its assets should be provisionally sequestrated and eventually distributed among its former members or handed over to the organisation that succeeds it.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends that the Guatemalan Government should be requested to furnish further information regarding the confiscation (the legal basis for",-1,1956,Guatemala
68,"this action, the use made of the funds and the safeguards possessed by the members of the union) and any intentions it may have of restoring these assets to the individuals concerned when the dissolved organisation is allowed to re-form in accordance with the Committee's recommendation in paragraph .
.In all these circumstances, the Committee:(a) recommends the Governing Body to decide that the allegations regarding violations of human rights and Guatemalan labour legislation and the imprisonment and persecution of trade union leaders do not call for further examination ;(b) recommends the Governing Body, in accordance with the conclusions stated in paragraphs  and :(i) to call the attention of the Government to the fact that the existing Labour Code imposes restrictions on agricultural trade unions which are incompatible with the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), which has been ratified by Guatemala, and to the necessity for ensuring that the future regulations provided for in the  Constitution will abolish these restrictions and to request the Government to keep the Governing Body informed as to the contents of such regulations when they are promulgated ;(ii) to draw the matter to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations ;(c) recommends the Governing Body, in accordance with the conclusions stated in paragraphs  and :(i) to call the Government's attention to the fact that the existing ban on the formation of trade unions by civil servants and government employees and workers is contrary to the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), which has been ratified by Guatemala, and to the necessity of taking steps to ensure that the final version of the public service regulations shall be in conformity with the Convention, and to keep the Governing Body informed as to the contents of such regulations when they are promulgated ;(ii) to draw the matter to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations ;(d) recommends the Governing Body, in accordance with the conclusion stated in paragraph , to call the attention of the Government to the Committee's recommendation in Case No. -which was endorsed by the Governing Body when it approved the Committee's th Report-to take all necessary measures to enable free and independent central workers' and peasants' organisations, as well as their affiliated unions and federations, to re-establish themselves in accordance with the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), which has been ratified by Guatemala ;(e) recommends the Governing Body to take note of the present provisional report in so far as it refers to allegations regarding the confiscation of the assets of the Educational Workers' Union, on the understanding that the Committee will make a further report as soon as it receives the information requested in paragraph .",-1,1956,Guatemala

70,".The complaint of the Latin American Confederation of Workers (W.F.T.U) is contained in two communications dated  March and  April , which are analysed separately.Communication of  March 
.According to this communication an outbreak of repression directed against all trade union organisations has occurred in Argentina, in violation of the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The state of siege is alleged to be the means used by the provisional Government to break into premises belonging to trade unions, imprison leaders and prohibit trade union meetings. It is claimed that members of the armed forces, who can in no way represent the interests of the workers, have been placed at the head of trade union organisations. Over  trade union leaders and active unionists are said to have been relegated to Patagonia and confined in a concentration camp. They include Rubens Iscaro, General Secretary of the Movement for Trade Union Democratisation and Independence and a leader of the Building Workers' Union, whose home is alleged to have been attacked by the police at daybreak on  December .Communication of  April 
.It is alleged that on  January  two newspaper sellers were arrested for selling the paper Nuestra Palabra. It is alleged that at Mar del Plata two building workers were dragged off as "" disturbers of the peace "" and transferred to the National Penitentiary. It is said that Messrs. Luis Martinez, Ulises Zangoititas and Rodolfo Weidman, of the Insurance Workers' Union, were arrested in Buenos Aires. A worker of the "" Atlanta "" firm who had supported a strike by the personnel of the factory is alleged to have been arrested on  January and sentenced to  days' imprisonment as an "" agitator "". In December  the police are said to have "" attempted to deprive of their liberty "" the construction workers Andrs Ibarrolla, Amado Ibarrolla and Domingo Moner. They are said to have been ordered to report to the police station at Quilmes. Forty offenders sentenced to  days' imprisonment are said to be detained in the prison of Villa Devoto. It is claimed that in the National Penitentiary good conduct certificates are demanded of members of their households who wish to visit prisoners. There is said to be a warrant for the arrest of Victor Vzquez ; his house is said to have been broken into and books confiscated. Vzquez is alleged to have been sentenced to  days' imprisonment for breach of the new police regulations : owing to the opposition of the public prosecutor the writ of habeas corpus applied for on his behalf was not granted. Francisco Mazo, E. F. Vai and Simn Gamarnik are said to be under permanent arrest at the pleasure of the Government so that the application made to a court in La Plata for a writ of habeas corpus has not been granted. It is said that the rights of the defence are restricted and that in most cases the judges themselves reject applications for writs of habeas corpus. The publication of Unidad Sindical, Vocero, Lucha Obrera, El Federal, Derechos del Hombre and other papers is said to be prohibited. The complaining organisation also submits an "" incomplete "" list of the imprisoned trade unionists and of political prisoners "" in the following penal establishments : the prison of Rio Gallegos (Santa Cruz), the Women's' Reformatory, the San Miguel Asylum, the prison of Viedma (Rio Negro), the National Penitentiary, the prison of Olmos (La Plata), the jail of the Department of La Plata (Province of Buenos Aires), the prison of Villa Devoto (Federal Capital), the prison of Esquel (Chubut), the police station at Caseros (Province of Buenos Aires) and "" southern prisons "". Of the names mentioned it is said that E. F. Vai was tortured in the prison of Viedma and Leonardo Gmez in the police station at Caseros. Pedro Castagno and Sal Veloso are said to be detained in the prison of Villa Devoto (Federal Capital) and to be threatened with deportation.ANALYSIS OF THE REPLY
.The Argentine Government submitted its observations in communications dated  May and  November  and  February , which are analysed separately.Communication of  May 
.In this communication the Argentine Government replies to the allegations submitted by the Confederation of Workers of Latin America on  March . The policy followed in the labour field is outlined as follows in the declaration of principles of the revolutionary Government : "" To establish freedom of association so as to ensure the genuine democratic operation, outside the field of party politics, of occupational organisations and trade unions, which the Government will make a special point of supporting ; to take government action to guarantee that real social justice shall prevail in an atmosphere of freedom ; the gains and rights of the workers to be fully recognised and further increased ; one of the Government's basic intentions is to achieve a real advance in the living conditions of the lower income brackets "". Although the provisional Government has been compelled to order arrests in accordance with its objectives and with a view to maintaining its stability and public order, nobody has been arrested merely owing to the fact he is a worker or a trade union leader. Where persons have been arrested or prosecuted this action has been taken owing to ordinary offences or misdemeanours having absolutely no relation to the fact that these persons are workers. Thus Rubens Iscaro was arrested at his home by the police by order of the competent authority and in accordance with due process of law Iscaro and other political leaders have been accommodated (and not "" relegated "") in a number of penal establishments (and not in "" concentration camps ""). Whilst a state of siege does in a way limit the rights of the individual it does not abolish them, since it is always possible to put up a defence either through administrative channels or by resort to the courts. These arrests were ordered exclusively with an eye to political activities connected with the former totalitarian rgime ; the Government appointed an administrator to run the affairs of the General Confederation of Labour and its affiliates in order to restore order in the management of the unions and to put an end to the venality and corruption of the leaders imposed on the movement by the dictatorship that has been overthrown. This intervention in the management of the unions was, moreover, intended to guarantee that within a period which was wisely kept short (within  days of  May ) really free elections would be held within the unions.Communication of  November 
.In this communication the Argentine Government transmits a memorandum of the Ministry of the Interior referring chiefly to the allegations put forward by the Latin American Confederation of Workers on  April . The Government begins by stating that, although all the necessary steps were taken to collect all the facts, the inadequate identification of the persons whose imprisonment is denounced by the Latin American Confederation of Workers held up the inquiry. In particular there have been cases of homonym, as with regard to Luis Martinez-one of the most common names-which called for the consultation of over  entries. In addition, it should be borne in mind that since Argentina is a federal State, each province, as well as the federal capital territory, has its own system of identification. Individual police files and the records of penal establishments are organised on the basis of identity numbers. In this country, however, there is no general register from which it can be determined whether a person is or is not being prosecuted in some particular province. Moreover, in each province the identity index cards give only the final judgment in the case and do not mention the mere fact of a prosecution. The Government states that in the light of these explanations the persons mentioned in the complaint of the Latin American Confederation of Workers dated  April  can be classified in two categories : () persons in the hands of the Government ; and () persons detained by other authorities.
.As regards the first category, "" persons in the hands of the Government "", the provision that entitles the Government to proceed in this manner is Act No.  of  September , proclaiming a state of siege. According to article  of the Argentine Constitution of , "" in the event of an interior disturbance or an external attack that imperils the functioning of this Constitution and of the authorities set up thereby, a state of siege shall be proclaimed in the province or territory where public order is disturbed and Constitutional guarantees shall be suspended therein, provided that whilst these guarantees are suspended the President of the Republic may not convict on his own or impose sentences. In such a case his power over persons shall be limited to that of arresting them or transferring",-1,1956,Argentina
71,"them from one part of the country to another, unless they prefer to leave Argentine territory."" In a list of names appended to its reply the Government gives the names of the persons in the hands of the Government, stating the date of arrest, the number of the Decree ordering the arrest and the date of release. On the date of the Government's communication only  persons were in this position. The Government gives their names, the dates of their arrests and the number of the Decree in each case. The fact that these persons are in the hands of the Government does not mean that the Constitutional guarantee of due process of law has been abrogated with regard to them. According to the jurisprudence of the Argentine Supreme Court, whose judgments the Government quotes, "" the detention of those convicted does not constitute a punishment but a preventive security measure which may be stopped by taking advantage of the option to leave the country "" (Judgments, Vol. , , p. ). According to another decision (Judgments, Vol. , , p. ), "" the intention behind the Constitution is to reconcile the need to maintain public order, which is the proper atmosphere for freedom, with the protection granted by the Constitution to the rights of the individual. So long as the person arrested or transferred has not signified his intention [of exercising his right to leave the country] the restriction of his liberty is Constitutionally valid ; if he signifies his intention and is allowed to go, no action lies in law ; if he is denied [the right to leave] or if it is made subject to restrictions that are contrary to law, the courts become competent to act in the defence of the right that has been ignored. This ensures that the purposes of article  [of the Constitution] are achieved ; each power operates within its own field and none of the guarantees of article  [of the Constitution : rights of the individual] are endangered.""
.The Government explains that the existence of a state of siege is due to the fact that the country has been going through a period of revolution after the overthrow in September  of a totalitarian dictatorship. With a view to the prompt restoration of the republican democratic rgime provided for in the Constitution of , the present revolutionary Government has been compelled to maintain a state of siege as provided for in the Constitution itself, and this makes it necessary at times to impose a minimum of restrictions on individual rights, while respecting the Constitutional guarantee of due legal process. The Government has issued writs for an election to be held in . It should be stated that the existing state of siege, which is a legal position provided for in the Constitution, represents the abolition of the "" internal state of war "" imposed on the country by the former dictatorship in violation of Constitutional rules. In addition, one of the first steps taken by the revolutionary Government was to guarantee the absolute independence of the judiciary. The allegation that some of those arrested have been arbitrarily deprived of the possibility of habeas corpus proceedings-besides being a gratuitous accusation-cannot be remedied by the Executive but through applications by those concerned to the competent appeals courts.
.The Government encloses an alphabetical list of the names of the persons who are mentioned by the complainant and whom it has not been possible to identify for the reasons previously stated. In any case none of these persons is now under arrest. At the most they would be offenders sentenced for minor offences or misdemeanours. Sentences of imprisonment for such criminal offences do not exceed  days. The regulations governing misdemeanours lie within the exclusive jurisdiction of each province. Generally speaking the proceedings for dealing with misdemeanours are summary : there are two instances and a defendant can submit evidence and appeal to a higher court. The offender may even by special appeal (on ground of unconstitutional action) go so far as the country's Supreme Court. The provincial laws guarantee due legal process for trials relating to minor offences and misdemeanours. The Government states that if the organisation which made the complaint were to supply more information (identification certificates, date and place of arrest, province, etc.), thus enabling the identification of the persons in question, it would perhaps be possible to carry out more thorough inquiries. At all events all the persons concerned had broken laws relating to offences or had committed misdemeanours, and had either served their sentences at the time of the Government's reply or were never arrested.
.In conclusion, the Government refers to other charges that are so vague that it cannot reply in detail. It has not been possible to find any trace of the alleged cases of torture. The Government draws attention to the fact that the Latin American Confederation of Workers has not stated to what court the relatives of the tortured men submitted their complaints. The law courts are always available to relatives to deal with all speed with complaints relating to illegal arrest and torture, which constitute offences under the Argentine laws. With respect to the allegations regarding the freedom of the press, the Government states that  dailies and other periodicals are published in the country. Only six of them belong to the Government, and even the editors of these six papers have freedom of opinion. It can be imagined that a tremendous percentage of the publications defend ideas in opposition to those of the Government. The prohibition of distribution-and not of freedom of expression--has in some cases been necessary for security reasons since a certain section of the press followed the directions of the deposed dictatorship and had adopted an attitude that was directly subversive. Such restrictions on individual freedom under a state of siege have been recognised as being legitimate by decisions of the national Supreme Court. Apart from these restrictions, newspapers and reviews of the most varied tendencies enjoy full freedom of expression ; and numerous political and trade union public meetings have been held. Authorisation to hold public meetings has not been refused to any party, including the Communist Party of Argentina. Since September  more than , political speeches of various tendencies have been broadcast.Communication of  February 
.In this communication the Argentine Government states that, of the  persons listed in their letter of  November  as having been arrested and placed at the disposition of the executive authorities, four have been released (one of them choosing to leave the country) and that the Government is now considering the cases of the other persons arrested. On  February  the Minister of the Interior, Dr. Carlos Alconoda Aramburu, declared : "" The revolutionary Government, respecting human rights and the law, has arrested no one by reason of his political opinions. It is only in proven cases of subversion endangering social peace or of sabotage against the national patrimony that the Government has found itself obliged to exercise the powers conferred upon it by article  of the Constitution."" The Government also transmits the text of a judgment of the Supreme Court, dated  December , dismissing the appeal of Mr. Rubens Iscaro and others against a refusal of habeas corpus by the lower court. With respect to the newspapers Vocero, Derechos del Hombre, El Federal (organ of the former Government Party in the province of Crdoba), and Lucha Obrera (organ of the National Revolutionary Socialist Party allied with the former Government Party), their publication has been suspended, states the Government, by reason of the fact that they engaged in subversive propaganda in favour of the rgime abolished by the revolution.
.In a statement made on  February  the Controller of the General Confederation of Labour declared that, first degree elections having taken place in the trade unions throughout the country-these organisations having been handed back to their members-steps are now being taken to hold elections in the federations, which will be followed by an end of the control of the federations. He said that the Electrical and Motive Power Workers' Federation was the first to be handed back to its legitimate administrators, elected by the workers in a truly democratic election. The statement ended with the declaration that the extraordinary general meeting of the electrical and motive power workers had approved everything that had been done during the period of control and that the other federations would, in turn, soon be handed back to the workers. The Government adds that , of the , trade unions have been handed back to their own administrations, following new elections, and that the same step will be taken with respect to the remainder. In the case of federations, the Government states that  have already been convened for the purpose of electing their administrations and that the remaining ones will be convened before the end of March. After that the same measures will",-1,1956,Argentina
72,"be taken in the case of the General Confederation of Labour.
.The allegations which the Committee is called upon to examine refer to various governmental measures towards the end of  and in the early months of , i.e. during a period of grave political disturbance in Argentina, which was then under martial law. The Government to which the complainant organisation attributes such action is a revolutionary Government which took power in September . In examining the various allegations submitted it is therefore necessary to have regard to the political situation through which the country was passing and to the political aspect of the governmental actions complained of. In many previous cases', in which it had to examine allegations against countries which were in a state of political crisis or had just passed through grave disturbances (civil war, revolution, etc.), the Committee considered it necessary, when examining the various measures taken by the governments, including some against trade union organisations, to have regard to such exceptional circumstances when examining the merits of the allegations. It is common knowledge that Argentina has passed through a revolutionary period and that the normal operation of its institutions has not yet been fully re-established. The various allegations made by the Latin American Confederation of Workers should, therefore, be considered in the light of the above facts.Allegations relating to the Detention of Trade Unionists and Workers
.Most of the allegations submitted by the complaining organisation refer to the arrest of trade unionists and workers. It appears from the Government's reply that, on  November , only  of the hundreds of persons mentioned by the complaining organisation were still in the hands of the Government. According to the Government's later reply dated  February  only seven of these  persons then remained in custody, three having been released and one having chosen to exercise his right to leave the country. The Government is considering the cases of those still detained. In the view of the Government, since the arrest of these persons was ordered by an agent of the authority specified in the Constitution, the guarantee of due legal process has been respected. The Executive has confined itself to applying a preventive security measure and not a punishment, and those arrested can halt this security measure immediately by observing the Constitutional procedure, which gives them the option of leaving Argentine territory, an option exercised by one of those concerned. The Minister of the Interior declared on  February  that the persons detained were not arrested by reason of their political opinions but were arrested only in proven cases of subversion or sabotage seriously endangering social peace. Further, the Government states that it has been unable to find any trace of the alleged tortures. In any case the appropriate criminal proceedings have not been instituted before the courts in which relatives of the persons concerned may institute proceedings with respect to matters of this kind.
.In the many cases in which the Committee has had to examine allegations regarding enforcement of measures of a strictly political character, such as martial law, it has always required the information submitted by governments to be sufficiently precise and circumstantial enough to enable it to conclude that the arrests were in no way occasioned by trade union activities. In the present case the Argentine Government has made a full inquiry into the position and supplied the Committee with detailed information, including particulars of the dates of release of  persons, and a list of  persons who have not been sufficiently clearly identified by the complainant to make possible full inquiries concerning them and in respect of whom the Government has no record of their having been detained.
.The question of the justification for introducing emergency measures, such as martial law or the like, is one which lies outside the competence of the Committee except in so far as it may have effect on the exercise of trade union rights.
.The Government states that the arrests of the seven persons who are still in prison were ordered with scrupulous respect for the Constitutional safeguard of due process of law : it was not strictly a case of imposing penalties, but rather of provisional security action to which the persons concerned can put an end at any time by making use of their rights under article  of the Constitution. The Supreme Constitutional Court of Argentina has declared this kind of restriction on individual liberties to be legitimate during a state of emergency. Furthermore, the arrested persons have administrative and judicial procedures for their defence ; and although, as the complainant organisation itself indicates, the courts in certain cases did not allow the writs of habeas corpus (see paragraph  above), this itself implies recognition that each of the persons concerned is in a position to defend himself under normal judicial procedure.
.The Government has confirmed that in every case the safeguard of due process of law was respected and that the supreme judicial authority of the country, which is independent of the Executive, confirmed the legality of the Government's action. What the Committee on Freedom of Association is concerned with is not, however, whether the action taken is legal under Argentine law, a matter on which the findings of the Supreme Constitutional Court of Argentina are clearly final, but whether the legal powers vested in the Argentine Government by the national law have been exercised in a manner inconsistent with freedom of association. The Committee has always emphasised the importance of due process in cases in which trade unionists are charged with offences of a political character or with offences under the ordinary law and has taken the view that granting a trade unionist his freedom on condition of his leaving the country cannot be regarded as compatible with the free exercise of trade union rights. The requirement of due process would not appear to be fulfilled if under the national law the effect of a state of siege is that a court to which application is made for habeas corpus cannot make and does not make an examination of the merits of the case. The question in such a case is not whether the judiciary is independent but whether the law which it is called upon to apply is consistent with the principle of freedom of association and affords adequate guarantees of an independent and impartial examination of the merits of cases in which a trade unionist has been charged with a political offence. In all these circumstances the Committee, while recognising the exceptional character of the situation in Argentina and noting that only seven of the persons named by the complainant now remain under arrest, considers it appropriate to draw attention to the importance which it has always attached to the observance of due process in such cases, and to affording any such persons a fair trial on the merits of the charges on which they are detained.Allegations relating to Repression of the Trade Union Movement
.The complaining organisation alleges in general terms that there has been in Argentina a movement of repression against all trade union organisations. Some trade union meetings are said to have been prohibited and members of the armed forces are alleged to have been appointed to run the various trade union organisations, although these persons lack any representative character. The Government denies that any such repression occurred, since one of the objectives stated in the revolutionary Government's declaration of principles is precisely the re-establishment of freedom of association. In order to put an end to the administrative corruption prevalent in various trade union organisations, due to the venality of the leaders imposed by the dictatorship which had been overthrown, the Government was obliged to appoint persons to administer the General Confederation of Labour and the unions affiliated to it. The function of these persons was to guarantee free and honest elections in the said organisations within a reasonable period ( days from  May ). The Government states, in its communication dated  February , that elections have been held in the , trade unions and that , of these have already been handed over to their own administrations, and that all the trade union federations will have been convened before the end of March to elect administrations which will take over control. Then, declares the Government, the same measures will be taken in the case of the General Confederation of Labour.
.As regards the alleged repression of trade union activities and prohibition of trade union meetings, it should be observed that these allegations are of general character and do not mention any specific case of prohibition of meetings or other repressive action apart from those examined in the preceding paragraphs (arrests, etc.). It should also be pointed out that the statutory system of workers' organisation which the present Government introduced by Decree No.  of  May  (repealing the previous trade union legislation which had been the subject of observations by the present Committee), expressly guarantees the",-1,1956,Argentina
73,"right of assembly without previous permission (section  of the Decree).
.As regards the appointment of persons to administer the General Confederation of Labour, the Government admits that this occurred and states that it was a measure rendered necessary by the corrupt administration of the unions whose officers had been appointed by the previous Government. The object of the said action was to make it possible for free elections to be held within a reasonable period. Intervention of this kind would appear incompatible with freedom of association in a normal period. It should be remembered, however, as pointed out in connection with the previous allegations, that this step was of a provisional character and taken by a revolutionary Government against trade union organisations which, in its view, were controlled by the Government recently overthrown. In Case No.  (Argentina) the Committee examined the situation arising out of this control of the General Confederation of Labour by the previous Government, and the Governing Body recommended the Argentine Government to reconsider the then existing law and practice. It would appear that the measures taken by the present Government were designed to implement the earlier recommendation of the Governing Body and that at the present time (February ) the object of the action taken by the Government is being achieved, primary trade union elections having been held and the administration of the unions in question having been handed over to the officers so elected, while preparations for similar elections in the case of the higher trade union organisations are now being made, after which they also will be handed over to their new administrations.
.In these circumstances the Committee considers that the intervention in the administration of the General Confederation of Labour and its affiliates, which the Government admits, was an exceptional measure of an entirely provisional character ordered during a period of transition towards a normal situation, which is being gradually re-established by means of free elections. The Committee therefore recommends the Governing Body to note that the return to a normal trade union situation is already well advanced and to reaffirm the importance which it attaches to re-establishing fully a situation in which workers without distinction may establish and freely join organisations of their own choosing. It also considers that the allegations regarding repression of trade union meetings are too vague to permit of an examination on their merits.Allegations relating to the Trade Union Press
.The complainant organisation alleges that publication of Unidad Sindical, Vocero, Lucha Obrera, El Federal, Derechos del Hombre, and other periodicals has been prohibited, and that persons selling Nuestra Palabra have been arrested. The Government, for its part, states that the restrictions imposed on the dailies mentioned by the complainant were based on the state of emergency which justifies, as the Supreme Court of Justice has admitted in several judgments, limitation for security reasons of the freedom of a certain section of the press "" directly subversive and hostile to the revolution ... following the directives of supporters of the fugitive ex-dictator "". The Government adds that the publication of the newspapers Vocero, Derechos del Hombre, El Federal (organ of the former Government Party) and Lucha Obrera (organ of the National Revolutionary Socialist Party allied with the former Government Party) was suspended because they engaged in subversive propaganda in favour of the rgime abolished by the revolution. Apart from this, states the Government, publications enjoy complete liberty of opinion, liberty of expression has not been hindered, and public, political and trade union functions have taken place in all freedom, while the radio is freely used for political propaganda. The Government indicates that the restrictions imposed during the state of emergency are temporary and that the return of the country to a normal Constitutional situation by means of elections is due to take place in . The need to defend the objectives of a revolution sometimes involves, according to the Government, the imposition of a minimum of restrictions on individual rights, in accordance with express provisions of the Constitution.
.In earlier cases relating to freedom of the press, the Committee considered that it was not called upon to examine the questions relating to freedom of the press in general but that it was competent only to examine the questions relating specifically to trade union publications, because as it stated in Case No.  (United Kingdom-British Guiana) "" the right to express opinions through newspapers or publications is certainly an essential element in trade union rights "".
.In the present case, of the publications whose circulation was admittedly restricted by the Government, only the Unidad Sindical would seem from its name, in the absence of other information, to be a labour or occupational organ. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the complaining organisation has offered no proof that the circulation of trade union publications was hindered by the reason of their being trade union publications. It appears from the Government's explanations that the restrictions imposed (during a revolutionary period and a state of emergency) were not based on the trade union nature of the publications but only on their "" directly subversive "" character, and that the restrictions were limitations of the general freedom of the press imposed for ""reasons of a political character and not purposes of trade union repression. In these circumstances the Committee, while stressing the importance of freedom of the trade union press as an essential element in trade union rights, considers that the restrictions imposed by the Argentine revolutionary Government on certain publications during the period of emergency appear mainly to have been based on reasons of a general political character. While bearing in mind the exceptional character of these measures, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to draw the attention of the Government to the importance of ensuring respect for the freedom of trade union publications.
.In conclusion the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to express its satisfaction at the measures taken by the Government with a view to restoring fully freedom of association and to ensuring full observance of trade union rights ;(b) to draw the attention of the Argentine Government and trade unionists to the text of the resolution concerning the independence of the trade union movement adopted by the International Labour Conference at its th Session (Geneva, ) which states "". it is essential for the trade union movement in each country to preserve its freedom and independence so as to be in a position to carry forward its economic and social mission irrespective of political changes "" ; when trade unions decide to initiate legally permitted political action they must ensure that such action is not "" of such a nature as to compromise the continuance of the trade union movement or its social and economic functions irrespective of political changes in the country "" ; it states further : "" Governments in seeking the co-operation of trade unions to carry out their economic and social policies should recognise that the value of this co-operation rests to a large extent on the freedom and independence of the trade union movement as an essential factor in promoting social advancement and should not attempt to transform the trade union movement into an instrument for the pursuance of political aims, nor should they attempt to interfere with the normal functions of a trade union movement because of its freely established relationship with a political party "" ;(c) to note the assurances given by the Government that persons are being held in preventive detention only in proven cases of subversion or sabotage and that the cases of those persons who are still detained are being considered, and to emphasise the importance of ensuring that every detained person shall enjoy the full guarantee of due legal process, so that an independent judicial authority can within a reasonable period carry out an objective examination of the merits of the charges on which he is detained ;(d) to note that the appointment by the Government of persons to administer the affairs of the General Confederation of Labour was an emergency measure taken after a revolution for the purpose of enabling organisations which had been controlled by the preceding Government to hold free elections, to note that such elections have now been virtually completed and that the return to a normal trade union situation is already well advanced, and to reaffirm the importance which it attaches to re-establishing fully a situation in which workers and employers, without distinction whatsoever, have the right to establish and, subject only to the rules of the organisation concerned, to join organisations of their own choosing without previous authorisation, in which workers' and employers' organisations have the right to draw up their Constitutions and rules, to elect their representatives in full freedom, to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes, and in which the public authorities refrain from any interference which could restrict this right or impede the careful exercise thereof ;(e) to emphasise, with respect to the allegations relating to freedom of the press,",-1,1956,Argentina
74,".When it had considered this case at its th Session (Geneva, November ) the Committee formulated recommendations to the Governing Body on allegations made with respect to anti-Communist legislation and to the right to strike in public services. In the latter connection, after examining Decree No.  of  April  amending section  of the Labour Code, the Committee recommended the Governing Body:to draw the attention of the Government to the possibility of abuse present in the application of the provisions empowering the Government to include in the definition of those public services in which strikes are forbidden any others that, in the opinion of the Government, affect the safety, health, education and economic or social life of the population, and to decide in consultation with the Council of State which forms of employment fall within the categories defined, and to request the Government to furnish information as to the extent to which use has been made of the provisions in question and as to the existing jurisprudence of the Council of State relevant to this matter.With respect to further allegations concerning massacres of workers and peasants, the Committee, not having received the Government's observations, presented an interim report to the Governing Body. The th Report of the Committee was approved by the Governing Body at its rd Session (Geneva, November ).
.Since the adoption of the Committee's th Report there has been a complete change of Government in Colombia. On  May  the then President resigned and was replaced by a military junta, which declared its intention of ensuring that a liberal policy would be pursued and arrangements made for the holding of free and democratic elections. It is anticipated that an election will be held in , in a few months' time.
.At its th, th and th Sessions (Geneva, February, May and October  respectively), the Committee adjourned its examination of the outstanding allegations pending the receipt of observations from the Government covering the different matters still in issue. The Committee now has before it four communications received since it examined the case in its th Report : one dated  March  from the complainant, two, dated  December  (together with an annex dated  December  received subsequently) and  February , emanating from the previous Government, and one, dated  January , emanating from the Government now in office. The analysis below is confined to the allegations still outstanding and to the replies of the respective Governments referred to above.
.In its communications dated  May and  July  the complaining organisation describes a series of events constituting "" the most appalling crimes in the history of Latin America "" ; these involve violations of trade union and democratic rights, large-scale massacres of workers and peasants, and genocide. United Nations intervention is urged to put an end to this situation. It is stated that on  April  a wave of murders "" without reason or justification "" began in a number of places-which the complainant mentions by name-in the department of Tolima. It is alleged that these murders formed part of a plan to ""pacify"" the country. The massacre was carried out by a military force totalling , men. The bulk of the victims (some of whom are mentioned by name in the complaint) were in Santo Domingo ; it is alleged that before being put to death a number of peasants were castrated and forced to dig their own graves. In Los Brazuelos, Calarma and Guaipa,  peasants were brutally murdered, while women were assaulted and beaten. Many workers were murdered while they were working in the coffee plantations. The prisons in these towns contain a number of prisoners who are minors. Many prisoners disappear mysteriously and are probably put to death. The Government is alleged to consider that ""political prisoners are a problem because they may become a focus for agitation whereas once they are dead they can only be used in this way for a few days "". The church authorities have protested without result to the military authorities against these crimes ; thousands of people are stated to have fled for their lives to other areas. In its communication dated  March  the complaining organisation declares that the Government ordered the establishment of a court martial to try the trade union leader and patriot, Amado Zapata, although it had been impossible to bring any charge against him other than that of his devoted service to the masses. The complainant alleges that Mr. Zapata was sentenced to three years' imprisonment ""for his honest legal work as a trade union officer "" and that another trade union official, Mr. Isauro Yosa, was also sentenced to imprisonment. The complainants demand a review of the sentences and the liberation of the persons concerned.ANALYSIS OF THE REPLIES
.In its communication dated  December  the previous Government states that these allegations have no foundation whatsoever, that the reprehensible acts imputed to the Government by persons of extreme left-wing opinions are alleged because the Government has firmly prevented Communist infiltration, and that the complaint makes no mention of harm having been caused directly to any trade union or to members of any union. According to the Government, at a period about four months prior to the date of this reply, acts of banditry occurred in the department of Tolima and the army "" took the necessary measures to deal with them, in accordance with its precise duty to protect the peasantry against the extortion which certain terrorist elements, inspired no doubt by a desire for financial gain, were practising in the coffee-producing areas "". The annex to this document, dated  December  and signed by the then Minister of Labour, which did not in fact reach the Office until January , contains a statement to the effect that the allegations are untrue and, in any event, have no bearing on the exercise of trade union rights. The rest of the communication is devoted to demonstrating that real freedom of association exists, in the view of the Government, in Colombia, in support of which view it cites purported extracts from a letter received from the Inter-American Regional Organisation of Workers in August , after the return from Colombia of a mission sent by that organisation. In that letter, reference is made to the work of the Colombian Ministry of Labour and the Minister is complimented for advocating a free and independent kind of trade unionism in keeping with the concepts of the I.R.O.W.
.The Government now in office forwarded, with its communication dated  January , a copy of a letter dated  December , in which the present Secretary-General of the Ministry of Labour refers to the events complained of as having taken place in the lifetime of the previous Government and points out that the observations before the Committee emanating from the previous Government (analysed in paragraph  above) "" represent the latter's reply to the complaints "".
.The Committee has borne in mind the fact that, on  May , the previous Government, which had been in power throughout the period during which the events referred to by the complainant took place, was replaced by a new Government, which has since then been preparing the way for the holding of an election which is expected to take place in a few months' time.
.In certain earlier cases the Committee has taken the view that, where a change of rgime has taken place in a country, the new Government should take all necessary steps to remedy any continuing effects which events complained of as having taken place under its predecessor may have had since its accession to power.
.The Committee notes that the Government now in power has not endorsed the reply given by the previous Government to the effect that the allegations are untrue and, in any event, have no bearing on the exercise of trade union rights. The present Government has, however, given no information which makes it possible to judge how far the events complained of may have had any continuing consequences which have not yet been remedied. In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to request the Government to furnish information concerning the action which it is taking to remedy any consequences which may continue, having regard to the importance which the Governing Body has always attached, as was emphasised in paragraph  (c) of the Committee's th Report, to the fundamental civil liberties proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and to due process in the examination of charges of violations of the law of the land which may have a bearing on the exercise of trade union rights.
.Finally, the Committee notes that the Government has not yet furnished the information requested by the Governing Body in paragraph  (b) of the Committee's th Report (see paragraph  above) in connection with the application of the provisions of Colombian legislation concerning strikes in public services. In these circumstances,",-1,1956,Colombia
75,"this policy the National Trade Union Supervisory Department in  and  granted incorporated status in  cases, approved  amendments to by-laws, approved and registered  new executive boards, called nine trade union congresses, approved the accounts of  trade union organisations, answered  queries on these questions and dealt with , cases.
.With reference to the second decree mentioned by the C.T.A.L, the Government quotes section  of the Colombian Constitution which states : "" The right to strike is guaranteed except in public services. The exercise of this right shall be regulated by law."" The first regulation on this subject was section  of the Labour Code which has since been amended by Decree No.  of  April , which is the subject of the complaint made by the C.T.A.L. The Government reproduces this decree in its reply. It makes three amendments to section  of the Labour Code. In the first place it gives a technical definition of a "" public service "" which embodies the most recent interpretation of the experts on administrative law, and which has been supported by the Supreme Court of Justice since . Precedents for this legal definition are to be found in a Bill drafted by the Faculty of Law of the National University of Colombia and in a Bill tabled in the House of Representatives in  by a Communist member. In the second place it gives a list, which is not restrictive, of the public services in which strikes are prohibited. This list conforms to the wording of section  of the Labour Code except that it adds "" the extraction, processing and distribution of salt "". Lastly, it follows the two Bills that have been referred to in defining as public services "" any others that in the opinion of the Government affect the safety, health, education and economic or social life of the population. The Government shall decide in consultation with the Council of State which forms of employment fall within the category defined in this subsection. "" This recourse to the Council of State, which is the highest court for disputes under administrative law, affords a safeguard to the community at large.
.The Government concludes by stating that the facts themselves prove that the accusations of the C.T.A.L are groundless since, during the three years in which the present Government has been in power, there have only been nine strikes (of which the Government's reply gives details) and these have been outside the public services.
.In the circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to communicate the observations set forth in paragraph  to the Colombian Government, but to decide that the allegations regarding anti-Communist legislation do not call for further examination ;(b) to draw the attention of the Government to the possibility of abuse present in the application of the provisions empowering the Government to include in the definition of those public services in which strikes are forbidden any others that, in the opinion of the Government, affect the safety, health, education and economic or social life of the population, and to decide in consultation with the Council of State which forms of employment fall within the categories defined, and to request the Government to furnish information as to the extent to which use has been made of the provisions in question and as to the existing jurisprudence of the Council of State relevant to this matter ;(c) to take note of the present interim report with regard to the allegations concerning massacres of workers and peasants, in which the Committee indicates that it cannot formulate its conclusions on these allegations or on the extent to which a question affecting trade union rights is involved until the Colombian Government has submitted its observations ; to emphasise the importance which it has always attached to the fundamental civil liberties proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and to due process in the examination of charges of violations of the law of the land which may have a bearing on the exercise of trade union rights ; and to note that the Committee will report on these allegations when it has received the Government's observations thereon.Geneva,  November .

77,".The complaint by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions is contained in three letters, dated respectively  July ,  October  and  January . These are analysed below.
.With the first of these letters the I.C.F.T.U transmitted the text of a resolution on the Dominican Republic adopted by its Executive Board in July . In this resolution the Executive Board, "" taking note ... of the suppression of the free labour movement and lack of adequate social legislation and protection "" in the Dominican Republic, reaffirms its determination to fight for the restitution of trade union freedom and other democratic rights suppressed by the tyranny of Trujillo and calls on its affiliates to join in a world-wide campaign of protest. The General Secretary of the I.C.F.T.U would study the possibility of making a complaint to the International Labour Office on the violation of trade union rights and also the possibility of proclaiming a boycott of the Dominican Republic. The second letter, dated  October , contains the text of the complaint itself. According to this document, Rafael L. Trujillo forcibly seized the Presidency of the Dominican Republic on  August  and installed an authoritarian rgime which deprived the Dominican people of all fundamental freedoms, including freedom of association ; since that date, the Dominican people have lived under a rgime characterised by absolute control over all the activities of the country; the workers are subject to continuous repression and are obliged to swear fidelity to the President of the Republic, as actually occurred in a public ceremony on  May .
.The complaint continues to the following effect : according to an Act of  July  a trade union organisation can function only if it has been recognised by the Ministry of Labour, to which a request for registration must be addressed; the Labour Code-known as the Trujillo Labour Code - provides, in section , that the Secretariat of State for Labour may forward to the persons concerned the documents required for the establishment of the union, including the rules, and point out any defects in these documents ; section  provides that registration of the union shall be refused if any of the required conditions are not fulfilled. These provisions show, the complaint goes on, that the trade unions are dependent on the Government, and this dependence is proved also by the following facts : there are two kinds of trade union leaders, some being not even union members but officials of the rgime (provincial governors, etc.) whom the law has made responsible for trade union duties ; the others are members of the unions, elected according to the instructions of the party in power ; this party has a political monopoly and constitutes a single entity with the Government : the trade union leaders elected according to its instructions should therefore be regarded as public officials ; trade union congresses are organised by officials of this party, and they indicate the subjects for discussion ; when a trade union wishes to call a strike it must notify the Secretariat of State for Labour, giving its reasons, and the strike may not be called until two weeks after this notification ; the trade union must prove that the strike has for its exclusive object the settlement of an economic dispute (section  of the Code). Other provisions of the Labour Code, the complainant argues, also show lack of freedom : section  prohibits trade unions from directly or indirectly restricting freedom to work, and this constitutes interference in the operation of the unions ; section  prohibits trade unions from dealing with political questions ; section  permits cancellation of registration by decision of the courts, and dissolution of the union, if it engages in activities not connected with its lawful objectives ; lastly, section  requires previous approval by the Department of Labour before collective agreements can become applicable. There is therefore no doubt that freedom of association does not exist in the Dominican Republic. On the one hand, there are legislative provisions restricting freedom of association ; on the other hand, the existing trade unions are not authentic, the so-called Dominican Confederation of Labour being an instrument used by President Trujillo to dominate the working class. The complainant therefore urges the Governing Body to request the Government of the Dominican Republic to re-establish the autonomy of the trade unions in relation to the executive authorities and eliminate all interference in trade union activities ; the sections of the Labour Code mentioned in the complaint should be amended, and the Government of the Dominican Republic should be reminded of the obligations assumed by it as a Member of the International Labour Organisation.
.In its third letter, dated  January , the I.C.F.T.U states that the action for which provision was made by the Governing Body when it adopted the conclusions of the Committee on the previous case regarding the Dominican Republic-Case No.  -has not materialised. The complainant organisation then recapitulates the various stages in the examination of Case No.  and particularly the question of the Government's invitation-subsequently withdrawn-to send a mission which would study "" the practical application of the legal provisions concerning freedom of association in force in the Dominican Republic "". The Committee on Freedom of Association, the letter continues, deplored the Government's refusal to give its consent to the sending of this mission and took note of the assurances given by the Government to the following effect-that workers' organisations could not be suspended or dissolved by administrative action, that there was nothing to prevent the Confederation of Dominican Workers from affiliating with an international organisation, and that the Government intended to ratify the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) ; moreover, the Committee emphasised how important it was that the provisions guaranteeing free exercise of trade union rights should be effectively applied. The I.C.F.T.U further refers to the assurances given at that time by the Government of the Dominican Republic ; it expresses "" the disappointment and regret of the free trade union movement "" at the attitude of the Government of the Dominican Republic in refusing to receive an I.L.O mission and attaching no value to the assurances given to the I.L.O; it also calls attention to the delay in ratifying Convention No. . The letter adds : "" Although the Government has given the I.L.O the formal assurance that in the Dominican Republic freedom of association exists, is exercised and is respected, the workers may in fact adhere only to trade unions approved by the Government, whose leaders are not elected freely by the workers and do not therefore represent them "".ANALYSIS OF THE REPLY
.In its letter of  November  the Government of the Dominican Republic said that a study of the complaint made it clear that this referred not only to labour questions but also to questions of an indubitably political character. The Government might have abstained from any rebuttal as regards the latter questions because they lay outside the terms of reference of the Committee on Freedom of Association. The Committee on Freedom of Association, the Government continued, had already had occasion to pass judgment, in a manner extremely satisfactory to the rgime of the Dominican Republic, on a similar complaint, also submitted by the I.C.F.T.U. ; in the light of this previous judgment by the Committee the position of the I.C.F.T.U was no longer tenable, because the Dominican legislation on which the Committee based the conclusions of its Fifth Report remained in force today ; this fresh complaint by the I.C.F.T.U could be explained only by its ignorance of the findings in the Fifth Report of the Committee, or by an intention on its part to act as an instrument of political interests extraneous to the objectives of the International Labour Organisation.
.The first allegation, the reply went on, was that the laws of the Dominican Republic infringed freedom of association because a trade union could function only if it had been "" recognised "" by the Secretariat of State for Labour, which might return the prescribed documents to the persons concerned ; on this point the Committee on Freedom of Association had already given a ruling, in favour of the present legislation, in its Fifth Report. The I.C.F.T.U mentioned the Act of  July , but this had been repealed by section  of the Labour Code another point which the Committee had certified in its Fifth Report. The registration referred to in sections  and  of the Code was a mere administrative formality, chiefly intended to enable legal personality to be accorded to trade unions ; hitherto, not a single case of refusal of registration had occurred. Provision for a similar formality was to be found in the legislation of many I.L.O member States, as was pointed out in the report of the Committee on Freedom of Employers' and Workers' Organisations (McNair Committee), submitted to",-1,1956,Dominican Republic
78,"the cancellation of the registration of trade unions and the dissolution of these unions, relate partly to legislation which the Governing Body has already found in Case No.  was repealed in  and partly to legislative provisions which the Governing Body found in Case No.  to be satisfactory, subject to employers and workers being able in actual practice to form and join organisations of their own choosing in full freedom ; so far as the allegations relating to the latter legislation are concerned, there are no allegations of fact concerning the manner in which it has been applied submitted in the complaint;(b) to note that both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ) have now been ratified by the Dominican Republic and that the other allegations concerning failure to give effect to the recommendations made by the Committee in Case No.  are too vague to call for further examination ;(c) with regard to the prohibition on political activity by trade unions, to draw the attention of the Dominican Government to the fact that section  of the Labour Code admits of interpretations incompatible with the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, , ratified by the Dominican Republic, and to the fact that the application of Act No.  of  June  to employers' or workers' organisations might also be incompatible with the Convention, and to draw this matter also to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations ;(d) to decide that the allegations relating to freedom not to associate examined in paragraphs  and  above do not call for further examination ;(e) to draw the attention of the Dominican Government to the importance which the Committee attaches, in cases in which strikes are prohibited in essential occupations, to ensuring adequate guarantees to safeguard to the full the interests of the workers thus deprived of an essential means of defending occupational interests ;(f) to note that the cumulative effect of all the various provisions set forth in sections  to  of the Labour Code, including in particular the provision that a trade union must before calling a strike satisfy a government authority of the economic character of the dispute-a provision which may well become indistinguishable in practice from a requirement of government authorisation prior to calling a strike-amounts to a denial of the right to strike, and to draw the attention of the Government to the desirability of its giving further consideration to the matter ;(g) as regards the provisions of the Labour Code requiring previous approval by the authorities of collective agreements, to draw the attention of the Dominican Government to Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, , and Article  of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, , both ratified by the Dominican Republic, and to the desirability of its giving further consideration to this question, and to draw the matter also to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.",-1,1956,Dominican Republic
79,".At its th Session (Geneva, May ), the Committee had before it a series of complaints, constituting Cases Nos. , ,  and , relating to Chile. The cases were considered together.
.The Committee's conclusions regarding the different allegations made by the complainants are contained in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, and its recommendations to the Governing Body in paragraph . The Committee's th Report was approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (Geneva, May-June ).
.On three of these allegations the Committee submitted only interim conclusions. The allegations in question are those relating to the imprisonment of trade unionists, with regard to which the Government was asked to supply additional information, and those relating to violation of trade union rights and to reprisals against trade unionists in connection with a strike of bank employees and a strike in the nitrate mines, with regard to which the Government had not Yet forwarded its observations
.These three groups of allegations are the only ones still before the Committee for consideration, and the following analyses relate exclusively to these three groups.
.In all the circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to reaffirm the observations which it made in paragraphs  and  of the th Report of the Committee concerning the severity of the Law for the Permanent Defence of Democracy with respect to the question of strikes, and to suggest to the Government once again that it might consider the possibility of re-examining the provisions of that Law in the light of the generally accepted principles with respect to freedom of association ; but to decide, for the reasons indicated in paragraphs  to  above and having regard to the fact that all the five persons concerned have been liberated, that it is inappropriate to pursue further the examination of the allegations relating to the arrest and sentencing of the leaders of the Sole Union of Chilean Workers (C.U.T.CH) ;(b) to take note with satisfaction, with respect to the arrests of the hundred or so persons alleged by the World Federation of Trade Unions, of the Government's statement that all the persons in question were liberated on  February  and to decide that this aspect of the case does not, therefore, call for further examination ;(c) to draw the attention of the Government to its view that acts of discrimination in connection with a peaceful strike are inconsistent with the maintenance of satisfactory industrial relations and incompatible with the best industrial practice and to the undesirability of persons appointed temporarily by the Government to control the banks falling below this standard ;(d) to draw the attention of the Government to its view that the initiation of the measures against Mr. Goldsack Donoso in his absence by the government controller of the bank by which he was employed is inconsistent with the duty of the Government both to refrain itself from taking measures calculated to interfere with a delegate to an I.L.O. Conference in the exercise of his functions and to use its influence and take all reasonable steps to ensure that such a delegate is not in any way prejudiced by his acceptance of functions as a delegate or by his conduct as a delegate ; that measures on other grounds should not be taken against him in his absence but should await his return, so that he may be in a position to defend himself ; that in the above circumstances it is insufficient for the Government to dissociate itself from the future course and consequences of the measures taken, and that it would be appropriate for the Government to take steps to ensure either that the measures taken against Mr. Goldsack Donoso are revoked or that he is fully compensated ;(e) to request the Government to be good enough to inform the Governing Body whether a committee of investigation was instituted for the purpose of determining the responsibility for the incidents connected with the strike in the nitrate mines and, if so, to inform the Governing Body as to the results of its inquiry.
.The Committee on Freedom of Association has before it the following complaints which, for the sake of clarity, are divided into two separate groups. The first group (Cases Nos.  and ) includes : () a verbal protest made on behalf of the Workers' group of the Governing Body by its President at the st Session of the Governing Body (Geneva, March ) ; () complaint of  February  by the World Federation of Trade Unions supplemented by additional information dated  March and  May  ; () complaint of  March  by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions supplemented by additional information of  May  ; () complaint of  February  by the National Bakers' Federation of Chile supplemented by additional information of  June  ; () complaint of  March  by the Confederation of Latin American Workers supplemented by additional information of  April  ; () complaint of  March  by the Maritime Confederation of Chile ; () complaint of  May  by the National Bakers' Federation of Chile and  other national trade union federations of Chile, quoting article  of the Constitution of the I.L.O. ; () complaint of  February  by the Sole Union of Chilean Workers ; () complaint of  November  by the ""Sekretariat D.P.P. Sebda "" (the Pan-Indonesian Central Council of Trade Unions) ; () complaint of  November  by the Posts and Communications Trade Union of the Free German Trade Unions (Berlin) ; () complaint of  March  by the Inter-American Regional Organisation of Workers ; and () a telegram of  March  from the People's Socialist Party of Chile. This group of complaints was communicated by the Director-General of the I.L.O to the Chilean Government by letters dated  January ,  and  March,  May,  June and  July  and  March , with the exception of the Inter-American Regional Organisation of Workers and the telegram of the People's Socialist Party which reproduce the allegations presented by the National Bakers' Federation of Chile. Since the whole of this group deals with related complaints they are examined together. The second group of complaints (Cases Nos.  and ) consists of the following : () complaint of  October  from the Association of Bank Employees of Uruguay ; () complaints of  October and  November  from the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions ; () complaint of  October  from the Miners' Trade Unions International (W.F.T.U) supplemented by additional information dated  November  ; () complaint of  November  from the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions of Salaried Employees, Technicians, Managerial Staff and Commercial Travellers ; and () complaint of  November  from the Inter-, national Confederation of Free Trade Unions. This group of complaints was communicated by the Director-General of the I.L.O to the Chilean Government by letters dated  October,  November and  December  ; they refer particularly to the strike of Chilean bank employees in September  and the strike in the nitrate mines of Pedro de Valdivia, also in September .
.In all the circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the attention of the Government of Chile to the provisions contained in article  of the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation that members of the Governing Body shall enjoy such privileges and immunities as are necessary for the independent exercise of their functions in connection with the Organisation and to decide that, subject to the observations made in paragraphs  to  above, this aspect of the case does not call for further examination ;(b) to draw the attention of the Government of Chile to the recommendations made by the Governing Body when approving the Committee's previous reports concerning Cases Nos.  and  that it should examine the desirability of reconsidering the Law for the Permanent Defence of Democracy in the light of generally accepted principles relating to freedom of association ;(c) for the reasons indicated in paragraphs  and  above, to draw the urgent attention of the Government of Chile to the conclusions of the Conference Committee on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, approved by the International Labour Conference at its th Session, and of the Committee of Experts in , with respect to the application in Chile of the Right of Association (Agriculture) Convention, , ratified by Chile, and to emphasise the importance of its taking steps without further delay to bring its national legislation into harmony with the obligations solemnly undertaken by the ratification of the Convention ;(d) to draw the attention of the Government of Chile to the desirability of taking the necessary steps to ensure that a freely constituted central organisation of workers can function freely and, with this end of view, of examining the possibility of bringing Chilean",-1,1956,Chile
80,"of dismissal, which has been a frequent occurrence since the present Government came into power. Hundreds of government workers have been dismissed without being able to protect their rights ; this is particularly true of school teachers and road and construction workers. The Educational Workers' Union has not merely been dissolved arbitrarily but its assets, totalling , quetzales made up of its members' contributions, have been confiscated. The General Confederation of Labour (C.G.T.G) and the Confederation of Peasants of Guatemala (C.N.C.G) have been dissolved in violation of the law and contrary to the wishes of their members. Similar action has been taken against Confederations of trade unions and peasants throughout the country.
.The free representative trade union movement is constantly persecuted and a great number of obstacles are placed in the way of its reorganisation and its ability to take cases to the labour courts. Trade union leaders have been harassed and persecuted under pretext of the need to combat communism ; hundreds of trade union leaders and officials have been illegally imprisoned ; while others have been forced to seek refuge abroad and have been denied the opportunity of returning to Guatemala.ANALYSIS OF THE REPLY
.In its communication dated  June  the Guatemalan Government states that Title IV of the Constitution of  February  is in fact based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. With regard to the alleged violations of International Labour Conventions it is stated that only  of the latter have been ratified by Guatemala. Section  of the Constitution recognises as "" fundamental principles of labour legislation "" the right to one day off a week with pay, to an annual holiday with pay which may not be commuted for compensation, to extra pay for overtime and the obligation of an employer to compensate any worker who is dismissed without good reasons ; these Constitutional provisions by implication rebut the allegations made by the C.T.A.L.
.Under section  () of the Constitution, the right of workers and employers to associate freely for the sole purpose of safeguarding their economic interests and to better their social conditions is recognised as a fundamental principle of labour legislation ; and "" the law shall make provision for the exercise of this right, having regard to the conditions prevailing in the various economic sectors and differences in the situation of rural and urban workers and employers "". This by implication rebuts the allegation regarding the ban on trade unionism among agricultural workers. On the subject of the alleged failure to punish those guilty of murdering peasants the Government states that the Criminal Code lays down the penalties for this offence and that the penalties would be enforced whatever the circumstances and irrespective of the personal standing of the individual concerned.
.With regard to workers employed by the State the Government explains in its communication dated  September  that, as required by the Constitution, a set of public service regulations are now being drafted. The State Employees Decree (No. ) dated  February , a copy of which was appended to the Government's reply, is also applicable as a provisional measure. The Government reports that since it came into force none of the unions of government workers has had its incorporated status withdrawn.
.In reply to the allegation about the dissolution of the Educational Workers' Union and the confiscation of its assets, the Government states that it was forced to take this measure because of Communist infiltration within the union, but adds that the dissolution cannot be held to be arbitrary since it was provided for in the Guatemalan labour legislation which came into force in . In the Government's opinion this legislation does not violate the spirit of Conventions Nos.  and  which Guatemala has ratified. The assets of the dissolved union have become State property as in fact its own by-laws provided. For similar reasons the Government has felt compelled to dissolve the General Federation of Labour and the Confederation of Peasants.
.In order to rebut the statements made by the complaining organisation to the effect that trade union leaders are persecuted and trade union reorganisation is obstructed, the Government quotes sections , , ,  and  of the Constitution which state that no person may be detained without warrant ; that every person has the right to do whatever is not prohibited by law ; that no person may be exiled or prevented from entering the country ; that "" the inhabitants of the Republic have the right to associate freely for the various purposes of human existence in order to promote, exercise and protect their individual political, economic, religious, social, cultural, occupational and other interests of any kind whatsoever "". Any laws or regulations which impair or curtail these Constitutional safeguards are ipso jure null and void. Finally, the Government adds that the functions and duties of State bodies are regulated by the Constitution : "" Officials are not the possessors but the trustees of authority, they are responsible for their official conduct and are subject to, and at no time above, the law"" (section  ()).
.The Guatemalan Government ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ) on  February  ; the Conventions came into force for Guatemala on  February .Allegations relating to Infringements of Human Rights and Guatemalan Labour Legislation
.The complaining organisation merely states in general terms that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights has been infringed and that a number of rights granted by Guatemalan law-the weekly rest day with pay, holidays with pay, dismissal compensation, overtime with pay, etc.-have been ignored. The Government in reply quotes various subsections of section  of the Constitution of  February  which specifically recognises as "" fundamental principles of labour legislation "", which may not be curtailed by laws or regulations, those workers' right that according to the complaining organisation have been ignored. Title IV of the Constitution ("" Human Rights "") is, according to the Government, based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
.This being so, the Committee notes that the complaining organisation does not refer to any specific violation of human rights and, moreover, that the allegations that various rights granted under Guatemalan labour legislation have been abolished refer to such matters as the weekly day of rest, holidays with pay, dismissals without compensation, overtime, etc., which have no direct relation with freedom of association and therefore do not fall under that heading. In Case No.  (Cuba) in which the Committee was asked to give a ruling on allegations that various human rights had been violated, it concluded that because these allegations did not refer to freedom of association there was no ground for pursuing its inquiry ; in Case No.  (Ceylon) the Committee decided that it was not called upon to examine general legal issues which had no relation to freedom of association. In the present case, considering that the workers' rights mentioned in the complaint are specifically recognised by the Guatemalan Constitution as "" fundamental principles of labour legislation "" the Committee considers that, even bearing in mind the importance it has always attached to the enforcement of statutory provisions recognising fundamental rights, it is unnecessary, in view of the tenor of the complaint, to inquire into the practical effectiveness of these Constitutional safeguards and accordingly that this aspect of the complaint does not call for further examination.Allegations relating to the Right of Agricultural Workers to Form Trade Unions
.The complaining organisation asserts that agricultural workers have been forbidden to form trade unions and that they are at the mercy of the landowners with the result that they have suffered gross ill-treatment while those responsible have not been properly punished. The Government for its part quotes section  () of the Constitution which guarantees in general terms the right to form trade unions while leaving it to the appropriate Act to draw a distinction between rural and urban workers and employers.
.Leaving aside the general allegation which is not backed by any proof and has nothing to do with the exercise of trade union rights, since it deals with alleged criminal offences committed by employers against agricultural workers, the Committee notes that the Constitution, while sanctioning agricultural trade unionism, states that the detailed regulations will be introduced later. At the present time the  Labour Code, which has remained in force by virtue of the Decree No.  of  January , contains special clauses dealing with "" agricultural associations "" (sections -).
.These sections read as follows:
.The object of every agricultural association shall be to protect and ameliorate the living conditions of agricultural workers and their families and other dependants and at the same time to contribute to the development and progress of agricultural and stock-raising undertakings throughout the country. For the purpose of attaining this last-mentioned essential purpose, the fundamental activities of an agricultural association shall be as follows:(a)",-1,1956,Guatemala
81,"It is not possible, therefore, to interpret the absence of any observations on these texts by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations as having constituted even tacit approval of their contents.
.On the other hand, with respect to this aspect of the case, the latest observations received from the Government of Cuba contain new elements which entirely change the situation. In fact, the Government states that the two decrees which were criticised have, since the th Report of the Committee was adopted, been repealed. In the concluding part of paragraph  (a) of the Committee's th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (October-November ), the Government was requested to take the necessary action to bring its legislation into harmony with the provisions of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ). In the repealing decree (Decree No. ), the text of which is annexed to the Government's communication dated  December , and which, as the Government points out in its letter of  December , was published in the Official Gazette of  December , it is stated in one of the clauses of the preamble that one of the reasons justifying the repeal of the two decrees in question is to be found in the fact that they might be regarded as being at variance with the requirements of Convention No. . In these circumstances, the Committee notes with satisfaction the effect thus given by the Government of Cuba to one of its recommendations approved by the Governing Body.
.Finally, in its latest communications, the Government replies to the request for further information made by the Governing Body with respect to allegations of wrongful acts committed against trade unionists. From the information furnished by the Government it would appear that the cases relating to the persons mentioned by name by the complainants have been the subject of references to the military judicial authorities by the civil courts before which they came, or of a provisional suspension of proceedings because of the impossibility, so far, of establishing the facts, or of investigations which have not yet been terminated or, finally, have not yet been the subject of any inquiry. In other words, all the cases in question are still pending and the information received from the Government is in the nature of a report as to the stages which have been reached in the proceedings which have been instituted.
.In these circumstances, while thanking the Government for the information which it has been good enough to furnish with respect to the stages reached in the proceedings instituted in the cases of the persons mentioned by name in the complaints, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to request the Government of Cuba to furnish precise information as to the circumstances surrounding the deaths of the persons mentioned by name in the complaint of the World Federation of Trade Unions and, particularly, on the conclusions reached in the judicial investigations into these events, it being understood that the Committee will report further on these allegations when it has received the information requested.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to take note of the more detailed observations furnished by the Government since the adoption of the th Report of the Committee on Freedom of Association by the Governing Body, according to which, in the specific case mentioned by the complainants, the police intervention on the occasion of a trade union congress for which the Government was criticised did not actually take place ;(b) to take note with satisfaction of the statement by the Government that Decrees No.  of  and No.  of , regarded by the Governing Body as being incompatible with the guarantees afforded to trade unions by the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), have been repealed, this measure giving effect to the recommendation made by the Governing Body that the Government of Cuba should take the necessary action to bring its legislation into harmony with the provisions of the Convention ;(c) to decide, while thanking the Government for the preliminary information which it has been good enough to furnish with respect to this question, to request the Government to furnish information as to the circumstances surrounding the deaths of the persons mentioned by name in the complaint of the World Federation of Trade Unions and, particularly, on the conclusions reached in the judicial investigations into these events, it being understood that the Committee will report further on these allegations when the information requested has been received from the Government.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to express to the Government of Cuba its view that the electoral system introduced by Decrees No.  of  and No.  of  is incompatible with the safeguards afforded to trade unions by the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), which has been ratified by Cuba, and, in particular, with the provisions that ""workers' organisations shall have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom and to organise their administration and activities"" and that ""the public authorities shall refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof "", and to request the Government to take the necessary action to bring its legislation into harmony with these provisions of the Convention ;(b) to draw the attention of the Government of Cuba to its view that police and military intervention (such as that recognised by the Government) on the occasion of  trade union congress is contrary to freedom of association and incompatible with Article  of Convention No. , which has been ratified by Cuba ;(c) to communicate the above conclusions to the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, calling its attention to a situation which is incompatible with a Convention which has been ratified ;(d) to note, with respect to the allegations relating to an attack on the Secretary-General of the Construction Workers' Union of Havana, that the competent courts of law opened an investigation and that the official in question is continuing to perform his trade union functions, and to decide that these allegations do not call for further examination ;(e) to decide that the allegations relating to the wage freeze, dismissals, etc., and those relating to the violation of human rights, do not, for the reasons indicated in paragraphs  and  above, call for further examination ;(f) to request the Government of Cuba, as a matter of extreme urgency, to provide precise information on the circumstances surrounding the deaths of the persons mentioned by name in the complaint of the W.F.T.U, and particularly on the conclusions reached in the judicial investigations into these events, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report on these allegations as soon as the information requested has been received.",-1,1956,Cuba

With respect to the allegations relating to wrongful acts committed against trade unionists, the Committee recommended the Governing Body to request the Government of Cuba, as a matter of urgency, to provide precise information on the circumstances surrounding the deaths of the persons mentioned by name by the complainants, and, particularly, on the conclusions reached in the judicial investigations into these events, it being understood that the Committee would submit a further report on these allegations as soon as the information requested had been received.ANALYSIS OF THE GOVERNMENT'S OBSERVATIONS
.By five communications dated  November,  December (two communications),  and  December , the Government of Cuba forwarded to the Office a number of observations on the conclusions adopted by the Committee and by the Governing Body, together with further information which the Committee had requested it to furnish on certain points.
.In the first place, the Government declares formally that, contrary to what would appear to be the case judging by the conclusions of the Committee and the Governing Body, it has never recognised that any police or military intervention took place on the occasion of a trade union congress. In the view of the Government nothing in the observations which it had presented on the allegations made by the complainants justified the conclusion that there had been any such admission on its part. Consequently, states the Government, this interpretation was erroneous and even malicious in the sense that it was calculated to distort the truth. The Government declares that in fact neither the police nor the security forces-even less so the army-entered the premises in which the trade union congress mentioned in the complaint of the Confederation of Workers of Latin America was being held, and surveillance was exercised only in the street for the exclusive purpose of preventing any possible disturbance.
.Further, the Government contests the validity of the reasoning which led the Committee to formulate the recommendation contained in paragraph  (a) of its th Report with respect to the regulations concerning trade union elections embodied in the decrees of  and . According to the Government, the decrees criticised in no way constitute instruments by which the trade unions are rendered subordinate. In support of this statement the Government declares that, moreover, the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has never regarded these texts as constituting an infringement of freedom of association. Finally, the Government states that these two decrees, which were promulgated in order to deal with a transitory situation, have since been repealed.
.Finally, in response to the request for further information made by the Committee in paragraph  (f) of its th Report, the Government gives the following information. After inquiries had been opened by several examining magistrates on the ground of murder in the cases of Messrs. Alejo Toms, Hctor Infante Prez, Isaac Hernndez Oliver, Loynaz Hecheverria and Luis Sera Moreno, the courts before which these cases had been brought declared themselves to be incompetent and surrendered their jurisdiction to the military judicial authorities. With regard to the case of Mr. Armando Guzmn Guidi, the murder inquiry instituted by the competent examining tribunal was provisionally suspended pursuant to the second paragraph of section  of the Penal Code on the ground that it had not been possible to establish who were the authors of the crime, their accomplices or the persons who sheltered them. For the same reasons, proceedings were suspended in the cases of Messrs. Antonio Valencio Consuegro and Antonio Concepcin. Paradio. With regard to the case of Mr. Miguel Torres Surez, whose death was verified through the files of the competent judicial authorities, an inquiry was opened by the said authorities and has not yet terminated. With regard, finally, to the cases of Messrs. Germnico Mendoza, Ramn Concepcin Cue, Amaranto Fransua, Luis Frits, Miguel Mordago and Enrique Morgan, the Government declares that their names are not mentioned in the records of inquiries filed in December .
.The Government categorically denies that it ever admitted any police or military intervention on the occasion of a trade union congress. This objection relates to paragraph  (b) of the th Report of the Committee, which stated:[The Committee recommends the Governing Body] to draw the attention of the Government of Cuba to its view that police and military intervention (such as that recognised by the Government) on the occasion of a trade union congress is contrary to freedom of association and incompatible with Article  of Convention No. , which has been ratified by Cuba.
.The reasons which caused the Committee to formulate its conclusions in these terms were as follows. In reply to a specific allegation that such intervention had taken place the Government, without specifically admitting the intervention for which it was criticised in this particular instance, nevertheless did not deny this allegation but, on the contrary, admitted the principle of intervention by declaring that it regarded it as justifiable. The Government's observations in this connection were as follows : "" trade union activities, particularly in times of political disturbance, insurrection and terrorism, require the exercise of supervision by the police and the security forces."" In these circumstances the Committee took the view that the fact that the Government refrained from refuting the intervention for which it was criticised, added to the attitude which the Government adopted in favour of the principle of police supervision, was equivalent to an admission by the Government that such intervention had actually occurred.
.Since the conclusions of the Committee were approved by the Governing Body the Government has furnished further information containing new elements, from which it would appear that the intervention for which the Government was criticised did not actually take place.
.In these circumstances, while affirming that any police or military intervention in legitimate trade union activities would be contrary to Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Committee has noted the more detailed observations furnished by the Government since the adoption of the th Report of the Committee by the Governing Body, according to which, in the specific instance mentioned by the complainants, the intervention for which the Government was criticised did not actually take place.
.The Government declares that the two decrees relating to the regulating of trade union elections, which the Committee and the Governing Body considered incompatible with the provisions of Convention No.  ratified by Cuba, cannot in any way be regarded as instruments resulting in the subordination of the trade unions. In support of this point of view, the Government declares that the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has never regarded these texts as infringing freedom of association. It is true that the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, which has addressed to the Government of Cuba observations on certain points (trade union rights of officials and State, provincial and municipal employees, general prohibition of all political activities on the part of trade unions, presence of an official at trade union meetings), has not commented on the decrees in question. It is necessary, however, to point out that, if the Committee of Experts has not been able to make observations on the two decrees in question, this is to be explained by the fact that the decrees have never been mentioned by the Government in the reports which it has furnished, in accordance with article  of the Constitution of the I.L.O, on the application of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and on the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ). Moreover, when the Committee of Experts, in , specifically asked in one of its observations addressed to the Government of Cuba, whether there were "" provisions in the national legislation respecting the election of trade union leaders"", the Government, in its reply, made no reference to either of the texts criticised in the present case. Finally, when the draft monograph with respect to Cuba prepared in the course of the inquiry of the Committee on Freedom of Employers' and Workers' Organisations-a draft which also contained no reference to the two decrees in question-was communicated to the Government of Cuba for its observations and a request was made to the Government to indicate any texts which might be missing from the list of legislative texts annexed to the draft, the Government refrained from making any reference to the decrees in question.",-1,1956,Cuba
83,".In February  the Committee resumed its examination of the various complaints, submitted by the Confederation of Workers for Latin America and the W.F.T.U, dated  December  and  March , alleging violations of trade union rights in Cuba.
.At that time the Committee submitted its final conclusions regarding some of the allegations; these were adopted by the Governing Body at its th Session (February-March ). As regards the allegations contained in the communication from the W.F.T.U dated  March , and on which the Government made certain comments in its communications of  May and  August of the same year, the Committee recommended the Governing Body to request the Government "" to furnish information as to the circumstances surrounding the deaths of the persons mentioned by name in the complaint of the W.F.T.U and, particularly, on the conclusions reached in the judicial investigations into these events"".
.In a statement submitted by the Legal Department of the General Staff, dated  November , the Government supplied some information on the circumstances in which Alejo Toms Lpez, Hector Infante Prez, Isaac Hernndez Oliver, Loynaz Hechavarria y Cordovez and Luis Sera Moreno lost their lives. According to that statement, the legal proceedings, which were initially instituted in the ordinary courts, were subsequently transferred to the military courts, and the proceedings against the persons apparently implicated in those crimes were dropped for lack of evidence.
.As the reply mentioned in the previous paragraph did not cover all the persons on whom the Committee had asked the Government for information with regard to the circumstances of their deaths and the legal proceedings taken against the persons responsible or presumed to be responsible, the Committee, at its th Session (November ), instructed the Director-General to ask the Government to communicate the conclusions reached in the judicial investigations into the deaths of the other persons mentioned in the complaint of the W.F.T.U, namely Armando Guzmn and Enrique Morgan, of the Preston Plant; Antonio Valencio Consuegro, of the Manati Plant; Silverio Hernndez, sugar worker; Antonio Concepcin Paradio, workers' leader at Puerto Padre; Jess Feli Meyva, tobacco worker; and Tilmo Esperanza, painter.
.In the absence of any reply to the earlier request for information the Committee deferred examination of the case at its st (February ), nd (May ), rd (November ), th (February ), th (May ), th (November ) and th (February ) Sessions. The Government sent its reply in a communication dated  April .
.As there has been a change of political rgime in Cuba since the occurrence of the incidents alleged the reply of the Government is of particular interest. The Government recognises the allegations to be well-founded but requests the I.L.O to take into account the date on which they occurred, as, in its view, the complaint has no longer any relevance as far as the Cuban workers are concerned and, moreover, all confusion with regard to the true identity of the persons responsible must be avoided. The communication states that the Revolutionary Government was in no way responsible for such atrocities; they were the work of the tyranny which, by dint of tremendous struggles and sacrifices, the revolutionary movement finally succeeded in ousting and replacing by a system of government which fully respects all the rights of the people and has established trade union rights in the truest and most positive sense of the term. In conclusion the communication states that the basis and principal objective of the efforts of the new rgime is the defence of the working classes and that the principal aim of its policy is the promotion and safeguarding of the exercise of trade union rights to the fullest possible extent.
.The only allegation put forward in this case on which a decision by the Committee is still required is that concerning the violent deaths of the persons mentioned in the W.F.T.U complaint. The information on the circumstances of their deaths and the legal proceedings taken against the persons responsible or presumed to be responsible, for which the Government had been asked, had been received, in an extremely fragmentary form, when the change of rgime took place in the country. The new Government has also failed to supply the information for which the Committee has repeatedly asked. In its reply it merely states that the allegations are well founded but that the new Government does not consider itself responsible for the atrocities perpetrated by the previous one.
.In certain earlier cases I the Committee took the view that, where a change of rgime had taken place in a country, the new government should take all necessary steps to remedy any continuing effects which events complained of as having taken place under its predecessor might have had since its accession to power; for instance in Case No.  (Bolivia) z, the Committee, after examining allegations concerning infringements of trade union rights by a government which had subsequently been overthrown, expressed the view that, although the government in power "" can obviously not be held responsible for events which took place under its predecessor, it clearly is responsible for any continuing consequences which they may have had since its accession to power "".
.The Committee has, however, also accepted the principle - where circumstances of the kind mentioned in the previous paragraph do not obtain-of discontinuing examination of complaints relating to political situations which no longer exist. In the present case there has obviously been a change in the political situation. Consequently, in view of the change of political rgime which has taken place in Cuba and the statement made by the new Government in its communication of  April  (see paragraph  above), the Committee considers that the events referred to in the complaint are no longer of current interest and that, in addition, they do not seem to have given rise to any consequences which might continue to make themselves felt under the new rgime.
.In all the circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that, for the reasons indicated in paragraphs  to  above, the case does not call for further examination.
.By two communications dated respectively  December  and  March , the former being addressed to the Secretary-General of the United Nations and transmitted by him to the I.L.O, the Confederation of Workers of Latin America and the World Federation of Trade Unions formulated a number of allegations relating to infringements of the exercise of trade union rights in Cuba. These allegations may be summarised as follows. The regulations concerning trade union elections embodied in Decrees No.  of  January  and No.  of  June  constituted an intervention by the State in a field in which the right of organisations to draw up necessary regulatory provisions is generally recognised ; these decrees, it was alleged, were contrary to the rights guaranteed to trade union organisations by Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), namely the right to organise their activities and to elect their representatives in full freedom. Acts of violence were alleged to have been committed against trade unionists ; in particular, the complainants gave the names of several persons alleged to have been killed. It was alleged that the right of meeting was not respected and that a congress of the Cuban Workers' Confederation took place under police supervision. Finally, allegations were formulated with respect to a wage freeze, the dismissal of workers and infringements of human rights.
.The Government forwarded its observations in two communications dated  and  May ; also, following the request made by the Committee at its th Session (Geneva, May ), the Government furnished further information on several points in a letter dated  August .
.At its th Session (Geneva, October ) the Committee examined the case as a whole and formulated certain conclusions and recommendations which were embodied in its th Report. This report was adopted by the Governing Body at its th Session (Geneva, October-November ). The Committee recommended the Governing Body to decide that the allegations relating to the wage freeze, dismissals and violation of human rights did not call for further examination. With respect to the allegations relating to the right of meeting, the Committee recommended the Governing Body to draw the attention of the Government to its view that police intervention on the occasion of a trade union congress is contrary to freedom of association and incompatible with Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), which has been ratified by Cuba. With respect to the allegations relating to intervention by the State in trade union elections, the Committee recommended the Governing Body to draw the attention of the Government of Cuba to its view that the electoral system introduced by Decrees No.  of  and No.  of  is incompatible with the safeguards afforded to trade unions by the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right",-1,1956,Cuba
84,".At its th Session (November ) the Committee continued its examination of this case, on which it had previously submitted two interim reports to the Governing Body in paragraphs  to  of its th Report and paragraphs  to  of its nd Report, respectively, and laid before the Governing Body its conclusions and recommendations which are contained in paragraphs  to  of its th Report. That report was approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ).
.The Committee notes with interest the adoption of these two codes and recognises that the provisions devoted to employers' and workers' organisations constitute a significant step forward in Paraguayan legislation as concerns the protection of freedom of association and trade union rights, and that these provisions are in part based on the generally accepted principles relating to freedom of association and trade union rights as contained in the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.Nevertheless, the Committee observes that some of the legislative provisions would seem to call for careful examination by the Government in order to bring them more fully into conformity with the terms of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), which the Government has decided to ratify.
.Among these provisions are the exclusion from the scope of section  of the Labour Code of officials, salaried employees and manual workers employed by state undertakings, municipal authorities or autonomous corporations. It would, therefore, be desirable for the trade union rights of the above categories of workers to be expressly recognised in the Labour Code or in the legislation establishing such official institutions.
.It would also be desirable to review the provisions of the Code concerning the types of trade unions which may be set up (section ), the number of members of the trade union who must be present at a general meeting in order to constitute a quorum (section  (f)), prohibition of the right to debate or take part in political affairs (section ), and cancellation of registration of trade unions by administrative authority (section ). All the above-mentioned provisions raise different problems which call for study by the Government. Recognising that the I.L.O has previously granted technical assistance to Paraguay in connection with labour legislation, the Committee hopes that, if the Government should require further technical assistance to examine these points, the I.L.O will do everything in its power to grant such assistance.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to express its interest in the recent adoption of the Labour Code and the Labour Disputes Procedure Code, in force from  February , which constitute a significant step forward in Paraguayan legislation as concerns the protection of freedom of association and trade union rights;(b) to express its satisfaction concerning the recent adoption of Act No.  whereby the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), is approved and ratified, and to express the hope that the Government will forward a formal instrument of ratification to the Director-General of the I.L.O at an early date, so that ratification may be duly registered;(c) to suggest to the Government that it may consider the advisability of further examining the provisions of the Labour Code and, in particular, the provisions mentioned in paragraphs  and  above, in order to bring them fully into conformity with the provisions of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ).
.At its meeting on  February  the Committee continued its examination of this case, on which it had previously submitted an interim report to the Governing Body in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, and laid before the Governing Body the conclusions and recommendations which are contained in paragraphs  to  of its nd Report. That report was approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (March ).
.The only allegations on which the Committee had not submitted its final conclusions to the Governing Body are certain allegations relating to the denial of trade union rights in Paraguay. The present report, therefore, is confined to the further consideration of these outstanding allegations.
.Paraguay has not ratified either the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee considers that, on the basis of the above legal text, and without more detailed information than it has as to what the trade union situation is in actual fact and as to how the legislation itself is applied in practice, it is not possible for it to express with certainty a conclusion as to how far the right of association can be exercised in freedom by the workers in Paraguay. The question would seem to depend in part on how certain of the legal provisions referred to above operate-especially section  (f) of Legislative Decree No.  which provides for control or supervision of trade unions by the Department of Labour and for the approval of their Constitutions and rules by the Department in agreement with the Executive Power; in the enactment forwarded there is no indication as to the criteria which have to be applied, for instance, in approving or disapproving the rules of a trade union, which would appear to indicate that approval is a matter within the discretion of the administrative authorities. In this connection the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has pointed out that the right of organisations to draw up their Constitutions and rules in freedom would appear to be considerably restricted in the case, for example, of countries in which Constitutions and rules must be submitted for previous approval by the authorities, whose power of decision does not appear to be limited by any specific rules."" Further, the Committee does not have before it any evidence as to how far means may exist whereby the exercise of the right of association of individual workers is protected and the free functioning and internal administration of workers' organisations is ensured.
.The Committee observes, however, that the Government states unequivocally that a draft labour code, which will provide for the right of association without previous authorisation and upon which the Government has received the advice of officials of the International Labour Office, is to be examined in the Legislative Congress during the present year.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to take note of the Government's statement that a draft labour code, which will provide for the right of association without previous authorisation, is to be examined in Legislative Congress during the present year;(b) to draw the attention of the Government to the importance which the Governing Body has always attached to the principle that workers and employers, without distinction whatsoever, should have the right to establish and, subject only to the rules of the organisation concerned, to join organisations of their own choosing without previous authorisation; and to the principle that workers' and employers' organisations should have the right to draw up their Constitutions and rules, to elect their representatives in full freedom, to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes, and that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof; and also to the principle that workers' and employers' organisations should not be able to be dissolved or suspended by administrative authority;(c) to urge the Government to ensure that full regard will be had in the draft legislation to be examined in the Legislative Congress to the principles enunciated in subparagraph (b) above and to the other generally accepted principles relating to freedom of association and trade union rights which are embodied in International Labour Conventions and, in particular, the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and that legislation giving full effect to the principles will be enacted at an early date;(d) to suggest to the Government that, when the legislation in question has been enacted, it may give consideration to ratifying the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. );(e) to request the Government to be good enough to keep the Governing Body informed as to further developments in connection with the draft labour code which is to be examined by the Legislative Congress of Paraguay this year.
.The complaint of the Confederation of Latin American Workers is contained in a communication dated  August . The Government presented observations on the complaint in a communication dated  June .
.When it examined the case at its meeting on  November , the Committee submitted its final conclusions to the",-1,1957,Paraguay
85,"Governing Body with respect to certain allegations relating to the detention of workers and trade union officers, and these were approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (- November ). The Committee presented an interim report on the remaining allegations-those relating to a police attack on an assembly of workers, to the detention of Mr. Insfrn, General Secretary of the Grau Union, and to denial of trade union rights-in respect of which it decided to request the Government to furnish further information. Further information was forwarded by the Government in a letter addressed to the Director-General of the I.L.O on  January . The Committee, therefore, is now in a position to continue its examination of these outstanding allegations.
.Paraguay has not ratified either the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.As regards the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to decide, with respect to the allegations relating to a police attack on an assembly of workers, that the complainants have not furnished evidence to show that, in this instance, any infringement of trade union rights occurred;(b) to decide, with respect to the allegations relating to the detention of Mr. Insfrn, General Secretary of the Grau Union:(i) to draw the attention of the Government once again to the importance which the Governing Body has always attached to the principle of prompt and fair trial by an independent and impartial judiciary in all cases, including cases in which trade unionists are charged with political or criminal offences which the Government considers have no relation to their trade union functions;(ii) that, in view of the Government's statement that Mr. Insfrn was liberated after one month and then left the country of his own free will, and subject to the observation made in subparagraph (i) above, no useful purpose would be served by pursuing further its examination of this aspect of the case;(c) to decide, with respect to the allegations relating to denial of trade union rights, to request the Government to be good enough to furnish the information and copies of legislative texts referred to in paragraph  above.
.The complaint of the Confederation of Latin-American Workers is contained in a communication addressed to the Director-General of the I.L.O on  August . It was transmitted to the Government of Paraguay on  August .
.At its th (October ), th (February ), th (November ), st (February ), nd (May ), rd (November ), th (February ) and th (May ) Sessions, the Committee adjourned its examination of the case, as it had not received the Government's observations on the complaint.
.The Government forwarded its observations in a communication dated  June .
.In all the circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to request the Government to be good enough to furnish texts of the legislation to which reference is made in its reply;(b) to decide that the allegations relating to the detention of unnamed workers and trade union officers are too vague to permit of an examination of this aspect of the case on its merits;(c) to decide, with respect to the allegations relating to the detention of Mr. Insfrn, General Secretary of the Grau Union:(i) to draw the attention of the Government to the importance which the Governing Body has always attached to the principle of prompt and fair trial by an independent and impartial judiciary in all cases, including cases in which trade unionists are charged with political or criminal offences which the Government considers have no relation to their trade union functions;(ii) to request the Government, having regard to the principle set forth above, to inform the Governing Body whether Mr. Insfrn is in prison or in confinement and to furnish information as to the legal or judicial proceedings taken in his case and as to the result of such proceedings;(d) to request the Government to furnish more detailed information concerning the incidents alleged to have taken place at the Pantheon of Heroes on  May .",-1,1957,Paraguay
86,".In its communication dated  April  the Trade Unions International of Leather, Shoe, Fur and Leather Products Workers (W.F.T.U) states that trade union leaders have been persecuted in Argentina, and that some - including Mr. Rubens Iscaro and other workers-have been imprisoned for a long time. In its subsequent communication, dated  June , the complainant organisation submits the names of seven other workers who, it alleged, were under arrest in  and . According to this organisation, the Argentine Ministry of the Interior stated that  workers were under arrest.ANALYSIS OF THE REPLY
.In its communications dated  July and  August  the Argentine Government states that the complaint by this Trade Unions International refers to a matter on which the Committee had already taken a decision, namely regarding the situation of the persons detained by the Executive during the state of siege. The Government continues to the following effect : several of the persons mentioned in the communication of  June  had already figured in complaints received in the former case ; the Governing Body, after taking note that the arrests had been ordered for security reasons against persons who had committed subversive activities or sabotage, expressed "" its satisfaction at the measures taken by the Government with a view to restoring fully freedom of association."" ; evidence of the development in this direction is provided by Resolution No.  (a copy of which is appended to the Government's reply), which orders convocation of an extraordinary general meeting of workers' occupational associations in order to approve the statutes of the General Confederation of Labour and to elect its officers on a regular basis.
.Furthermore, the Government states, the new complaint by the Trade Unions International has no longer any object, since it deals with arrests made in  and  during the state of siege ; this was abolished throughout the territory of the Republic by Decree No.  of  June , and all the persons detained by the Executive  in all-were released ; Mr. Rubens Iscaro was one of the persons now at liberty ; at present any persons still detained could only be those sentenced by a court of law to imprisonment for ordinary penal offences ; but such cases, the Government concludes, have of course nothing to do with the present allegations.
.The Trade Unions International of Leather, Shoe, Fur and Leather Products Workers states that trade union officials were detained in Argentina in  and  ; that these included Mr. Rubens Iscaro ; and that the Ministry of the Interior has recognised that some  workers were detained by the Executive. The Government, on the other hand, points out that the present complaint refers to facts already examined by the Committee on Freedom of Association in its th Report, namely the situation of the persons detained by the Executive during the state of siege. The Government recalls the conclusions adopted by the Governing Body in the said case, and states that the observations then presented apply also in the present instance. Furthermore, as the state of siege referred to in the complaint was raised throughout Argentine territory by Decree No.  of  June  the Government describes the present complaint as one which has no longer any object ; it states that the  persons detained by the Executive, including Mr. Rubens Iscaro, the person specifically mentioned by the complainant organisation, were released when the state of siege was raised on that date.
.In these circumstances, having regard to the fact that it examined in its th Report the position of the persons detained by the Executive during the state of siege in  and  and to the fact that this situation ceased with the raising of such state of siege and the release of all the persons who had been detained by the Executive, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that it would be purposeless to examine the present complaint further.",-1,1957,Argentina
87,".On  February  the I.F.C.T.U sent a letter to the Director-General of the I.L.O containing allegations to the effect that trade union rights had been violated in Argentina in connection with the bank strike which took place in February-March . This complaint was communicated to the Government on  February .
.On  January  the A.S.A. presented a series of allegations concerning the same strike, which were communicated to the Government on  February . The A.S.A. supplemented its complaint by a letter dated  March , the contents of which were communicated to the Government on  March .
.On  March  the P.T.T.I presented voluminous documentation containing allegations to the effect that trade union rights had been violated in connection with the disputes which broke out in telegraph and telephone occupations during September, October and November . This complaint was communicated to the Government in a letter dated  March .
.In a communication dated  October  the Government of the Argentine Republic forwarded its observations on the various complaints which had been transmitted to it.
.At is th Session (November ) the case was referred to the Committee, which submitted an interim report to the Governing Body, approved by it at its th Session (- November ).
.In discussing the case at its session in November  the Committee dealt with certain of the allegations (relating to the illegality of the strike of telegraph and telephone personnel, to the suspension of the registration of associations, and to the mobilisation of bank employees). It considered that on other points, for it to be able to form an opinion in full knowledge of the facts, it would be necessary to obtain additional information from the Government regarding the allegations concerning the prosecutions and detention of trade unionists and the placing of certain trade union organisations under administrative control.
.The decisions taken by the Governing Body on the Committee's recommendations and the requests for additional information were brought to the Government's attention in a communication from the Director-General dated  November .
.At its st Session (February ), in view of the absence of the additional information requested from the Government, the Committee decided to adjourn examination of the case to its next session. The Government was informed of this decision in a letter dated  March .
.In a communication dated  April , supplemented on  April, the A.S.A. submitted a new complaint to the I.L.O relating this time to the dispute which has been in existence since the beginning of  between Argentine bank employees and their employers. This complaint was supported on  May  by the I.F.C.T.U.
.The new complaint by the A.S.A. and the supplementary information transmitted in support of it were communicated to the Government for observation in two letters dated  April and  May .
.At its nd Session (May ), in view of the absence both of the additional information previously requested from the Government and of any observations by the Government on the latest complaint by the A.S.A., the Committee decided to adjourn the examination of the case to its next session. The Government was informed of this decision of the Committee in a letter dated  June .
.In a communication dated  September  the Argentine Government forwarded to the office a further set of observations on the complaints of violation of freedom of association which had been submitted against it.
.When the case was again referred to the Committee at its rd Session (November ), it submitted a second interim report to the Governing Body, which was approved by the latter at its th Session (- March ).
.During its examination of the case at its November  Session, the Committee dealt with some of the outstanding allegations (the question of the legality of the  bank strike, and allegations relating to the general position of the trade union movement). However, it considered that it was necessary for it to obtain from the Government additional information on certain points concerning the allegations relating to the prosecution and the detention of trade unionists, and to the placing of certain trade union organisations under administrative control.
.The requests for additional information were sent to the Argentine Government in a letter from the Director-General dated  November .
.At its th Session (February ) the Committee, in the absence of the additional information requested from the Government, decided to adjourn the examination of the case to its next session.
.In a communication dated  February  the Government of the Argentine Republic forwarded to the Office a further set of observations concerning the complaints of violation of freedom of association which had been submitted against it.
.The following paragraphs deal solely with the allegations pending since the approval by the Governing Body of the Committee's st Report.
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ). The first of these Conventions entered into force for Argentina on  January , whereas the second entered into force on  September .
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to take note of the Government's declared intention to bring to an end all control of the Banking Association and to express the hope that the removal of this control will take place in the near future;(b) to draw the attention of the Government to the importance which it attaches to the principle set forth in Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Argentina, that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict trade union rights or impede the lawful exercise by workers' organisations of their right to elect their representatives in full freedom, to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes;(c) to decide that, subject to the observations contained in subparagraphs (a) and (b) above, and for the reasons given in paragraphs  to  of the present report, the case as a whole does not call for further examination.
.On  February  the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions addressed to the Director-General of the International Labour Office a letter containing allegations that freedom of association had been infringed in Argentina in connection with the bank strike that occurred in the months of February and March . his complaint was communicated to the Government on  February .
.On  January  the organisation known as Argentine Trade Union Action (A.S.A.) put forward a series of allegations concerning the same strike. These allegations were communicated to the Government on  February . Argentine Trade Union Action supplemented its complaint by a letter dated  March , and the Government was informed of the contents of that letter on  March .
.On  March  the Postal, Telegraph and Telephone International submitted an extensive series of documents containing allegations that freedom of association had been infringed in connection with the disputes that broke out among telegraph and telephone workers in the months of September, October and November . This complaint was forwarded to the Government by a letter dated  March .
.By a communication dated  October  the Government of the Argentine Republic submitted its observations regarding the various complaints that had been communicated to it.
.The case was submitted to the Committee at its November  (th) Session, and the Committee submitted to the Governing Body an interim report which was approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (Geneva,  to  November ).
.When it examined the case at its meeting in November , the Committee dealt with certain of the allegations that had been put forward (allegations relating to the illegality of the strike of telegraph and telephone workers, the suspension of the registration of associations and the mobilisation of bank employees). On the other hand it took the view that on certain points it would be necessary, if the Committee was to be in a position to reach a decision based on a full knowledge of all the relevant factors, to obtain additional information from the Government with regard to the allegations relating to the prosecution and detention of trade unionists and the placing of certain trade union organisations under administrative control.
.The decisions taken by the Governing Body on the Committee's recommendation, together with the requests for additional information, were transmitted to the Government by a communication from the Director-General dated  November .
.Since it had not received the additional information requested from the Government the Committee decided at its February  (st) Session to postpone consideration of the case until its next session. The Government was informed of this decision by a letter dated  March .

88,"Haiti. These legal provisions, a copy of which was annexed to the Government's communication of  January , are the following:(a) Order of the Military Council of the Government dated  September  proclaiming a state of martial law throughout the territory of the Republic;(b) Order of the President of the Republic dated  May  declaring a state of siege throughout the territory of the Republic and suspending the guarantees prescribed by articles , , , , ,  and  of the Constitution;(c) Decree of the Legislative Body dated  July  suspending the guarantees prescribed by articles , , ,  (paragraph ), ,  and  of the Constitution and according full powers to the Head of the Executive for a period of six months.The Government also annexed to its reply the text of the Constitutional guarantees contained in the articles of the national Constitution mentioned in the orders and decree cited above..When it examined the case at its st Session (February ), the Committee observed that it was clear from the texts cited by the Government that the reasons which caused them to be put into application must be sought in the disturbed political situation experienced in Haiti.
.When it examined the case at its st Session (February ), the Committee observed that it was clear from the texts cited by the Government that the reasons which caused them to be put into application must be sought in the disturbed political situation experienced in Haiti.
.The Committee recalled that in many previous cases in which it had had to examine allegations against countries which were in a state of political crisis or had just passed through grave disturbances (civil war, revolution, etc.), it had considered it necessary, when examining the various measures taken by the governments, including some against trade union organisations, to have regard to such exceptional circumstances when examining the merits of the allegations. However, in cases in which it has had before it complaints of alleged infringements of freedom of association under a state of siege or emergency or by virtue of national security legislation, the Committee, while indicating that it is not called upon to comment on the necessity for or desirability of such legislation, which is a purely political consideration, has always taken the view that it must consider what repercussions the legislation might have on trade union rights.
.While refraining, therefore, from commenting on the political aspects of the state of emergency pursuant to which the measures complained of had been taken against Mr. Michel, the Committee, in February , nevertheless affirmed once again the importance which it attaches to the principle that measures of detention should be accompanied by adequate judicial safeguards applied within a reasonable period and to the right of all detained persons to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment, and recommended the Governing Body to draw these points to the attention of the Government of Haiti.
.With regard to the particular case of Mr. Michel and to the measures taken against him, the Committee, at its February  Session, observed that, while the Government referred to the legal texts and to the procedures pursuant to which the measures were taken, it nevertheless made no mention of the reasons that caused them to be taken. For these reasons the Committee asked the Director-General to obtain further information from the Government on this point.
.Responding to that request for further information by a communication dated  April , the Government, in order to show that the reasons for the measures taken against the person concerned were completely unconnected with his trade union functions or activities, furnishes a copy of a confidential letter addressed to the Secretary of State for Labour, on  October , by the Secretary of State for Home Affairs and National Defence, in which it is stated: "" Mr. Nathanael Michel, former general secretary of the National Union of Workers of Haiti, was removed from his post by the members of that organisation because he had pawned a cin-camera, a duplicating machine and other articles belonging to that organisation in a pawnshop belonging to Mr. Appolon Thzine. Being trade union property, these articles could not be disposed of or mortgaged except under certain specific conditions prescribed by legislation. Mr. Michel took no heed of this fact. Secondly, he was removed from his post by the General Assembly of the U.N.O.H. Being enraged, he tried to ascribe his dismissal to political causes and made all sorts of efforts to break up the organisation. In order to avoid the possibility that any dangerous action by this swindler should imperil the continued existence of this trade union organisation, Mr. Michel was assigned a forced residence in Gressier.""
.This accusation made against Mr. Michel by the U.N.O.H was, the Government affirms, the only reason for the action taken against him by the government police services. The Government adds that because of his constant political activities directed against the Government, "" which were partly responsible for the repressive action taken against him "", Mr. Michel thought it desirable to seek sanctuary in the Embassy of Venezuela and then, subsequently, went to Venezuela.
.At its nd Session (May ) the Committee, taking account of a telegram dated  May  from the I.C.F.T.U informing it of the despatch of further information and requesting, accordingly, an adjournment, decided to adjourn its examination of the case to a later session. The further information referred to by the complainants is contained in a communication dated  August .
.In this communication the complainants seek to furnish information on a number of points which, they state, has been forwarded to them by Mr. Michel himself from the United States where he would appear to have gone after a brief stay in Venezuela.
.According to the information received by the complainants, after the dissolution of a number of occupational associations ordered following the change of rgime in June , the U.N.O.H waged a campaign of protest which resulted in Messrs. Isidore and Michel, respectively president and general secretary of the U.N.O.H, being summoned to the Dessalines Barracks, where threats were made that they would be tortured and the headquarters of the U.N.O.H would be closed if the protest campaign waged by that organisation was not terminated.
.In the observations made by the Government in a communication dated  October  in respect of the further information furnished on  August  by the I.C.F.T.U, the Government formally denies that, following the change in the Presidency of the Republic, any massive dissolutions of trade unions took place and challenges the complainants to furnish a list of the organisations claimed to have been dissolved. The Government also affirms that Messrs. Isidore and Michel were never summoned to the Dessalines Barracks to be threatened with torture on account of the trade union affairs of the U.N.O.H and, in support of its statement in this connection, it adduces the text of a declaration made by Mr. Isidore, indicating that neither he nor Mr. Michel was summoned to the Dessalines Barracks, and that no pressure was exercised by the authorities in respect of the trade union affairs of the U.N.O.H.
.The complainants again having mentioned the arrest and imprisonment of Mr. Michel, the Government refers to its earlier communications in respect of the reasons which occasioned these measures.
.The complainants also recall that Mr. Michel was dismissed from his post as a teacher at the Haiti Central School of Arts and Crafts "" under the pretext that he had resigned in accordance with the regulations of that Department "". In this connection the Government forwards the text of a letter from the National Department of Education which gives the reasons for the removal of Mr. Michel from his post as a teacher in the Central School of Arts and Crafts, the summary of these reasons being that the person concerned stayed away from his work without having obtained authorisation to do so, thus rendering himself liable to the application of the disciplinary provisions of the National Education Regulations (section ), according to which prolonged absence without reason and without prior authorisation may entail dismissal.
.The complainants then allege that the reason for which Mr. Michel, after being released, was placed in forced residence resulted from his refusal of the proposals made by the Government that he should resign from the U.N.O.H. The I.C.F.T.U also alleges that, in April , the Secretary of State for Labour convened separately the leaders of the organisations affiliated to the U.N.O.H in order to ask them to give their aid to the Government by disavowing the Executive Committee of the organisation.
.In its reply dated  October  the Government denies that it asked Mr. Michel to resign from his post as general secretary of the U.N.O.H and declares, on the contrary, that it has always refrained from intervening in the administration of occupational associations. It also denies ever having convened the leaders of the trade union organisations affiliated to the U.N.O.H in order to ask",-1,1958,Haiti

.When it examined the case at its th Session (November ), the Committee took the view that it would be necessary to obtain further information from both the complaining organisation and the Government before it could make its recommendations to the Governing Body. The Committee decided, therefore, to adjourn its examination of the case until the information in question had been received.
.Having been informed of this decision, the Government of Haiti and the I.C.F.T.U forwarded the further information requested of them by two letters dated  and  January  respectively. In a letter dated  February  the Government forwarded its comments on the supplementary information contained in the I.C.F.T.U's communication dated  January , which had been transmitted to the Government by the Director-General.
.When it examined the case further at its st Session (February ), the Committee was able to make final recommendations to the Governing Body on all except one aspect of the allegations. These recommendations, and the reasoning on which they were based, are contained in the rd Report. With respect to the allegations with which it did not feel that it could deal finally at that time, the Committee made an interim report, considering it necessary to obtain additional information from the Government before formulating its final conclusions.
.This request for further information was conveyed by the Director-General to the Government, which forwarded a reply to the Office on  April .
.At its nd Session (May ) the Committee adjourned its examination of the case until its next session, in accordance with a request made by the I.C.F.T.U by a telegram dated  May , in which it stated that further information was being forwarded.

.The Government replied by a letter dated  October ; this reply having been received by the Office too late to permit of its being examined by the Committee at its rd Session (November ), the examination was adjourned until the th Session of the Committee.
.At its th Session (February ) the Committee considered it necessary to ask the Government to clarify certain aspects of the matter and adjourned its examination of the case pending the receipt of the information in question. The Government was requested to furnish this information by a letter from the Director-General dated  March .
.At its th Session (May ) the Committee, not having received the further information requested from the Government, adjourned its examination of the case until its present session.
.The information requested was forwarded to the Office by the Government of Haiti by a letter dated  June .
.Having regard to the explanations given in paragraph  above, the present document relates only to the one set of allegations still outstanding.Allegations relating to Measures Taken against Mr. Nathanael Michel, General Secretary of the National Union of Workers of Haiti (U.N.O.H)
.In its original complaint, the I.C.F.T.U alleges that, on  January , Mr. Nathanael Michel, General Secretary of the U.N.O.H, was arrested and kept in prison without any charges having been brought against him. After being released from prison on  January , Mr. Michel was assigned a forced residence for several weeks. Moreover, it is stated, Mr. Michel was removed from his post as a teacher at the Haiti Central School of Arts and Crafts.
.Although they do not make a specific statement to this effect, the complainants, in their communication dated  July , allow it to be understood that these measures originated in the trade union activities of Mr. Michel, and they consider in particular that the removal from office of the person concerned constitutes a contravention of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Haiti, Article  of which provides that workers shall enjoy adequate protection against acts calculated to cause the dismissal of or otherwise prejudice a worker because of his participation in union activities.
.In its first reply dated  September  the Government affirms that Mr. Michel was never disturbed on account of his trade union activities and that the measures taken against him originated in his political activities, while he had also been guilty of embezzlement. In support of its claim that the measures taken against Mr. Michel were not connected with his trade union activities, the Government annexes to its reply a copy of a letter addressed to Mr. Michel by the new President of the U.N.O.H. In this letter it is stated "" for reasons of a purely political character you were arrested on  January of this year and set free after  days of imprisonment but kept under police supervision. Since this last police measure was cancelled for you and for others, through the intervention of the U.N.O.H and of certain national and international democratic organisations, you have stayed underground for personal reasons "" and, further on: "" The members of the Committee of the U.N.O.H are prepared to help you in any action you may take to clear yourself of the charge of communism which has recently been laid at your door.""
.In several earlier cases the Committee has been called upon to formulate conclusions on the application of measures which, even though of a political character and not intended to restrict trade union rights as such, may nevertheless affect the exercise of such rights. When it examined the present case in November  the Committee took the view that, as the person concerned had trade union responsibilities, the measure taken with regard to him was likely, even if that were not intended, to affect the exercise of trade union rights.
.The Committee pointed out that, if in certain previous cases it has reached the conclusion that allegations relating to measures taken against trade union militants did not call for further examination, this has been after it has received information from the governments showing sufficiently precisely and with sufficient detail that the arrests were in no way occasioned by trade union activities but solely by activities outside the trade union sphere which were either prejudicial to public order or of a political nature.
.In the present case the Committee noted that the Government did not give details of the activities which caused measures to be taken against the person concerned. In these circumstances, and having regard to the fact that the measures in question were taken at a moment when trade union elections were being held in the organisation of which Mr. Michel was general secretary, the Committee considered that, in order to be able to reach a conclusion in full knowledge of all the circumstances, it should request the Government to furnish more detailed information with respect both to the specific reasons for the measures complained of being taken and, in particular, to the particular activities which had been held against him.
.Further, in view of the complainants' allegation that Mr. Michel was arrested and kept in custody without any specific charges having been made against him, and of the fact that the Government, in its reply dated  September , made no observations on this particular aspect of the case, the Committee, having regard to the importance which it has always attached to the principle of prompt and fair trial by an independent and impartial judiciary in all cases, including cases in which trade unionists are charged with political or criminal offences, decided, in November , to request the Government to be good enough to furnish information concerning the procedure followed when the measures against Mr. Michel were taken and concerning the guarantees attending such procedure.
.In response to these requests for information the Government, in a communication dated  January , began by confirming the statements made in its previous observations, forwarded on  September . It pointed out further that the U.N.O.H, an affiliate of the Inter-American Regional Organisation of Workers (O.R.I.T) and the organisation to which Mr. Michel belonged, took part in the O.R.I.T - I.C.F.T.U Conference in Bogot in December , its delegate being Mr. Fritzner Sainvil, now general secretary of the U.N.O.H in succession to Mr. Michel. This delegate, freely chosen, according to the Government, by the organisation in question, was duly accredited and participated in the normal way in the work of the Conference. Yet, declares the Government, it is precisely the I.C.F.T.U which has submitted a complaint concerning Mr. Michel to the I.L.O.
.Referring more specifically to the particular points raised by the Committee, the Government, in further observations dated  January , declared that the measures taken against Mr. Michel were taken pursuant to legal provisions adopted because of the abnormal political situation prevailing in",-1,1958,Haiti
90,".By a communication dated  November  addressed directly to the I.L.O, the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions presented a complaint of alleged infringements of freedom of association by the Government of the Argentine Republic. This complaint was communicated to the Argentine Government for its observations on  November . The Government replied by a letter dated  February .
.The complaint of the I.F.C.T.U related to the new Industrial Associations Act of  August , numerous provisions of which, in the view of the complaining organisation, infringe the fundamental principles relating to freedom of association and, in particular, the guarantees laid down in the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the latter of which Conventions has been ratified by the Argentine Republic.
.According to the complainant, while section  of the Act of  August  claims to guarantee freedom of association, this freedom has been completely destroyed by a whole series of other provisions in the Act which set up a trade union monopoly for industrial organisations which fulfil certain conditions of representation laid down by the Act. While numerical minorities and other groups which are not considered representative have the right to form industrial organisations, these are prohibited from styling themselves "" trade unions "" ; they are also forbidden to defend or represent industrial interests against the State and employers if in the same sector there already exists an association which is recognised as a trade union by the Government authorities.
.Thus, declare the complainants, organisations established by workers who do not wish to belong to trade unions enjoying a state-protected monopoly cannot act as trade unions at all. It ensues from section  of the Act that they cannot take part in any of the following activities : (a) defend or represent industrial interests against the State and employers ; (b) defend or represent the individual interests of their single members against financial institutions, in the courts or against any other state organisation ; (c) take part in government bodies for the organisation of labour and social security; (d) intervene in collective negotiations, sign or amend acts and collective agreements, assist in the supervision of social legislation or encourage its extension and improvement ; (e) collaborate with the State as a technical and advisory agent in the examination and solution of problems concerning the occupation ; (f) organise meetings and assemblies without prior authorisation ; (g) establish an endowment fund for mutual benefit societies.
.In consequence, according to the complainants, many workers will have to join a trade union recognised by the State in order to gain satisfaction in disputes or quarrels with employers, State and social security organisations, etc., because the activities of the non-recognised unions are paralysed.
.The complainants then quote sections ,  and  of the Act which lay down the criteria for according to, or withholding from, an industrial organisation the legal status of a trade union. These sections, as cited by the complainants, read as follows:Article . The industrial workers' association that most nearly represents the activity concerned shall have the right to enjoy the legal status of a trade union on the condition that:
.Its rules are adapted to the provisions contained in the previous Act.
.It possesses the largest number of members, thus giving it sufficient powers to represent the activity or category of occupation in the area which it covers.
.It has been exercising trade union rights for at least six months previously.Article . Where there exists an organisation with the legal status of a trade union this status can only be given to another trade union for the same activity when there are more paying members in the latter than in the association with the status of a trade union over a minimum and continuous period of six months prior to the request.Article . When, under the terms of the previous Article, the legal status of a trade union is given to an organisation, the trade union which obtained this status previously loses it if it ceases to be sufficiently representative in character. In deciding whether the trade union whose membership has been surpassed should keep its legal status, its trade union activity and also its contribution to the defence and protection of industrial interests shall be taken into account.
.In the view of the complaining organisation, the criteria laid down in these sections of the Act for endowing an association with the legal status of a trade union or for withdrawing this status are not only very arbitrary but also extremely vague. Further, the complainants declare, "" the Government will be able to make use of these criteria when assessing the importance, value and trends of any trade union activity on the part of an industrial organisation ""; thus, in effect, the Act gives the Government every opportunity of dominating the monopolised trade union movement which, as a result, is in danger of becoming a political instrument of this Government.
.In conclusion, the I.F.C.T.U requests the I.L.O:(a) to request the Government of the Argentine Republic to desist from enforcing the Act complained against;(b) to request the Government of the Argentine Republic to start the necessary proceedings for replacing this Act by another which shall fully comply with freedom of association and trade union rights ;(c) to request the Government of the Argentine Republic to enforce the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), which has been ratified by the Argentine Republic ;(d) to invite the Government to proceed as rapidly as possible to ratify and enforce the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ).
.In its reply the Government declares that the Act of  August  does not lay down what the structure of the Argentine trade union movement should be; it merely establishes a legal framework which ensures that occupational organisations are able to operate, certifies that the representative functions vested in them are legitimately theirs and safeguards the rights of the workers belonging to them.
.To assess the merits of this Act and to grasp the purposes of its provisions, declares the Government, it is necessary to take account of the conditions against the background of which it is to be applied. In the Argentine Republic, declares the Government, the workers are out to build up powerful industrial organisations, and to do so they realise that they must take care not to dissipate their strength and so they aim at achieving the greatest possible degree of unity. In support of this statement the Government points out that during the period when Legislative Decree No. / was on the Statute Book-a decree which provided for outright plurality in trade unionism-only very few workers' organisations were set up alongside the existing ones.
.The Government goes on to state that the binding force attaching to collective agreements in the Argentine Republic, even upon third parties who are not signatories thereto, makes it necessary for the authorities to ensure with meticulous care that the associations concluding such agreements are of a truly representative character. For these reasons, the Government considers, the Act in question, conferring as it does preferential rights on the most representative industrial associations, does not appear to be inappropriate to conditions in the Argentine Republic and is not an encroachment on freedom of association.
.In the Government's view, in order to appreciate the extent to which freedom of association is a reality, the position has to be reviewed from three different aspects - the point of view of the relationship of the association to the State, that of the relationship of individuals to their unions and that of the relationship of one association to another.
.With respect to the first of these aspects, the Government declares that the independence of the workers' industrial associations from the State is accorded full recognition in the Act of  August . Section  of this Act provides : "" In no event may the authority administering the Act interfere in the management or administration of any industrial association, whether or not the latter possesses guild status "". Moreover, section  provides expressly that "" suspension or withdrawal of guild status shall not deprive the organisation of the right to continue operating as an ordinary association at common law"".
.From the point of view of the relationship between individuals and their trade unions, the Government declares that freedom of association must be regarded as existing to the extent that individuals are at liberty to join or not to join a union, to discontinue their membership should they so desire, and to belong to unions of their own choosing. All these rights, the Government claims, are fully recognised by the Act of  August .
.With respect to the relationship between one association and another, the Government states that the Act complained against guarantees that workers' organisations are independent of any employers' association or political party, whether national or international, and prohibits workers'",-1,1958,Argentina
91,"organisations from receiving funds from such sources (section  of the Act).
.The new legislation, declares the Government, gives the sanction of law to a system of plurality in trade union organisation and of unity in industrial bargaining. In so doing, it clad in legal form a preponderance that the majority union could in any event have attained by its own weight, and in this weight lies the justification for the special legal capacity with which the Act endows it. Thus, the sole purpose of the new enactment is to give effect to the democratic principle of majority rule.
.The Government adds:There can be no doubt that, if it were not desired to distinguish between various classes of associations in the Act, the legislator might have opted for putting them all on the same footing, irrespective of how representative they were and how many members they possessed ; but in such a case the only rights they could be accorded would be those derived from the Constitutional guarantees of freedom of the individual, freedom of association and freedom to petition the authorities. One should not, however, confuse the rights proceeding from these guarantees with the special trade union rights instituted for the purposes of the necessary representation of a trade or occupational category. This essential distinction is not made in those enactments that lump all occupational organisations into the same class and eschew the system of guild status. Such enactments require organisations to furnish proof of their representative character, or lay down procedures whereby this may be determined, before the organisations are allowed to enter into commitments (e.g. collective agreements) on behalf of the trade or occupation as a whole.
.The Government affirms, further, that the choice of the system to be adopted rules out any risk of arbitrary action on the part of the administrative authorities because section  of the Act of  August  gives a right of appeal to the courts in any matter relating to guild status.
.The Government declares in its reply that the complaint of the I.F.C.T.U lists all the exclusive powers which section  of the Act grants to the most representative industrial associations, but omits all reference to the powers which section  of the same Act accords to the remaining organisations which are merely registered. Contrary to what the complainants appear to allege, the latter organisations are not completely forbidden to defend and represent industrial interests vis--vis the State and the employers. Only in the event of there being in the relevant trade or occupation one or more associations with recognised guild status must they refrain from exercising the rights which appertain exclusively to such associations. This system does not imply that associations which are merely registered cannot take action to protect and represent their membership or that they cannot obtain corporate status as ordinary associations and petition in furtherance of occupational interests. The difference between the industrial associations with guild status and those which are merely registered lies in the fact that the former act as the statutory bargaining agents for the trade or occupation as a whole, whereas the latter may only undertake acts of stewardship to uphold the interests of the said trade or occupation.
.In conclusion, the Government affirms that the Act of  August  in no way infringes the provisions of International Labour Conventions Nos.  and , that it does not set up a trade union monopoly for workers' industrial organisations that possess guild status, that it does not forbid organisations which are merely registered to exercise trade union functions and that it does not give the Government opportunities of dominating the trade union movement, thus permitting it to transform it into a political tool.
.It would appear, both from the allegations made by the complainants and from the observations presented by the Government, that the essential question in the case as a whole consists in the distinction made by the Act of  August  between "" ordinary "" occupational associations and those which enjoy "" guild status "". The complainants and the Government ascribe a very different meaning and scope to this distinction. Accordingly, before any conclusion can be formulated, it is necessary to examine the actual text of the Act.
.Section  of the Act provides that workers shall be entitled to establish and join organisations of their own choosing without previous authorisation. Section  prohibits any trade union discrimination. However, a concept is introduced in Chapters IV and V of the Act which had previously been abandoned, namely the distinction between ordinary organisations and organisations having trade union status.
.The essential criterion governing the granting or refusal of trade union status is the degree of representativeness of the organisation concerned, this being determined in its turn principally on the basis of the size of its membership compared with the memberships of the other organisations, but also on the contribution made by the organisation concerned towards the defence and protection of occupational interests.
.On several occasions, and especially when the draft text of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention was being discussed, the Conference has had to consider the question of the representative character of workers' and employers' organisations ; it accepted to some extent the distinction which certain countries draw between various organisations according to the extent to which they are representative. Article , paragraph , of the Constitution of the I.L.O recognises the concept of "" most representative "" organisations. The distinction made by the new Argentine Act between two categories of trade union organisations could not therefore give rise to criticism in itself.
.It is nevertheless necessary to consider, in the light of the texts, what are the criteria for, and the consequences of, such a distinction.
.Although a distinction made between organisations according to whether they are more or less representative may be admissible in itself, it is necessary that the criteria for determining such distinction shall be objective and be based on prescriptions which give rise to no possibility of abuse.
.According to section  of the Argentine Act, an organisation cannot obtain trade union status if there already exists an organisation enjoying such status unless the number of its members exceeds the number of members belonging to the union already having this status. Section  provides that a union enjoying trade union status will lose that status if it ceases to be sufficiently representative in character. It is also stated in that section : "" In determining whether the association with the smaller membership should retain its trade union status, account shall be taken of the number of its members, its trade union activity and its contribution to the defence and protection of occupational interests.""
.The Committee considers that the imprecise nature of the terms of the part of the section which is cited above might permit of abuse when the decision is taken by the Government whether or not to permit a particular trade union to retain its trade union status.
.It would seem that the independence of occupational organisations in relation to the public authorities might be compromised if the legislator or the executive power can effect a discrimination between the various organisations concerned which is not based on objective criteria, and even more so where-as will be seen to be the case subsequently when the Argentine Act is analysed-the consequences of the distinction between the different organisations are to reserve to certain organisations a monopoly both in respect of the determination of conditions of employment (collective bargaining, etc.) and in respect of the representation and defence of the interests of the workers in relation to the public authorities.
.In this latter connection the consequences of the distinction between organisations which do not and those which do possess trade union status are defined in sections  and  of the Act, which specify the functions and rights of these two types of organisation. Section  provides that the rights and functions listed therein are reserved exclusively to organisations which have trade union status. The rights thus accorded by section  exclusively to organisations enjoying trade union status include-participation in the work of the public bodies concerned with the regulation of labour and social security, the negotiation and conclusion of collective agreements, collaboration with the State in a technical and advisory capacity in the study and solution of problems of concern to the occupation represented by the organisation, the holding of meetings without obtaining prior authorisation, the defence and representation of the individual interests of the members of the organisation vis--vis the social security institutions, courts of law and other public bodies and, finally, the defence and representation of occupational interests vis--vis the State and the employers. It is true that the last, mentioned right is also accorded to ordinary organisations, but section  of the Act nevertheless provides that they may enjoy this right only where no association with trade union status exists in the branch of activity concerned.
.Among the activities in which ordinary organisations may engage, section  of the Act mentions the establishment",-1,1958,Argentina
92,"of provident and welfare institutions, holiday camps, canteens, hospitals, etc., the formation of producers' and consumers' co operatives, the promotion of general and vocational education by setting up libraries, laboratories, etc. From the strictly trade union point of view therefore, the role assigned to these organisations is extremely limited. According to the definition contained in Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) the term "" organisation "" means ""any organisation of workers or of employers for furthering and defending the interests of workers or of employers "". It is clear from a perusal of the Act that even if that may be the object which is pursued by ordinary organisations, they lack the means of attaining it and the means of action open to such organisations are particularly limited.
.In its reply, the Government states that the difference between the functions of organisations having legal status and those of ordinary organisations resides solely in the fact that the former act as the statutory bargaining agents for the trade or occupation, whereas the latter may only undertake acts of stewardship to uphold the interests of the trade or occupation. In the final analysis, the whole system of industrial relations rests on the associations which enjoy trade union status and these organisations appear to be the only ones to possess the means to defend and promote the interests of the workers ; the other organisations of workers are deprived by the Act of such essential trade union functions as the conclusion of collective agreements in addition to that of defending and promoting occupational interests.
.In these circumstances, having regard to the fact that the distinction made by the Act between organisations enjoying trade union status and ordinary organisations results, in particular, in the latter organisations being unable to defend occupational interests against the employers, to hold meetings without previous authorisation and to conclude collective agreements-this point being of particular importance in the Argentine Republic, where the collective agreements may be extended to third parties who have not taken part in their negotiation and conclusion-it would seem that organisations which do not have trade union status do not have the right to organise in freedom their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes. Further, in view of the limited functions which are assigned to these organisations, it may be wondered whether the distinction does not infringe the generally recognised principle that workers shall have the right to establish and join organisations of their own choosing-a principle which is embodied in Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ).
.By including the words "" organisations of their own choosing "" in the said Convention, the Conference made allowance for the fact that in certain countries there are a number of different workers' and employers' organisations which an individual may choose to join for occupational, denominational or political reasons ; but it did not pronounce upon the question whether it is in the interest of workers and employers to have unified organisations rather than a number of separate ones. But it also recognised thereby the right of any group of workers (or employers) to form breakaway organisations if they think this desirable to safeguard their material or moral interests.
.The Convention also lays down that workers' and employers' organisations shall have the right to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes (Article ) and that the acquisition of legal personality by workers' and employers' organisations shall not be made subject to conditions of such a character as to restrict the application of the guarantees laid down in the Convention (Article ), which guarantees include the freedom of choice of organisation by the workers and the right of organisations to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes.
.Finally, it may be appropriate to refer here to the observations made by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations at its last session (April ) according to which in certain cases a prohibition of the establishment of an occupational organisation capable of "" furthering and defending the interests "" of its members may result from the "" recognition "" by the Government of another organisation. The Committee went on: ""This is clearly the case, for example, when the law itself specifies the privileged organisation by name. It may also be the case where the regulations relating to recognition impose on the organisations of workers concerned a form which may restrict their freedom of action and do not lay down objective criteria for the recognition for a fixed period of an organisation for the purposes of representation or negotiation "".
.In the present case it would appear that only organisations which enjoy trade union status are able to "" further and defend the interests "" of their members, and that organisations to which this status is not assigned are unable to perform such functions.
.There would seem to be no doubt that the privileged position thus accorded to organisations having trade union status may indirectly operate against the freedom of the workers to join organisations of their own choosing. This opinion, moreover, was expressed by the Committee when it had before it another case in which the trade union system in force in the Argentine Republic at the time was the subject of a complaint.
.In that case, noting that the regulations then in force did not place on the same footing ordinary organisations and recognised trade unions, the Committee, "" having regard to the fact that the privileged status accorded to recognised trade unions may indirectly operate against the freedom of workers, to belong to organisations of their own choosing "" took the view that it would be desirable for the Government to reconsider the distinction made between recognised trade unions and other trade union organisations.
.In another case, relating to Brazil, in which it had to examine a system which had many features in common with that in force in the Argentine Republic, the Committee expressed the following opinion:It may, however, be asked whether, simply because the approved unions enjoy, to the exclusion of other organisations, privileges of paramount importance in the defence of occupational interests, wage earners are not indirectly obliged to belong to the approved unions. It does happen that the legislation in other countries without any intention of discrimination confers on recognised unions, which are in fact the most representative, certain privileges in connection with the defence of occupational interests which only they are in a position to perform effectively. But the granting of such privileges may not be made subject to conditions of such a nature as to bring into question through their operation the fundamental guarantees of freedom of association.
.Following this precedent and having regard to the fact that the conditions present in the case now before it are similar in many respects to those which it had to consider when it examined Case No.  relating to the Argentine Republic, the Committee, while noting that the laws now in force are not the same laws as were in force when it examined the earlier case, considers that the privileged status accorded to organisations which enjoy trade union status considerably limits the means of action open to organisations which do not have such status and may indirectly operate against the freedom of workers to belong to organisations of their own choosing, and recommends the Governing Body to draw the attention of the Argentine Government to the desirability of considering whether it would not be possible to abolish the distinction made by the Act of  August  between organisations which enjoy trade union status and other trade union organisations.
.Finally, with respect to a more specific point, the Committee has noted that, according to sections  and  of the Act read together, organisations which do not enjoy trade union status are prohibited from holding meetings without previous authorisation. The right to hold meetings in freedom is an integral part of the right of trade unions to function freely. This is the point of view that the Committee has expressed whenever it has been called upon to examine a complaint containing allegations of infringements of the free exercise of the right of trade union meeting. In this connection, the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations emphasised in  that "" the degree of freedom enjoyed by occupational organisations in determining and organising their activities depends very largely upon certain legislative provisions of general application relating to the right of free meeting, the right of free expression and, in general, to civil and political liberties enjoyed by the inhabitants of a country "". From this point of view also, the considerable limitation placed on the means of action open to organisations which do not enjoy trade union status by the fact that they cannot hold meetings without previous authorisation would disappear if the distinction between these two",-1,1958,Argentina
93,"types of organisation was abolished.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to suggest to the Government that it may give consideration to ratifying the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) in the near future ;(b) to suggest to the Government that it might consider amending its legislation, with a view to bringing it into complete harmony with the principles contained in the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ).Geneva,  May .

.This further complaint by Argentine Trade Union Action and the additional information submitted in support of it were communicated to the Government for its observations in two letters dated  April and  May  respectively.
.At its May  (nd) Session, and in the absence of the additional information previously requested from the Government and of the observations expected from it concerning the latest complaint by Argentine Trade Union Action, the Committee decided to postpone consideration of the case until its next session. The Government was informed of this decision of the Committee by letter dated  June .

.The Government of Argentina presented its observations on the various complaints mentioned above in a communication dated  October .
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to decide, with respect to the allegations relating to the illegality of the strike of telegraph and telephone employees and its effects on trade union rights, to draw the attention of the Government to the desirability of considering the possibility of effecting an improvement in the existing system for the settlement of disputes in state-owned undertakings by affording the guarantee of adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures in which the parties concerned can take part at every stage ;(b) to decide, with respect to the allegations relating to suspension of the registration of associations, to draw the attention of the Government to the importance which it attaches to the right of meeting and the principle that organisations representing the workers should be recognised for collective bargaining purposes, and to draw its attention to the fact that the suspension by administrative measures of a trade union is contrary to one of the fundamental principles of freedom of association ;(c) to decide, with respect to the allegations relating to the detention of trade unionists, to draw the attention of the Government to the importance which it attaches to the principle that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict trade union rights or impede the lawful exercise thereof, but to decide, having regard to the fact that the examining magistrate found that there were no proper grounds for the detentions and the persons concerned were released within three days, that no useful purpose would now be served by examining further this aspect of the case ;(d) to decide, with respect to the allegations relating to arrests of trade unionists and the illegality of the bank employees' strike, to express the hope that the Government, desiring to see labour relations develop in an atmosphere of mutual confidence, will have recourse, when dealing with situations resulting from strikes and lockouts, to measures provided for under common law rather than to emergency measures, which involve a danger, by reason of their very nature, of certain restrictions being placed on fundamental rights ;(e) to decide, with respect to the appointment of a controller of the Argentine Bank Employees' Association, to draw the attention of the Government to the importance which it attaches to the generally accepted principle that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict the right of workers' organisations to elect their representatives in full freedom and to organise their administration and activities, and to request the Government to furnish information as to whether the appointment of the controller for the trade union in question has now been cancelled ;(f) to decide, with respect to the allegations relating to the mobilisation of bank employees, in view of the serious consequences which a measure of this kind may imply for workers and for the exercise of their trade union rights, to draw the attention of the Government to the possibility of abuse involved in the mobilisation of workers in industrial disputes and to emphasise the undesirability of recourse to such measures except for the purpose of maintaining essential services in circumstances of the utmost gravity ;(g) to take note of the present interim report of the Committee with respect to the outstanding allegations in this case, it being understood that the Committee will report further thereon when it has received the observations requested from the Government.",-1,1958,Argentina

."" Under the Government's threat to close down the Union's offices"" continue the complainants "" the Management Committee had unanimously decided to place the audiovisual apparatus belonging to the U.N.O.H in safe keeping lest it be destroyed or confiscated by the authorities. Accordingly, an electric generator and a Delco, together with the necessary papers, were entrusted to a business firm, the understanding being that when the U.N.O.H took the equipment back it would pay a sum of $ to the owner of the firm. Mr. Michel was subsequently accused of fraudulent conversion and false pretences at the U.N.O.H's expense but in fact it is clear that he was only carrying out the instructions of the U.N.O.H committee without deriving any personal advantage from so doing.""
.In opposition to this interpretation of the facts, the Government gives an entirely different version, supported by various pieces of evidence emanating respectively from the U.N.O.H and from Mr. Thzine, owner of the "" business house "". In the first place it would appear from these documents that in Haiti the expression "" business house "" means the office of a person who lends on security. It would also appear from a memorandum drawn up by the U.N.O.H that Mr. Michel wrongfully used the apparatus belonging to a trade union in order to secure a personal loan and that, moreover, he retained a number of other objects belonging to the organisation. In this connection, the memorandum of the U.N.O.H con-tained the following statement: "" By pledging a projector and a duplicating machine belonging to the U.N.O.H, Mr. Nathanael Michel acted arbitrarily and without the knowledge of the other members of the Management Committee of the union. It was a personal action from which he alone derived benefit."" It would also appear from the letter from the pawnbroker, Mr. Thzine, that the latter attempted, by laying a complaint before the police, to have Mr. Michel arrested for fraud and misuse of funds because, in the words of Mr. Thzine, as he was not the owner of the apparatus in question, he did not have the right to pledge it. But at that time, adds Mr. Thzine, Mr. Michel "" had already gone underground "".
.When it considered the case at its th Session (February ), the Committee took the view that further clarification on certain points would be necessary before it could make its final recommendations to the Governing Body.
.Thus, the Committee observed that, according to the Government's communication dated  October , Mr. Michel appeared to have been dismissed on the ground that he had absented himself, without leave, from his work at the Central School of Arts and Crafts, where he was a teacher. But, observed the Committee, it appeared from the other information in its possession that Mr. Michel was in prison at the time of such dismissal.
.The Committee also noted that, in its observations, the Government declared that the offences committed by Mr. Michel were the only reason, or at least the essential reason, for the measures taken against him, and, therefore, the Committee could not understand why, that being the case, those measures were taken pursuant to an exceptional procedure and not under the common law penal procedure.
.By a letter dated  March  the Director-General, on behalf of the Committee, requested the Government to be good enough to furnish its observations on the two points mentioned above. The Government replied by a communication dated  June .
.With regard to the first point, the Government refers to section  of the Act of  September , which reads as follows:
.The detention of an employee in custody for not more than  days followed by acquittal shall likewise be a case of suspension of the contract without liability for the employer or employee.The employee shall, within three days of the date on which detention commenced, inform the employer of the reason why he is unable to report for work, and shall return to work within the two days of the date on which the circumstance ceases to exist; if he fails to do so, the contract shall be deemed to be terminated without liability for either side. If so requested by the employee, the director of the prison shall issue the necessary certificates in evidence of the facts mentioned in this article.The Government declares that Mr. Michel, contrary to this section of the Act, did not inform his chief of his imprisonment, which is why the General Directorate of National Education applied the disciplinary measure prescribed by section  of the Act of  September .
.It would appear from the explanations given by the Government that Mr. Michel failed to comply with the legal requirements in that he did not furnish information to his superior indicating the reasons for his absence from work and that, thereupon, the General Directorate of National Education considered itself justified in applying the provisions of the Act, which stipulate the termination of the contract where such information is not furnished.
.With respect to the second point raised by the Committee, the Government refers in the first place to its earlier statements and seeks to justify the application of an exceptional procedure in the case of Mr. Michel on the ground that, apart from the other offences committed by him, he was guilty of anti-government political activities of a reprehensible character.
.Although the explanations given by the Government--including those set forth in paragraphs  and  above-still remain obscure to a certain extent, it would nevertheless appear to be fairly clear from these explanations and from the documents furnished in support thereof that the reasons for the measures taken against Mr. Michel had their origin in political considerations and, also, in common law offences stated to have been committed by Mr. Michel. However this may be, it would not seem to be established that the measures complained against resulted from his trade union activities.
.In earlier cases in which the Committee has had to examine allegations relating to the prosecution of trade union officials and active trade unionists, it considered that the only question to be answered was the real reason for the arrests or trials. Only if these were ordered by reason of the trade union activities properly so called of the arrested persons had a violation of freedom of association occurred.
.Moreover, the Committee observes that the complainants base their latest further information solely on statements by Mr. Michel (see paragraph  above). The Committee considers that, although the question of proof must be judged in each case according to the particular circumstances, a complaint which is based solely on statements by the person directly concerned is, especially in particular equivocal circumstances such as those subsisting in the present case, necessarily somewhat suspect and could not be regarded as substantiated by adequate evidence.
.In these circumstances, while regretting even if it be true that the measures taken against Mr. Michel were mainly occasioned by common law offences stated to have been committed by the person concerned-that the ordinary penal procedure was not utilised in his case in preference to an exceptional procedure, and emphasising once again the importance which it attaches to the fact that measures of detention should be accompanied by adequate judicial safeguards applied within a reasonable period and to the right of all detained persons to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment, the Committee considers that the complainants-whose allegations in this case are based solely on the statements of the person accused-have not furnished proof that the measures complained against constituted, in this instance, an infringement of freedom of association. The Committee, therefore, recommends the Governing Body to decide, subject to the observations made above, that the case does not call for further examination.
.The complaint dated  July  was addressed directly to the I.L.O by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions. The complaining organisation was informed, by a letter dated  August , of its right to furnish further information in substantiation of its complaint within a period of one month.
.The complaint was transmitted to the Government of Haiti by a letter dated  August . The Government forwarded its observations to the Office by a communication dated  September .
.When it examined the case at its th Session (Geneva, November ), the Committee took the view that it would be necessary to obtain further information from both the complaining organisation and the Government before it could make its recommendations to the Governing Body. The Committee decided, therefore, to adjourn its examination of the case until the information in question had been received.
.Having been informed of this decision the Government of Haiti and the I.C.F.T.U forwarded the further information requested of them by two letters dated  and  January  respectively. In a letter dated  February , the Government forwarded its comments on the supplementary information contained in the I.C.F.T.U's communication dated  January , which had been",-1,1958,Haiti
97,".In accordance with Resolution No. A (XV) adopted on  April  by the Economic and Social Council, the Secretary-General of the United Nations transmitted to the Director-General of the I.L.O a communication dated  July , from the Honduras Brewery and Aerated Waters Workers' Union, San Pedro Sula, containing allegations of infringements of the exercise of trade union rights by the Government of Honduras.
.The complaint was communicated to the Government which forwarded its observations thereon in a letter dated  October .
.In the present case, clearly, no essential public service was involved. In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to draw the attention of the Government to the importance which it attaches to the fact that any use which is made of the police in the event of a strike, when exceptional circumstances so require, should be limited to the maintenance of public order and should not be for the purpose of breaking the strike, which might constitute a violation of trade union rights. However, in the present case, as it has not been established that the police and armed forces were used for the purpose of breaking the strike, which, moreover, was of short duration, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that no useful purpose would be served by pursuing further its examination of this aspect of the case.",-1,1958,Honduras
98,".On  June  the World Federation of Trade Unions addressed to the Director-General of the I.L.O a communication containing allegations relating to a putative infringement of freedom of association by the Government of Ecuador.
.By a letter dated  July , the Director-General informed the complaining organisation, in accordance with the procedure, of its right to furnish further information in substantiation of its complaint within a period of one month. The complaining organisation has not availed itself of this right.
.Having received a copy of the complaint by letter of  July , the Government of Ecuador presented its observations on the matter in a communication dated  September .
.In a complaint dated  June  the World Federation of Trade Unions alleges that the unions of various departments of the Municipal Council of Guayaquil had submitted a series of demands which the Council refused to accept, whereupon the municipal employees declared a strike in the middle of January . As a result of the dispute the Subdirector of Labour of Guayaquil handed down an award which was said to concede the majority of the workers' claims. The complainants allege, however, that the award contains a serious attack on the right to strike, in that it includes a clause stating "" that the workers in question may not avail themselves of the right to strike on account of the Constitutional principle laid down in the second paragraph of clause (i) of article  of the Political Constitution "". On the basis of this clause, they argue, the right to strike could be denied to all the public service workers in the country. According to the complainants this Constitutional clause guarantees the right to strike by providing, to quote their words, that "" the right of public service workers to strike shall be covered by special rules "". Such rules not yet having been issued, it is alleged that the right to strike is not limited by any restrictive conditions.
.In the same letter it is alleged that the Mayor of Guayaquil informed the press on  March  that he would not act on those parts of the award by the Subdirector of Labour that went in favour of the workers, and that the Municipal Council had resolved to dismiss the , workers who had taken part in the strike. As a result the municipal employees found themselves obliged to come out on strike again.
.The letter ends by saying that the principles customarily accepted by the I.L.O in regard to freedom of association have been violated, especially as regards the right to strike, which may not be restricted by resorting to wrongful dismissals. It is further contended that to deny municipal workers the right to strike when no rules exist on the subject constitutes an infringement of trade union rights.
.The Government replied to the complaint in a memorandum of  September , enclosing a long appendix consisting of a newspaper clipping reporting a statement by the Minister of Social Security and Labour on the sequence of events. In the documentation furnished by the Government, it is stated that, following the filing of a statement of demands by the municipal employees of Guayaquil, various agreements came to be signed in February . However, the agreed stipulations were never carried into effect as various changes occurred in the mayoralty, which finally resolved to dismiss  workers. A new statement of demands was presented as a result, and the Ministry of Labour undertook a series of conciliation measures that proved unsuccessful. Under these circumstances the workers decided to have recourse to strike action and notified the Conciliation and Arbitration Tribunal which had intervened in the dispute. After a series of judicial proceedings the case was referred to the Subdirector of Labour for the Coastal Region, who gave an award in second instance ; this award was not observed by the Municipality, which refused to reinstate the workers who had taken part in the strike, "" the dismissal thus being clearly shown to be contrary to the stipulations of the award "". The parties thereupon applied to the Tribunal, which granted a writ of execution of the award, and the Ecuadorian Confederation of Labour moved the Council of State to intervene, in order to oblige the Municipality to give effect to the award. The Government maintains that the dispute was legally terminated by the award handed down on appeal by the Subdirector of Labour for the Coastal Region, in which he ordered an immediate resumption of work by the strikers and payment of wages by the Municipality for the strike period.
.To sum up, the salient facts of this case are as follows : non-performance by the Municipality of an agreement entered into with the public service employees ; dismissal of certain employees ; declaration of a strike ; mediation by the Ministry of Social Security and Labour and intervention of the Conciliation and Arbitration Tribunal and the Subdirector of Labour for the Coastal Region, who issued an award on the appeal ; non-compliance with the award by the Municipality ; further mass dismissals ; resumption of the strike, and intervention of the Tribunal and the Council of State to secure the enforcement of the award.Allegations relating to the Prohibition of Strikes in Public Services
.The Committee observes that complaint is made, in the first place, of the clause in the award which lays down that the workers involved in the dispute, being employed in public services, do not have the right to resort to strikes, pursuant to the principle enunciated in paragraph  of article  (i) of the Political Constitution.
.The Committee has, on many occasions, expressed the view that the right of workers and their organisations to strike as a legitimate means of defence of their occupational interests is generally recognised. This general principle, however, as the Committee has observed in several earlier cases, may be restricted both in what are deemed to be essential services and in the civil service. The Committee has stressed the importance it attaches in such cases to the existence of machinery for the peaceful settlement of such disputes, in order that the workers thus deprived of so essential a means of defending occupational interests as legal strike action may be assured of adequate safeguards. The Committee has also held that although a strike may be temporarily restricted by law until existing facilities for negotiation, conciliation and arbitration can be brought to bear, such limitation or counteraction should be accompanied by adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration proceedings in which the parties concerned can take part at every stage and that "" where the law places restrictions on the exercise of the right to strike, appropriate guarantees should be afforded to the workers concerned in the form of adequate procedures for the peaceful settlement of disputes "".
.The Committee, while considering that it is not competent to interpret a Constitutional provision, observes that in the present case the problem depends on the application of article  (i) of the Political Constitution of Ecuador. This article lays down in fine that "" employees of public works and institutions of public service may not go on strike, except in accordance with special rules "". These rules have not yet been promulgated. It was on these premises that the Subdirector of Labour decided that workers in public services could not have recourse to strike.
.The complainants, on the other hand, affirm that, according to the Constitution, "" the right of public service workers to strike shall be covered by special rules "". As these rules have not been promulgated, they consider that the right to strike is entirely unrestricted.
.The situation is, therefore, that there is a difference of opinion as to the legal effect of the fact that the regulations provided for in the Constitution have not been issued, but that, in this instance, the workers involved in the dispute, whose right to strike was denied by the authorities, did in fact enjoy appropriate guarantees in the sense that they were able to have recourse to conciliation and arbitration machinery which recognised the justification, for the greater part, of the workers' demands.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.Allegations relating to Dismissals for the Purpose of Restricting the Right to Strike
.The complainants also criticise the decision of the Municipality to dismiss the , employees involved in the strike. The complainants consider that these were abusive dismissals, with the intention of restricting the exercise of the right to strike. The Government states that, by refusing to reinstate the workers who took part in this action, the Municipality has acted in a manner "" clearly contrary to the stipulations of the award "" of the Subdirector of Labour.",-1,1958,Ecuador

100,"the matter, an international organisation of employers or workers having consultative status with the I.L.O, or another international organisation of employers or workers where the allegations relate to matters directly affecting its affiliated organisations. In the present case, the Trade Unions International of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur Workers, the original complainant, is an international organisation which has no consultative status with the I.L.O, nor is there any evidence to indicate that the Argentine organisation to which reference is made in the allegations is affiliated to it.

101,".By a communication dated  April , which was sent directly to the I.L.O, the association known as ""Fraternity"" (Association of Railway Engine Staff), Buenos Aires, lodged a complaint of infringement of trade union rights in Argentina. This complaint was forwarded to the Government by a letter dated  May , for observations.
.No observations having been received from the Government the Committee decided at its nd Session (Geneva, May ) to adjourn consideration of the case to its next session, a decision of which the Government was notified by a letter dated  June .
.The Government forwarded its reply under cover of a communication dated  September .
.Argentina has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), but it has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ).
.The "" Fraternity "" complaint is concerned with the mobilisation of the railwaymen under a decree of  November  and with the consequences of this enactment for railway employees. The complaining organisation gives the following description of what happened.
.In November  negotiations were begun between the Railwaymen's Federation, represented by its two constituent organisations, the Railway Union and "" Fraternity "", and the Argentine State Railways Corporation, regarding the payment of back pay as the result of an agreement whereby the railwaymen had been granted a wage increase with retroactive effect. While the workers were demanding immediate and outright payment of the arrears, the Corporation desired to discharge its debt by means of bi-monthly instalments. Owing to the progress of inflation and the falling off in the purchasing power of money which it entailed, the workers did not feel in a position to accept the method which the Corporation desired to impose on them and in protest against the unbending attitude of the Argentine State Railways and in the hope of making their opinions prevail, the railwaymen's unions launched a series of partial stoppages.
.In reply to this strike movement, the Government issued a Decree, No. / dated  November , calling to the Colours the entire staff of the railways and at the same time placing the Railway Union under the control of a military administrator.
.For its part, ""Fraternity"" had issued a strike call to its membership as a result of the mobilisation decree, but cancelled the strike call after receiving a promise from the civilian and military authorities that it would not be affected as a union, in spite of the provisions of the mobilisation decree. Despite this promise, the complainants allege, and despite a provision in a later enactment (Decree No. /) granting "" Fraternity "" trade union freedom, the military authorities in control of the railways are ignoring "" Fraternity "" and continuing their authoritarian management of railway affairs.
.In its reply, the Government begins by stating that as soon as it came to power it endeavoured to restore the ailing economy to health and with that aim in view to set up a system that would make for sound labour-management relations and open an era of industrial peace. To this end the Industrial Associations Act (No. ) was promulgated and in addition the Government took steps to safeguard the rights of the workers by all the Constitutional and administrative means at its command.
.The fact remains, the Government states, that a series of scattered movements, prompted for the most part by political considerations, broke out in Argentina with the object of upsetting the established machinery of Government and obstructing the authorities in the discharge of their Constitutional functions. The country was swept by a wave of strikes launched for reasons other than the defence or furtherance of the workers' interests. The Government quotes several examples of strikes of this nature, which it qualifies as "" insurrection strikes "".
.As regards the appointment of military controllers for certain trade unions, the Government states that this is a normal consequence of the proclamation of a state of emergency. It further points out that only  out of a total of  were placed under military control and that of those  the majority were without leaders at the time the action was taken. In the same way, the Government adds, suspension of trade union activities is a logical and lawful consequence of mobilisation. The Government states that both the High Court judges and the federal Court of Appeal have ruled-in actions brought by certain mobilised railwaymen-that the Government was within the Constitutional rights vested in it in taking the action it did.
.Summing up its general observations the Government declares that it could not impair the right of the trade unions to strike, since this right is expressly guaranteed in article bis of the National Constitution. Naturally, the Government adds, this right, like any other, must be exercised in accordance with the laws that govern it.
.The Government then replies one by one to the specific allegations made by the complaining organisation.
.The complainants allege that the mobilisation of the railwaymen had the effect of postponing sine die the conclusion of discussions on the agreement concerning the salary scale (see paragraph  above), at a stage when the date of its coming into force, among other matters, remained to be determined. In reply to this allegation the Government states that the State Railways Corporation agreed outright to the workers' demand for a retroactive wage increase. This increase, the Government notes, corresponded to a rise of  per cent over the rates of pay applicable on  February , and involved a payment by the Corporation of , million Argentine pesos. There was no adjournment of the negotiations, since the agreement had been accepted ; any delay that resulted was brought about by the workers' refusal to accept the method of payment by instalments which the Corporation suggested.
.The complainants further allege that all questions concerning staff trade union problems were brought to a standstill in all the railway administrations as a result of mobilisation. The Government does not dispute this fact, and explains it by pointing out that, since the workers had come under military authority and become an integral part of the army by reason of their mobilisation, they no longer enjoyed trade union rights and were subject to military discipline alone.
.The Government's reply to the allegations that negotiations for an emergency pay increase based on the sharp rise in the cost of living had been brought to a standstill, is that the dispute was not about the wage increase as such, but rather about the way in which the increase was to be paid, as stated above. Moreover, it would have been beyond the Corporation's powers to lay its hands on a sum of , million Argentine pesos within a month as the workers were then demanding, and as they had continued to demand ever since.
.The complainants contend that the closure of trade union premises, which are under military guard, prevents the holding of trade union meetings and regional congresses. While recognising that certain trade union premises were shut down when it was considered necessary to do so, the Government states that the complaining organisation has not been placed under military control and that the mobilisation order did not have the effect of hampering this organisation's activities, so long as those activities did not infringe the provisions of the mobilisation decree.
.According to the complainants, elections to the management and executive organs of the trade union have had to be adjourned, together with the election of representatives on the General Directorate of Social Assistance and Welfare for the Railways, the Directorate of the Railway Superannuation Fund, the Directorate of the Argentine Railways Corporation and the Central Confederation Committee. The Government's answer is that suspension of the exercise of trade union rights is a consequence of mobilisation. It explains that mobilisation does not entail the abolition of those rights, but merely suspends the exercise thereof to a certain degree.
.The complainants allege that sentences of imprisonment ranging from a few days to more than a year have been passed on more than  persons of "" Fraternity "". These sentences, which are served in army or in other disciplinary units, are said to have been imposed for infringements of military regulations. In its reply, the Government points out that the mobilised workers were under military discipline and that any breach of such discipline carries the punishments duly laid down in the Code o?Military Law.
.Lastly, it is stated by the complainants that mobilisation has brought with it a proliferation of typical military orders, which are incompatible with the agreement on the wage scale and with the regulations and laws presiding over labour-management relations on the railways. The complainants' assertion is that these measures spell the loss of the railwaymen's hard-won rights and gains over a period of many years. The Government does not deny that such measures have been taken, for they follow logically from mobilisation. It does, on the other hand, deny that they imply the loss or suspension of rights derived from agreements on",-1,1959,Argentina
102,"wages or other occupational questions.
.In conclusion, the Government states that the most convincing evidence of the respect it professes for workers' rights is the fact that it has repealed the temporary mobilisation measures. Decree No.  of  June  demobilised the railwaymen and the situation throughout the trade union movement has again returned to normal.
.The Committee has already examined in an earlier case t a complaint relating to the same mobilisation of workers on the Argentine railways. The facts then alleged were similar and the Government's reply was, to all intents and purposes, identical with that submitted in the present case.
.On that occasion the Committee found that the mobilisation of the workers concerned resulted in their becoming subject to the provisions of the Military Code and to the administrative disciplinary regulations. It further noted that, although the measure adopted by the Argentine Government was not designed to curtail trade union rights as such but was intended to cope with the emergency created by the railway strike, in practice these rights were nevertheless affected.
.It considered on that occasion that there did not appear to have existed a state of acute national emergency such as the Committee had observed in a case involving the United States, in which it had had to deal with a seizure of the railroads, which had been placed under army control, and in which it had found that the case did not call for further examination only after observing that the seizure in question did not constitute an arbitrary measure, but was essentially dictated by considerations of public interest in a national emergency situation, since it was a question of guaranteeing despatch of supplies and munitions to the United Nations forces in Korea and since the measure had been taken only after exhaustion of all other methods of settlement of the dispute provided by law.
.Accordingly, when examining the previous case mentioned above relating to the mobilisation of Argentine railwaymen, the Committee recommended the Governing Body to draw the attention of the Government to the possibility of abuse involved in the mobilisation of workers in industrial disputes and to emphasise the undesirability of recourse to such measures, except for the purpose of maintaining essential services in circumstances of the utmost gravity.
.As the circumstances in the present case are the same as those in the case on which the Committee made the recommendation set out in the previous paragraph, the Committee considers it appropriate to come to the same conclusion.
.With respect to the placing of certain trade unions under military control, the Committee had to inquire into a similar situation in the Argentine case to which reference has been made above (Case No. ), as well as in Case No. , also relating to Argentina.) On that occasion the Committee recommended the Governing Body to draw the attention of the Government to the importance which it attaches to the generally accepted principle that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict the right of workers' organisations to elect their representatives in full freedom and to organise their administration and activities.
.As the Committee is confronted with a similar situation in the present case, it considers it appropriate to make the same recommendation to the Governing Body.
.As for the sentences imposed on certain mobilised workers, it appears from the explanation afforded by the Government that these measures result from the application of the Military Code to which the persons concerned were subject by virtue of the mobilisation order and the proclamation of a state of emergency.
.In many cases in which the Committee has had before it complaints regarding alleged violation of freedom of association under emergency or special legislation, or under a State Security Act, the Committee-while stating that it was not called upon to give an opinion on the necessity or desirability of such legislation, which is a purely political matter-has consistently maintained that it must examine any repercussions that this legislation might have on trade union rights.
.In the present case the Committee observes-as it did in Case No.  mentioned above-that a certain number of mobilised workers have, as the Government itself admits, been sentenced pursuant to legislation which can be assimilated to emergency legislation.
.In these circumstances, the Committee, as it has done in several previous cases, recommends the Governing Body to express the hope that the Government, desirous of seeing labour relations develop in an atmosphere of mutual confidence, will have recourse, when dealing with situations resulting from strikes or lockouts, to measures provided under common law rather than to emergency measures, which involve a danger by reason of their very nature of certain restrictions being placed on fundamental rights.
.The Committee notes with satisfaction the Government's statement to the effect that the order mobilising railwaymen has been rescinded, thereby enabling the trade unions to resume their normal activities. For this reason, and subject to the foregoing observations, it recommends the Governing Body to decide that no useful purpose would be served by a further examination of the case.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the attention of the Government, with respect to the mobilisation of the railwaymen, to the fact that the mobilisation of workers in industrial disputes is inconsistent with the exercise of trade union rights ;(b) to draw the attention of the Government, with respect to the placing of certain unions under military control, to the importance which it attaches to the principle that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict the right of workers' organisations to elect their representatives in full freedom and to organise their administration and activities ;(c) to express the hope, with respect to the sentences passed on certain mobilised workers, that the Government, desirous of seeing labour relations develop in an atmosphere of mutual confidence, will have recourse, when dealing with situations resulting from strikes or lockouts, to measures provided under common law rather than to emergency measures which involve a danger by reason of their very nature of certain restrictions being placed on fundamental right;(d) to take note with satisfaction of the Government's statement to the effect that the order mobilising the railwaymen has been rescinded, thereby enabling the trade unions to resume their normal activities, and for this reason to decide-subject to the observations in subparagraphs (a), (b) and (c) above-that no useful purpose would be served by further consideration of this case.",-1,1959,Argentina

These recommendations, which may be found in paragraph  (a) and (b) of the Committee's th Report, were approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (June ), so it will not be necessary to revert to them in this report.
.In addition, in a letter dated  July , the W.F.T.U had made allegations respecting the strike of banking and insurance employees, the ill-treatment of trade unionists in Magdalena Prison and the existence of concentration camps. The Committee did not conclude its examination of these allegations. The pages which follow will therefore be devoted entirely to these two series of allegations still outstanding.
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.As regards the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the attention of the Government to the importance of providing some procedure which will ensure peaceful settlement of industrial disputes involving civil servants so that these workers, who are deprived of an essential means of defending their professional interests such as a strike, may have appropriate guarantees in the form of impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration proceedings in which the parties concerned can take part at every stage;(b) to request the Government to be good enough to forward its observations to the Governing Body on the various allegations made by the complainants to the effect that the  banking employees' strike was marked by the requisition of trade union premises, the arrest of trade union leaders and mass dismissals, and to state what is the present situation so far as these aspects of the matter are concerned;(c) to take note of the present interim report with regard to the allegations referred to in subparagraph (b) above, and to the allegations relating to the ill-treatment of certain workers in prison and the existence of concentration camps, it being understood that the Committee will report further on these aspects of the case when it has received the additional information awaited from the Government.
.The original complaint of the W.F.T.U consisted of two communications dated  January and  February  respectively; it contained allegations concerning the strike of railway workers in November  and the breaking of that strike and the strike in the national refrigeration plant in January -subsequently developing into a general strike and the manner in which it was put down.
.When the Committee examined the case at its nd Session (May ) it had before it a communication from the Government dated  April  containing observations on the railwaymen's strike and another communication dated  May  which constituted a partial reply to the allegations concerning the strike in the refrigeration plant and in which the Government announced that it would forward its observations at a later date.
.The Committee submitted its recommendations to the Governing Body on the allegations relating to the railwaymen's strike in November  and to its repression in paragraphs  (a), (b) and (c) of its th Report. These recommendations were approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session (May-June ) and there will therefore be no further reference in this document to the allegations concerning this aspect of the case.
.The Committee adjourned its consideration of the allegations relating to the strike of workers in the refrigeration plant pending a full reply from the Government. The W.F.T.U in its letters of  and  November  furnished further material in support of these allegations and presented new allegations, while the Permanent Liaison Committee of the Unified Workers' Movement of Argentina lodged a further complaint on this matter. In its communication dated  June  the Government added to the observations it had made in its letter of  May .
.When the case was examined again at its th Session (November ) the Committee submitted its final recommendation to the Governing Body concerning some of the allegations which had remained in abeyance, namely the allegations relating to the strike of workers in the national refrigeration plant and the allegations relating to the mobilisation of petroleum workers, railwaymen and transport workers. These recommendations, which appeared in paragraph  (a) and (b) of the Committee's th Report, were approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ); these matters will not be reopened in the present document, which deals only with the allegations which are still outstanding.
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. , and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.As regards the case as a whole the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to decide, with regard to the allegations concerning the detention of trade union leaders, that, for the reasons given in paragraphs  to  above, it would serve no useful purpose to give further consideration to this aspect of the case;(b) to decide that the allegations concerning interference by the public authorities with trade union administration do not, for the reasons indicated in paragraphs  to  above, call for further examination;(c) with regard to the allegations concerning the strike of banking and insurance employees, to request the Government to be good enough to present its observations thereon, giving the grounds on which it declared the strike in question illegal;(d) to take note of the present interim report with regard to allegations of maltreatment of certain workers in custody and the existence of concentration camps to which certain trade unionists are said to have been sent, it being understood that the Committee will report further on these aspects of the case when it has received the further information on the subject promised by the Government.
.The original complaint of the W.F.T.U is contained in two communications, the first dated  January  and the second  February ; they contain allegations relating to the strike of railway workers which took place in November  and that of the workers of the national refrigeration plant, which subsequently developed into a general strike, in January  and the manner in which they were repressed.
.When the Committee examined the case at its meeting in May , it had before it a communication from the Government, dated  April , which contained observations on the railway workers' strike, and a further communication, dated  May , which replied in part to the allegations concerning the strike of the workers at the refrigeration plant and stated that the Government would forward its further observations at a later date.
.In the circumstances the Committee submitted its recommendations on the allegations relating to the strike of railway workers in November , and the manner in which it was refused, to the Governing Body; these recommendations, contained in its th Report, paragraph  (a), (b) and (c), were approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session (May-June ). Consequently, these allegations will not be taken into consideration in the present report.
.At the same time, the Committee deferred consideration of the allegations concerning the strike of the workers in the refrigeration plant pending receipt of the full reply of the Government. In letters dated  July and  November  the W.F.T.U submitted further information on these allegations, together with new allegations; at the same time the Permanent Liaison Committee of the Unified Workers' Movement of Argentina submitted a further complaint. In a communication dated  June  the Government submitted observations supplementary to those supplied earlier in its letter of  May . The present document is concerned exclusively with the allegations still before the Committee.
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the attention of the Government to the recommendations approved by the Governing Body when it adopted paragraph  (c) of the Committee's th Report and paragraph  (a) and (b) of the Committee's th Report, and to reaffirm the importance which it attaches to the principle, embodied in Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), ratified by the Argentine Republic, that workers' organisations should have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom and to organise their administration and activities and that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof;(b) to note the reference in the Government's letter of  June  to the statement by the President of the Republic of  December  that the Executive had every intention of bringing all such "" interventions "" to an end as soon as possible, and to return the",-1,1959,Argentina

.By a communication dated  January  addressed directly to the I.L.O, the World Federation of Trade Unions submitted a complaint containing allegations of infringements of the exercise of trade union rights in the Argentine Republic. The complaint was transmitted to the Government, for its observations, by a letter dated  January .
.At its st Session (Geneva, February ), the Committee decided, as it had not received the Government's observations, to adjourn its examination of the case until its next session. The Government was informed of this decision by a letter dated  March .
.The complaining organisation forwarded further information in substantiation of its complaint by a communication dated  February . This further information was transmitted to the Government by a letter dated  March .
.The Government replied by a communication dated  April .
.The Argentine Republic has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), but has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ).
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the attention of the Government, with respect to the mobilisation of the railwaymen, to the fact that trade union rights may be endangered by the mobilisation of workers in industrial disputes and to emphasise the undesirability of recourse to such measures except for the purpose of maintaining essential services in circumstances of the utmost gravity ;(b) to express the hope, with respect to the allegations relating to the prosecution and arrest of organised workers, that the Government, desiring to see labour relations develop in an atmosphere of mutual confidence, will have recourse, when dealing with situations resulting from strikes and lockouts, to measures provided under common law rather than to emergency measures, which involve a danger by reason of their very nature of certain restrictions being placed on fundamental rights;(c) to draw the attention of the Government, with respect to the appointment of military administrators in the case of the Railwaymen's Union and of certain of its locals, to the importance which it attaches to the generally accepted principle that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict the right of workers' organisations to elect their representatives in full freedom and to organise their administration and activities.(d) to take note of the present interim report with respect to the allegations relating to the strike of state refrigeration workers, which became general, and to its repression, it being understood that the Committee will report further thereon when it has received the further information promised by the Government.",-1,1959,Argentina
105,".By a communication dated  November  addressed directly to the I.L.O, the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions presented a complaint of alleged infringements of freedom of association against the Government of the Republic of Haiti.
.As this complaint alleges that a person was arrested, it was dealt with in accordance with the urgency procedure established in respect of such cases by a decision of the Governing Body in November  (th Session).
.In accordance with that procedure, the Director-General, by a letter dated  November , brought the text of the complaint to the notice of the Government, requesting the Government to forward its observations thereon as a matter of urgency.
.The Government of Haiti replied by a communication dated  December .
.In the meantime, the complaining organisation addressed to the Director-General a letter dated  December , by which it implicitly withdraws the complaint.
.In its original communication dated  November , the I.F.C.T.U alleged that Mr. Lonville Leblanc, President of the Federation of Christian Workers of Haiti and a participant at the I.F.C.T.UJI.L.O. Seminar in Quito, had been arrested when he returned to Port-au-Prince. In a later communication dated  December , the complainants, while maintaining reservations as to the restrictions stated to be imposed on trade unions in Haiti, declare that they have had news of the liberation of Mr. Leblanc and indicate that, as the facts complained of no longer subsist, their complaint has now become purposeless.
.The questions raised by the withdrawal of a complaint have been examined in earlier cases by the Committee. In Case No.  relating to Greece, the Committee expressed the view that the desire shown by a complaining organisation to withdraw its complaint, while constituting a factor to which the greatest attention must be paid, is not, however, in itself sufficient reason for the Committee to cease automatically to proceed with the examination of the complaint. The Committee considered in that case, having regard to conclusions adopted earlier by the Governing Body, that it is free to evaluate the reasons given to explain the withdrawal of a complaint and to investigate whether these appear sufficiently plausible to lead one to believe that the withdrawal was made in complete independence. The Committee observed that cases might exist in which the withdrawal of a complaint by the organisation presenting it would be a result not of the fact that the complaint had become without purpose but of pressure exercised by the government against the complainants, the latter being threatened with an aggravation of the situation if they did not consent to this withdrawal.
.In the present case, the reason given by the complainants for their desire that the Committee should not examine the complaint further is that the person who was arrested has since been liberated. It would seem therefore that the grievances which gave rise to the complaint no longer subsist.
.This fact is corroborated by the statements of the Government, which declares, in its reply dated  December , that Mr. Leblanc was arrested not by reason of his trade union activities but on suspicion of having, in contravention of the law of Haiti, transported private letters emanating from abroad. When the investigation revealed, however, that there were no grounds for this suspicion, the person concerned was immediately liberated.
.In these circumstances, having regard to the statements both of the complainants and of the Government, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that there is no ground for pursuing the matter further.",-1,1959,Haiti

.At its meeting in May  the Committee further examined this case, considering the sole allegation which remained outstanding, namely the alleged refusal by the management of the National Bank to comply with certain court orders in respect of the trade union leader Mr. Ral Ignacio Robacio, and made the following recommendation to the Governing Body (paragraph  of its nd Report, approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session in June )In consequence the Committee recommends the Governing Body to ask the Government specifically whether the Labour Court of Appeal, before giving its final judgment, ordered the Bank not to proceed with Mr. Robacio's posting until such judgment was pronounced.

.The allegation still outstanding concerns the posting by the management of the National Bank of Mr. Ral Ignacio Robacio, General Secretary of the Buenos Aires Bank Employees' Union (S.E.B.B.A.), to a branch  kilometres away from Buenos Aires - this is said to be a measure of anti-union discrimination - while at the same time an administrative charge was initiated against him designed to convert this posting into an outright dismissal.
.The LF.C.T.U stated that the S.E.B.B.A then applied to the judge for an injunction to prevent any modification in Mr. Robacio's position until judgment had been given in a lawsuit brought by the union. Although the judge granted this injunction, the Bank refused to comply with it, despite a further sentence by the same judge against the Chairman of the Bank for contempt of court. The Bank authorities having appealed against the labour judge's decision, the Labour Court of Appeal on  April  affirmed the interlocutory injunction granted by the judge. The National Bank refused to comply with this order also. These statements of the I.F.C.T.U have been supported by the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions of Salaried Employees, Technicians, Supervisors and Commercial Travellers.
.Having noted that the Government in its reply had refrained from making any comment on this point, the Committee took the view at its th Session (May ) that it would be advisable to adjourn examination of this particular aspect of the case pending receipt of information from the Government, and it made a recommendation to the Governing Body to this effect.
.The Committee's conclusions as adopted by the Governing Body, and in particular the request for information on the matters mentioned above, were brought to the notice of the Government by a letter from the Director-General dated  July .
.The Government replied by a communication dated  September . This reply, however, still contained no information on the points referred to above.
.In these circumstances the Committee at its th Session (November ) recommended the Governing Body to request the Government once again to furnish information in respect of the allegations to the effect that the management of the National Bank had not complied with the injunction granted by the labour judge, and subsequently affirmed by the Labour Court of Appeal, relating to the situation of the General Secretary of the S.E.B.B.A.
.In a communication dated  November  the Government forwarded further information concerning the allegation.
.In its communication dated  November  the Government stated that Mr. Ral Ignacio Robacio's posting was a normal one for which provision was made in the statutory regulations governing public employees, and that in any case Mr. Robacio had not accepted his posting and had refused to take up the new duties assigned to him. The Government added that Mr. Robacio had then lodged an appeal for protection with the sitting labour judge, who ordered the Bank not to proceed with the posting, but the Bank had refused to acknowledge the competence of the labour court and lodged an appeal to have the decision quashed. The Labour Court of Appeal-continued the Government-had affirmed the decision in that the court was competent to hear the case, but quashed the judge's decision in favour of protection. The Government concluded by stating that Mr. Robacio had open to him all legal avenues for establishing his rights, "" which proved the existence of effective legal guarantees such as characterise a system of justice "".
.The Committee observed at its th (February ) Session that the complainants' statements and those of the Government were not in themselves contradictory with each other. The Committee also observed, however, that while the Government confirmed the complainants' statement to the effect that when Mr. Robacio had appealed to the labour judge for protection the latter had ordered the Bank not to proceed, and that later the Labour Court of Appeal had affirmed the decision as to the competence of the court to hear the case, it made no reference to the contempt of court, alleged by the complainants to have been committed by the National Bank in declining to accept the rulings of the labour judge and of the Labour Court of Appeal that it should not go forward with Mr. Robacio's posting.
.In these circumstances the Committee considered that it was essential, if it was to reach a decision on this aspect of the case, for it to know whether it was correct-as the complainants alleged-that the National Bank had on a number of occasions flouted the decisions of the judicial authorities and, if so, what measures had been taken by the Government in this respect.
.Furthermore, the Committee felt that it would be difficult for it to take a decision without knowing the exact circumstances surrounding this particular allegation, and to this end it would be advisable, in accordance with its usual practice, to request the Government to forward copies of the judgments, together with all the conclusions of law and findings of fact given in this connection by the judge of first instance and the Labour Court of Appeal, instead of a summary of the dispositive part of these judgments such as the Government had given in its communication of  November .
.In its communication of  April  the Government repeats what it stated in its communication of  November  and adds that "" it should be borne in mind that under Argentine law the lodging of an appeal in protection cases has a suspensive effect, whereby in virtue of the appeal by the President of the Argentine National Bank against the ruling of the judge of first instance the proceedings remained in a state of suspense until the Labour Court of Appeal pronounced its final judgment quashing the decision of the judge of first instance in favour of protection "". The Government adds that this procedural formula does not imply, "" as the complainants mistakenly claim, a refusal to bow to the authority of the judge of first instance "".
.The Committee observed at its preceding session (May ) that in its communication of  April the Government had affirmed that under Argentine law the lodging of an appeal in protection cases has a suspensive effect, and that in consequence there was a stay of execution of the ruling of the judge of first instance in the case in question until the Labour Court of Appeal pronounced its final judgment. The Committee also observed, however, that the complainants had alleged that the injunction not to proceed with Mr. Robacio's posting was granted in the first place by the judge of first instance and subsequently ( April ) affirmed by the Labour Court of Appeal. Noting that the Government, in its various communications, had never expressly denied that the Labour Court of Appeal-as alleged by the complainants-ordered the Bank not to proceed with Mr. Robacio's posting until final judgment was pronounced, the Committee felt that if it was to come to a decision in full awareness of the facts on this aspect of the complaint it would be helpful to have this point cleared up by the Argentine Government. Accordingly, it recommended the Governing Body to ask the Government specifically whether the Labour Court of Appeal, before giving its final judgment, ordered the Bank not to proceed with Mr. Robacio's posting until such judgment was pronounced.
.In its reply of  July  the Government states that at no stage did the Labour Court of Appeal issue an order not to proceed with Mr. Robacio's posting. Furthermore the Government repeats a number of minor points figuring in its previous statements, to the effect that the complainants confuse the machinery of appeal with suspensive effect and an alleged refusal to comply, which never occurred.
.The Committee notes the Government's statement that the",-1,1960,Argentina
108,"Labour Court of Appeal at no time issued an order not to proceed with Mr. Robacio's posting; it would appear to follow from this answer that the National Bank did not refuse to comply with any decision by the Labour Court of Appeal, since the said Court did not issue an order "" not to proceed "" but did issue a decision by which-because it considered the application for protection to have been unfounded-it quashed the decision of the labour judge. It would seem, moreover, that Mr. Robacio had open to him all legal means of establishing his rights and that accordingly there is no further object in proceeding with this aspect of the case.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that the outstanding allegation relating to refusal by the National Bank to comply with certain court orders does not call for further examination.
.The Committee had already examined this case at its th Session (May ), and, with the exception of one allegation by the complainants, submitted its final conclusions to the Governing Body concerning the case as a whole. These conclusions were adopted by the Governing Body at its th Session (June ).
.At its th Session (February ) the Committee concerned itself once again with this case to discuss the sole allegation which remained outstanding, namely the alleged refusal by the management of the National Bank to comply with certain court orders in respect of the trade union leader Mr. Ral Ignacio Robacio, and made the following recommendation to the Governing Body (paragraph  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its st Session (March )):
.In consequence the Committee recommends the Governing Body to request the Government to furnish as early as possible information concerning the allegations to the effect that the management of the National Bank has on a number of occasions flouted the decision of the judicial authorities and, if this is the case, on the measures that the Government has taken in this connection, as well as copies of the judgments, together with all the conclusions of law and findings of fact, given by the judge of first instance and, in particular, the Labour Court of Appeal.
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.By a communication dated  April  the Government has sent certain additional information in relation to this allegation.
.The allegation still outstanding concerns the posting by the management of the National Bank of Mr. Ral Ignacio Robacio, General Secretary of the Buenos Aires Bank Employees' Union (S.E.B.B.A.), to a branch  kilometres away from Buenos Aires-this is said to be a measure of anti-union discrimination-while at the same time an administrative charge was initiated against him designed to convert this posting into an outright dismissal.
.The complainants stated that the S.E.B.B.A then applied to the judge for an injunction to prevent any modification in Mr. Robacio's position until judgment had been given in a lawsuit brought by the union. Although the judge granted this injunction, the Bank refused to comply with it, despite a further sentence by the same judge against the Chairman of the Bank for contempt of court. The Bank authorities having appealed against the labour judge's decision, the Labour Court of Appeal on  April  affirmed the interlocutory injunction granted by the judge. The National Bank refused to comply with this order also.
.Having noted that the Government in its reply had refrained from making any comment on this point, the Committee took the view at its th Session (May ) that it would be advisable to adjourn examination of this particular aspect of the case pending receipt of information from the Government, and it made a recommendation to the Governing Body to this effect)

.The Committee already considered this case at its th Session (May ) and, except for one allegation by the complainants, it submitted its final conclusions regarding the whole case to the Governing Body. These conclusions were adopted by the Governing Body at its th Session (June ).
.This is not the first time that the Committee has had to examine the consequences of the distinction made in Argentine legislation between organisations with trade union status and others. Nor is it the first time that the Argentine Government has disputed the validity of conclusions reached by the Committee and the Governing Body in this connection. It would, therefore, seem essential to state the exact position of the Committee and the Governing Body in regard to this matter.
.The Government's comments would seem to indicate that it believes the Committee's and the Governing Body's remarks to relate essentially to the fact that certain particular privileges are granted only to the most representative organisations. This was not in fact the position adopted either by the Committee or by the Governing Body.
.On several occasions, and particularly during discussion on the draft of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Conference referred to the question of the representative character of trade unions, and, to a certain extent, it agreed to the distinction sometimes made between the various unions concerned according to how representative they are. Article , paragraph , of the Constitution of the I.L.O states the concept of "" most representative "" organisations.
.Thus, the mere fact that the law of a country draws a distinction between the most representative trade union organisations and other trade union organisations is not in itself a matter for criticism, provided that such distinction does not accord to the most representative organisation privileges extending beyond the privilege of priority, on the ground of its having the largest membership, in representation for such purposes as collective bargaining or consultation by governments or for the purpose of nominating delegates to international bodies. In other words, this distinction should not have the effect of depriving trade union organisations not recognised as being among the most representative of the essential means whereby they may defend the occupational interests of their members, organise their administration and activities and formulate their programmes, as provided for in the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Argentina.
.In this respect",-1,1960,Argentina
110,"the Government's reply to the Committee's and the Governing Body's conclusions concerning the section of the Committee's report quoted in paragraph  above states that the fact that an association does not enjoy trade union status does not prevent it apart from the right to participate in collective bargaining-from fulfilling its functions of defending the workers' occupational interests and pursuing its economic, cultural and sporting and other activities perfectly normally. In the Government's opinion, Act No.  does not confer any "" privileged status "" on associations having trade union status nor is it correct that it "" limits considerably the field of action of organisations which do not have this status ""; similarly, it is stated that it would be wrong to suggest that the system of law in Argentina "" can indirectly affect the right of workers to join the organisations of their own choosing "".
.At this stage reference should be made to the text of the Act itself. The consequences of the distinction drawn between organisations which respectively have or have not trade union personality would appear to be determined in sections  and , defining the functions and rights of these two classes of organisations. Section  provides that the rights and functions listed shall be enjoyed exclusively by organisations having trade union status. The rights thus granted under section  only to organisations having such status include: participation in the work of the public bodies concerned with the regulation of labour and social security; collective bargaining and concluding collective agreements; collaborating with the State in a technical and advisory capacity in the study and solution of problems of concern to the occupation that they represent; holding meetings without obtaining prior permission; defending and representing the individual interests of members vis--vis the social security institutions, courts of law and other public bodies; and the defence and representation of the occupational interests of employees vis--vis the State and the employers. Although the last of the above-mentioned rights is also granted to ordinary organisations, section  states that such organisations shall enjoy these rights only provided that there is no organisation with trade union status for the particular occupational category.
.Among the activities in which ordinary organisations may engage, section  mentions the establishment of provident institutions, holiday camps, canteens, hospitals and the like, the formation of co-operatives of producers and consumers, the promotion of general and vocational education by means of libraries, schools and so on.
.It cannot be disputed that the functions which organisations not having trade union status are allowed to fulfil in the field of trade union activities are exceedingly limited. Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Argentina, defines the term "" occupational organisation "" as meaning "" any organisation of workers or of employers for furthering and defending the interests of workers or of employers "". Examination of the Act would appear to indicate that ordinary organisations do not enjoy the means to achieve this end and that their scope of action is greatly restricted.
.The Committee and the Governing Body already arrived at the same conclusions when they examined Case No. , also concerning Argentina. In that instance, considering the limited functions open to ordinary organisations, the Committee felt that the distinction made in national legislation could have the indirect consequence of restricting the freedom of the workers to belong to the organisations of their own choosing.
.The reasons which led the Committee and the Governing Body to adopt this position are as follows. As a general rule, when a government can grant an advantage to one particular organisation or withdraw that advantage from one organisation in favour of another, there is a risk, even if such is not the government's intention, that one trade union will enjoy an unfair advantage or disadvantage in relation to the others, which thereby constitutes an act of discrimination. More precisely, by placing one organisation at an advantage or at a disadvantage in relation to the others, a government may either directly or indirectly influence the choice of workers regarding the organisation to which they intend to belong, since they will undeniably want to belong to the union best able to serve them, even if their natural preference would have led them to join another organisation for occupational, religious, political or other reasons. Thus, the freedom to choose is a right expressly laid down in Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), which Argentina has ratified.
.The Committee considers that the latest observations submitted by the Government do not add any new elements, with regard to the question as a whole, to the arguments which it presented earlier, and that, consequently, the Committee has no reason to modify its previous conclusions, as stated in paragraph  of its th Report, which, as stated above, were approved by the Governing Body.
.With regard to the case as a whole the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to request the Government once again, for the reasons stated in paragraphs  to  above, to furnish its observations at an early date in respect of the allegations to the effect that the management of the National Bank did not comply with the injunctions granted by the labour judge and subsequently affirmed by the court of appeal relating to the situation of the General Secretary of the Buenos Aires Bank Employees' Union;(b) to confirm, for the reasons stated in paragraphs  to  above, the conclusions contained in paragraph  (a), (b), (c) and (d) of the Committee's th Report, which are cited in paragraph  above;(c) to take note of the present interim report regarding the allegations still outstanding, it being understood that the Committee will report further thereon when it has received the information requested in subparagraph (a) above.
.The complaint of the I.F.C.T.U is contained in a communication dated  April , which was followed up by two further communications dated  May and  June . By a communication dated  June  the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions of Salaried Employees, Technicians, Supervisors and Commercial Travellers informed the Director-General of their desire to support the complaint of the I.F.C.T.U. The Government submitted its observations on the various communications of the I.F.C.T.U in a letter dated  February .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants allege that on  December  the Buenos Aires Bank Employees' Union (S.E.B.B.A) requested the Minister of Labour to grant it the status of an incorporated trade union ("" trade union personality ""); on the basis of a provision in Act No. , the Minister rejected this request, on the grounds that the union had not been in existence for six months at the date of the application. Representations by the I.F.C.T.U requesting the Government to review its decision remained unanswered.
.In the meantime, on  January , a dispute broke out at the National Bank as a consequence of the dispatch by the head office of a confidential circular (the text of which has been supplied by the complainants) forbidding employees to engage in any trade union activity, and a subsequent interview with the trade union officials of the Boedo branch to notify them of this order and announce possible disciplinary penalties.
.Representatives of the S.E.B.B.A thereupon presented themselves on  February at the Directorate-General of Labour Relations, the competent authority, with the request that a conciliation meeting be convened. This authority, it is alleged, after having verbally stated that it could not reply favourably to this request on account of the fact that the S.E.B.B.A did not possess "" trade union personality "", allowed the normal waiting period to elapse without taking any action. An appeal to the Minister of Labour also remained without effect.
.On  March  the S.E.B.B.A brought a lawsuit against the National Bank and the Minister of Labour for violation of the new article  of the National Constitution concerning the right of workers to organise freely and democratically in trade unions and asked the Government to act in accordance with Act No. , which ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ). On  April  the labour judge, after verifying the facts alleged at the National Bank, sent letters to the Chairman of the Bank and to the Minister of Labour to inquire into the reasons for these infringements of trade union freedom. Three hours after the judge's visit to the National Bank, the Bank authorities are said to have decided to post the General Secretary of the S.E.B.B.A local, Mr. Ral Ignacio Robaccio, to a branch situated  kilometres away from Buenos Aires, and at the same time initiated an administrative charge against him designed to convert this posting into an outright dismissal.
.The S.E.B.B.A",-1,1960,Argentina
111,".In a letter dated  January , supplemented by another dated  February , the P.T.T.I placed before the I.L.O a complaint to the effect that the exercise of trade union rights had been infringed in the Argentine Republic. This complaint was communicated to the Government by letter dated  March .
.At the th Session (May ) of the Committee, as the Government had not yet sent any observations, it was decided to defer examination of the case until the next session. The Government was informed of this decision by letter dated  May .
.At the th Session (November ) the Government's reply, dated  October , was placed before the Committee. However, the reply having arrived too late for the Committee to be able to study it in a satisfactory manner, it was decided that the case as a whole should be deferred until the following session.
.At the th Session (February ) the Committee took note of a letter from the Government, dated  February , announcing that supplementary observations on this case were being sent. It therefore decided to defer examination until these observations should be in its hands.
.The Government transmitted the said observations in a letter dated  June .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants allege that, in connection with a dispute between the postal workers and the Argentine authorities, the latter took certain action incompatible with the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ). The particular allegations made by the complainants are discussed below. It may first be advisable to review the various stages of the dispute as described by the complainants, their version being in general in conformity with that given in the Government's reply (the additional information contained therein is inserted at the appropriate points).
.There was inflation in Argentina in , which hit the working class very hard. In June  the Federation of Postal and Telecommunications Workers (FOECYT), which has , members, started negotiations with the Government for a pay increase on the ground that the cost-of-living index had risen during the past year by approximately  per cent without any increase in the wages and salaries of communications workers.
.The offer made by the Government (an increase of  per cent.) was considered insufficient by the FOECYT, all the more so as it was coupled with a four-hour extension of the working week. As a protest, and in order to exercise pressure on the authorities, the Federation arranged a "" slow down "", then instructed its members to "" work to rule "" and, finally, called a strike on  December .
.The Government states in its observations that the members of the FOECYT are public service personnel whose right to strike is subject to certain restrictions; that by its attitude, and particularly by calling for a stoppage, the FOECYT acted contrary to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, No. ; and that the strike was therefore considered unlawful.
.On  January  the Minister issued a warning that disciplinary action would be taken if work did not return to normal within  hours. "" As the postal and telegraph workers "" (to quote the complainants' own words) "" took no notice of the Government's intervention "", repressive action was taken against a number of strikers.
.After an appeal ( January ) by members of the Senate, who offered their mediation on condition that the strike should end, work was resumed ( January ), and - still according to the complainants - the repressive action ceased (- January ).
.In its reply of  October  the Government states that the dispute was settled, an agreement satisfactory to the parties having, apparently, been reached with the only two associations of personnel which had official recognition as trade unions (personeria gremial), namely the Association of Telegraphists, Radio-Telegraphists and Similar Personnel and the National Civil Servants' Union, Branch  (the FOECYT did not have this recognition). The Government adds at the close of its memorandum that, although it was not a "" recognised "" union, the public authorities had sought as far as possible to meet the FOECYT's demands. This seems to be confirmed by the lengthy negotiations which took place.
.The course of events having been thus summarised it will now be appropriate to examine the particular allegations made by the P.T.T.I to the effect that the Argentine authorities committed grave infringements of freedom of association. These allegations are dealt with separately below.Allegations concerning the Arrest of Workers
.The P.T.T.I alleges, using rather vague terms, that an "" unknown number "" of postal and telegraph workers were imprisoned "" as trade unionists "". In its reply the Government states that no postal or telegraph workers were arrested "" by reason of their quality as trade unionists "". The Government does not deny that there were arrests; however, it declares that these were due exclusively to acts of violence or infringements of freedom to work and that in any case they were carried out "" in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations "".
.In previous cases in which the Committee has had to examine allegations concerning the arrest of trade union officers or members it has considered that the only question arising is the real ground for the arrests. Only if these were ordered because of trade union affiliation or activity properly so called could an infringement of freedom of association be held to have occurred.""
.In the present case, having regard on the one hand to the vagueness of the allegations and on the other hand to the Government's categorical statement that the arrests of certain trade unionists were due to acts of violence and the like, but not to the trade union status or activities of the persons concerned (indeed, the complaints do not even allege that they were due to participation in the strike), and having regard also to the statement of the complainants themselves that all the persons arrested have been released, the Committee, while reaffirming the importance that it attaches to the principle that public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict trade union rights or impede the lawful exercise thereof, recommends the Governing Body to decide that no useful purpose would be served by pursuing further the examination of this aspect of the case.Allegations concerning Dismissal of Strikers
.Without giving details, the complainants allege that an "" unknown number of postal and telegraph workers "" were dismissed. In its reply the Government states that no personnel was dismissed owing to the dispute; that the whole staff was reintegrated; and that the nine persons discontinued were temporary employees whose contracts had expired. The Government adds that it went so far as to re-engage a temporary worker, despite her misconduct in the service, because of special intervention by the union.
.Whereas the Government in its reply states categorically that there were no dismissals due to the dispute and that those members of the staff who appear to have been temporarily suspended were all reintegrated, the complainants make their allegation in the vaguest terms and adduce no single name or other specification in its support.
.In these circumstances the Committee considers that the complainants have not furnished proof that there was an infringement of freedom of association in this instance, and therefore recommends the Governing Body to decide that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.Allegations concerning Withholding of Wage Payments and Disciplinary Action
.The complainants allege in very general terms that some arrested or dismissed workers had received no pay since  January . They also state that disciplinary measures were taken against FOECYT trade unionists, but that they do not know to what extent.
.In its observations on this aspect of the case the Government declares that no employee failed to receive the normal pay of his grade and that no disciplinary action was taken. "" The fact "" it adds "" that the strikers were not paid for the days on which they did not work was strictly in conformity with Decree No.  of  November , a statutory measure which must be respected "".
.The Government goes on to state that the suspensions "" which certain employees attributed to their part in the strike "" were imposed in due application of section  of the Staff Regulations for the National Civil Service (Legislative Decree No. /) because of excessive unjustified absence. The Government adds that, in the calculation of absences in this connection, days on which employees were on strike were not included.
.In reply to the complainants' allegations, which - as shown above - are put in rather vague terms and give no exact data (names of persons against whom disciplinary action was taken, character of the action, etc.), the Government gives a specific explanation of the character of the action taken and the reasons for it: this does not seem to indicate",-1,1960,Argentina

.Having been invited by the Government of Costa Rica to send a mission to investigate the accusations made by the complaining organisations, the Director-General of the I.L.O appointed as his representative Mr. H. S. Kirkaldy, Professor of Industrial Relations at the University of Cambridge, and Reporter of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations of the I.L.O, "" to investigate the facts which are the subject of the various complaints of alleged infringements of trade union rights in Costa Rica submitted to the I.L.O by different trade union organisations in that country and to make a report thereon to the Director-General "". Mr. Kirkaldy, accompanied by an official of the International Labour Office, carried out this mission from  to  August  and submitted a report thereon to the Director-General. The Committee has examined the report of the Director-General's representative and has found most useful the factual information collected on the spot when examining the allegations.
.The case covers eight series of allegations concerning respectively anti-union acts by employers, the banning of certain trade union meetings, eviction from trade union offices, the detention of trade union leaders, the application for registration by the Sole Federation of Workers of the Southern Pacific (FUTRA), the right of way, a draft decree and intervention in trade union meetings. As regards the last two allegations, the Committee submitted its final conclusions to the Governing Body in paragraph  (b) of its th Report and in paragraph  (a) of its nd Report, respectively.
.In all the circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to suggest to the Government the possibility of adopting clear and precise provisions to ensure the adequate protection of workers' organisations against any acts of interference by employers or their organisations, in conformity with Article  of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), which has been ratified by Costa Rica;(b) to draw the attention of the Government to the importance which it attaches to the right of plantation workers to hold trade union meetings and to suggest that it might be appropriate to adopt clear provisions as to the meaning to be attached to the terms "" public meeting "" and "" private meeting "";(c) to draw the attention of the Government, having regard to the particular situation of plantation workers, to the importance which it attaches to the principle enunciated by the Plantations Committee of the I.L.O at its First Session (Bandung, December ) that employers of plantation workers should provide their unions with facilities for the conduct of their normal activities, including free office accommodation and freedom of entry;(d) as regards the allegations relating to the detention of trade union leaders:(i) to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that the right of trade unions to meet freely in their own premises, without need for prior authorisation and without control by the public authorities, constitutes a fundamental element of freedom of association;(ii) to note that the various workers detained were released some hours later;(iii) to decide that this aspect of the case does not require further examination;(e) to draw the attention of the Government to the obligation which it undertook, in ratifying the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), to apply all its provisions including, in this particular case, the provisions of Article  which specifies that "" workers and employers, without distinction whatsoever, shall have the right to establish and, subject only to the rules of the organisation concerned, to join organisations of their own choosing without previous authorisation "";(f) to express its satisfaction to the Government for the statement by the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare, according to which if the question of the revival of the draft decree referred to in paragraph  above should arise in future, the Government would consult the I.L.O prior to taking any decision on the matter;(g) to express its satisfaction to the Government for the assurances given by the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare, according to which it will no longer send inspectors to private trade union meetings, unless so requested by the trade unions concerned.
.Having taken cognizance of the case at its th Session (November ), the Committee submitted to the Governing Body the interim report contained in paragraphs  to  of the th Report of the Committee, which was approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ).
.The case comprised five sets of allegations, concerning, in order, anti-union acts by employers, the banning of union meetings on premises provided for the workers, interference with union meetings, the detention of trade union leaders and a draft decree. In respect of the last of these the Committee submitted to the Governing Body its final recommendations, which are set out in paragraph  of its th Report. The remaining allegations, together with others subsequently made by the Chiriqui Land Company Workers' Union in letters dated  October  (to which the Government replied by a letter dated  February ) and  February  with respect to its eviction from the union offices and by the FUTRA in a letter dated  February  with respect to its application for registration, are examined below.
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.As regards the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the allegations relating to interference with trade union meetings;(i) to draw the attention of the Government to the importance of having regard, when it is taking the necessary measures to fulfil its responsibility for the maintenance of public order, to the possibility of the exercise of trade union rights being endangered, and to the desirability of taking adequate steps to ensure that its police officers observe the provisions of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Costa Rica;(ii) to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that when the authorities send their representatives to assemblies or general meetings of trade unions, held on union premises, or other private union meetings, the presence of such representatives may be considered as an interference, from which the public authorities should refrain in virtue of Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. );(b) to take note of the present interim report as concerns the allegations relating to antiunion acts by employers, eviction from trade union offices, the banning of certain trade union meetings, the detention of trade union leaders and the application for registration made by the Sole Federation of Workers of the Southern Pacific, it being understood that the Committee will report further thereon as soon as it is in possession of the supplementary observations and information which it has requested from the Government.Geneva,  February .

.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).

113,"that there was an infringement of freedom of association here.
.In the circumstances the Committee considers that the complainants have not furnished proof that there was in this instance an infringement of freedom of association, and therefore recommends the Governing Body to decide that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.Allegations relating to Measures Taken against Mr. Bucci, General Secretary of the FOECYT and Other Officers of the Federation
.The complainants state that the "" trade union leave "" (licencia gremial) granted to Mr. Bucci, General Secretary, and other officers of the FOECYT had been withdrawn by the authorities, who are alleged to have replied that such leave had never been granted to Mr. Bucci. The complainants describe this last assertion as false and adduce in support of their view the text of a passage from the Bulletin of the Department of Communications (No.  of  November ) which does indeed indicate that trade union leave was granted in Mr. Bucci's case,
.In its reply the Government confirms that trade union leave was given to officers of the FOECYT, but only "" as a contribution to constructive trade union activity "". It adds that this action was taken outside the relevant statutory rules, since the FOECYT "" had not and has not "" official recognition as a trade union; that grant of the said leave was thus a favour which the authorities were not obliged to concede; that the FOECYT had outlawed itself by calling the strike without fulfilling the statutory conditions and in disregard of the particular character of the work of postal and telephone personnel who perform a public service; and that it would not have been logical, in the open conflict which had arisen, for the Department to continue to grant it the privilege in question.
.At this point the term "" trade union leave "" (licencia gremial) should be explained. In Argentina it evidently means the authorisation given to an employee to engage in full-time trade union work while continuing to receive his wage or salary. In its supplementary observations of  June  the Government quotes the text of a decree on the subject. This states that, if an employee of the Government is appointed to a trade union office "" for which no payment is made by the trade union organisation, he shall be entitled to leave with pay to the extent necessary for the duration of his term..."". Moreover, it appears from the Government's explanations that in the case of officially recognised trade unions this leave is given more or less automatically, but that the same does not apply to unions which have not been so recognised.
.In the supplementary observations made in its letter of  June  the Government provides further information in this regard. It refers to a system introduced under Argentine legislation "" for granting to a trade union organisation the right to be judged most representative of the relevant trade or occupation "". This, it says, permits performance of some of the most important functions of a trade union, particularly the conclusion of collective agreements, which may then be rendered applicable erga omnes. The system, the Government continues, being "" that of numerical determination, is so objective as to dissipate any possible suspicion of partiality in the grant of recognition for the abovementioned purposes. Indubitably, the most representative organisation is that which does the biggest and most important job in defence of the workers' interests. Moreover, it is logical that in a system of trade union pluralism such as ours, where as many unions can be set up in a given trade or occupation as the workers desire, the right to trade union leave should be limited to the most representative.""
.On several occasions, and particularly during discussion on the draft of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, the Conference referred to the question of the representative character of trade unions, and, to a certain extent, it agreed to the distinction sometimes made between the various unions concerned according to how representative they are. Article , paragraph , of the Constitution of the I.L.O states the concept of "" most representative "" organisations.
.Thus, the mere fact that the law of a country draws a distinction between the most representative trade union organisations and other trade union organisations is not in itself a matter for criticism, provided that such distinction does not accord to the most representative organisation privileges extending beyond the privilege, on the ground of its having the largest membership, of priority in representation for such purposes as collective bargaining or consultation by governments or for the purpose of nominating delegates to international bodies. In other words, this distinction should not have the effect of depriving trade union organisations not recognised as being among the most representative of the essential means whereby they may defend the occupational interests of their members, organise their administration and activities and formulate their programmes, as provided for in the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Argentina.
.It will be seen from the comments of the Government that the privilege of receiving licences is not exclusively reserved to the most representative trade unions, that is to say the ones which enjoy official recognition. It appears-since this privilege had also been extended to the FOECYT, the union involved in this case-that trade union licences can be, and occasionally are, granted to organisations other than those recognised as representative.
.It is therefore desirable that trade union licences should be granted in accordance with objective criteria and not simply at the discretion of the authorities. The Committee considers that, generally speaking, a system under which a government can grant a privilege to a particular organisation, or withdraw that privilege from an organisation to confer it on another one-to mention only two examples-might result in one union receiving particularly favourable or unfavourable treatment by comparison with the others and might thereby give rise to discrimination. More specifically, a government, by treating a particular organisation more favourably or more unfavourably than others, might influence the workers in their choice of the organisation to which they wish to belong. Now, in this field freedom of choice for the persons concerned is a right specifically laid down in Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ). If, therefore, a government wishes to grant certain privileges to trade unions, it is essential that in granting them it should treat all the unions concerned on an equal footing. The Committee had occasion to lay down this principle in an earlier case relating to privileges granted to certain organisations in the form of the provision of premises.
.In the present case, however, the withdrawal of the trade union licences of Mr. Bucci and other members of the FOECYT does not seem to have been a discriminatory measure. The licences in question were granted as a favour, the authorities not being required to grant them. By calling a strike without taking into account the restrictions of the right of employees of state public services to strike, and, in particular, by ignoring the provisions of Act No.  concerning conciliation and arbitration, the organisation in question placed itself in the wrong; this would appear to justify the withdrawal by the authorities of a privilege which they had voluntarily granted to the union and to which the latter had no specific right.
.In the circumstances, subject to the general remarks in paragraph  above, the Committee recommends to the Governing Body to decide that this aspect of the complaint does not call for further consideration.
.The complainants further allege that, in a letter from the "" Chief of Administration"", dated  January , Mr. Bucci, General Secretary of the FOECYT, was informed that, his "" licence "" (trade union leave) having been withdrawn, he had been transferred to Branch Office La Plata  and was invited to explain his reasons for absence from service.
.The complainants state in this regard that, two years before, Mr. Bucci had been, elected by the postal and telecommunication workers of Argentina, in a secret ballot, as a member of the Disciplinary Committee of the Department. This body, they continue, meets once a week and "" staff members are released from work in the service and are fulltime members of the Committee "". They conclude that the Department "" was therefore in the wrong to recall Mr. Bucci into the service and to apply disciplinary measures when he refused to obey "".
.In its reply the Government states that membership of the Disciplinary Committee does not carry with it release from the obligation to attend for duty on the days when the Committee has no sitting; that after the strike, and apparently also after transmission of the complaint, some of the staff members were excused other duty by decision of the Department of Communications; that, by virtue of this decision, Mr. Bucci is able to perform",-1,1960,Argentina
114,"his trade union functions while receiving his salary as a civil servant; that the only requirement made of Mr. Bucci is to serve as a member of the said Committee, and that, despite his absence from sittings, no disciplinary action has been taken against him.
.It proceeds from the Government's explanation that Mr. Bucci has had the benefit of a general measure which enables him to spend his whole time on trade union business while continuing to receive his salary. Mr. Bucci's position seems thus to have reverted to what it was before his trade union leave was withdrawn. Furthermore, he appears to have retained his membership of the Disciplinary Committee.
.In these circumstances the Committee considers that this aspect of the complaint has become purposeless and therefore recommends the Governing Body to decide that it does not call for further examination.
.As regards the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that, for the reasons given in paragraphs  to  above and subject to the observations contained in paragraphs  and , the complaint made by the P.T.T.I does not call for further examination.",-1,1960,Argentina
115,".This case was examined by the Committee as early as the th Session (November ) when the Committee submitted to the Governing Body an interim report contained in paragraphs  to  of the th Report of the Committee, which was approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ), again at its th Session (February ) when the Committee submitted another interim report contained in paragraphs  to  of its nd Report, which was approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (March ), and yet again at its nd Session (October ), when it submitted another report contained in paragraphs  to  of its th Report which was approved by the Governing Body at its rd Session (November ) and which contains the final recommendations on this case.
.The said recommendations, which were forwarded to the Government of Costa Rica by a communication dated  November , read as follows:
.In all the circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to suggest to the Government the possibility of adopting clear and precise provisions to ensure the adequate protection of workers' organisations against any acts of interference by employers or their organisations, in conformity with Article  of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), which has been ratified by Costa Rica;(b) to draw the attention of the Government to the importance which it attaches to the right of plantation workers to hold trade union meetings and to suggest that it might be appropriate to adopt clear provisions as to the meaning to be attached to the terms "" public meeting "" and "" private meeting "";(c) to draw the attention of the Government, having regard to the particular situation of plantation workers, to the importance which it attaches to the principle enunciated by the Plantations Committee of the I.L.O at its First Session (Bandung, December ) that employers of plantation workers should provide their unions with facilities for the conduct of their normal activities, including free office accommodation and freedom of entry;(d) as regards the allegations relating to the detention of trade union leaders:(i) to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that the right of trade unions to meet freely in their own premises, without need for prior authorisation and without control by the public authorities, constitutes a fundamental element of freedom of association;(ii) to note that the various workers detained were released some hours later;(iii) to decide that this aspect of the case does not require further examination;(e) to draw the attention of the Government to the obligation which it undertook, in ratifying the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), to apply all its provisions including, in this particular case, the provisions of Article  which specifies that "" workers and employers, without distinction whatsoever, shall have the right to establish and, subject only to the rules of the organisation concerned, to join organisations of their own choosing without previous authorisation "";(f) to express its satisfaction to the Government for the statement by the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare, according to which, if the question of the revival of the draft decree referred to in paragraph  above should arise in future, the Government would consult the I.L.O prior to taking any decision on the matter;(g) to express its satisfaction to the Government for the assurances given by the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare, according to which it will no longer send inspectors to private trade union meetings, unless so requested by the trade unions concerned.
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.By a communication dated  January  the Government of Costa Rica acknowledged receipt of the letter forwarding the Committee's recommendations and asked for an interpretation of the recommendation contained in the th Report, paragraph  (e), in order to ascertain whether it means that the public authorities must refrain from any intervention which would tend to restrict or prevent the formation or registration, and consequently the acquisition of legal personality, of unions which, though having statutes in conformity with the law, show themselves, from the evidence collected about their underlying purposes or means of action, to be bodies intended to promote subversion or to conspire against the established government or against the Constitutional democratic rgime; or whether, on the other hand, whenever the possibility of recourse to the competent courts is guaranteed, the administrative authority may, for serious reasons of public or social interest, refuse these spurious trade union organisations the registration conferring legal personality-which would constitute a special procedure of dissolution, successful in achieving its end only when approved by the judicial authorities on an action taken by the organisation's representatives or when, through patent lack of interest, the organisation concerned does not appear before the competent court within a legal time limit.
.In this connection the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, considering a similar observation formulated by the Government representative of another country which had also ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), was of the opinion that a group which adopted the rules and the form of a trade union only in order to engage in activities foreign to trade union activities could naturally not enjoy the guarantees laid down in the Convention. However, the Committee considered that it would be difficult to determine in advance whether an organisation applying for registration would or would not engage in activities foreign to trade union activities. As the Committee emphasised in its general conclusions in , normal control of the activities of trade unions should be effected a posteriori and by the judicial authorities; and the fact that an organisation which seeks to enjoy the status of an occupational organisation might in certain cases engage in activities foreign to trade union activities does not appear to constitute sufficient reason for subjecting trade union organisations a priori to control with respect to their composition and with respect to the composition of their management committees.""
.In all the circumstances the Committee, while maintaining its earlier conclusions, recommends the Governing Body to draw the attention of the Government of Costa Rica to the fact that refusal to register a union because the authorities, in advance and of their own independent judgment, consider that it might be politically undesirable, would seem tantamount to submitting registration, which is compulsory and without which a union cannot lawfully exist, to previous authorisation on the part of the authorities, which is not compatible with the provisions of Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), ratified by the Government of Costa Rica.
.This case was examined by the Committee at its th Session (November ), when the Committee submitted to the Governing Body an interim report contained in paragraphs  to  of the th Report of the Committee which was approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ); and, more recently, at its th Session (February ), when the Committee submitted another interim report contained in paragraphs  to  of its nd Report, which was approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (March ).
.Paragraph  of the nd Report of the Committee reads as follows:
.As regards the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the allegations relating to interference with trade union meetings:(i) to draw the attention of the Government to the importance of having regard, when it is taking the necessary measures to fulfil its responsibility for the maintenance of public order, to the possibility of the exercise of trade union rights being endangered, and to the desirability of taking adequate steps to ensure that its police officers observe the provisions of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Costa Rica;(ii) to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that when the authorities send their representatives to assemblies or general meetings of trade unions, held on union premises, or other private union meetings, the presence of such representatives may be considered as an interference, from which the public authorities should refrain in virtue of Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. );(b) to take note of the present interim report as concerns the allegations relating to anti-union acts by employers, eviction from trade union offices, the banning of certain trade union meetings, the detention of trade union leaders and the application for registration made by the Sole Federation of Workers of the Southern Pacific, it being understood that the Committee will report further thereon as soon as it is in possession of the supplementary observations and information which it has requested",-1,1960,Costa Rica
116,"to determine whether further examination by the Governing Body would serve any useful purpose, the Committee wishes to emphasise, as it has done on several previous occasions, that one of the fundamental principles of freedom of association is that workers should enjoy adequate protection against all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment-dismissal, transfer or other prejudicial measures -and that this protection is particularly desirable in the case of trade union officials because, in order to be able to perform their trade union duties in full independence, they must have the guarantee that they will not be prejudiced on account of the mandate which they hold from their trade unions. The Committee also wishes to point out that the guarantee of such protection in the case of trade union officials is also necessary in order to ensure respect for the fundamental principle that workers' organisations should have the right to elect their representatives freely.
.In consequence the Committee recommends the Governing Body to draw the attention of the Government to the importance which it attaches to the principles mentioned above, which are embodied in the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), both ratified by Argentina.
.There remains one point put forward by the complainants concerning which the Government has refrained from submitting observations: the allegations that two injunctions granted in a court of first instance and confirmed by the court of appeal instructing the management of the Bank not to modify the situation with regard to the General Secretary of the complaining organisation were ignored by the said management.
.The Committee has adjourned its examination of this particular aspect of the case pending receipt of the Government's observations thereon, and recommends the Governing Body to request the Government to submit these observations.
.As regards the case as a whole the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to decide, for the reasons indicated in paragraphs  to  above, that the allegations concerning the prohibition of National Bank employees from engaging in trade union activities do not call for further examination;(b) to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that the privileged position accorded to associations enjoying trade union status limits considerably the field of action of organisations which do not have this status, and may indirectly operate against the freedom of workers to belong to organisations of their own choosing, and to the desirability of considering the possibility of abolishing the distinction made under the Act between associations with trade union status and other occupational organisations;(c) to draw the attention of the Government to the importance attached by the Governing Body to the principle whereby workers should enjoy adequate protection against all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment-dismissal, transfer or other prejudicial measures-and that this protection is particularly desirable in the case of trade union officials because, in order to be able to perform their trade union duties in full independence, they must have the guarantee that they will not be prejudiced on account of the mandate which they hold from their trade unions;(d) to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that the guarantee of such protection in the case of trade union officials is also necessary in order to ensure respect for the fundamental principle that workers' organisations should have the right to elect their representatives freely;(e) to request the Government to submit its observations in respect of the allegations to the effect that the management of the National Bank did not comply with the injunctions granted by the labour judge and subsequently affirmed by the court of appeal relating to the situation of the General Secretary of the complaining organisation;(f) to take note of the present interim report in respect of this last allegation, it being understood that the Committee will report further thereon as soon as it is in possession of the information requested from the Government in accordance with subparagraph (e) above.",-1,1960,Argentina
117,"then applied to the judge for an injunction to prevent any modification in the situation until judgment had been given. Although the judge granted this injunction, the complainants allege that the Bank refused to comply with it, despite a further sentence by the same judge against the Chairman of the Bank for refusal and contempt of court. The authorities of the National Bank having appealed against the labour judge's decision, the court of appeal on  April  affirmed the interlocutory injunction granted by the judge. The National Bank is said to have likewise declined to comply with this decree.
.In its reply the Government states that the S.E.B.B.A is registered with the General Directorate of Occupational Associations of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security as a first-degree organisation. This registration was granted on application in accordance with the legislation in force, in view of the fact that the organisation in question complied with the requirements of section  of the Occupational Associations Act (No. ).
.Subsequently the S.E.B.B.A applied for recognition as a trade union; this request could not be complied with because the union did not fulfil the requirement laid down in section  () of Act No. , viz. a union must have been in operation for more than six months.
.The Government adds that section  () of Act No.  states that "" occupational associations on registration in accordance with section  of the present Act shall be entitled to defend and represent the interests of the occupation concerned in dealings with the State and with employers whenever there is no organisation in the same occupation which has been recognised as the most representative body "". In banking, declares the Government, there already exists an organisation which enjoys such a status, to wit the Association of Bank Employees.
.In another case relating to Argentina (the Government now refers, incidentally, to the observations it made at that time) the Committee examined in great detail the numerous consequences of distinctions made under the Act in question between organisations with trade union status and those which did not have it.
.After a thorough study of the Act the Committee at that time expressed the opinion that the independence of occupational organisations in relation to the public authorities might be compromised if the legislator or the executive power could effect a discrimination between the various organisations concerned which was not based on objective criteria, and even more so where the consequences of the distinction between the different organisations were to reserve to certain organisations a monopoly both in respect of the determination of conditions of employment (collective bargaining, etc.) and in respect of the representation and defence of the interests of the workers in relation to the public authorities.
.The Committee also observed that from the strictly trade union point of view the role assigned to organisations which did not enjoy trade union status was extremely limited, and it recalled in this connection the definition contained in Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. )-since ratified by Argentina-to the effect that the term "" organisation "" means "" any organisation of workers or of employers for furthering and defending the interests of workers or of employers "".
.In view of the fact that the distinction made by the Act between organisations enjoying trade union status and ordinary organisations resulted in the latter's being unable to defend occupational interests and conclude collective agreements, the Committee concluded that organisations which did not have trade union status did not have the right to organise in freedom their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes. "" Further,"" declared the Committee, "" in view of the limited functions which are assigned to these organisations, it may be wondered whether the distinction does not infringe the generally recognised principle that workers shall have the right to establish and join organisations of their own choosing-a principle which is embodied in Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ).""
.In view of the fact that the situation does not appear to have changed since the conclusions referred to above were reached, and that Argentina has in the meantime ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Committee recommends the Governing Body once again to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that the privileged position accorded to associations enjoying trade union status limits considerably the field of action of organisations which do not have this status, and may indirectly operate against the freedom of workers to belong to organisations of their own choosing, and to the desirability of considering the possibility of abolishing the distinction made under the Act between associations with trade union status and other occupational organisations.
.As regards the allegation to the effect that the management of the National Bank has taken steps to prevent its employees from engaging in any form of trade union activity (see paragraph  above) the Government recalls first of all that the employees of the National Bank, the official bank of Argentina, have the status of public servants. It adds that the measure taken by the management of the Bank was in accordance with Ministerial Order No. / dated  March , which was itself adopted to deal with an exceptional situation which threatened to disrupt banking operations, which are of vital importance and a stoppage in which could paralyse the country's economic life.
.In these circumstances, declares the Government, there could be no question of allowing the employees of the National Bank, as public servants, under the pretext that they were taking part in their trade union activities during the hours when the Bank was open to the public, to bring the whole of the Government's banking activities to a halt with resulting disruption of the national economy. "" Accordingly,"" concludes the Government, "" it was essential to insist that all trade union activities should take place outside bank opening hours in order not to obstruct the essential operations of the state banking system.""
.The Ministerial Order referred to in paragraph  above, the text of which is supplied by the Government, is couched in the following terms on the subject: "" Employees' delegates, members of internal committees or workers with similar representative functions, while entitled to perform their union duties, should do so in a manner compatible with the effective carrying out of their obligations as employees; this is so because they have the status of active employees; for this reason any attitude designed to prevent or hinder in any way the proper and efficient giving of their services by disrupting the normal course of activities in banking and insurance establishments is out of place; ... in the branch of activity in question, in view of the peculiarities thereof, employees' delegates, members of internal committees or workers with similar functions of a trade union nature should carry on their trade union activities outside working hours.""
.The explanations given by the Government and the texts that it has submitted in support of the same reveal that, contrary to the assertions of the complainants, the measures taken by the management of the National Bank do not prohibit employees absolutely from engaging in any form of trade union activity, but simply limit such activity to the time outside working hours.
.It appears that such limitation cannot be considered as an infringement of the exercise of trade union rights, since Article  () (b) of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), states unequivocally that employers, while they may agree to trade union activities being carried on during working hours, are not obliged to do so. The Convention puts it in this way: there should not be prejudice against a worker because of "" participation in union activities outside working hours or, with the consent of the employer, within working hours "".
.In these conditions the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that this particular aspect of the case does not call for further examination.
.Answering the complainants' allegations concerning the transfer of the General Secretary of their organisation, which according to them constituted an anti-union discriminatory measure, the Government affirms that on the contrary it was a normal posting which took place under civil service regulations.
.While bearing in mind that the evidence available is not sufficient to enable it to determine the real reasons behind the transfer in question, the Committee considers that, since this posting was decided upon at a time when a dispute was in progress between the employers and the organisation of which the person in question was General Secretary, the complainants had some cause for supposing that there was a connection between the posting and the trade union position occupied by this man.
.In these circumstances, while considering that the contradictory information before it in this instance does not allow it",-1,1960,Argentina
