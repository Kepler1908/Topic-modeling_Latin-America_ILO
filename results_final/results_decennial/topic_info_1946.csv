His wife was also arbitrarily imprisoned. The complaint emphasised that no charge had been brought against Mr. Federico Rondn and that he left the country in October  with a regular passport issued by the Government of Venezuela. The complaint also protested against the arrest, on  February , of Mr. Rodolfo Quintero, President of the Federation of Workers for the Federal District and the State of Miranda, although no valid charge had been or could be brought against him.\n.The complaint of the W.F.T.U presented a series of allegations concerning measures taken by the authorities against the Union of Petroleum Workers in the Ribas and Zaraza districts. According to the complainant, a collective agreement similar to the one concluded between the main petrol companies and the "" Independent Trade Union Movement "", an organisation controlled by the Government, was signed on  September  by the Atlantic Refining Company and the executive committee of the above-mentioned union in the presence of the regional delegates of the Ministry of Labour. The signature was ratified in the presence of the civil authorities at Caracas in accordance with the provisions of the Labour Code. At that meeting, in accordance with the decisions reached by the Union Assembly held on  September , the members of the executive committee lodged a written protest against the conditions under which the agreement had been forced upon them. This protest was made public on  October. On the same day, they were imprisoned and the union offices were searched by the police. Six days later some of them were set free and the civil authorities gave them documents stating that they had been held in preventive detention and were not guilty of any crime. The other members of the executive committee (Claudio Chacn, Fernando Bolivar, Ramn Lozada and Carlos Laza) were detained for  days, then dismissed from their employment with the consent of the labour inspectorate. Later they were taken to the Gurico State prison. The secretary of the union, Mr. Rafael Castillo, one of the leaders who had been released, was forced to draw up an inventory of the assets of the union and to leave the union under the threat of prosecution. On  October the funds and documents of the union were seized by the police ; on  October, the labour inspectorate gave the local delegate of the Ministry of Labour a document attesting that, at a meeting held on  October, the workers had decided to dissolve the union and hand over all its funds to the independent trade union. In actual fact, declared the complainant, no such meeting ever took place, but the authorities attempted to give some show of legality to the arbitrary dissolution of the union and the transfer of its funds to the Government-controlled trade union by forcing the workers, under threats of imprisonment, to sign the document. The complainant considered that these facts clearly showed that the administrative and police authorities had openly interfered in the functioning of a trade union organisation and had attempted to destroy it. By a letter dated  June  the W.F.T.U was informed that, in accordance with the procedure in force, it might furnish further information in substantiation of its complaint within a period of one month. In a letter dated  July  the W.F.T.U stated that, in its view, the facts cited in its original complaint convincingly established the infringements of the exercise of trade union rights committed in Venezuela.\n.The complaint presented by the International Longshoremen\'s and Warehousemen\'s Union (San Francisco) protested against the arrest, in order to impede their trade union activities, of several Venezuelan trade union leaders and, in particular, Messrs. Jess Faria, Federico Rondn, Luis Emiro Arrieta and Alicedes Hurtado. On being informed that, according to the procedure in force, it was entitled to present further information within one month, the complaining organisation stated, in a letter dated  January , that in its view it was not necessary to furnish proof in support of the facts alleged in the complaint because the Government had not refuted the allegations made against it and because the persons mentioned in the original complaint were still in prison.Analysis of the Government\'s Replies (Communications dated  October ,  February  and  October )Communication dated  October \n.In this communication, relating also to the I.C.F.T.U complaint of  December  analysed above, the Venezuelan Government presented its observations on the complaint submitted by the I.R.O.W.\n.In no case had workers been the victims of repressive acts on grounds of trade union membership or activities. Workers belonging to trade union organisations sanctioned in the past in accordance with the Labour Law were not subject to disability and many, and in some cases all, of the workers who had belonged to unions dissolved on legal grounds had joined existing trade unions or created new ones. The measures taken by the Government, including measures taken to maintain public order, were based on Constitutional provisions and the Government denied that international organisations were competent to discuss them because such discussion would mean an infringement of the national sovereignty of Venezuela.First request for further information. . At its Seventh Session (November ), the Committee, while noting with satisfaction the assurances given by the Government in its communication of  October  that it had not interfered with the activities of trade union organisations and that the organised workers had not been subjected to repressive measures because of their trade union affiliation, observed that the Government gave no information with reference to the allegation that certain trade union leaders had been arrested. The Committee consequently decided, before examining the case as a whole, to request the Director-General to ask the Venezuelan Government for more detailed information on the imprisonment of the trade union leaders mentioned in the communication of  April  from the I.R.O.W. This request was conveyed to the Venezuelan Government by the Director-General in a letter dated  December .Communication dated  February \n.In this communication the Venezuelan Government referred to its first reply and reaffirmed that not only did it not place any restriction on the activity of legally constituted trade union organisations, but that on the contrary one of the principles of its social policy was to protect the rights of trade unions in so far as they confined their activity to the functions assigned to them by law.\n.In connection with the arrest of Mr. Prez Salinas and Mr. Ramn Quijada, the Government contended that those persons were no longer trade union leaders. The Venezuelan Workers\' Confederation and its affiliated organisations were dissolved by Executive Decree No. , dated  February , which was subsequently ratified by the National Constituent Assembly of the United States of Venezuela when it approved the reports of the Ministry of Labour. Consequently, a complaint relating to a violation of trade union rights could not be based, according to the Government, on the detention of persons who were no longer trade union leaders. Similarly, Mr. Augusto Malav Villalba could no longer lay claim to the title of General Secretary of a Confederation which ceased to exist nearly four years before.\n.The Government stated, more specifically, that Mr. Prez Saunas and Mr. Ramn Quijada were arrested for illegal activities punishable by law, which not only had no connection with trade union activities but were, on the contrary, quite incompatible with such activities. The Government considered that these acts were all the more serious as attempts were made to conceal them under cover of trade union activities and thus to obtain for them the protection given by law to these activities.\n.The Government concluded by emphasising that, under the powers granted to it by the Constitution, it alone was entitled to decide the course of action to be followed in relation to the persons in question and reaffirmed that the measures taken to maintain public order were not matters which could be discussed by international organisations because "" to accept such a course would mean an infringement of the principles of national sovereignty "".Second request for further information. . At its Eighth Session (March ) and at its Ninth Session (May ), the Committee decided to adjourn its examination of the above complaints in the hope of receiving certain further information from the Government of Venezuela on the I.R.O.W complaint and observations on the complaint of the W.F.T.U, dated  March , communicated to the Government by a letter dated  July .Communication dated  October \n.In this communication the Venezuelan Government presented further observations concerning the complaint of the W.F.T.U and the further information requested by the Committee with reference to the complaint of the I.R.O.W.\n.With reference to the allegations of the W.F.T.U relating to the arrest', 'the Committee recommends the Governing Body to draw the attention of the present Government to the views which it expressed previously with regard to this matter and to ask the Government to be good enough to furnish the information requested.\n.In all the circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note that on  May  a complete change of Government took place in Colombia, the previous Government having been replaced by a new Government which is making preparations for the holding of elections in a few months\' time ;(b) to note that, while the events complained of took place during the lifetime of the previous Government, the present Government has given no information which makes it possible to judge how far the events complained of may have had any continuing consequences which have not yet been remedied, and, in these circumstances, to decide, having regard to the importance which the Governing Body has always attached to the fundamental civil liberties proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and to due process in the examination of charges of violations of the law of the land which may have a bearing on the exercise of trade union rights, to request the Government to be good enough to furnish information concerning the action which it is taking to remedy any consequences of the events complained of which may have continued ;(c) to draw the attention of the Government to the possibility of abuse present in the application of the provisions of Decree No.  of  April , and to request the Government to furnish information as to the extent to which use as been made of the provisions in question and as to the existing jurisprudence of the Council of State relevant to this matter ;(d) to suggest to the Government that it might care to examine its law and practice in the light of the provisions contained in the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), with a view to applying and ratifying those Conventions.\n.The allegations made by the Confederation of Workers of Latin America (C.T.A.L) are contained in two communications dated  May and  June  respectively ; these are analysed separately below.Communication dated  May \n.The complainant alleges that the Colombian Government has adopted a repressive policy in violation of the principles laid down in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and that in so doing it has trampled on the workers\' fundamental rights. The Government is stated to be preparing a military campaign against the peasants in the department of Tolima.\n.The Government is alleged to have issued two decrees making free expression of opinion an offence and abolishing the Constitutional right to strike. The first of these decrees prevents trade unions from being led by workers "" who genuinely represent their fellow workers\' interests "" ; under penalty of from two to ten years\' imprisonment the receipt or circulation of the publications of international democratic organisations or membership of these organisations is forbidden.\n.It is stated that in the second decree the Government has tried to prevent workers from acting in support of their economic claims. In particular, the complaining organisation mentions the following provision which, in its opinion, completely abrogates the right to strike recognised by the Colombian Constitution, and is contrary to the resolutions adopted at various I.L.O meetings which have been endorsed by the Colombian Government:The public service shall be deemed to include, inter alia, the following forms of employment:(a) any branch of the government service ;(b) land, water or air transport undertakings, water supply, electric power and telecommunications ;(c) health establishments of all kinds, such as hospitals and clinics ;(d) social assistance, charitable and welfare institutions ;(e) dairies, markets, slaughter-houses and all public or private distributive outlets of such establishments ;(f) all public hygiene and cleansing services ;(g) the extraction, processing and distribution of salt ;(h) the extraction, refining, transport and distribution of oil and its by-products when, in the opinion of the Government, these are intended to maintain normal supplies of fuel ;(i) any others that in the opinion of the Government affect the safety, health, education and economic or social life of the population. The Government shall decide in consultation with the Council of State which forms of employment fall within the category defined in this subsection.Communication dated  June \n.In this connection the complainant describes a series of events constituting "" the most appalling crimes in the history of Latin America "" ; these involve violations of trade union and democratic rights, large-scale massacres of workers and peasants, and genocide. United Nations intervention is urged to put an end to this situation. It is stated that on  April a wave of murders "" without reason or justification "" took place in a number of places-which the complainant mentions by name-in the department of Tolima. It is alleged that these murders formed part of a plan to "" pacify "" the country. The massacre was carried out by a military force totalling , men. The bulk of the victims (some of whom are mentioned by name in the complaint) were in Santo Domingo ; it is alleged that before being put to death a number of peasants were castrated and forced to dig their own graves. In Los Brazuelos, Calarma and Guaipa,  peasants were brutally murdered, while women were assaulted and beaten. Many workers were murdered while they were working in the coffee plantations. The prisons in these towns contain a number of prisoners who are minors. Many prisoners disappear mysteriously and are probably put to death. The Government is alleged to consider that "" political prisoners are a problem because they may become a focus for agitation whereas once they are dead they can only be used in this way for a few days "". The church authorities have protested without result to the military authorities against these crimes ; thousands of people are stated to have fled for their lives to other areas.ANALYSIS OF THE REPLY\n.In its communication dated  September  the Colombian Government makes its comments on the complaint dated  May . It begins by saying that as a general principle it rejects any type of interference in the country\'s internal jurisdiction, since no international organisation has the power to encroach on this field which belongs exclusively to individual States, as is clearly specified in article  () of the United Nations Charter. However, out of deference towards the International Labour Organisation, to which Colombia has belonged since it was founded, the Government, while completely rejecting accusations made by a Communist-inspired organisation "" which systematically sets out to discredit democratic governments "", is prepared to comment on the charges made.\n.The first decree referred to by the C.T.A.L must be the Extraordinary Decree No.  of  March , which the Government reproduces in its reply and which was issued under Act No.  passed in  to reform the National Constitution and "" to prohibit international communism "". The sole purpose of this anti-Communist legislation is to safeguard democracy and Christian civilisation and it is a distortion of the facts to allege that it is an attempt to prevent ""representative workers "" from reaching positions of leadership in the unions. There are in Colombia two Confederations, a number of federations and some  unions which exercise their rights freely and democratically. This fact is acknowledged by the Inter-American Regional Organisation of Workers (O.R.I.T) in a letter which is quoted in the Government\'s reply. This letter states, inter alia, that "" documentary evidence supplied by our affiliate ... proves that the free and independent trade unionism that you advocate for your country coincides with the O.R.I.T.\'s conception of genuine trade unionism "". The Colombian Workers\' delegate at the th Session of the International Labour Conference, who is now Vice-Chairman of the Colombian Workers\' Union, stated in plenary sitting : "" Freedom of association is absolute. In the last  months, , trade union meetings and workers\' congresses have been held, and in the same period there have been founded and put into operation the new National Confederation and  workers\' unions. At present there are three trade union centres, grouping almost all the trade unions. All operate quite freely as regards their policy and activities without interference from the State or from one another. ""The Government\'s policy - as enunciated in various public statements - supports "" free and democratic trade unionism as against a government-dominated or totalitarian movement ... ; a non-political trade union movement, i.e. one that is concerned with the interests of its members and has no party preoccupations ... ; a national trade unionism having no contact with communism or any other pernicious foreign doctrines by whatever name they may be called ... ; and a trade unionism that shows respect for the catholic feelings of Colombians "". In accordance with', 'right of assembly without previous permission (section  of the Decree).\n.As regards the appointment of persons to administer the General Confederation of Labour, the Government admits that this occurred and states that it was a measure rendered necessary by the corrupt administration of the unions whose officers had been appointed by the previous Government. The object of the said action was to make it possible for free elections to be held within a reasonable period. Intervention of this kind would appear incompatible with freedom of association in a normal period. It should be remembered, however, as pointed out in connection with the previous allegations, that this step was of a provisional character and taken by a revolutionary Government against trade union organisations which, in its view, were controlled by the Government recently overthrown. In Case No.  (Argentina) the Committee examined the situation arising out of this control of the General Confederation of Labour by the previous Government, and the Governing Body recommended the Argentine Government to reconsider the then existing law and practice. It would appear that the measures taken by the present Government were designed to implement the earlier recommendation of the Governing Body and that at the present time (February ) the object of the action taken by the Government is being achieved, primary trade union elections having been held and the administration of the unions in question having been handed over to the officers so elected, while preparations for similar elections in the case of the higher trade union organisations are now being made, after which they also will be handed over to their new administrations.\n.In these circumstances the Committee considers that the intervention in the administration of the General Confederation of Labour and its affiliates, which the Government admits, was an exceptional measure of an entirely provisional character ordered during a period of transition towards a normal situation, which is being gradually re-established by means of free elections. The Committee therefore recommends the Governing Body to note that the return to a normal trade union situation is already well advanced and to reaffirm the importance which it attaches to re-establishing fully a situation in which workers without distinction may establish and freely join organisations of their own choosing. It also considers that the allegations regarding repression of trade union meetings are too vague to permit of an examination on their merits.Allegations relating to the Trade Union Press\n.The complainant organisation alleges that publication of Unidad Sindical, Vocero, Lucha Obrera, El Federal, Derechos del Hombre, and other periodicals has been prohibited, and that persons selling Nuestra Palabra have been arrested. The Government, for its part, states that the restrictions imposed on the dailies mentioned by the complainant were based on the state of emergency which justifies, as the Supreme Court of Justice has admitted in several judgments, limitation for security reasons of the freedom of a certain section of the press "" directly subversive and hostile to the revolution ... following the directives of supporters of the fugitive ex-dictator "". The Government adds that the publication of the newspapers Vocero, Derechos del Hombre, El Federal (organ of the former Government Party) and Lucha Obrera (organ of the National Revolutionary Socialist Party allied with the former Government Party) was suspended because they engaged in subversive propaganda in favour of the rgime abolished by the revolution. Apart from this, states the Government, publications enjoy complete liberty of opinion, liberty of expression has not been hindered, and public, political and trade union functions have taken place in all freedom, while the radio is freely used for political propaganda. The Government indicates that the restrictions imposed during the state of emergency are temporary and that the return of the country to a normal Constitutional situation by means of elections is due to take place in . The need to defend the objectives of a revolution sometimes involves, according to the Government, the imposition of a minimum of restrictions on individual rights, in accordance with express provisions of the Constitution.\n.In earlier cases relating to freedom of the press, the Committee considered that it was not called upon to examine the questions relating to freedom of the press in general but that it was competent only to examine the questions relating specifically to trade union publications, because as it stated in Case No.  (United Kingdom-British Guiana) "" the right to express opinions through newspapers or publications is certainly an essential element in trade union rights "".\n.In the present case, of the publications whose circulation was admittedly restricted by the Government, only the Unidad Sindical would seem from its name, in the absence of other information, to be a labour or occupational organ. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the complaining organisation has offered no proof that the circulation of trade union publications was hindered by the reason of their being trade union publications. It appears from the Government\'s explanations that the restrictions imposed (during a revolutionary period and a state of emergency) were not based on the trade union nature of the publications but only on their "" directly subversive "" character, and that the restrictions were limitations of the general freedom of the press imposed for ""reasons of a political character and not purposes of trade union repression. In these circumstances the Committee, while stressing the importance of freedom of the trade union press as an essential element in trade union rights, considers that the restrictions imposed by the Argentine revolutionary Government on certain publications during the period of emergency appear mainly to have been based on reasons of a general political character. While bearing in mind the exceptional character of these measures, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to draw the attention of the Government to the importance of ensuring respect for the freedom of trade union publications.\n.In conclusion the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to express its satisfaction at the measures taken by the Government with a view to restoring fully freedom of association and to ensuring full observance of trade union rights ;(b) to draw the attention of the Argentine Government and trade unionists to the text of the resolution concerning the independence of the trade union movement adopted by the International Labour Conference at its th Session (Geneva, ) which states "". it is essential for the trade union movement in each country to preserve its freedom and independence so as to be in a position to carry forward its economic and social mission irrespective of political changes "" ; when trade unions decide to initiate legally permitted political action they must ensure that such action is not "" of such a nature as to compromise the continuance of the trade union movement or its social and economic functions irrespective of political changes in the country "" ; it states further : "" Governments in seeking the co-operation of trade unions to carry out their economic and social policies should recognise that the value of this co-operation rests to a large extent on the freedom and independence of the trade union movement as an essential factor in promoting social advancement and should not attempt to transform the trade union movement into an instrument for the pursuance of political aims, nor should they attempt to interfere with the normal functions of a trade union movement because of its freely established relationship with a political party "" ;(c) to note the assurances given by the Government that persons are being held in preventive detention only in proven cases of subversion or sabotage and that the cases of those persons who are still detained are being considered, and to emphasise the importance of ensuring that every detained person shall enjoy the full guarantee of due legal process, so that an independent judicial authority can within a reasonable period carry out an objective examination of the merits of the charges on which he is detained ;(d) to note that the appointment by the Government of persons to administer the affairs of the General Confederation of Labour was an emergency measure taken after a revolution for the purpose of enabling organisations which had been controlled by the preceding Government to hold free elections, to note that such elections have now been virtually completed and that the return to a normal trade union situation is already well advanced, and to reaffirm the importance which it attaches to re-establishing fully a situation in which workers and employers, without distinction whatsoever, have the right to establish and, subject only to the rules of the organisation concerned, to join organisations of their own choosing without previous authorisation, in which workers\' and employers\' organisations have the right to draw up their Constitutions and rules, to elect their representatives in full freedom, to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes, and in which the public authorities refrain from any interference which could restrict this right or impede the careful exercise thereof ;(e) to emphasise, with respect to the allegations relating to freedom of the press,']"
