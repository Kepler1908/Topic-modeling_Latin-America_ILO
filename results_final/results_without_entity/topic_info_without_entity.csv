More recently, the Government has declared that a major programme of agrarian reform is currently under way, the socio-economic consequences of which will ensure that the events involved in the present case cannot recur. As regards the death of Trnsito Vsquez, the Government explained that, under a court decision issued on  March , a stay of proceedings was granted concerning the charge relating to wilful homicide and the release was ordered of Mximo Garcia Lpez, Josh Felipe Garcia Vsquez and Sarbelo Garcia Ramirez.

As regards the list supplied by the complainants of workers and peasants who had died, the Government states that their deaths were not the result of repressive action due to their trade union activities and obligations, but rather of the violence which continues to be generated by the extreme left and the extreme right and which, by drawing the armed forces into a purely defensive response, are plunging the country into a bloodbath which has been criticised and deplored by the true citizens of El Salvador.\n.With regard to Case No. , in which one of the complainants alleged that five trade unionists had been arrested, the Government states that the events in question were brought about by an illegal strike which bad been declared by the River Lempa Hydroelectric Company Workers\' Trade Onion on  and  August . The Government adds that the instigators of the strike violated the provisions of the Constitution by not following the procedure set forth in the Labour Code when they cut off without any advance notice the electricity service throughout the country, which seriously damaged the national economy (with losses exceeding  million colones) and caused the irreparable loss of human lives in hospitals and other medical centres. According to the Government, when the situation reached the point of posing a threat to the national security, since the service involved was one which was indispensable to the community, and as a result of the public outcry, the armed forces intervened in the plant without bloodshed and proceeded to arrest the principal leaders of the strike who - with the exception of those who were not considered to be responsible and who were subsequently released - are now being held in prison, where they are being treated correctly. The Government states that the prisoners are subject to the jurisdiction of military courts, which are now investigating their case in collaboration with their defence counsel.\n.With regard to the assassination of Rodolfo Viera, Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer (Case No. ), the Government stated that it had ordered the arrest of the wealthy right-wing businessmen Ricardo Sol Meza and Hans Christ; the latter is currently in Miami and proceedings are at present under way to seek his extradition. The Government adds that the Public Prosecutor has been especially instructed to appoint, on behalf of the State, representatives to take part in the trial being heard by the Fifth Criminal Court and these representatives have already participated in the investigations. The Government points out that Mr Viera was, in addition to being a member of the Salvadorean Communal Onion, a high official of the Government and was looked upon as one of the major proponents of agrarian reform, all of which constituted the motives for his assassination at the wretched hands of the extreme right and extreme left.\n.Finally, as regards the allegations concerning the assassination of workers, trade union leaders and school teachers between  October  and  September  (Case No. ) under the presidency of General Carlos Humberto Romero, the Government states that it does not know why the corresponding investigations did not produce any results, if indeed such investigations took place. The Government adds, however, that in order to demonstrate clearly and sincerely that the present rulers of El Salvador are free of any links or compromises with the past, an investigation will be conducted into these deplorable events, the results of which will be transmitted to the Committee as soon as possible.\n.Before considering the substance of the various matters raised by the complainants, the Committee would like to express its deep concern at the serious nature of the allegations, most of which refer to the death, assassination, arrest or disappearance of trade unionists and trade union leaders, which have continued to occur even after  October , the date on which the former Government was deposed. While noting the troubled situation which is facing the authorities in El Salvador, the Committee must draw the attention of the Government to the fact that a free and independent trade union movement can develop only in a climate of respect for fundamental human rights, and to the Resolution concerning Trade Onion Rights and their relation to civil liberties adopted by the International Labour Conference in , which states in particular that the concept of trade union rights is totally meaningless in the absence of civil liberties and that the rights conferred on workers\' and employers\' organisations must be baled on respect for civil liberties.\n.The Committee also deplores the fact that in spite of the time which has elapsed, the Government in its observations has still not replied to all the allegations or has done so only incompletely in some of the cases.\n.The Committee notes that the Government considers itself free of any responsibility for the events which allegedly occurred before  October . In this connection, the Committee considers, as it already pointed out at its session in February , that there exists a link of continuity between successive governments in the same State and that although a government cannot be held responsible for events which took place under a preceding one, it has a clear responsibility for any consequences which those events might have produced since its accession to power. This principle is particularly applicable as regards the clarification of events which have led to the loss of human lives or the detention of trade unionists who are still being held in prison.\n.As regards the allegations concerning the attacks on the lives or persons of trade unionists or trade union leaders, the Committee cannot but deplore the loss of numerous lives and the injuries mentioned in the complaints. The Committee notes the Government\'s statement that investigations are now under way concerning the events referred to in Cases Nos. ,  and  and, more generally, into the assassinations which allegedly took place between  October  and  December  (Case No. ) concerning which the Government states that an investigation is being ordered, the results of which will be transmitted to the Committee. However, since the Government has not provided information on the death of the trade union leader Tombs Rosales (Case No. ) or the injuries to which reference is made in Cases Nos.  and  and some of the assassinations referred to in Case No. , the Committee requests the Government to undertake as soon as possible - if it has not already done so - an independent judicial inquiry into these allegations with a view to elucidating', 'trade union leader Francisco Girn Ramos (Case No. ), the Government states that he was indicted on a charge of destroying genuine documents and that there was never any allegation that there had been an infringement of freedom of association.

They are therefore sometimes difficult to prove. The fact nevertheless remains, as the Committee has recalled in each of the foregoing cases, that any discrimination of this kind jeopardises the right of workers to set up and join organisations of their own choosing, a right which is explicitly recognised in Article  of Convention No. .\n.The Committee also wishes to lay stress on the principles set forth in the resolution concerning the independence of the trade union movement, adopted by the International Labour Conference at its th Session (). The fundamental and permanent mission of the trade union movement, states the resolution, is the economic and social advancement of the workers. When trade unions in accordance with the national law and practice of their respective countries and at the decision of their members decide to establish relations with a political party or to undertake Constitutional political action as a means towards the advancement of their economic and social objectives, such political relations or actions should not be of such a nature as to compromise the continuance of a trade union movement or its social or economic functions irrespective of political changes in the country. The resolution also stresses that governments should not attempt to transform the trade union movement into an instrument for the pursuance of political aims, nor should they attempt to interfere with the normal functions of a trade union movement because of its freely established relationship with a political party.\n.Allegations concerning the registration and cancellation of registration of trade unions\n.The representative of the Director-General explained that a resolution, No. / of  October , repealed resolutions of  which, by administrative decision, cancelled the registration of numerous trade unions, including the single union of workers of the Central Romana Corporations and Central Romana By Products mentioned in the complaints. Such registration was necessary to enable the trade unions to function. In the preamble to this new resolution it is stated, among other things, that the previous Government was guilty of actions ultra vires by assuming powers that legally belonged to the courts of first instance by virtue of section  of the Labour Code. The preamble also refers to Article  of Convention no. , which prohibits the dissolution or suspension of workers\' and employers\' organisations by administrative authority. In these circumstances the Committee considers that this aspect of the case calls for no further examination.\n.In this connection, the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has observed that according to section  of the Labour Code the registration of a trade union could be refused by the Ministry of Labour. It had asked the Government whether it was possible to appeal to the courts against a refusal to register a trade union. The Under-Secretary of State told the representative of the Director-General that it was possible to appeal against a refusal to register a trade union, as it was to appeal against any administrative act.\n.Allegations concerning intervention by the public authorities in the internal affairs of trade unions and occupation of trade union premises\n.The problems raised in this connection were of two kinds. The first related to an administrative resolution, No. / of  October , issued by the Secretariat of State for Labour, according to which general assemblies organised with a view to setting up a trade union, federation or Confederation, electing its executive Committee, amending its statutes, merging with other trade unions or affiliating with a federation or Confederation, had to be ""certified"" by a labour inspector. After examining the file on the case and hearing the administration\'s opinion, the Secretary of state decided whether the trade union can be registered, whether its executive Committee can be recognised, and whether a merger or affiliation can take place, after having previously verified that the legal requirements have been fulfilled. The Committee expressed the view in its th Report that the obligation to accept the presence of a representative of the authorities at general assemblies constituted a restriction upon the free activity of trade unions.\n.The representative of the Director-General received the assurance that the resolution would shortly be repealed. The officials he talked with added that, pending the repeal, the authorities would abide by the limitations placed on this text by two rulings of the Supreme Court of Justice. According to the rulings, the powers of the Secretariat of State for Labour in trade union affairs should be interpreted restrictively and the purpose of the presence of an inspector at union assemblies could only be to provide the Secretariat with a report on the circumstances in which the assembly took place and on the decisions adopted. The Court stressed that contesting union elections was a matter for the labour tribunal and not the administrative authorities. According to officials of the CGT, says the report, while the previous Government had used this resolution to commit excesses, the present Government was not applying it in the same spirit.\n.The second set of problems raised relates to factual situations: intervention by the authorities in the elections of the Stevedores\' Union (POASI); manoeuvres in other undertakings, with the assistance of the authorities, to remove trade union leaders from office; confiscation and misappropriation of the funds of POASI; and occupation of its premises and those- of the National Union of Independent Drivers (UNACHOSIN). In this connection the representative of the Director-General makes the following statement in his report:With regard to the election of trade union leaders, the Secretary and Under-Secretary of State declared that the Supreme Court ruling in the POASI case was a clear case of the infringement of the law by the Government of that period. They confirmed that the POASI had organised elections on  October  and was now operating normally. They also confirmed that the premises of the POASI and UNACHOSIN had been occupied but that a stop had now been put to these measures. The Under-Secretary of State for Labour said that in occupying union premises the previous Government had not respected existing legal provisions. Forcible entry is prohibited by law and misuse of power by public servants is a punishable offence under the Penal Code. As to the allegations concerning POASI funds, he said that this was now past history and that the POASI was currently verifying its financial records. If any misappropriation of funds was brought to light, the matter would be brought before the competent authorities.\n.The representative of the Director-General continues:In more general terms, the Secretary of State for the Interior and for the Police informed me that meetings organised on union premises were allowed to take place unhindered and that no authorisation was required open-air meetings were another matter and did require authorisation, and the appropriate decisions were taken in the light of all relevant factors: importance of the date for the union ( May, for example), traffic problems, proximity of an important building (hospital, for example), etc.\n.The Committee notes that a solution has now been found to the factual problems raised in the complaints. It also notes the intention of the Government to repeal Resolution No. / mentioned above and trusts that this measure will be taken in the near future.\n.Allegations concerning interference with the right to strike\n.Complaints were also made with reference to the exercise of the right to strike. In this connection, the representative of the Director-General points out, the labour authorities have recognised that it was virtually impossible to engage in strike action in the present state of the legislation. Such action could only last for a few days because judges were empowered to order a return to work. The report adds:It is significant that the Labour Code only authorises strike action within very strict limits (see sections ,  and ): for example, more than  per cent of the employees concerned must have voted in favour of the strike; a strike cannot take place if one of the parties decides to submit the dispute to arbitration; and it must come to an end upon the expiry of the legal time limit for the resumption of work ordered by the judge. The right to strike is restricted even further by the provisions governing arbitration procedure: the presiding judge can appoint the arbitrators ex officio or at the request of the Secretary of State for Labour (section ) and may order the resumption of work (section ; see also sections  to  and ). The arbitration award has the effect of a collective agreement (section', 'the death threats and abduction of members of the trade union of the ESDEE Maquiladora enterprise: the Government is gathering information;- the attempted abduction of Mr. Pablo Mazariegos: no denunciation had been made because the victim was not sure who was responsible. He indicated that he has been subject to no recent persecution or threats;- the capture and torture of Mr. Eligio Quej Morn: the Government is collecting information;- the imprisonment of Mr. Rubn Terry Amzquita: he has left the country and gone into exile.\n.As concerns the allegations with respect to anti-union discrimination and practices contrary to collective bargaining, the Government provided the following information:- as concerns the collective dispute at the La Patria farm, a collective agreement providing for the reinstatement of the dismissed persons was signed with the mediation of the General Labour Inspectorate;- Ernesto Bol was reinstated in his job;- as concerns the attacks on Werner Coc Ramrez, the Government has asked for further information from the complainant about the place where this unionist works;- as concerns the MK S.A. and L&L S.A. enterprises, the respective judges have not yet handed down their judgements;- as concerns the refusal by the National Committee for the Blind and Deaf Mutes of Guatemala, the judicial proceedings have not yet been concluded;- as concerns the Unicasa S.A. and Welly S.A. enterprises, the General Labour Inspectorate initiated a penal trial before the judicial authority which is still pending;- the reinstatement of the workers on the El Salto farm continues to be discussed in the tribunals;- as concerns the Bolivia farm, thanks to a commission made up of various authorities and established at the request of the Popular Workers\' Federation, an agreement has been arrived at in which the parties withdrew the judicial action initiated;- as concerns the alleged refusal to negotiate in the Los Angeles farm, a collective agreement was made on  October  with the intervention of the General Labour Inspectorate;- as concerns the La Argentina farm, no denunciations were presented;- as concerns the Diseos y Maquilas S.A. enterprise, the industrial dispute was resolved with the making of a collective agreement.\n.In their communication of July , the IUF and the ICFTU state that Mrs. Flor de Mara Salguero de Laparra, a trade unionist of the Trade Union Federation of Food, Agro-Industry and Related Workers (FESTRAS), a trade union organization in the maquila sector, received death threats in ; on  May  she was abducted, drugged, beaten and raped; after her release she received further intimidating telephone calls recalling the assault against her on  May.\n.In its communications of July, October and December , the ICFTU indicates that in the middle of March , Mr. Alexander Yovany Gmez Virula, a leader of the trade union in the RCA enterprise, was assassinated. Mr. Ivo Adio Garca Rivera, an official of the Trade Union of Electricity and Energy Workers was abducted and freed the following day after being submitted to severe psychological pressure and that these events were related to a work stoppage in August . Furthermore, the ICFTU alleges the assassination of Mr. Eric Osberto Berganza Pacheco, an official of the Trade Union of Workers of the National Electrification Institute on  July , which the trade union says was the result of his trade union activities. Further threats were also made against the trade unionist Dbora Guzmn and against the child which she was expecting, to make her force her husband, Flix Hernndez, an official of the Lunafil Trade Union, to leave the trade union. The ICFTU adds also that Mr. Ernesto Bol, an official of the Trade Union of the Workers of the City of Coban was severely beaten and insulted on  November  by unknown people; furthermore it was not possible for him to be reinstated in his post even with the existence of a judicial order to this effect.\n.Finally, the ICFTU alleges that in the Las Delicias farm, in Retalhuleu, which belongs to the Good Year S.A. Rubber Plantations multinational enterprise, attempts have been made for many years to destroy the Trade Union of Rubber Plantation Workers in the Las Delicias farm through radical anti-union measures designed to intimidate workers, such as the systematic dismissal of workers who were trade union members, violations of the fundamental right to engage in collective bargaining (the enterprise has appointed a group of non-unionized workers to represent all the workers) and the unacceptable measures of reprisal taken by the enterprise, such as the closing down of the school and clinic which depend on the enterprise and the recent refusal to pay wages for the last two months to unionized workers.\n.The Committee notes the willingness of the Government to reply to all the allegations and the extensive report of the Presidential Commission for the Coordination of Executive Policy on Human Rights and observes that it contains some information on most of the pending allegations concerning deaths, disappearances, acts of violence against trade unionists and anti-union dismissals. The Committee notes that proceedings or investigations have been initiated concerning the death of the trade unionists Juan Tarax and Lilian Elizabeth Jurez Escobar (the responsible official was placed before the competent court), Camilo Ajqui Gimon (who the Government denies as a unionist), Adrin Miranda Lpez and Velizario Lpez Rojas, the arrests of the trade unionists Silvio Pastor, Pablo Itzel, Teodoro Pastor, Rolando Pastor and Francisco Pastor (which resulted in the dismissal of a captain), the abduction of Walter Njera Molina (who was released), the disappearance of Gustavo Rosalio Vsquez Lpez and the attacks against Ernesto Bol. However, the Committee deeply regrets that the information supplied by the Government gives no indication that significant progress has been made in the investigations of the numerous cases of alleged violence. The Committee therefore requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard. The Committee also notes the information from the Government categorically denying the alleged police repression of strikers at the Social Security Institute on  February  (no force was used and the police presence was confined to guaranteeing freedom to work), and that the detention of officials of the STIGSS during a strike was for a short period and due to the unlawful seizure of vehicles, and that the guilty parties were fined by the magistrates court; the Government also denies that there has been any detention or arrest of trade unionists in the Mahler y Sucesoras enterprise on  March  and states that there was only a meeting held during working time and which resulted in the signing of documents in an agreement reached between the parties on the existing labour dispute.\n.The Committee notes that the Government requests clarification from the complainants on the following allegations: the death of Messrs. Jos Mara Incuyat, Julio Csar Prez and Pedro Genovevo Escobar, the armed attack against Mr. Victor Alfredo Chacoj and the attacks against Werner Coc Ramrez. The Committee therefore requests the complainants to provide the information available to them on these allegations to enable the Government to reply.\n.As regards the other allegations of deaths, disappearance or acts of violence against trade unionists, although the Committee notes that the Government states in some cases that no denunciations have been made, that the persons concerned were not trade union officials, that the events were not related to the trade union activities or functions of the victims or that the persons concerned have gone into exile abroad, the Committee emphasizes the need to open or continue investigations against those responsible for the offences committed (see the respective list in Annex I). In this respect, the Committee would like to reiterate the conclusions which it reached at its meeting in June  (see th Report, paras.  and ), which are reproduced below:The Committee deeply deplores the many violent deaths of trade union officials and trade unionists, as well as the disappearances, abductions, arbitrary arrests, acts of aggression and death threats which have occurred since the presentation of the complaints (), and expresses its deep concern at the situation of impunity (only in one of the assassinations to which the Government refers does it appear that the authors have been identified) and insists on the absolute need to open judicial inquiries on all the cases before the Committee with a view to ascertaining the facts and punishing the guilty parties. In this connection, the Committee recalls the commitment made by the Attorney-General of the Republic to open inquiries on all the cases placed before the Committee and asks the Government to keep it informed in this respect.Although it is aware of the difficult situation affecting Guatemala and of the Government\'s policy for the promotion of human rights, the Committee recalls that ""the rights of workers\' and employers\' organizations can only be exercised in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind against these organizations\' leaders and members and that it is for governments to ensure that this principle is respected"" (see st Report, Case No.  (Nicaragua), para. , and th Report,', 'the death threats and abduction of members of the trade union of the ESDEE Maquiladora enterprise: the Government is gathering information;- the attempted abduction of Mr. Pablo Mazariegos: no denunciation had been made because the victim was not sure who was responsible. He indicated that he has been subject to no recent persecution or threats;- the capture and torture of Mr. Eligio Quej Morn: the Government is collecting information;- the imprisonment of Mr. Rubn Terry Amzquita: he has left the country and gone into exile.\n.As concerns the allegations with respect to anti-union discrimination and practices contrary to collective bargaining, the Government provided the following information:- as concerns the collective dispute at the La Patria farm, a collective agreement providing for the reinstatement of the dismissed persons was signed with the mediation of the General Labour Inspectorate;- Ernesto Bol was reinstated in his job;- as concerns the attacks on Werner Coc Ramrez, the Government has asked for further information from the complainant about the place where this unionist works;- as concerns the MK S.A. and L&L S.A. enterprises, the respective judges have not yet handed down their judgements;- as concerns the refusal by the National Committee for the Blind and Deaf Mutes of Guatemala, the judicial proceedings have not yet been concluded;- as concerns the Unicasa S.A. and Welly S.A. enterprises, the General Labour Inspectorate initiated a penal trial before the judicial authority which is still pending;- the reinstatement of the workers on the El Salto farm continues to be discussed in the tribunals;- as concerns the Bolivia farm, thanks to a commission made up of various authorities and established at the request of the Popular Workers\' Federation, an agreement has been arrived at in which the parties withdrew the judicial action initiated;- as concerns the alleged refusal to negotiate in the Los Angeles farm, a collective agreement was made on  October  with the intervention of the General Labour Inspectorate;- as concerns the La Argentina farm, no denunciations were presented;- as concerns the Diseos y Maquilas S.A. enterprise, the industrial dispute was resolved with the making of a collective agreement.\n.In their communication of July , the IUF and the ICFTU state that Mrs. Flor de Mara Salguero de Laparra, a trade unionist of the Trade Union Federation of Food, Agro-Industry and Related Workers (FESTRAS), a trade union organization in the maquila sector, received death threats in ; on  May  she was abducted, drugged, beaten and raped; after her release she received further intimidating telephone calls recalling the assault against her on  May.\n.In its communications of July, October and December , the ICFTU indicates that in the middle of March , Mr. Alexander Yovany Gmez Virula, a leader of the trade union in the RCA enterprise, was assassinated. Mr. Ivo Adio Garca Rivera, an official of the Trade Union of Electricity and Energy Workers was abducted and freed the following day after being submitted to severe psychological pressure and that these events were related to a work stoppage in August . Furthermore, the ICFTU alleges the assassination of Mr. Eric Osberto Berganza Pacheco, an official of the Trade Union of Workers of the National Electrification Institute on  July , which the trade union says was the result of his trade union activities. Further threats were also made against the trade unionist Dbora Guzmn and against the child which she was expecting, to make her force her husband, Flix Hernndez, an official of the Lunafil Trade Union, to leave the trade union. The ICFTU adds also that Mr. Ernesto Bol, an official of the Trade Union of the Workers of the City of Coban was severely beaten and insulted on  November  by unknown people; furthermore it was not possible for him to be reinstated in his post even with the existence of a judicial order to this effect.\n.Finally, the ICFTU alleges that in the Las Delicias farm, in Retalhuleu, which belongs to the Good Year S.A.

It also indicates that a number of points in the collective agreement concluded in February  have not been implemented. The complainant considers that by acting in this way the Government is limiting the percentage increase in teachers?salaries and is obstructing the collective bargaining process, in violation of ILO Convention No. .\n.In an additional communication of  May , the UDA declares that the initial complaint now has the support of the Federation of Education Workers (FETE) and of the secretariat for education policies, a subordinate body of the General Confederation of Labour (CGT). The UDA indicates that, together with its members, it organized and carried out industrial action from March  in the search for a reformulation of salaries, among other labour claims, since the Government refused to reopen collective bargaining, namely to convene the federal joint negotiation board, and so the fixing of salaries remained in the hands of the State, against a background of  per cent year-on-year inflation. The industrial action, which was lawful and had been notified to the labour authority, received voluntary mass support from teachers in Argentina, who withdrew from their duties. The complainant alleges that, in addition to the failure to convene the joint negotiation board, the State decided to reduce the share of the Compensation Fund (financed by the Government) received by the seven provinces facing the greatest difficulties. According to official announcements, the intention of the Ministry of Education is to reduce that share by  per cent per year, until it disappears altogether in . As regards the Education Incentive Fund (FONID), the UDA states that even though it had been instituted for salary emergencies? it has become a normal and usual complement to teachers?salaries, albeit with the downside that it is not classified as remuneration and hence does not generate social security contributions.\n.Considering the salary situation in the Province of Buenos Aires to be unsustainable, the complainant indicates that it filed an action for amparo (protection of constitutional rights) at the end of March . As a protective measure, it requested the convening of the negotiation board provided for under section  of the Education Finance Act (No. ), with implementing regulations laid down by Decree No. /. By a decision of  April , the protective measure was granted in summary proceedings and the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security was ordered to convene within five days the negotiation board provided for by section  of Act No. . The State appealed against this decision in the National Chamber for Labour Appeals. The proceedings are in progress and no first-instance ruling had been issued by the end of May .\n.The UDA adds that on  March  the Government summoned the trade unions to a joint meeting during which it made a proposal consisting of the advance payment of one-off fixed sums not classified as remuneration (considered illegal and not generating contributions to the social security system) for serving employees, the payment being subject to non-implementation of the industrial action called for by the trade unions at the national level for  and  March . As the proposal was rejected, the Ministry of Labour of the Province of Buenos Aires did not put forward any other proposal but served notice of compulsory conciliation on the trade unions. The unions had recourse to the local court for administrative disputes and on  March  secured a ruling consisting of a protective measure. The ruling stated that if no agreement was reached between the parties, the dispute would be settled by a provisional impartial body set up by joint agreement for the sole purpose of settling the joint negotiations. This decision was then overturned by the appeals chamber for administrative disputes in La Plata. On  March , the court for administrative disputes, at a request from the unions, issued a new protective measure: (i) ordering the Executive Authority to refrain from implementing any act that disrupted, restricted, limited or affected the freedom of workers and their organizations in collective negotiations; and (ii) ordering the Ministry of Labour to take the necessary steps to ensure that collective bargaining goes ahead in an environment of good faith, freedom and equality between the parties.\n.The complainant also reports threats made by a number of officials in the Province of Buenos Aires (involving fines, declarations of illegality, revocation of trade union status, monetary deductions, etc.). In particular, it reports that an application was filed by the Ministry of Labour of the Province of Buenos Aires against the complainant for the suspension of trade union status (file No. ///).\n.The UDA further denounces the fact that, in an unprecedented measure in the Province of Buenos Aires, the governor of the province called on , volunteers to give educational support to the almost  million pupils in Buenos Aires for the duration of the stoppage called by the teachers?unions in March , at the start of the  academic year.\n.Lastly, the complainant indicates that the summons of  March  to joint negotiations was in reality a form of manipulation and deceit in relation to the trade unions, as the State showed no inclination to engage in dialogue but pursued the restriction of the right to strike as its sole objective. It alleges that the recourse to compulsory conciliation constitutes a violation of the Constitution of the Province of Buenos Aires and also of Acts Nos  and . The UDA also reiterates that the Ministry of Labour of the Province of Buenos Aires initiated the procedure calling for the suspension of its trade union status.\n.In its communication dated  February , FLATEC reports that the classroom allowance ?which is an additional component to the salary structure of private tutors based on Act No.  and Decree No.  of the Province of Mendoza ?has actually been established to obstruct the regular exercise of the right to strike of private tutors, through the imposition of fines and the withholding of salary. They state that the monetary allocation constitutes remuneration, and so it entails contributions in the areas of welfare, assistance and union dues, and is to be considered in the calculation of additional annual earnings. The classroom allowance is to be paid from March  for every employee covered by Act No. and its amendments who provides services in the Directorate-General for Schools, has the status of qualified teacher and performs assigned duties on all working days in the respective month, except for absences due to sick leave or accidents or any other leave on objective grounds defined by the abovementioned legislation.\n.The complainant objects to the fact that for just one day of strike action in the month concerned, the classroom allowance is not paid, which signifies a very serious withholding of salary, amounting to some  to  per cent of monthly pay. Hence the right to strike is penalized through an excessive loss of pay, which is far greater than the amount that corresponds to the strike day.\n.FLATEC also denounces the arbitrary and unlawful failure to implement the collective bargaining procedure of the federal joint negotiation board for education, and describes the historical background to the current dispute. It recalls that, in order to cut costs in educational matters and as part of commitments for the renegotiation of foreign debt, in January  the Executive Authority proposed, and Congress adopted, Act No.  concerning the transfer of education services to the provinces. This transfer resulted in a serious imbalance in the quality of', 'in that the key element of representativeness is disregarded; (iii) there is no right to information on collective bargaining matters since a close examination of the Decree shows that it abolishes the right to information within the joint negotiation board for education itself (section ), thereby denying the unions knowledge of employment levels in the education sector, investment policies, programmes for the introduction of new technologies, etc.; and (iv) there is also no possibility of requesting the Ministry of Labour to set up a board for collective agreement negotiations since section  of Decree No. / has been abolished.\n.Lastly, CTERA denounces the brutal crackdown by the police in the city of Buenos Aires on  April  against education workers and union officials belonging to CTERA, some of whom were unlawfully arrested and subsequently released, for attempting to set up the Mobile School?at the Plaza de los Dos Congresos with a view to calling on the Government, in ways other than work stoppages, to convene a national joint negotiation board in the sector. It also claims that the head of State, when referring to the teachers?salary claims, made offensive comments about the education unions.\n.In a communication dated  April , the Government states that at no time was there non-compliance on its part which would justify the complaint presented by the UDA. On the contrary, considerable progress had occurred in relation to the previous situation.\n.Firstly, the Government makes a clarification regarding the reference to the national Government (to which the Ministry of Education and Sport belongs) as the employer? For the Government, this assertion is far removed from reality. In this regard, it explains that in the early s legislation adopted by the national Congress (Act No.  and complementary legislation) provided that educational establishments that had hitherto been under the auspices of the national Government would now be directly governed by the provinces. Hence the legislation provided at that time for the transfer to the provinces of educational establishments and their teaching and non-teaching staff that until then had been under national direction. Consequently, from that time onwards no educational establishments, or any of the teachers employed there, were any longer under the control of the national Government. Hence it is incorrect to describe the national Government as the employer? There are  different sets of regulations relating to teaching, each of them applicable in their respective area of jurisdiction. According to the Government, this demonstrates that the central government is not the employer? the employers are the provinces plus the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, each having its respective territory.\n.As regards the framework agreement (provided for in section  of the Education Finance Act (No. ) and referred to in point  of the collective agreement of February ), the Government indicates that it should not be forgotten that even if reference is made to a framework agreement? what is essential is the existence of agreements between the parties in each province. On that basis, from a position already fixed internally, discussions on the framework agreement can begin with the aim of reaching basic agreements at national level. The Government indicates that section  of Act No.  of January  (implemented by Decree No. /), provides as follows: The Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (currently the Ministry of Education and Sport) together with the Federal Council for Culture and Education (currently the Federal Council for Education) and the teaching unions with national representation, shall conclude a framework agreement which shall include general guidelines relating to: (a)conditions of work; (b) the school calendar; (c) the minimum teaching salary; and (d) the teaching career. The Government explains that: (i) although no meetings were held from  to  for the purposes of formulating the framework agreement established in section of Act No.  ?there were only meetings at the start of each year to discuss the minimum teaching salary, which had been fixed by agreement with the unions in some cases, while other meetings had been prescribed by decree of the Executive Authority where there was no agreement ?this inaction ceased as from ; (ii) the foregoing does not alter the fact that it is a complicated, difficult task for the various regional jurisdictions, each having its own regulations relating to teachers, to reach basic agreements in relation to the creation of the framework agreement; and (iii) this whole situation goes far beyond the possibilities of the national Government, which depends on the decisions and policies of the various regional jurisdictions within the countrys federal system.\n.With regard to the minimum teaching salary (point  of the collective agreement of February ), namely the salary threshold below which no province may set the salary of any teacher, the Government explains that reaching agreement at that time on an automatic mechanism for increasing the minimum teaching salary was a significant step forward. The new mechanism agreed upon with the trade unions entails the automatic increase of the minimum salary, which is updated each year. This joint agreement establishes that the teaching salary must be at least  per cent higher than the minimum living wage, and this adjustment would be automatic, irrespective of any agreement reached in the joint negotiation board for education. For the Government, the clause regarding the automatic increase makes it unnecessary and merely academic to hold discussions on the minimum teaching salary each year. The automatic increase is calculated on the basis of the minimum living wage. This is fixed annually by the Council for the Minimum Living Wage, with the participation of workers, employers and representatives of the national Government and of the Federal Labour Council (provincial governments). Hence, in addition to the amount established annually as the general minimum wage by this Council, there is an extra  per cent as a fixed component of the minimum teaching salary for the year.\n.With regard to the Compensation Fund referred to in the complaint from the UDA, this is designed to complement (compensate) the earnings of teachers who do not reach the established minimum threshold. The aim is to help iron out disparities in the initial teaching salary in provinces where, despite financial input into the sector and greater efficiency in the allocation of resources, it is not possible to overcome those inequalities. This is separate from the FONID, which, simply providing incentives as its name suggests, has a totally different function from the Compensation Fund.\n.In a communication of March , the Government forwards information provided by the Ministry of Governance, Labour and Justice of the Province of Mendoza regarding the classroom allowance. It states that FLATEC brought a claim of unconstitutionality before the provincial court. However, it was withdrawn by the plaintiff. According to the Government, this demonstrates a lack of coherence in that the union renounced any local ruling but decided to pursue the matter at the international level in the ILO Committee on Freedom of Association. It also indicates that: (i) the Province of Mendoza is experiencing a severe financial emergency; (ii) in conformity with the terms of the national joint negotiations signed by the national union representatives on  February , the initial teaching salary was raised by implementing the Compensation Fund, with a further increase in the funds supplied by FONID, and stipulating that the teaching salary must now be at least  per cent above the minimum living wage, irrespective of any agreements reached in the joint negotiation board for education; (iii) the negotiations took place in accordance with all the principles of good faith negotiation. For each proposal made, appropriate efforts were made to reach agreements, within the current economic context and budget of the province; (iv) however, even though the province improved the initial proposal on several occasions, no agreement could be reached. It was here that the increase in the teaching salary was fixed by decree, chiefly safeguarding the right to education and thereby guaranteeing the resumption of classes; and (v) with regard to the classroom allowance, the provincial government considers that the whole complaint is based on the incorrect and unsubstantiated premise, that the classroom allowance is not designed to be an incentive for teacher productivity. On the contrary, the Government explains that this measure has had a direct positive impact with regard to teacher absenteeism, there has been a substantial improvement in pupil attendance and also a reduction in the number of replacement teachers required. The Government also denies categorically that the classroom allowance is a way for the legislation or Government to penalize the right to strike through substantial losses of teaching salary for just one stoppage or strike day.\n.Lastly, the Government attaches a copy of the decision of the Supreme Court of Justice of Mendoza, Second Chamber, in the case Single Union of Education Workers v. Government of Mendoza ?claim of unconstitutionality? dated  December , which calls on the Plenary Court to rule on the constitutionality of the legal provisions challenged in the case file (Decree No. / ratified by Act No.', 'in that the key element of representativeness is disregarded; (iii) there is no right to information on collective bargaining matters since a close examination of the Decree shows that it abolishes the right to information within the joint negotiation board for education itself (section ), thereby denying the unions knowledge of employment levels in the education sector, investment policies, programmes for the introduction of new technologies, etc.; and (iv) there is also no possibility of requesting the Ministry of Labour to set up a board for collective agreement negotiations since section  of Decree No. / has been abolished.\n.Lastly, CTERA denounces the brutal crackdown by the police in the city of Buenos Aires on  April  against education workers and union officials belonging to CTERA, some of whom were unlawfully arrested and subsequently released, for attempting to set up the Mobile School?at the Plaza de los Dos Congresos with a view to calling on the Government, in ways other than work stoppages, to convene a national joint negotiation board in the sector. It also claims that the head of State, when referring to the teachers?salary claims, made offensive comments about the education unions.\n.In a communication dated  April , the Government states that at no time was there non-compliance on its part which would justify the complaint presented by the UDA.

It also indicates that: (i) the Province of Mendoza is experiencing a severe financial emergency; (ii) in conformity with the terms of the national joint negotiations signed by the national union representatives on  February , the initial teaching salary was raised by implementing the Compensation Fund, with a further increase in the funds supplied by FONID, and stipulating that the teaching salary must now be at least  per cent above the minimum living wage, irrespective of any agreements reached in the joint negotiation board for education; (iii) the negotiations took place in accordance with all the principles of good faith negotiation. For each proposal made, appropriate efforts were made to reach agreements, within the current economic context and budget of the province; (iv) however, even though the province improved the initial proposal on several occasions, no agreement could be reached. It was here that the increase in the teaching salary was fixed by decree, chiefly safeguarding the right to education and thereby guaranteeing the resumption of classes; and (v) with regard to the classroom allowance, the provincial government considers that the whole complaint is based on the incorrect and unsubstantiated premise, that the classroom allowance is not designed to be an incentive for teacher productivity. On the contrary, the Government explains that this measure has had a direct positive impact with regard to teacher absenteeism, there has been a substantial improvement in pupil attendance and also a reduction in the number of replacement teachers required. The Government also denies categorically that the classroom allowance is a way for the legislation or Government to penalize the right to strike through substantial losses of teaching salary for just one stoppage or strike day.\n.Lastly, the Government attaches a copy of the decision of the Supreme Court of Justice of Mendoza, Second Chamber, in the case Single Union of Education Workers v. Government of Mendoza ?claim of unconstitutionality? dated  December , which calls on the Plenary Court to rule on the constitutionality of the legal provisions challenged in the case file (Decree No. / ratified by Act No.']"

On  October , the personnel director of the National Directorate for Human Resources of SUNAT sent the communications and public relations secretary electronic memorandum No. --F, in which he was accused of having used the institutional email system on  October  for non-work-related purposes, dealing with personal matters during working hours, and was therefore requested to submit a report on the matters described within three days. It should be pointed out that no evidence was included in support of the accusations made. Nonetheless, on  October  the abovementioned employee attempted to remedy this by sending Mr Jorge Carrillo Vrtiz memorandum\n.According to the complainant organization, these disciplinary proceedings against the communication and public relations secretary and the Defence Secretary were prompted by the sending of an email to a group of union members informing them of action taken by SINAUT SUNAT in defence of workers' rights, such as the filing of amparo proceedings to reach a settlement on the list of demands for '  through arbitration; the presentation of a new complaint to the ILO concerning anti-union practices; the status of the execution of a Constitutional Court ruling ordering the standardization of remuneration of all SUNAT employees; and developments in the labour inspectorate with regard to compensation for delayed use of annual leave entitlement. However, it is especially important to mention that the email also informed members that complaints against officials of the National Directorate of Human Resources (including the director of personnel, Ms Miriam Daz Colmenares) had been filed with the internal oversight body, the Office of the Comptroller General of the Republic and Congress for repeated noncompliance with social and labour legislation. This makes it all the more obvious that the disciplinary proceedings initiated by SUNAT, referred to in the present complaint, in fact constitute a flagrant act of retaliation for the exercise of our activity in defence of our trade union rights, since the official who instituted them is one of the persons against whom our trade union has filed a complaint.\n.In its communication of  February , referring to SINAUT SUNAT s allegations, the Government reports that SUNAT states the following:' Unlawful deduction from wages on account of the strike held by members of SINAUT SUNAT. Section (b) of Supreme Decree No. --TR approving the consolidated text of the Collective Labour Relations Act (TUO-LRCT) provides that the effects of a strike include suspension of all the obligations of an individual contract, including that of paying remuneration. Therefore the deduction in this case should have been made only for the two days not worked, in accordance with section  of Legislative Decree No. , read together with section  of the implementing regulations, approved by Supreme Decree No. --TR. In response to letter No. - sent by SINAUT SUNAT, SUNAT has reviewed each of the cases referred to in the complaint, which cover , workers, in order to determine the amounts deducted and verify the items under which they were deducted and the sums to be reimbursed; this task was completed in October this year. The reimbursement of the amounts deducted for the Sunday began in November. Thus it cannot be said that there was no response to the communication sent by SINAUT SUNAT, since the necessary verification has been carried out.' Failure to deduct fines imposed on workers by the trade union for not having participated in the strike. SUNAT states that it respects the sanctity of the wages of its employees, and therefore did not deduct the amounts of the fines imposed by the trade union on the workers who did not observe the strike on  and  December , as there is no legal basis for doing so, since section  of Legislative Decree No. -TR approving the TUO-LRCT provides that the employer is only obliged to deduct from remuneration the statutory ordinary and extraordinary trade union dues of its unionized workers at the request of their trade unions and with the worker s written consent. The General National Budget System Act provides that  The uniform payroll system may only be affected by the deductions stipulated by law, by court order or other items accepted by the official or retiree, with the approval of the Director-General of Administration or the person acting as his replacement'  Accordingly, SINAUT SUNAT was informed by letter No. --SUNAT/F that SUNAT is not obliged to deduct fines imposed by the trade union on its members, or contributions arising from particular relationships it may establish.' SUNAT scheduled an internal competition to fill vacant managerial posts, the timetable of which coincided with the dates previously fixed for the strike. SUNAT states that on  April   Guidelines for filling vacant managerial posts' were approved, in view of the fact that there were managerial posts to be filled; as of that date, preparations were made to carry out the selection procedures to fill the vacancies. SUNAT s activity and procedures are carried out in a structured and planned manner, and therefore cannot anticipate potential events. Thus, in memorandum No.  -SUNAT/F of  September , a proposal for filling the vacancies was sent to the Deputy National Superintendent for Internal Revenue. This communication predates the date on which SINAUT SUNAT decided, in an extraordinary general assembly on  October , to hold the strike.' SUNAT took it upon itself to designate part of its activities as essential services, unlawfully requesting its employees, in the event of a strike, to guarantee the presence of the necessary staff to prevent the interruption of its activities. SUNAT states that letter No. --SUNAT/F, which it sent to SINAUT SUNAT to inform it of the occupations and number of workers necessary to maintain essential minimum services, was not intended to restrict the workers' constitutional right to strike, as the letter was based on section  of Supreme Decree No. --TR, the Collective Labour Relations Act, and on section  of Supreme Decree No. --TR, the Regulations issued under the Collective Labour Relations Act ' provisions which set out two cases of exceptions to stoppages. One of these consists of essential public services, which are specifically listed, and which do not cover the tax administration; the second case, which includes work essential to the enterprise, the interruption of which would endanger persons, safety or property or prevent the immediate resumption of the normal activity of the enterprise once the strike has ended, does cover the services of the tax administration; in view of the nature of its functions and of the fact that tax and customs procedures are subject to statutory time limits, it is essential to guarantee the continuity of services to that end.' SUNAT withdrew permission to use the institutional email system for communications of trade union members. SUNAT states that at no time did it authorize the use of email for purposes other than those strictly related to work, as laid down in sections (u) and (g) of the SUNAT Staff Regulations. Moreover, it states that in Circular No. - of  March  it set out rules governing the email system, stipulating that it is an official means of communication and information exchange provided to employees, who should use it exclusively for the performance of their duties, in accordance with section . of the general provisions of Departmental Decision No. --INEI, approving Directive No. --INEI on  Rules for the use of email in public administration bodies'  a copy of which is attached. Letter No. --SUNAT/F sent by the Department of Personnel Management to the general secretary of the trade union is a reminder on the appropriate use of email, as is clear from paragraph  of the letter, which reads as follows:  You are reminded that this organization has established rules for the use of institutional email, of which all staff members are aware...'  it thus does not constitute a revocation, since, as pointed out above, there was never any authorization to use the email system for purposes other than those laid down in the abovementioned rules.' SUNAT has displayed an evident unwillingness to communicate with SINAUT SUNAT. SUNAT states that this assertion is unfounded, since it has held a number of meetings with SINAUT SUNAT representatives, such as those held by the National Superintendent of SUNAT on  and  April , in which it heard union officials Paola Aliaga Huatuco and Edmstines Montoya Jara, as well as meetings held on  January  and  February  with the Deputy National Superintendent for Internal Revenue, and meetings with the National Director of Human Resources on  March  and  November . In addition, constant efforts are being made to maintain a positive industrial relations climate, and in seeking solutions at both individual and collective levels.' SUNAT refuses to grant the trade union the facilities necessary to enable"", ""remuneration of all SUNAT workers should be standardized. Mr Montoya was therefore granted professional III status, which increased his salary from ,. to ,. nuevos soles and, from January , to , nuevos soles. The Government adds that it is true that the labour administration authority fined SUNAT, but the fine was revoked by the higher authority in Resolution No. --MTPE//. on the basis of the arguments set out. Taking into account the Government s arguments and information and the promotion and salary increases from which union official Mr Edmstines Montoya Jara has benefited, the Committee will not pursue its examination of this allegation.\n.With regard to its recommendation concerning the disciplinary proceedings against union representatives for alleged misuse of email (Defence Secretary Ms Mara Covarrubias and communication and public relations secretary Mr Jorge Carrillo Vrtiz), in which the Committee requested the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the inquiry to be conducted in that regard, the Committee takes note of the Government s statements that: () the labour administration authority ruled that SUNAT had committed no offence against Mr Carrillo because legal provisions exist concerning the use of email in public institutions; and () the labour administration authority issued an inspection order in . The Committee requests the Government to send the administrative authority s existing and future decisions concerning these two officials. The Committee observes that restricting the union s use of email is an important issue for the union and one which caused collective bargaining to break down. The Committee takes note of the Government s statement that SUNAT has made improvements in its facilities for unions (such as the use of notice boards to publicize information) and points out that the union did not include the issue of email use among the matters to be dealt with in arbitration over its list of demands for ' . Although it has taken account of this information provided by the Government, the Committee recalls that workers' representatives should enjoy such facilities as may be necessary for the proper exercise of their functions, including access to workplaces and the use of email. Recalling that access to employers' facilities should not be exercised to the detriment of the efficient functioning of the enterprise concerned, the Committee suggests that the employer and the workers' organization strive to reach agreement on the modalities for the use of email.\n.With regard to the Committee s recommendations requesting the Government to send its comments on the complainant s allegations that the administrative authority authorized SUNAT (the employer) to express its views on the declaration of a strike on  and  November , the Committee takes note of the Government s statements that: () the allegation refers to the declaration of inadmissibility (made by the administrative authority) concerning the complainant s notification of the timing of this strike; and () during the appeals procedure, the administrative authority identified irregularities in voting (the records do not state whether the decision was adopted by a ballot of members present and eligible to vote, as stipulated in the union s statutes; furthermore, the total number of members from Lima who attended the assembly does not match either the number given in other documents or the total stated in point  of the sworn declaration made by the union s executive committee). The Government adds that SUNAT s alleged authorization by the administrative authority to express its views on the declaration of a strike stems from the fact that both the union and SUNAT are entitled to challenge administrative decisions. The Committee takes note of this information.\n.The Committee takes note of the allegations made by the CATP concerning practices by SUNAT, during negotiations on SINAUT SUNAT s list of demands for ' , that go against the principles of collective bargaining and good faith (delaying tactics, lack of specific proposals during the direct negotiation phase, lack of willingness to find solutions to demands of an economic nature on the grounds that budgetary limits must be respected, counter-proposals on non-economic issues, put forward by SUNAT during the conciliation phase, that did not represent any real improvement, communication from SUNAT to the union right in the middle of conciliation proceedings instructing it to refrain from using the email system for union purposes that had always previously been accepted). The CATP adds that, in this context, the union asked for the matter to be referred to arbitration and that, although an  extra-procedural' meeting was held at which SUNAT submitted a document describing various measures taken on some of the demands included in the union s list as  SUNAT policy'  the union pointed out that these unilateral decisions could not be viewed as benefits obtained through collective bargaining, since they could be amended or revoked.\n.The Committee observes that the complainant highlights a previous case concerning SUNAT that involves the list of demands for ' , in which the Committee emphasized that the impossibility of negotiating wage increases on an ongoing basis is contrary to the principle of free and voluntary collective bargaining enshrined in Convention No. .\n.The Committee observes that the Government, as an indication of SUNAT s willingness to bargain, states that there have been collective agreements with two other union organizations operating at SUNAT, one of which is the National Federation of Customs and Taxation Workers; the Government emphasizes that arbitration with SUNAT is possible (the Government refers to an arbitration award in proceedings between SUNAT and the complainant) and that the complainant could have recourse to the same procedure for the list of demands for ' , by virtue of a  ministerial resolution, if there is a lack of good faith in bargaining, provided that the requirements set out in the resolution are met (completing a training course ' first organized in December  ' and being included on the National Register of Arbitrators). The Committee observes that the Government states that the  ministerial resolution, in accordance with legislation and the practice of the Constitutional Court, provides for the possibility of negotiating increases in remuneration within previously authorized budgetary allocations, so long as it is taken into account that any such financing must be planned using resources directly raised by the public body in question.\n.The Committee takes note of the Government s statements denying any lack of good faith on the part of SUNAT and pointing out that SUNAT had participated in bargaining meetings to try and reach agreement during the direct negotiation, conciliation and extra-procedural phases, and that records show that discussions took place between the parties in order to reach agreement as far as possible. The Committee takes note of the Government s statement that the fact that SUNAT s representatives were unable to review the extensive documentation submitted by the union, as reflected in the minutes of the conciliation meeting ( September ), cannot be taken as an indication of bad faith, as the information was only received on  and  September. The Committee observes that the Government recognizes certain restrictions on the negotiation of economic provisions for budgetary reasons, although it seems that the situation has subsequently evolved from a legal point of view.\n.The Committee concludes, based on the statements made by the complainant and the Government, that the representatives of SUNAT participated in all phases of the bargaining process concerning the list of demands for ' , that there was discussion between the parties and that the employer representatives made counter-proposals (although the complainant claims that they represented no real improvement). The Committee considers SUNAT s practice of granting certain improvements in conditions to public servants, not within the framework of a collective agreement, but as unilateral decisions, even though they relate to bargaining matters (which makes it more a consultation than bargaining), to be more problematic. The Committee observes, in this respect, that the Government confirms that, during the bargaining process, SUNAT indicated that, despite no agreement having been reached, nine demands (which the complainant recognizes were related to some union demands) had already been acknowledged and acted upon, as detailed in the Government s reply. In the Committee s view, this practice does not promote collective bargaining and should be avoided.\n.The Committee observes that, in this case, as in previous cases concerning Peru, bargaining on provisions that imply increases in remuneration has run into significant difficulties in practice, and also that the applicable standards require further clarification (for instance, the state grants general bonuses to its employees). The Committee observes that, in this case, the arbitration requested by the complainant with regard to the list of demands for '  did not take place and that the bargaining process extended beyond the period it was intended to cover (as can be seen, for example, from this case and from the Government s statements regarding the date of the arbitration award for the '  list of demands). The Committee observes that arbitration in public bodies is covered by a  ministerial resolution that allows for"", 'facts, determining responsibility and punishing those responsible. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.(d) The Committee requests the Government to repeal Emergency Decree No. -, Ministerial Resolution No. --EF/ and Emergency Decree No. - so as to guarantee that the parties themselves decide whether they wish to include productivity criteria in determining wages in collective bargaining.\n.The complaints are contained in communications from the General Confederation of Workers of Peru (CGTP) and the Unified Trade Union of Petroleum, Energy, Oil and Refinery Workers of the Grau Region (SUTPEDARG), dated  August and  June  respectively, and in a communication from the Federation of Petroleum Workers of Peru (FETRAPEP), dated  April . The CGTP forwarded fresh allegations by letters of  August  and  June , and the FETRAPEP in a communication of  June . The Government responded by letter of  February,  April and  September .\n.Peru has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.In its communication of  August , the General Confederation of Workers of Peru (CGTP) alleges that article  of Emergency Decree No. -, published on  March , established that, in , state enterprises would conduct their pay policy for staff, whether covered by collective bargaining or not, through the award of a single productivity bonus which would not constitute a part of their basic remuneration and would be governed by resolution of the Ministry of Economics and Finance. In accordance with the aforementioned article, Ministerial Resolution No. --EF was published on  April ; this set the guidelines for the award of the Single Productivity Bonus (BUP), as well as the guidelines for simplifying the pay system of workers in state enterprises. The requirements established by the resolution for the award of the bonus in state enterprises were as follows: (a) the amount to be awarded should be set in accordance with the worker\'s level of responsibility, contribution and commitment, as reflected in an evaluation process conducted prior to the award; the evaluation criteria may be approved solely by the directorate, i.e. without the involvement of the trade union; (b) the resulting amount may be paid in instalments; (c) prior to this, the pay system must have been simplified on the basis of only two structural components (basic remuneration and consolidated bonus) and the integral remuneration agreements must have been signed in cases where remuneration exceeds , nuevo sols; (d) in the case of staff covered by collective bargaining, bonuses must be set and awarded as part of the collective bargaining process; and (e) a worker\'s total present income plus bonus (which as such may not be considered as a pay increase) may under no circumstances exceed the Maximum Income Level (TMI) established for the general manager or equivalent official in each enterprise. Similarly, the award of the BUP will depend in the last instance upon the extent to which the management objectives have been achieved, as set out in the management agreement concluded between the state enterprise and the Office of State Institutions and Bodies (OIOE), as stipulated by articles  and  of the aforementioned Ministerial Resolution. Those agreements specifically state the enterprise\'s commitments and the productivity bonus entitlement, provided that a high percentage of the planned objectives for  are achieved, failing which, no authorization will be issued to make bonus payments subject to the limits set in the agreement.\n.Furthermore, in accordance with the regulations applicable to collective bargaining, as cited by the CGTP, the directorates of state enterprises must submit to the OIOE, for its approval, the agreements signed with trade unions; this is required by Act No. , the Public Sector Budget Act; this constitutes a further encroachment upon the parties\' collective independence, above and beyond the constraints imposed by that instrument.\n.According to the CGTP, the strategy of placing the productivity bonus award exercise within the collective bargaining process is part of a policy gradually to replace the increases or compensation agreed upon with the workers. This constitutes an attempt to obviate the bargaining phase which, at present, addresses increases in remuneration, with implications in terms of compensation for service time, allowances, leave and others, in an endeavour to move on to the stage of regulating non-remuneration-related increases without any positive implications for workers\' rights and, apparently, without any extra labour costs for enterprises and with a further reduction in the Peruvian workers\' standard of living.\n.Accordingly, organizations such as the Federation of National Ports Enterprise Workers (FENTENAPU) and the Union of SEDEPAL Workers (SUTESAL) were coerced into signing their collective agreements with the respective state enterprises under the conditions imposed by the aforementioned instructions which, hence, limit the agreements regarding wage increases and, in particular, remuneration-related increases for the benefit of their members.\n.Furthermore, the members of the National Unified Federation of Health Workers (FENUTSSA) received a clear refusal from the Ministry of Health to negotiate upon the list of claims they presented this year, with the argument that, this year, the education sector required extra finances for the purpose of increasing the pay of administrative staff in various regions of the country. Similarly, the list of claims presented to the Ministry of Education by the United Education Trade Union of Peru (SUTEP), the Unified Trade Union of Education Centre Workers (SUTACE) and the National Federation of Education Administrative Workers (FENTASE) was disregarded upon grounds similar to those invoked in the health sector. All of this occurred despite the fact that salaries of public servants in health and education have been frozen for several years.\n.In its communication dated  August , the CGTP alleges that on  July  the Government handed over the railways of the state enterprise ENAFER S.A. to a consortium of private companies with domestic and foreign capital. This meant the dismissal of all workers already having undergone three staff rationalization operations involving more than , lay-offs since . The dismissals constitute a case of abuse by the Government, given that a technical study by the World Bank indicates that the staff necessary for the enterprise to function is , workers. The new operator is only required to recruit former ENAFER S.A. workers to meet its own needs; the recruitment is for one year and may be carried out directly or through third parties. In this way, the majority of the , workers will lose their jobs whereas they are above  years of age and, also, the majority of those that manage to be recruited will be so by third parties. The CGTP points out that the offers made to the trade unions by ENAFER S.A. to bring about their acceptance of the terminations was to pay compensation to the tune of  nuevo sols (less than US$) in respect of each year of service - which is equivalent to the present basic wage of an ENAFER S.A. worker with  to  years of service. This remuneration is lower than the minimum remuneration for the purpose of calculating compensation, which is currently set at  nuevo sols per year of service and an indemnity of $,. The enterprise\'s proposals were turned down.\n.The railway union representatives made a counter-proposal: recruitment guarantees for a minimum of five years; an increase in basic remuneration comprising  nuevo sols of basic wage, an ""economic package"" of  nuevo sols per month that had already been paid; a compensatory bonus of $,, etc. This counter-proposal was rejected and ENAFER S.A. sent out notarial letters to each of the , workers. These letters invited them to accept its proposal, setting a deadline of  August  for the return of the signed letters, failing which they were threatened with termination as part of a collective dismissal already accepted by the Ministry of Labour, with the loss of the $, indemnity and with not being included in the list of workers to be supplied to the new operator for recruitment purposes. The CGTP adds that, in these circumstances, it was agreed to call a strike on  August . On  August, the Government initiated indiscriminate, unjustified and brutal repression of railway workers, their spouses and children camping out around the railway stations of Chosica (Lima), Cuzco and Arequipa. This violent repression left many people injured with contusions and instances of asphyxia, above all amongst the children and women on account of the large quantity of tear gas used by the police. In Cuzco,  workers were detained. On  August, there was industrial action in Lima, organized jointly by the telephone- and dockworkers\' unions, as well as in Arequipa and Chosica to protest at the police repression. Meetings were held with the chairpersons of the National Congress Labour and Transport Committees as well as with the Deputy Minister of Transport although, to date, the Government\'s position has remained unchanged and it has declared the strike illegal.\n.In its communication of ']"

The Committee strongly urges the Government to take all necessary measures to ensure that FEDECAMARAS is able to exercise its rights as an employers' organization in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind against its leaders and members and to promote, together with that organization, social dialogue based on respect.(b) As regards the abduction and mistreatment in  of FEDECAMARAS leaders Mr Noel lvarez, Mr Luis Villegas, Mr Ernesto Villamil and Ms Albis Muoz (the latter sustained three bullet wounds), while noting the sentencing of one of the accused to  years and eight months' imprisonment, the Committee requests the Government to send a copy of the ruling issued and to continue providing additional information concerning any penalties imposed on the perpetrators of these crimes, and concerning any compensation to FEDECAMARAS and to the leaders concerned for damage caused by those illegal acts. Furthermore, the Committee reiterates its request to the Government to send its observations concerning the points raised by FEDECAMARAS with regard to the bomb attack on its headquarters on  February .(c) As regards the allegations of the seizure of farms, land recoveries, occupations and expropriations to the detriment of current or former employers' leaders, the Committee insists that those current or former leaders of FEDECAMARAS be compensated in a just manner. At the same time, the Committee refers to the decision of the Governing Body in March , in which it  urged the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to develop and implement the Plan of Action as recommended by the high-level tripartite mission, in consultation with national social partners'  which in turn refers to  the establishment of a round table between the Government and FEDECAMARAS, with the presence of the ILO, to deal with all pending matters relating to the recovery of estates and the expropriation of enterprises and other related problems arising or that may arise in the future'  The Committee regrets that the Government stated in previous communications that establishing a dialogue round table on questions of recovery of estates and holding consultations on legislation are not viable and that, in its latest communication, it merely indicates that it proceeded in compliance with the law. The Committee firmly urges the Government to implement this request along the lines described in the conclusions and to report thereon. Lastly, like the high-level tripartite mission, the Committee emphasizes  the importance of taking every measure to avoid any kind of discretion or discrimination in the legal mechanisms governing the expropriation or recovery of land or other mechanisms that affect the right to own property' (d) As regards the structured bodies for bipartite and tripartite social dialogue which need to be established in the country, and the plan of action in consultation with the social partners, involving the establishment of stages and specific time frames for its implementation with the technical assistance of the ILO, as recommended by the Governing Body, the Committee regrets the lack of information and further progress in this regard. The Committee recalls that the conclusions of the mission also refer to a round table between the Government and FEDECAMARAS, with the presence of the ILO, and a tripartite dialogue round table, with the participation of the ILO and an independent chairperson. The Committee urges the Government to immediately adopt tangible measures with regard to bipartite and tripartite social dialogue as requested by the high-level tripartite mission. Observing that the Government has not yet provided the requested plan of action, the Committee urges the Government to implement fully without delay the conclusions of the high-level tripartite mission endorsed by the Governing Body and to report thereon. The Committee urges the Government to promote social dialogue and initiatives taken in this area, such as the meetings held between the authorities and FEDECAMARAS in February and October , and to implement tripartite consultations immediately.(e) The Committee, in line with the conclusions of the high-level tripartite mission, urges the Government to take immediate action to create a climate of trust based on respect for employers' and trade union organizations with a view to promoting solid and stable industrial relations. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of any measures taken in this regard. The Committee regrets that the Government has not appointed a representative of FEDECAMARAS to the Higher Labour Council or the social dialogue body fulfilling its functions, and urges the Government to do so as soon as possible.(f) The Committee, having noted the Government s observations concerning the allegations of detention and trial of employers and leaders in various sectors, regrets that once again a full answer has not been provided in relation to the individuals who are the subject of investigation procedures. As regards the cases of Corporacin Crnica and the  Da a Da Practimercados' chain, the Committee urges the Government to indicate the specific allegations against the people under investigation or trial by the judicial authorities, and not merely give an indication of general criminal offences, and to provide information on the progress of the respective judicial proceedings and their compliance with precautionary or detention measures. The Committee again requests the authorities to consider lifting any preventive detention measures imposed on employers' and business leaders pending trial. As regards the allegation of the detention of the managers of the FARMATODO pharmacy chain, the Committee requests the Government to confirm whether the charges against these individuals have been dropped or, if not, to indicate the specific allegations against them and to provide information on the progress of the respective judicial proceedings; and, in view of the complainants' allegation that four of the owners and managers of this pharmacy chain had been arrested, the Committee urges the Government to indicate whether any other individuals are currently under arrest or trial, and it invites the complainant organizations to provide the Government and the Committee with any detailed information that they may have on this matter.(g) As regards the allegations of the detention of the president of CONINDUSTRIA, Mr Eduardo Garmendia, the president of ANSA, Mr Luis Rodrguez, and the president of the Venezuelan Association of Clinics and Hospitals, Mr Rosales Briceo, and allegations of shadowing and harassment of the president of FEDECAMARAS, Mr Jorge Roig, given the divergences between the allegations and the Government s reply, the Committee invites the complainants to provide the Government and the Committee with additional information, including any evidence they may have, and it urges the Government, on the basis of such information, to carry out any relevant additional investigations and to keep the Committee informed on this matter.(h) As regards the adoption by the President of the Republic, in November , of  decree-laws on important economic and production-related issues without consulting FEDECAMARAS, the Committee regrets that the Government has not made any observation concerning their impact on social dialogue and, deeply deploring the persistence of this situation, it firmly expects that full consultations will be held in the future with the most representative organizations of workers and employers, including FEDECAMARAS, on draft legislation covering labour or social matters that affect their interests and those of their members.(i) The Committee expresses its deep concern at the lack of information and progress on the above issues and urges the Government to take all the requested measures without delay.(j) The Committee notes with great concern the new allegations of the IOE and FEDECAMARAS dated  May , in which it is alleged: (i) the enactment in December , without consultation with the social partners, of  national laws, including the law on job security; (ii) semblance of dialogue through communications to FEDECAMARAS by the Government, when it has already announced or adopted the measures concerned; (iii) the unilateral promulgation without prior consultation of the Decree of the President of the Republic declaring a state of emergency for economic hardship; (iv) new acts of intimidation against FEDECAMARAS; (v) approval without consultation of a new increase in the minimum wage and the value of the socialist Cestaticket in February ; and (vi) failure by the Government to implement the road map presented to the Governing Body of the ILO in March . The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on these allegations without delay so that the Committee can examine all the relevant elements.(k)"", ""Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.In its previous examination of the case in March , the Committee made the following recommendations on the matters still pending [see rd Report, para. ]:(a)\tRegarding the abduction and maltreatment of the FEDECAMARAS leaders, Messrs Noel lvarez, Luis Villegas, Ernesto Villamil and Ms Albis Muoz (Employer member of the Governing Body of the ILO), the latter being wounded by three bullets, the Committee deplores the offences that were committed, emphasizes their seriousness and requests the Government to take all the steps within its power to arrest the other three persons involved in the abductions and wounding, and to keep it informed of developments in the investigations. The Committee notes the Government s statement that a public hearing was scheduled for  October  and expresses the hope that the persons guilty of these crimes will soon be convicted and sentenced in proportion to the seriousness of the offences in order that such incidents will not be repeated and requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect. At the same time, the Committee notes with concern the IOE s statement in its additional information that Ms Albis Muoz, employers' leader and one of the victims of aggression, has asserted that neither of the suspects arrested (Mr Antonio Jos Silva Moyega and Mr Jason Manjares) were the instigators of the aggression, as well as the IOE s reservations as to the idea that the motive of the aggression was car theft.(b)\tRegarding the criminal investigation ordered by the Public Prosecutor s Office into the public declarations by the President of FEDECAMARAS, Mr Noel lvarez, the Committee wishes to state that, in the context described by the IOE, the declarations do not in its opinion appear to contain any criminal content and should not normally have given rise to a criminal investigation. However, so that it can reach its conclusions in full possession of the facts, the Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the allegation.(c)\tRegarding the alleged attacks on FEDECAMARAS headquarters in , the Committee had requested FEDECAMARAS to file an official complaint on the subject with the Public Prosecutor s Office. The Committee reiterates that recommendation and indicates that if the organization has not done so by the Committee s next meeting, it will not pursue its examination of this allegation any further; noting however that an environment of harassment and lack of confidence in the public authorities is not conducive to the proposed lodging of its official complaints.(d)\tRegarding the alleged bomb attack on FEDECAMARAS headquarters on  February , the Committee notes the Government s statement that the persons charged, Mr Juan Crisstomo Montoya Gonzlez and Mrs Ivonne Gioconda Mrquez Burgos, have confessed in full to the crimes of public intimidation and unlawful use of identity papers, that a preliminary public hearing was set for  November  and that, as soon as a final ruling on the case was handed down, the Committee would be duly informed. The Committee emphasizes the importance that the guilty parties should be punished in proportion to the seriousness of the crimes committed and the employer organization compensated for the loss and damage on account of these illegal acts. The Committee is waiting to be informed of the sentence handed down.(e)\tObserving the various acts of violence committed against FEDECAMARAS or its officials, the Committee again draws the attention of the Government to the fundamental principle that the rights of workers' and employers' organizations can be exercised only in a climate free of violence, intimidation and fear, as such situations of insecurity are incompatible with the requirements of Convention No. .(f)\tRegarding the Committee s recommendation that the Government restore the La Bureche farm to the employers' leader, Mr Eduardo Gmez Sigala, and compensate him fully for all the damage caused by the authorities in occupying the farm, the Committee notes that there is a contradiction between the allegations and the Government s judgment that the expropriated farm of employers' leader Mr Eduardo Gmez Sigala was idle. Be that as it may, the Committee observes that the Government does not deny the IOE s allegation that the farm is currently a military training centre (as opposed to the Government s statement that the purpose of the land rescue procedure is to encourage the agricultural use of the Valle del Ro) or the allegation that Mr Eduardo Gmez Sigala has not received any compensation. The Committee therefore once again calls on the Government to respond fully to the allegations, return the farm property without delay to the employers' leader and compensate him fully for all losses sustained as a result of the intervention by the authorities in seizing his farm.(g)\tThe Committee requests the complainant organizations to send their comments on the information and observations presented by the Government concerning the expropriation of Agroislea SA, Owen Illinois and the Turbio steel plant.(h)\tThe Committee invites the complainants to provide their observations on the Government statement on the livestock farmer Mr Franklin Brito.(i)\tRegarding the alleged confiscation ( rescue'  according to the Government) of the farms owned by the employers' leaders, Mr Egildo Lujn, Mr Vicente Brito, Mr Rafael Marcial Garmendia and Mr Manuel Cipriano Heredia, the Committee considers that it is impossible to discount the possibility of discrimination. The Committee requests the Government to ensure that they are granted fair compensation without delay and to initiate a frank dialogue with those affected and with FEDECAMARAS on the confiscations/rescues referred to and to keep it informed of developments. The Committee also requests the Government to send its observations on the attacks on the buildings owned by Mr Carlos Sequera Ypez, former President of FEDECAMARAS.(j)\tRegarding the alleged lack of bipartite and tripartite social dialogue with FEDECAMARAS, the Committee notes with concern the IOE s new allegations concerning the approval without any tripartite consultation of laws that affect the interests of employers and their organizations. The Committee regrets that the Government has not responded specifically to these allegations of the IOE and urges it to do so without delay. Moreover, observing that the serious shortcomings in social dialogue continue to exist, the Committee reiterates its earlier recommendation, as follows:' deeply deploring that the Government has ignored its recommendations, the Committee urges the Government to establish a high-level joint national committee in the country with the assistance of the ILO, to examine each and every one of the allegations and issues in this case so that the problems can be solved through direct dialogue. The Committee trusts that the Government will not postpone the adoption of the necessary measures any further and urges the Government to keep it informed in this regard;' the Committee expects that a forum for social dialogue will be established in accordance with the principles of the ILO, having a tripartite composition which duly respects the representativeness of workers' and employers' organizations. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard and invites it to request technical assistance from the ILO. The Committee also requests it once again to convene the tripartite commission on minimum wages provided for in the Organic Labour Act;' observing that there are still no structured bodies for tripartite social dialogue, the Committee emphasizes once more the importance that should be attached to full and frank consultation taking place on any questions or proposed legislation affecting trade union rights and that it is essential that the introduction of draft legislation affecting collective bargaining or conditions of employment should be preceded by detailed consultations with the most representative independent workers' and employers' organizations. The Committee once again requests the Government to ensure that any legislation concerning labour, social and economic issues adopted in the context of the Enabling Act be first subject to genuine, in-depth consultations with the most representative independent employers' and workers' organizations, while endeavouring to find shared solutions wherever possible;' the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed with regard to social dialogue and any bipartite or tripartite consultations in sectors other than food and agriculture, and also with regard to social dialogue with FEDECAMARAS and its regional structures in connection with the various sectors of activity, the formulation of economic and social policy and the drafting of laws which affect the interests of the employers and their organizations;' the Committee requests the Government to ensure that as part of its policy of inclusive dialogue (including within the Legislative Assembly), FEDECAMARAS is duly consulted in the course of any legislative debate that may affect employer interests, in a manner commensurate with its level of representativeness.The Committee deeply deplores that the Government has once again ignored these recommendation despite the fact that the Committee has been insisting on them for years.(k)\tRegarding the alleged discrimination by the authorities against FEDECAMARAS and the allegations of favouritism vis--vis parallel organizations close to the Government and lacking in independence,"", ""Office into the public declarations by the President of FEDECAMARAS, Mr Noel lvarez, the Committee wishes to state that, in the context described by the IOE, the declarations do not in its opinion appear to contain any criminal content and should not normally have given rise to a criminal investigation.

According to information received by the mission, Guatemala is living in a state of insecurity because of the persistent policy of intimidation and terror employed against the population, while the practice of arrest and disappearance has become a standard and systematic instrument of repression from which an alarming number of victims have suffered, especially trade union leaders both in the towns and in the country.\n.The ICFTU adds that the mission drew up a list of cases of arrest and disappearance, assassinations and attacks on trade union leaders and activists;  instances of arrest and disappearance and  assassinations were cited between  and May . The list of trade union leaders and members who have disappeared or been kidnapped, assassinated or physically attacked appears in an annex to this report. (This list does not include persons already cited in other cases brought before the Committee on Freedom of Association.)\n.In its communication dated  July , the WFTU refers to the kidnapping of trade union leader Felicita Floridalma Lucero, an allegation that was previously brought before the Committee in connection with Case No. .\n.In its communication dated  September , FASGUA alleges that on  September  the body was discovered of Eleazar Esa Barrera Martnez, an employee of the textile factory Fbrica de Tejidos Imperial who had been kidnapped during mass demonstrations against the increase in prices and in support of wage claims. According to FASGUA, his body was found hanging by the neck from an electric wire and bore signs of torture.\n.FASGUA adds that on the morning of  September  nurse Rita Josefina Pineda Aldana was kidnapped by armed men.\n.Finally, FASGUA alleges that on  September ,  members of the National Army supported by  artillery trucks and about  tanks launched an attack on the University of San Carlos and searched every building, including the headquarters of the University Workers\' Union where they caused extensive damage and seized trade union documents.\n.The Government states in its communications dated  August  that all the complaints concerning alleged violations of freedom of association communicated to it by the ILO have been passed on to the Ministry of the Interior with instructions to transmit to the Committee on Freedom of Association any information that may come to light as a result of its inquiries.\n.The Government adds that a copy of the statement it received to the effect that Floridalma Lucero y Lucero and Amancio Samuel Villatoro had disappeared has been communicated to the competent tribunal and that investigations are being conducted to determine their whereabouts. With respect to the disappearance of Julin Revolorio, Raymundo Prez, Yolanda Urizar Martnez de Aguilar, Manuel Francisco Contreras, Jos Luis Ramos, Luis Estrada, Victor Ascn, Lucrecia Orellana, Graciela Samayoa and her children, Fermn Solano, Antonio Argeta and Sergio Venicio Samayoa Morales, the Government states that none of the persons cited are being held in any of the country\'s detention centres but that inquiries are being made into their whereabouts. The Government indicates that, in the case of investigations of this nature, the judiciary is duly informed by the General Directorate of the National Police through the competent tribunal.\n.The Government states further that it has collaborated closely with the judiciary and the Supreme Court of Justice in the investigations into disappearances and in the habeas corpus proceedings. The Head of State has accordingly set up a committee consisting of representatives of the Ministry of National Defence, the State Prosecutor\'s Office and the Ministry of the Interior to determine the whereabouts of the persons listed as having disappeared; in its efforts to arrive at the truth, the Committee has conducted an investigation throughout the country, issued the necessary orders to all state security forces and invited the civilian authorities to collaborate. It appears from the investigations that the persons whose names appear on the list submitted by the Mutual Support Group to the committee are not being held in any penal or preventive detention centre in the country.\n.The Government goes on to state that the investigations must be considered as being still under way since, inter alia, it has not yet been possible to obtain the list of Guatemalan citizens who have emigrated to Mexico in order to determine whether some of the persons who have disappeared are listed as official residents of that country. The Government indicates that, at the request of the interested parties and in accordance with the law, the State Prosecutor\'s Office has initiated penal proceedings with the Court of First Instance and with the Justices of the Peace of the Penal Branch of the Departments of Petn, Quetzaltenango, Zacapa and Guatemala City in connection with alleged kidnappings and has taken part in proceedings already initiated.

According to the Government, the workers and the undertaking reached an agreement which included the payment of compensation. The only point on which agreement was not reached, despite the efforts of the General Labour Inspectorate, concerned five trade union leaders.

The Committee regrets that the Government has not supplied any details on the other  trade union leaders and members who have disappeared or on the alleged assassination of  trade union leaders and members and physical attacks on another union leader. The Committee further recalls that it had requested the Government to conduct a judicial inquiry into the attempted kidnapping and physical attacks on former trade union leader Alvaro Ren Sosa.\n.In these circumstances, the Committee recalls in general terms that when a climate of violence prevails in a country, this renders the exercise of trade union rights practically impossible and also recalls, as did the International Labour Conference in its  Resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties, that the absence of civil liberties removes all meaning from the concept of trade union rights and that the rights conferred on workers\' and employers\' organisations must be based on respect for those civil liberties.

The Government indicates that, in the case of investigations of this nature, the judiciary is duly informed by the General Directorate of the National Police through the competent tribunal.\n.The Government states further that it has collaborated closely with the judiciary and the Supreme Court of Justice in the investigations into disappearances and in the habeas corpus proceedings. The Head of State has accordingly set up a committee consisting of representatives of the Ministry of National Defence, the State Prosecutor\'s Office and the Ministry of the Interior to determine the whereabouts of the persons listed as having disappeared; in its efforts to arrive at the truth, the Committee has conducted an investigation throughout the country, issued the necessary orders to all state security forces and invited the civilian authorities to collaborate. It appears from the investigations that the persons whose names appear on the list submitted by the Mutual Support Group to the committee are not being held in any penal or preventive detention centre in the country.\n.The Government goes on to state that the investigations must be considered as being still under way since, inter alia, it has not yet been possible to obtain the list of Guatemalan citizens who have emigrated to Mexico in order to determine whether some of the persons who have disappeared are listed as official residents of that country. The Government indicates that, at the request of the interested parties and in accordance with the law, the State Prosecutor\'s Office has initiated penal proceedings with the Court of First Instance and with the Justices of the Peace of the Penal Branch of the Departments of Petn, Quetzaltenango, Zacapa and Guatemala City in connection with alleged kidnappings and has taken part in proceedings already initiated. The Government states that in the course of the investigations conducted in the various departments of the Republic, no allegations were made regarding the existence of detention centres other than the legally constituted penal centres for preventive detention and for the serving of prison sentences.\n.The Government declares that the committee has conducted a thorough official investigation at the national level, employing all possible means at its disposal, and that its report constitutes the most thorough investigation of the problem of ""disappeared persons"" that the present Government has carried out in its efforts to establish the facts.\n.Finally, with respect to the alleged closing down of operations at the Universal Textiles Factory, the Government states that the General Labour Inspectorate and the General Labour Directorate collaborated fully with the workers who had lodged a petition against its closure. According to the Government, the workers and the undertaking reached an agreement which included the payment of compensation. The only point on which agreement was not reached, despite the efforts of the General Labour Inspectorate, concerned five trade union leaders. Charges were accordingly brought against the undertaking in June  with the competent labour tribunal which has not yet handed down its ruling.\n.The Committee notes the Government\'s statement that the Head of State has set up a committee consisting of representatives of the Ministry of National Defence, the State Prosecutor\'s Office and the Ministry of the Interior to determine the whereabouts of the persons listed as having disappeared and that the Committee has conducted a nation-wide investigation with the collaboration of the civilian and military authorities. The Committee also notes that, according to the Government, the persons listed as having disappeared are not being held in any penal or preventive detention centre.\n.The Committee notes that, according to the Government, inquiries have been made into the whereabouts of trade union leaders Felicita Floridalma Lucero y Lucero, Amancio Samuel Villatorio and Sergio Vinicio Samayoa Morales. The Committee also notes the Government\'s statement that it has not yet been possible to establish the whereabouts of other kidnapped trade union leaders and members (Julin Revolorio, Raimundo Prez, Yolanda Urzar, Manuel Francisco Contreras, Jos Luis Ramos, Luis Estrada, Vctor Ascn, Lucrecia Orellana, Graciela Samayoa and her two children, Fermn Solano and Antonia Argeta). The Committee regrets that the Government has not supplied any details on the other  trade union leaders and members who have disappeared or on the alleged assassination of  trade union leaders and members and physical attacks on another union leader. The Committee further recalls that it had requested the Government to conduct a judicial inquiry into the attempted kidnapping and physical attacks on former trade union leader Alvaro Ren Sosa.\n.In these circumstances, the Committee recalls in general terms that when a climate of violence prevails in a country, this renders the exercise of trade union rights practically impossible and also recalls, as did the International Labour Conference in its  Resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties, that the absence of civil liberties removes all meaning from the concept of trade union rights and that the rights conferred on workers\' and employers\' organisations must be based on respect for those civil liberties. It expresses its profound concern at the seriousness of a situation in which a large number of trade union leaders and members']"

SUTE CHILE reiterates that the Act does not respect current regulations for education assistant personnel, which recognize their rights to bargain collectively and to strike. Lastly, the organization alleges that, since the adoption of Act No. , many complaints have been received from education workers in relation to mass dismissals.\n.In its communications dated  July  and  December , which refer to both cases, the Government provides information about: (i) the Chilean school system and the reasons for improving the municipal system of public education; (ii) the situation of education assistants in the municipal sector, which is the subject of the current complaints; and (iii) the protection of the personnel concerned with respect to trade union rights and collective bargaining. It appends to its response a document from May  entitled  Position of the Ministry of Education regarding the labour situation of education assistants reporting to municipal corporations in the context of the draft act establishing the public education system' (May , Official Gazette No. -).\n.The Government explains that the country s school system is a mixed, public rivate system of provision composed of four types of establishment that report to different entities: municipal (public) establishments, subsidized private establishments, unsubsidized private establishments and establishments with delegated administration. The municipal establishments to which the present case refers are administered by two types of management structure: Municipal Education Administration Departments or Municipal Education Directorates (DAEMs or DEMs), on the one hand, and municipal corporations on the other. DAEMs and DEMs are bodies that belong directly to the municipality; their functions are restricted to the administration of municipal educational establishments, which includes human and pedagogical resource management and administrative management. Municipal corporations are non-profit, private law entities with their own legal personality. Each has a board of directors presided over by the mayor of the respective commune. The general aim of municipal corporations is to administer the education, health and social development of the commune, carrying out functions in different areas of municipal life (education, health, children s services, etc.). On the basis of various studies on the topic, the Government considers that the municipal public education sector is not in a position to permanently ensure terms of administration and resource management that would guarantee the quality, improvement and future protection of public education across the entire country. Accordingly, the proposal contained in the draft act ' which was adopted on  November  (Act No. ) ' envisages the creation of a national system of public education structured around local public education services. These entities belong to the State Administration and assume the form of decentralized public services specialized in education management, which provide administrative, technical and pedagogical support to the school establishments under them. Lastly, the Government declares that it has held a permanent dialogue with almost all stakeholders and unions in school education, in particular, in relation to the draft act establishing the public education system. The unions consulted include the National Council of Education Assistants, the main representative of that segment of workers in municipalized education, which is composed of various federations and confederations of education assistants' associations and unions from the whole Chilean municipal sector (including FENASICOM).\n.Regarding the situation of education assistants (prior to the reform), the Government indicates that they work in one or more educational establishments and carry out functions other than teaching, which might be professional, technical, administrative, auxiliary or service tasks. Education assistants across the municipal sector are governed by Act No.  and also by the Labour Code. The legislation distinguishes their right to association on the basis of the employing entity. For education assistants contracted by DAEMs or DEMs ' i.e. directly by municipalities ' section  of Act No.  establishes that they are subject to Act No.  on civil servants' associations. In the case of municipal corporations, section  of the same Act No.  grants education assistants the right to bargain collectively in accordance with the Labour Code, permitting an exception for this group of workers to the prohibition set out in section  of the Code. According to the Government, the new public education system provided for by the law does not alter the contractual and labour regime of education assistants who work in educational establishments under the authority of municipal corporations or directly for municipalities. In addition, it does not establish requirements or selection processes for transferring all education assistants from municipalities and corporations to future local public education services. The Government asserts that the main modification proposed by the draft act in relation to that sector of workers is to change the employer responsible for contracting education assistants: such employers will assume a single (public) nature, ending the current dichotomy between municipal corporations and municipalities. The Government emphasizes that a key focus of the draft act is ensuring the employment continuity of all workers associated with the provision of public education, meaning that transferred employees will have no break in their employment and will keep their wages and welfare rights. The Government stresses that the  no break in service' transfer model, established in the draft act, means that workers will lose neither their legal rights nor any rights acquired under agreement with the respective municipality or municipal corporation prior to their transfer, including those acquired by tacit agreement. The Government specifies that, in addition to the Administrative Statute, various statutes or specific provisions are applicable to public sector workers according to the nature of their activity. This is true of education assistants, who have their own regulations and statute.\n.Regarding the protection of the union rights of the personnel concerned, the Government states that, firstly, workers have the right to join unions under article () of the national Constitution. However, the legislation on the public sector establishes a relevant exception in article  of the Administrative Statute, which prohibits civil servants from joining or belonging to trade unions in the field of the State Administration. Notwithstanding the above, the Government considers that the State recognizes and respects the freedom of association of State Administration workers, who have their right to form civil servants' associations recognized, the only condition being that they abide by the law and the statutes of the associations, in accordance with Act No.  on civil servants' associations. According to the Government, these associations have, in practice, operated in a similar way to trade unions, meaning that the right to organize of workers has also been respected in the public sector. The Government indicates that freedom of association and the representation of labour interests are exercised differently by public sector workers than by private sector workers, but that that does not mean that the rights do not exist or that there are no mechanisms in place for their enjoyment. Moreover, based on the variant regulations and characteristics of the public employment system, the new Act provides that workers should, pursuant to the reform and the resulting change in labour law, transform their trade unions and form civil servants' associations. The Act grants a period of two years starting from the date of education service transfer for the trade unions representing the transferred personnel to merge, amend their statutes in accordance with Act No.  on civil servants' associations and switch to being governed by such provisions for all legal purposes following the submission of the amended statutes to the Labour Inspectorate. In that regard, the Government underscores that the Act grants existing trade unions the opportunity to adapt to public sector regulations. It thus guarantees that educational assistant workers will not, at any point during the transfer process, be unprotected with respect to their right to organize and right to representation before the authorities and their employer. The Government stresses that trade unions that do not make use of their right to adapt will remain as such and will not lose their legal personality or forego their legal existence in so far as national legislation does not permit the dissolution of unions by a decision of the administrative authority. According to the Government, the reform affects not the trade union rights themselves, but rather the way in which they are guaranteed. Once the assistants become State employees, their right to organize starts being governed by Act No.  establishing regulations on State Administration civil servants' associations. In fact, section (a) of the Act explicitly indicates that one of the main purposes of civil servants' associations will be to promote the advancement of their members' economic, living and working conditions.\n.Regarding the right to bargain collectively, the Government makes a distinction between the right to bargain, on the one hand, and collective bargaining regulated by the Labour Code, on the other. Public sector workers bargain centrally in some cases and on a sectorial basis in others. It is reasonable that general working conditions ' which are established by law ' tend to be"", ""to develop that was hardly suitable for the negotiations planned for October of that year between Lan Chile S.A. and the Trade Union of Pilots and Technicians of Lan Chile S.A. It should be noted that this situation developed following the attack and destruction of the Twin Towers in the United States, and that this incident obviously had an effect on some of the events denounced by the trade union, but does not provide a single or sufficient explanation.\n.The Government then lists a series of events which, as it points out, constitute anti-union practices.Individual bargaining between the enterprise and pilots\n.During the second quarter of , the enterprise created subsidiary enterprises to which some unionized pilots were transferred following individual bargaining, which provided them with access to improved financial conditions, and their withdrawal of trade union membership. This process was public knowledge and was even encouraged by company executives.Publicity campaign against collective bargaining\n.The atmosphere being experienced within Lan Chile S.A. was made known to the public through articles in the press that appeared repeatedly from August  onwards. These articles pointed out that the collective bargaining process to be carried out by the pilots was a threat to the entreprise and to the country s economy given that the bargaining appeared to be intrinsically linked to conflicts and paralysis. These conclusions stem from articles that appeared in the  El Mercurio' newspaper during August .\n.In a public notice, the trade union s executive board qualified these articles in the press as a campaign against the trade union in order to discredit the workers' organization and discourage collective bargaining by generating a negative public opinion. The trade union responded by implementing the industrial action entitled  work-to-rule'  consisting in fulfilling the provisions of aeronautical regulations to the letter. This obviously involved the non-infringement of applicable standards, but also involved straying from the usual practices employed by the enterprise in air navigation processes, and which are outside the regulations, in order to cut costs for fuel and other consumables.Mass dismissal of active trade union members\n.These events were followed by the mass dismissal of unionized pilots. Between  September and  October , the company dismissed  members. In  of these cases the company invoked  company requirements' as the reason for the dismissals and in  cases it invoked the  serious breach of contractual obligations'  When the enterprise describes the serious breach of contractual obligations, it refers, inter alia, to confusing situations which led to delays for some flights. However, there is no clear relationship between the delays and the breach of contracts or internal regulations.\n.Following the dismissal of these  workers, the company reinstated  of them. Amongst those not reinstated were eight former trade union directors and workers who participated in the  legal strike. Therefore, the measure was highly discriminatory given that, in essence, it affected the most active members of the organization, namely those who were dismissed for respecting a trade union agreement consisting in  work-to-rule'  without violating contractual or legal standards.\n.The  workers affected filed a motion to vacate the dismissals before the Fifth Labour Court of First Instance of Santiago, filed under  Bustamante and Others versus Lan Chile S.A.' (Case No. -).Reduction in the workers' negotiating power\n.The dismissals prior to the commencement of collective bargaining had repercussions on the collective bargaining process promoted by the trade union in that only  members participated. This represents a  per cent reduction in the number of participants compared with the previous collective bargaining process. The process was concluded without a strike and a four-year collective agreement was signed, with a  per cent reduction in the pay increase that otherwise would have been due. At the same time, the entreprise came to an agreement with three groups of pilots, who during the previous negotiation process formed part of the trade union, in the form of -month collective agreements with a lower pay adjustment.Pressure exerted by Lan Chile S.A. for thewithdrawal of trade union membership\n.Following inspections by the employment services during the course of , it was established that unionized pilots and technicians were subjected to intense pressure aimed at making them withdraw membership from their trade union organization. This is shown in documents and communications issued by the employer which offer improved conditions of work that are incompatible with continued trade union membership. This approach was also reflected in the implicit threats of dismissal that were made by some supervisors and acknowledged by some workers during conversations with the officer from the Labour Inspectorate. As a result, the trade union executive board received membership withdrawals from mid- until the first-quarter of ; it currently has only  members.Discrimination against trade unionmembers with regard to training\n.Lan Chile S.A. excluded trade union members from flight training for operating the new company airplanes. This was subsequently taken up by the trade union executive board with the employer, but this measure was not reversed. In the past, training was considered a recompense for pilots' seniority. According to the information collected during the inspections conducted in the enterprise, such exclusion became apparent shortly before the collective bargaining process began. According to the information provided by the trade union executive board, this segregation still continues during the present year.Conditions for the reinstatement of dismissed pilots\n.According to the information collected during the inspections conducted in the company in ,  pilots dismissed for disciplinary reasons, for having participated in the action entitled  work-to-rule'  were reinstated by the employer with the condition that they write a letter in which they had to acknowledge responsibility for the possible damage the industrial action may have caused; furthermore, they had to blame the trade union for forcing them into the alleged transgression. With their new individual contracts, these pilots did not regain the collective benefits that they had previously enjoyed.Replacement of dismissed unionized pilotsby recruiting foreign pilots\n.The company failed to comply when requested for information by the inspectors in order to determine the legality of such recruitment. As a result of this conduct, the enterprise was fined on three occasions, on the most recent occasion, it was given the maximum administrative sanction for hindering the labour inspector s work.Harassment of trade union officials: Failure to grant thework agreed upon and professional disqualification\n.In August , a complaint was made about the suspension from everyday duties of the trade union directors, Messrs. Nibaldo Jorquera and Artidoro Leal, and Lan Chile S.A. was sanctioned for failing to grant the work agreed upon in the employment contract. This also happened to the official Baldovino Bendix.\n.This conduct began to take the form of excluding trade union officials from work schedules, which are documents used to notify each pilot of his flight itinerary, rest periods, training activities and other events for the following month. The collective agreement obliges the employer to provide this document.\n.In January , another administrative fine was issued for failing to provide the officials Jozcef Szita, Artidoro Leal, Nibaldo Jorquera and Baldovino Bendix with work schedules and for failing to grant the first two mentioned officials the agreed upon work.\n.It should be pointed out that, according to the provisions of the Civil Aeronautical Authority, in order to keep their license, pilots must be accredited with a determined number of flight hours. Without such a license they cannot work as pilots or co-pilots. In practice this amounts to professional disqualification and makes it impossible for them to work for this, or another, aviation company since they fail to meet the essential requirements.\n.Moreover, the Government indicates the effects of the action taken by Lan Chile S.A. which constitutes anti-union and unfair practices in collective bargaining:' Trade union membership. After having been the most representative union and bringing together nearly all of the pilots and technicians at Lan Chile S.A., with  members, the Trade Union of Pilots and Technicians now has only  members, as a result of the dismissals, membership withdrawals and creation of subsidiary enterprises.' Trade union executive board. In October , the trade union executive board was composed of five members. In the first-quarter of , only one director remained in service since three officials left the company, in one case following legal proceedings which lead to an agreement, and in the other cases following out-of-court negotiations. The last reorganization of the executive board, on  May , only enabled the election of three directors.' Trade union assets. In view of the reduction in membership, the trade union stopped receiving a significant amount of resources, in the form of trade union dues. Therefore, the trade union was forced to move to smaller headquarters and reduce the number of officers and advisers.' Collective bargaining. The collective bargaining of pilots, which until  had been carried out exclusively by the Trade Union of Pilots and Technicians, was significantly fragmented during the last negotiating process, and therefore led to fewer collective benefits. Moreover, by negotiating separately, three groups signed instruments for  months, whereas the trade"", 'that a request be made with ten days\' notice for authorisation by the Chief of the area under the state of emergency to hold meetings in public places. The National Grouping of Workers (CNT) satisfied these requirements but did not even receive an acknowledgement in reply. In view of this situation, the CNT leadership called on the workers and the population of Santiago to meet on the Plaza de los Hroes on  May at  a.m.\n.The report also indicates that on  April the authorities had prevented the holding of an artistic and cultural event at union premises of the Confederation of Leather and Footwear Workers to celebrate May Day.\n.On  May the city of Santiago was practically occupied by the police and the military. In spite of this climate, thousands of people approached the meeting place and, when the first groups formed, the police forces hurled projectiles and tear gas at them. Dozens of persons were wounded. All persons and all vehicles were checked and approximately  persons arrested, including Manuel Bustos, Vice-President of the CNT, Jorge Mills, a member of the national council of the CNT, and Humberto Arcos, an official of the Confederation of Unions of Workers in the Metal Industry. The majority of these persons were released on the same day with a summons to appear before the Police Court for having caused a disturbance of the peace.\n.Also on the morning of  May, two trade union premises belonging to the Confederation of Textile and Clothing Workers (CONTEVECH) and to the Professional Association of Teachers of Chile (AGECH) were illegally searched. Furniture and documents were destroyed or removed. The persons present were threatened, certain of them were struck, and  teachers attending a meeting at the premises of the AGECH were arrested, although organisations with a legal personality (as in the case of the AGECH) are not required to request authorisation to hold meetings at their own premises to deal with matters within their competence.\n.In its communication of  June , the Confederation of Copper Workers (CTC) alleges that on  April  the Director-General for Industrial Relations of the National Copper Corporation (CODELCO) notified  workers of the termination of their work contract on the basis of article (f) of Legislative Decree No. . This provision permits an employer to dismiss workers without specifying the grounds for dismissal, with  days\' notice or by paying compensation of an amount equal to the last monthly wage. According to the CTC, this permits the Government and employers, as in this case, to take discriminatory measures against trade unions.\n.The CTC states that all those affected by this measure were skilled workers, had behaved irreproachably and had from  to  years\' service in the undertaking. The only possible grounds for their dismissal are therefore their active participation in trade union meetings and activities. Furthermore, four of them were about to become trade union officials. Moreover, this measure was intended to intimidate the workers in the undertaking in order to impede their trade union action. These assumptions are substantiated by the fact that on the day of the dismissals, the two unions of El Salvador with the largest number of affiliates had convened assemblies for the purpose of putting their affairs in order following the disqualification of their leaders decreed by the Ministry of Labour. These assemblies unanimously rejected the dismissals and condemned the measure taken by CODELCO. For ten days,  of the dismissed workers went on hunger strike.\n.In its communication of  June , the National Union of Workers of the Telephone Company of Chile states that on  April  it presented a draft collective agreement to the Telephone Company in conformity with the legislation in force. The employer replied on  April , raising objections to the draft in respect of the situation of replacement telephone operators, although the latter are not among those workers barred from collective bargaining under article  of Legislative Decree No. . On  May , after compulsory arbitration proceedings had been initiated, the Director of Labour issued a resolution in which it was decided to exclude from collective bargaining the situation of the  members of the union employed as replacement operators. The union points out that the persons concerned are covered by an indefinite work contract and have more than  years\' continuous service in the undertaking. The union adds that the Santiago Provincial Labour Inspector had issued on  May  a totally contrary resolution which recognised the right of these workers to participate in collective bargaining. Lastly, the union indicates that it submitted appeals to the courts but that the latter had not yet handed down their judgement.\n.In its communication of  September , the ICFTU alleges that Juan Fernando Reyes, President of the ""El Roto Chileno"" Peasants\' Federation of Curico and his family had been subjected to constant threats since  July . On several occasions, armed and masked civilians conducted night searches at his home and destroyed furniture and other objects. The appeal for protection submitted by his lawyers was rejected, as, according to police sources, no warrant for arrest or order of inquiry had been issued in his case. Since then, his home was again searched and his wife severely beaten.\n.In its communication of  September , the FISE refers to the arrest by the security services of Mr. Guillermo Scherping, Under-Secretary of the Professional Association of Teachers of Chile. The FISE fears that his life is in danger.\n.Works Union No.  of the National Copper Corporation of Chile states in its communication of  September  that on  September police officers arrived at the Union\'s offices for the purpose of evicting the six workers referred to in a previous complaint presented by the Confederation of Copper Workers, as well as their families who had organised a soup kitchen on the premises since their dismissal by the National Copper Corporation, at a time when they enjoyed trade union ""immunity"". The police officer responsible for this eviction presented no document issued by a competent authority.\n.The National Confederation of Trade Unions in Building, Wood, Building Materials and Related Activities, for its part, refers to the warrant issued for the arrest of its president, Sergio Troncoso Cisternas. The complainant organisation points out that Mr. Troncoso, who had already been detained on several occasions, was sought by persons in civilian clothes on  September , when he was in the German Democratic Republic to attend the Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions.\n.CONSTRAMET indicates that its leaders Jos Ramn Avello Soto and Ronaldo Muez Moreno were sought by the police as of the day following the proclamation of the state of emergency,  September . Furthermore, a regional secretary of the organisation, Humberto Arcos Vera, is under permanent surveillance, as are the Confederation\'s offices. The complainant organisation also indicates that the police authorities prohibited meetings of several constituent unions (the Eugenio Gonzlez, Morgan and Fuenzalida Unions) which were in the process of negotiation.\n.FENTATREX refers to the dismissal of three trade union officials by the Via dye works. It explains that these officials were declared responsible for the fact that  of the  workers in the undertaking did not arrive for work on the protest day held on  September , as they were without means of transport, sick or unable to leave their district which was occupied by law enforcement agents. The undertaking then arbitrarily applied sections . and . of Legislative Decree No.  which penalises unlawful acts preventing the worker from being present at his work or discharging his obligations as a worker and the direction of or active participation in any unlawful interruption or stoppage of work. The dismissals were decided without notice being given, without the right to compensation and in contravention of ""trade union immunity"".\n.FENTATREX indicates that  workers at the San Martino textiles undertaking had to take the risk of meeting in private houses to discuss a draft collective agreement since a consequence of the proclamation of the state of emergency was to prohibit meetings of trade unions which do not possess their own premises.\n.The Miners\' Confederation alleges that several trade unionists were dismissed for having participated in collective bargaining: in particular, the former official of the Lota Union No.  of the National Coal Enterprise (ENACAR), Fresia Mellado Opazo, and ten workers of Union No,  of Victoria de Lbu. It is alleged further that an official of ENACAR Union No. , Juan Carlos Salazar Sierra, was disqualified from holding his union post and that workers at the Minero Cerro Negro undertaking, including the trade union official Rolando Chacana Ganza, were arrested for purported thefts of explosives. Lastly, it is alleged that, at the Agustinas de Copiapo mine, the Agustinas mining enterprise unilaterally decided to lower salaries in  and  at a time when the collective agreement was in force.\n.Finally, in a joint letter several Chilean national confederations indicate that the homes of officials of']"

The Office sent a telegram to the Government on  April  inviting it to submit its observations as soon as possible. In June  the Minister of Labour forwarded additional information.\n.El Salvador has not ratified either the freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.The complaints examined by the Committee were basically of three kinds: first, concerning the violent death and disappearance of trade unionists and former trade unionists; second, arrest of trade union leaders; third, attack on trade union premises and destruction of records.\n.At the last examination of the cases in question, in November , the Governing Body, in accordance with the Committee\'s recommendations, expressed extreme concern at the serious nature of the allegations and observed that various acts had occurred after  October , when the previous Government had been deposed.\n.In particular, concerning violent deaths and disappearances, the Governing Body deplored the loss of many human lives and the injuries referred to in the complaints. It noted that investigations had been opened into some of the occurrences and requested the Government to undertake as soon as possible a judicial inquiry into those cases where investigations had not been opened and to inform it of the results.\n.In his communication of June , before giving a detailed reply concerning the cases in question, the Minister of Labour stated that, as a human being and as an official, he regretted that in the past acts had occurred in El Salvador which were not perhaps compatible with humane feelings, especially as regards violations of freedom of association such as those denounced to the International Labour Organisation. However, in order to preserve his country\'s international prestige despite the climate of violence which has prevailed in recent years, resulting in loss of human life and material losses, he stated that he would like to present specific information on the current situation concerning these cases.\n.It should therefore be recalled that, in Case No. , the complainants alleged in particular that on  October , workers who were preparing to organise a collection in support of a strike at the El Len factory were attacked by the police, and two of them lost their lives. According to the Government\'s communication of June , the investigations undertaken and requested from the Ministry of Defence and Public Security confirm that there is no file on events relating to the situation of trade unionists in the El Len factory which occurred under the presidential administration of Colonel Arturo Armando Molina and General Carlos Humberto Romero in  and .\n.As regards Case No. , according to a communication of the WCL dated  April , Jos Santos Tiznado and Pedro Gonzlez, leaders of the Salvadorian Peasants\' Central, were murdered by uniformed members of the National Guard at midnight, on  May , in the Jsus suburb of the San Ramn municipality in the department of Cuscatln. In addition, Manuel Antonio Carrillo and Jos Antonio Carrillo, former leaders of the Salvadorian Peasants\' Central and members of the El Rosario Agricultural and Consumers Co-operative Ltd., were murdered on  June  by members of the forces of repression, as was evident from the calibre of the bullets found near their bodies. As regards Rafael Hernndez Olivo, Secretary General of the Irrigation and Drainage Section of the National Association of workers of the Ministry of Agriculture and Cattle Farming (ANTMAG), who had been transported to the Metapn hospital after being injured in an accident, he had subsequently disappeared, having been arrested by the hacienda police.\n.Concerning the homicide of the peasants Jos Santos, Pedro Gonzlez, Manuel Carrillo and Antonio Carrillo, and the disappearance of Rafael Hernndez Olivo, the Government states that the authorities are continuing their investigations.\n.In Case No. , the ICFTU alleged, in a communication dated  July , that in a clash with the armed forces on  June , Toms Rosales, a leader of the workers\' union of the ""Granja Santa Ins"", had been killed and four other trade unionists had been injured, when the workers at this undertaking had called a peaceful strike in support of a list of wage claims.\n.The Government has still not supplied any information on this allegation.\n.In Case No. , concerning the murder on  January  of Rodolfo Viera, Secretary General of the Salvadorian Communal Union, and the death of two United States trade unionists Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer, representatives of the AFL-CIO in El Salvador, the Government confirms in its communication of June  that a trial was being held in the fifth criminal court of San Salvador. The accused, Ernesto Sol Meza, has been released on the order of the Supreme Court, after submitting an appeal, and the other accused, Hans Krist, has been acquitted, adds the Government.\n.The Committee observes that the Government has supplied certain information on the development of the investigations conducted by the authorities into the death and disappearance of the trade unionists and former trade unionists referred to by the complainants.\n.As regards certain events, however, the Committee regrets that despite the time which has elapsed since the complaints were presented, the Government still has not supplied any observations, particularly on the alleged death of Toms Rosales and the injuries inflicted on his fellow workers by the forces of the law on  June  at the Granja Santa Ins. In this respect, the Committee recalls, as it has stated on numerous previous occasions, that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact. It is therefore confident that if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, the latter should recognise the importance for the protection of their own good name of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to the allegations put forward,\n.In Case No. , the Committee notes that, according to the Government, an investigation is being made into the homicide of the peasants Jos Santos, Pedro Gonzles, Manuel Carrillo and Antonio Carrillo and the disappearance of Rafael Hernndez Olivo. The Committee again stresses to the Government the need to ensure that the guilty parties are punished and insists that the Government inform it of the results of the current investigations and of the penalties imposed.\n.The Committee also notes that in Case No. , the trial in the murder of trade union leader Rodolfo Viera has resulted in the acquittal of one of the accused and that the second has been released pending appeal. In this connection, the Committee must first keenly deplore the murder of these trade unionists. It would also observe that a climate of violence such as that in which the murders were committed constitutes a serious obstacle to the exercise of trade union rights. Consequently, such acts call for effective measures on the part of the authorities. The Committee therefore requests the Government to send it the text of any judgement handed down in this case, and to pursue actively the investigations into these cases.\n.During its most recent examination of the substance of these cases, the Committee had also recommended the Governing Body to note that some trade unionists had been released, and had noted that certain arrests were made because of participation in an illegal electricity strike which led to the loss of human lives in hospitals and other welfare centres.\n.However, it had also requested the Government to indicate the reasons for and circumstances surrounding the arrests of the leaders Enrique Tejada, Antonio Campos Mendoza, Salomn Snchez Mrquez, Vicente Aguirre, Melitn Snchez, Antonio Fuentes and Maximiliano Castro, and to supply information on their present situation. Recalling that it should be the policy of every government to ensure the right of all detained persons to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment, it pointed out that the arrests of trade unionists against whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found may involve the restriction of trade union rights and a serious interference in trade union activities.\n.Lastly,', '.Since  numerous complaints concerning violations of freedom of association in El Salvador have been presented by the following organisations: the United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador (FUSS), the Federation of Unions of Workers in the Food, Clothing, Textile and Allied Industries of El Salvador (FESTIAVTSCES), the Committee for Trade Union Unity of Workers of Central America and Panama (CUSCA), the Trade Unions International of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur Workers, the Trade Unions International of Food, Tobacco, Hotel and Allied Industries Workers, the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the World Federation of Agricultural Workers, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of the Workers of Latin America (CPUSTAL).\n.The Committee has already examined most of these cases on several occasions and submitted interim reports to the Governing Body.\n.Since then, in the absence of observations from the Government, the Committee adjourned its examination of these cases to February, then May .

It noted that investigations had been opened into some of the occurrences and requested the Government to undertake as soon as possible a judicial inquiry into those cases where investigations had not been opened and to inform it of the results.\n.In his communication of June , before giving a detailed reply concerning the cases in question, the Minister of Labour stated that, as a human being and as an official, he regretted that in the past acts had occurred in El Salvador which were not perhaps compatible with humane feelings, especially as regards violations of freedom of association such as those denounced to the International Labour Organisation. However, in order to preserve his country\'s international prestige despite the climate of violence which has prevailed in recent years, resulting in loss of human life and material losses, he stated that he would like to present specific information on the current situation concerning these cases.\n.It should therefore be recalled that, in Case No. , the complainants alleged in particular that on  October , workers who were preparing to organise a collection in support of a strike at the El Len factory were attacked by the police, and two of them lost their lives.

SITET presented additional information on  April . The Government submitted its comments by letters dated  November and  December .\n.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.The CCTD states that during the th Session of the International Labour Conference () the Workers\' delegate of Costa Rica had accused his Government of trade union persecution and that the Government delegate had undertaken that his Government (including autonomous institutions) would not carry out any reprisals or persecution of any kind against trade union leaders. The complainants add that, disregarding this promise, the Costa Rican Electricity Institute (IOE), an autonomous body whose directors are appointed on government advice and in which there is a Minister appointed by the Central Government, had dismissed members of SITET and brought charges against Mr. Guido Nez Romn, Secretary-General of that union, accusing him of having used the right to strike, negotiated the signing of a collective agreement and exerted trade union pressure to that end.\n.SITET states in its letter of  March  that since its registration with the competent administration it has been subjected to considerable pressure from the IOE. Investigations carried out by a special Committee of the Legislative Assembly had revealed that the accusation was justified. A Member of Parliament had then tabled a motion to the effect that the terms of a loan from the Inter-American Development Bank should include trade union immunity (fuero) and the obligation to negotiate a collective agreement. The IOE administrators had then undertaken to change their policy towards the union.\n.In view of this commitment, the complainants continue, SITET had submitted a draft collective agreement in April , but one month later the Institute had transformed one of its own credit associations into a trade union called the ASDEICE and granted it all necessary privileges (furnished office, employee, car and driver, funds for the publication of a monthly bulletin, etc.). This ""home made"" union, continues the complainants, had also presented a draft collective agreement. Having received two drafts, IOE stated that the two organisations should first of all reach agreement, knowing very well that the puppet union would not agree to do so. The draft agreement had not, in fact, produced any results. Renewed pressure was exerted to make workers leave the SITET, and although the other union fell into Communist hands, according to the complainants, that did not change the IOE\'s attitude to ASDEICE, some of whose members were even promoted.\n.SITET then submitted a complaint to the Minister. As the manager of IOE stated that the dispute should be submitted to the labour courts, SITET had followed the procedure for the settlement of disputes of an economic and social nature. The parties had been summoned to appear for conciliation, but the IOE had refused to negotiate. SITET had then sought compulsory arbitration, but that had been refused since, under a special Constitutional provision, the Institute was not obliged to go to arbitration. At that point, the workers had decided to strike, although such action was illegal because IOE is a public service. The employer had then dismissed eight workers, all of whom had seventeen years\' service, not for participation in the strike but for unlawful acts harmful to the Institute. The complainant had asked the Ministry of Labour to investigate the unfair accusation and the charges had been proved to be unfounded, but the workers had not been reinstated. Also as a result of the strike, the Secretary-General of SITET, Guido Nez Romn, and other members of the executive, together with the dismissed workers, had been accused of incitement to the collective stoppage, which was an offence under Article  of the Labour Code; their case was under investigation.\n.Since then, SITET stated, the situation had become worse and pressure on the union had increased; workers had been dismissed on any pretext, without any of the benefits to which they were legally entitled. The management had organised what was known as the ""Group for the Preservation of the IOE"", composed of all the heads of department, who visited all the work centres to persuade workers to leave the union. According to SITET, it even writes letters of resignation for them. The campaign had enabled management to induce , members to leave the union. Whereas, according to the union rules, workers wishing to resign from the union must apply to the executive which then gives instructions for deductions in respect of union dues to cease, the IOE, according to the complainant, applies other methods. SITET is sometimes informed by the accounts department that a worker has decided to resign from the union and that his contributions would no longer be deducted from his pay; in such cases the union receives no other information than that given by IOE. In other cases, the worker sends his letter of resignation to the chief of personnel, who gives instructions for the deduction of union dues to cease and sends the union a copy of the worker\'s letter together with a copy of his own letter to the accounts department. Sometimes the worker communicates directly with the accounts department, which crosses the worker off its list. According to SITET, normal procedures are applied in the case of the other union; workers are not crossed off the list but are forced to remain in that organisation. It adds that it has lodged a complaint with the Ministry of Labour but so far has not heard of any action being taken.\n.The second communication from SITET concerns another practice of the same type: it claims that the chief of the personnel office ceased deducting the trade union dues of some workers, whereas the union had merely asked him to suspend the loan repayments to one of the union\'s bodies.\n.The Government replied by two communications of  November and  December . Concerning the dismissal of eight strikers, it pointed out that the action taken by IOE was illegal and referred in this connection to Section  of the Constitution and Sections , ,  and  of the Labour Code. Section  specifically bans strikes in public services and stipulates that any conflicts arising in such services shall be referred to the labour courts. Section  defines as public services all activities performed by employees of the State or of its institutions where the activities of the State or its institutions are not the same as those of private firms or agencies working for reward.\n.The Government submitted a copy of the ruling of the labour court (and that of the Supreme Labour Court confirming it), to the effect that negotiations had been broken off following a threat of strike which it declared to be illegal. Consequently, it is the Government\'s opinion that there were sufficient grounds for dismissal under Article  of the Labour Code. From later talks held with a view to restoring peace between the employer and workers, the IOE had appeared to be prepared not to dismiss workers merely for having gone on strike and to dismiss only those strikers who had acted in a manner prejudicial to the undertaking by deeds punishable under the Penal Code. In the light of that implicit undertaking and at the request of the trade union, the Ministry of Labour had carried out an investigation into the criminal liability of the dismissed workers. Seven of the eight had not participated in any punishable act, but the Institute nevertheless dismissed them, which it was legally entitled to do.\n.Regarding the criminal proceedings brought against the Secretary-General of SITET, the Government states that the IOE had brought legal proceedings pursuant to Sections ,  and  of the Penal Code. The articles in question read:\n.""The sanctions specified in section , increased by one-third for any person responsible for jeopardising the common weal, shall be imposed for:\n.""The penalty shall be imprisonment for six months to two years for any person guilty of creating a public danger or of impeding or hampering the normal operation of transport by land, sea, air or water, or of impeding or hampering public communication services or public power services in any form.\n.""The penalty shall be imprisonment for six months to two years and a fine consisting of a percentage of the income earned over a period of from  to  days for any person guilty of having urged officials or employees of public services collectively to abandon their work.""\n.The Government points out that Mr. Nez Roman has never been committed to gaol. The investigating magistrate had ordered ""imprisonment and trial"", but the accused had been left free pending trial and the case had not closed. During the proceedings, the counsel for the', ' of whom were directly hired by the employer and the rest of whom are subcontracted.\n.SITAGAH alleges that Geest Caribbean Americas Ltd. has, since , hired and subcontracted many migrant workers who did not have residence papers (Nicaraguans), who are not entitled to rights under Costa Rican labour law, using them as reserve labour and thus forcing Costa Rican banana plantation workers to accept below-average conditions of work, safety and pay. The employer\'s arbitrary actions led the workers to contact the SITAGAH union leadership in September , and hundreds of them joined the union, but the enterprise suppressed the union and prevented it from functioning, including by: dismissing workers who had joined the union, and elected union representatives; discriminating in terms of pay and conditions of work; unfair practices against the SITAGAH trade union; rescinding the freedom of trade union officers to meet with workers without the employer\'s prior authorization; promoting solidarist interference in trade union matters and resorting to violence (with a private police force to prevent unionization) and armed repression (workers were injured and beaten by the police force), in order to break the workers\' legitimate strike.\n.SITAGAH adds that since September  it has been applying for recognition and calling for a solution to its members\' labour problems. Even though it has formally recognized the SITAGAH trade union, the employer continues to take up all labour issues with workers\' standing committees affiliated to solidarist organizations, refusing to discuss them with SITAGAH.\n.In April , the employer\'s arbitrary acts went as far as cutting workers\' wages by more than , colones per fortnight, which provoked a three-day strike (,  and  April ), as a result of which the employer enterprise promised to negotiate with SITAGAH on wage issues, on the basis of an agenda drawn up by the trade union. However, the employer did not sit down to the negotiating table, but instead launched mass dismissals of workers belonging to the trade union, and subcontracted workers were removed from the plantation. The enterprise immediately called the migration authorities to ensure that the migrant workers who had no residence papers and who had joined the union were expelled from the country. This situation compelled the workers to call a further strike for - May . However, on  May, using a court order to open up a public right of way as an excuse, the Costa Rican police force, supported by Geest Caribbean private guards, under orders from the employer\'s representative, moved in on the strikers,  of whom received bullet wounds, three of them serious, leaving some workers unable ever fully to work again, and imprisoned  workers. To date, two workers are still missing. It should be pointed out that the workers were engaged in a peaceful strike - the strike had not been declared illegal because there were no grounds for doing so in view of the employer\'s arbitrary acts and the legitimacy and fairness of the workers\' demands - however, the enterprise dismissed more than  workers, violating the trade union immunity (fuero sindical) to which they were entitled as the dismissals included representatives, elected by workers, on standing committees on the negotiating committee that discussed labour issues on the plantation with the Government and enterprise, and on grass-roots trade union committees, and included members of the trade union executive committee.\n.Furthermore, SITAGAH points out that despite the fact that the problem has not been resolved and that SITAGAH boasts considerable membership among workers still in employment, the employer is preventing trade union officers from meeting freely with workers, using private guards to deny them access to plantations, preventing workers from holding meetings and communicating with persons outside the plantation. As these workers have stated, the Geest Caribbean plantation in Sarapiqu is a concentration camp with flowers, where trade union officers must ask permission of the employers even to speak with members, but may not communicate with other workers or hold union meetings. SITAGAH encloses a memorandum from the banana plantation manager, written and signed in his own handwriting, addressed to the private guards and stating that Mr. Pablo Zuiga is authorized to speak with trade union members. Nevertheless, the private guards have been present during conversations and workers could not express themselves freely.\n.Meanwhile, the enterprise and the advisory body belonging to the banana industry solidarist movement in Costa Rica, the John XXIII Social School, in the midst of a labour dispute, in an effort to interfere in the dispute and pressurize workers to join the solidarist association, have set up four solidarist associations which have been approved by the Ministry of Labour without questioning their illegal origin.\n.According to the complainant, the Government of Costa Rica adopted an Act on trade union immunity (fuero sindical) but in practice, as in cases such as this, it is not being applied. The Constitutional Chamber legitimized trade union immunity in an erga omnes ruling which is also not being implemented by any state judicial or administrative body in Costa Rica. The State approved legislation prohibiting solidarist associations from interfering in collective bargaining or acting against trade unions. However, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security continues to approve solidarist associations set up to damage trade unions, and approve the collective bargaining carried out between the employer and standing committees belonging to solidarist organizations, thereby excluding the trade union. In the specific case mentioned in this allegation, the employer has set up four solidarist associations and negotiates remuneration with the standing committee.\n.The first labour policy move by the present government was to fire on and suppress the workers of the Geest Caribbean Americas company, who were engaged in legal strike action.\n.In its communications dated  May,  and  October , the Government stated that the essence of the allegations contained in the general part of these cases harked back to the issues dealt with in Case No.  by the Committee on Freedom of Association and the most recent observations of the Committee of Experts, and that these matters were examined by a direct contacts mission to Costa Rica from  to  October . The Government points out that the current administration has shown particular interest in bringing labour legislation into line with the principles contained in Conventions Nos. ,  and , has set up a legal framework specifically designed to protect trade union organizations and their officers, and introduced various bills applying, with ILO technical assistance, the recommendations made by the Committee on Freedom of Association in its th Report, and by the Committee of Experts. The Government refers specifically to a recent Act, No.  of  November , which, inter alia, amends the Labour Code (with regard to trade union guarantees) and the Act on solidarist associations, bringing them into line with the provisions of the aforementioned Conventions. The Government adds that the claims of inequality between solidarism and trade unionism are false. On the contrary, the Government, on the basis of the recommendations made by the Committee as mentioned above, submitted a Bill to the Legislative Assembly on the establishment of an occupational capitalization and economic democratization fund, which changes the regulations governing compensation upon termination of a contract, thus making it a genuine right for all workers and placing trade unions and solidarist associations on an equal footing with regard to acting as administrators of these funds. Similarly, the Act of  November  reduces the minimum number of workers needed to set up a trade union to  (in other words, the same number as that required to set up solidarist associations), provides adequate protection against anti-union discrimination and updates the fines for violation of the Labour Code and ILO Conventions.\n.With regard to the allegation of restrictions on collective bargaining and strikes in the public sector, the Government points out that it has been negotiating specific legislation on public employment which contains express provisions on the settlement of collective disputes and the right to strike in this sector since the beginning of  with trade union organizations (including the complainant). With regard to ruling No. - of Constitutional Chamber IV, the Government points out that, under the constitutional guidelines in force, the employment relationship between the public administration and its public servants is subject to ""particular or special criteria"" which do not allow the application of labour legislation on arbitration since the latter was drawn up to cover labour relations in the private sector alone. The Government adds that since public sector workers are barred access to arbitration machinery on the basis of the aforementioned ruling, on  March , following discussion with the Central Labour Council (a tripartite body), the Regulations on collective bargaining for public servants were issued, allowing collective bargaining and the exercise of trade union rights in the public administration. These Regulations remain temporarily in force while the corresponding legislation is being passed since, as a result of tripartite consultation, a Bill on the settlement of collective disputes in the public sector will be submitted to the', ' of whom were directly hired by the employer and the rest of whom are subcontracted.\n.SITAGAH alleges that Geest Caribbean Americas Ltd. has, since , hired and subcontracted many migrant workers who did not have residence papers (Nicaraguans), who are not entitled to rights under Costa Rican labour law, using them as reserve labour and thus forcing Costa Rican banana plantation workers to accept below-average conditions of work, safety and pay. The employer\'s arbitrary actions led the workers to contact the SITAGAH union leadership in September , and hundreds of them joined the union, but the enterprise suppressed the union and prevented it from functioning, including by: dismissing workers who had joined the union, and elected union representatives; discriminating in terms of pay and conditions of work; unfair practices against the SITAGAH trade union; rescinding the freedom of trade union officers to meet with workers without the employer\'s prior authorization; promoting solidarist interference in trade union matters and resorting to violence (with a private police force to prevent unionization) and armed repression (workers were injured and beaten by the police force), in order to break the workers\' legitimate strike.\n.SITAGAH adds that since September  it has been applying for recognition and calling for a solution to its members\' labour problems. Even though it has formally recognized the SITAGAH trade union, the employer continues to take up all labour issues with workers\' standing committees affiliated to solidarist organizations, refusing to discuss them with SITAGAH.\n.In April , the employer\'s arbitrary acts went as far as cutting workers\' wages by more than , colones per fortnight, which provoked a three-day strike (,  and  April ), as a result of which the employer enterprise promised to negotiate with SITAGAH on wage issues, on the basis of an agenda drawn up by the trade union. However, the employer did not sit down to the negotiating table, but instead launched mass dismissals of workers belonging to the trade union, and subcontracted workers were removed from the plantation. The enterprise immediately called the migration authorities to ensure that the migrant workers who had no residence papers and who had joined the union were expelled from the country. This situation compelled the workers to call a further strike for - May . However, on  May, using a court order to open up a public right of way as an excuse, the Costa Rican police force, supported by Geest Caribbean private guards, under orders from the employer\'s representative, moved in on the strikers,  of whom received bullet wounds, three of them serious, leaving some workers unable ever fully to work again, and imprisoned  workers. To date, two workers are still missing. It should be pointed out that the workers were engaged in a peaceful strike - the strike had not been declared illegal because there were no grounds for doing so in view of the employer\'s arbitrary acts and the legitimacy and fairness of the workers\' demands - however, the enterprise dismissed more than  workers, violating the trade union immunity (fuero sindical) to which they were entitled as the dismissals included representatives, elected by workers, on standing committees on the negotiating committee that discussed labour issues on the plantation with the Government and enterprise, and on grass-roots trade union committees, and included members of the trade union executive committee.\n.Furthermore, SITAGAH points out that despite the fact that the problem has not been resolved and that SITAGAH boasts considerable membership among workers still in employment, the employer is preventing trade union officers from meeting freely with workers, using private guards to deny them access to plantations, preventing workers from holding meetings and communicating with persons outside the plantation. As these workers have stated, the Geest Caribbean plantation in Sarapiqu is a concentration camp with flowers, where trade union officers must ask permission of the employers even to speak with members, but may not communicate with other workers or hold union meetings. SITAGAH encloses a memorandum from the banana plantation manager, written and signed in his own handwriting, addressed to the private guards and stating that Mr. Pablo Zuiga is authorized to speak with trade union members. Nevertheless, the private guards have been present during conversations and workers could not express themselves freely.\n.Meanwhile, the enterprise and the advisory body belonging to the banana industry solidarist movement in Costa Rica, the John XXIII Social School, in the midst of a labour dispute, in an effort to interfere in the dispute and pressurize workers to join the solidarist association, have set up four solidarist associations which have been approved by the Ministry of Labour without questioning their illegal origin.\n.According to the complainant, the Government of Costa Rica adopted an Act on trade union immunity (fuero sindical) but in practice, as in cases such as this, it is not being applied. The Constitutional Chamber legitimized trade union immunity in an erga omnes ruling which is also not being implemented by any state judicial or administrative body in Costa Rica. The State approved legislation prohibiting solidarist associations from interfering in collective bargaining or acting against trade unions. However, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security continues to approve solidarist associations set up to damage trade unions, and approve the collective bargaining carried out between the employer and standing committees belonging to solidarist organizations, thereby excluding the trade union. In the specific case mentioned in this allegation, the employer has set up four solidarist associations and negotiates remuneration with the standing committee.\n.The first labour policy move by the present government was to fire on and suppress the workers of the Geest Caribbean Americas company, who were engaged in legal strike action.\n.In its communications dated  May,  and  October , the Government stated that the essence of the allegations contained in the general part of these cases harked back to the issues dealt with in Case No.  by the Committee on Freedom of Association and the most recent observations of the Committee of Experts, and that these matters were examined by a direct contacts mission to Costa Rica from  to  October . The Government points out that the current administration has shown particular interest in bringing labour legislation into line with the principles contained in Conventions Nos. ,  and , has set up a legal framework specifically designed to protect trade union organizations and their officers, and introduced various bills applying, with ILO technical assistance, the recommendations made by the Committee on Freedom of Association in its th Report, and by the Committee of Experts. The Government refers specifically to a recent Act, No.  of  November , which, inter alia, amends the Labour Code (with regard to trade union guarantees) and the Act on solidarist associations, bringing them into line with the provisions of the aforementioned Conventions. The Government adds that the claims of inequality between solidarism and trade unionism are false. On the contrary, the Government, on the basis of the recommendations made by the Committee as mentioned above, submitted a Bill to the Legislative Assembly on the establishment of an occupational capitalization and economic democratization fund, which changes the regulations governing compensation upon termination of a contract, thus making it a genuine right for all workers and placing trade unions and solidarist associations on an equal footing with regard to acting as administrators of these funds.

Although section  of the Labour Code prohibits anti-union practices, the penal sanctions imposed are fines ranging from  to  pesos ( peso  US dollar). According to the report, the Government appears willing to do everything in its power to find a solution:The Secretary and Under-Secretary of State recognise that there have been numerous dismissals and that some cases had apparently involved trade union officials. It was also possible that, in order to get rid of certain leaders, employers had dismissed a whole group of workers. The Government had tried to solve matters through conciliation and mediation and had sometimes succeeded. As it stood, however, the existing legislation did not provide it with the means to do more. Quite apart from the fact that it was difficult to find proof - a problem which is not unique to the Dominican Republic, of course - the Labour Code (section ) allows the employer to terminate a contract for an indefinite period, without giving any reason. Consequently, an employer can dismiss a worker if he finds it convenient provided he pays his employee the amounts to which he is legally entitled (corresponding to the period of notice, the leaving grant and days of leave). This applies even when a collective agreement contains a special clause providing for the protection of union officials. According to existing case law, an employer who fails to respect this provision and dismisses trade union leaders is only required to pay the special indemnity which is provided for in the event of a violation of this clause.\n.The report mentions that there are at present proposals to amend the Labour Code, in particular section . The representative of the Director-General mentions the various drafts which have been prepared and adds:The President of the Republic has made a public appeal for a social truce. The representatives of the workers and employers are therefore in the process of negotiating an agreement through the Secretariat of State for Labour. One meeting was held during our mission, and the various inter-occupational Confederations whose officials I met took part in it along with the employers' associations. One of the items for discussion had to do with genuine respect for the freedom of association of workers: the employers' organisations are apparently prepared to guarantee that no trade union leader and no leader of any trade union in the process of being set up will be dismissed from their enterprises except by authorisation of an arbitration Committee. In practice, this amounts to an amendment by agreement of section  of the Labour Code. ... Moreover, it is quite feasible that, following the agreement, the matter will be brought before the Congress in the form of a Bill. The Secretary of State informed me that, even if no agreement is reached, a draft amendment to the law will be submitted on this point. Such an amendment could therefore be adopted without it being necessary to wait for the adoption of a new Labour code.\n.As the Committee has already pointed out in other cases, legislation which merely prescribes that any worker dismissed without just cause is entitled in certain cases to compensation and damages in addition to the wage corresponding to the period of notice, does not give sufficient protection against acts of anti-union discrimination, since it enables an employer, on condition that he pays the compensation prescribed by law, to dismiss any member of his staff, whether a member of a trade union or not, for trade union or other activities, the public authorities being powerless to prevent him from doing so. Protection is particularly desirable in the case of trade union officials because, in order to be able to perform their trade union duties in full independence, they must have the guarantee that they will not be prejudiced on account of the mandate which they hold from their trade unions. This guarantee is also necessary to secure respect for the principle that workers' organisations have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom.\n.The Dominican Government stated that it was keenly aware of the gaps in its legislation in this respect, and that it was trying to obtain a broad consensus as regards the solution to these difficulties. The Committee considers it essential that this question should be settled in the near future, given the problems which have arisen in the country.\n.Allegations concerning unfair practices in the public sector\n.The allegations referred to the setting up by the Government of a parallel union in Puerto de Andrs at Boca Chica (communication of August ) and a manoeuvre in the Dominican Telephone Company (CODETEL) to make the National Union of Telephone Workers (SNTT) lose its legal representative character (communication of June ).\n.As regards the latter point, the representative of the Director-General wanted to assure himself that the SNTT was exercising its trade union activities fully and that it had recently concluded a collective agreement with the enterprise for the period -. The agreement contains a special clause concerning the protection of trade union officials. Except in the case of a former leader who had been suspended, this provision had been respected. However, the report mentions other cases than that referred to in the previous paragraph in which parallel unions had been set up under the former Government. In this respect the Committee had earlier recalled (in May ) the provision of Article  of Convention No. . Under this provision - as under Article  of the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ), not ratified by the Dominican Republic - workers' organisations must enjoy adequate protection against any act of interference by employers in their establishment, functioning or administration. Article  specifies that acts which are designed to promote the establishment of workers' organisations under the domination of employers or employers' organisations, or to support workers' organisations by financial or other means with the object of placing such organisations under the control of employers or employers' organisations, shall be deemed to constitute acts of interference.\n.The Secretary and Under-Secretary of State for Labour declared that the present Government would not endorse or tolerate such practices as the previous Cabinet had done, specifically in the transport sector and the sugar industry. The representative of the Director-General adds the following:In a more general vein, I raised the matter of attempts by employers to interfere in the activities of workers' organisations, and not only in the public sector. On this point the Secretary and Under-Secretary of State said that the current provisions of the Labour Code did not give the Government sufficient scope to combat such practices but that it was nevertheless its policy to try to take action on the basis of the complaints received. They added that it was the Government's attention to introduce proper provisions to put a stop to such acts of interference.The Committee notes these statements and considers it desirable, even if the Government is resolved to tolerate such practices no longer, that legal protection should be strengthened and that the Labour Code should, for example, prescribe more dissuasive sanctions for contraventions of section , the provisions of which are reproduced in the footnote.\n.According to the information gathered, several union Confederations also expressed concern at the creation of the General Union of Dominican Workers (UGTD) allied to the political party currently in power (PRD) because they were afraid that the new organisation would receive more favourable treatment, especially in the public sector (the State is the principal employer in certain branches of activity, such as agriculture). Dismissals had already allegedly taken place in the health sector and the sugar-cane industry. This had given rise to a fear that the dismissed workers would be replaced by others who supported the new Government. In some cases this was said to have already begun. The representative of the Director-General explains that, according to the governmental authorities he spoke to, most of the Dominican trade unions were independent of the traditional Confederations and close to the PRD; they were now able to organise themselves and were doing so within the UGTD. The report continues:The Government spokesman went on to say that the dismissals that had taken place in the public sector had not been on trade union grounds. Two points in particular should be borne in mind: in the first place, it was customary in the country to give posts in the public sector to members of the party in power (spoils system); secondly, from the economic standpoint it was necessary to cut down in personnel as the number of employees had sometimes grown far too great. They insisted that the Government would respect the right of freedom of association and ideological pluralism. In any case, legal proceedings could be undertaken against the administration if it was suspected of misuse of power.\n.On more than one occasion the Committee has examined cases in which allegations were made that the public authorities had by their"", ""to be a fundamental problem which was still disrupting industrial relations in the country. Although section  of the Labour Code prohibits anti-union practices, the penal sanctions imposed are fines ranging from  to  pesos ( peso  US dollar). According to the report, the Government appears willing to do everything in its power to find a solution:The Secretary and Under-Secretary of State recognise that there have been numerous dismissals and that some cases had apparently involved trade union officials. It was also possible that, in order to get rid of certain leaders, employers had dismissed a whole group of workers. The Government had tried to solve matters through conciliation and mediation and had sometimes succeeded. As it stood, however, the existing legislation did not provide it with the means to do more. Quite apart from the fact that it was difficult to find proof - a problem which is not unique to the Dominican Republic, of course - the Labour Code (section ) allows the employer to terminate a contract for an indefinite period, without giving any reason. Consequently, an employer can dismiss a worker if he finds it convenient provided he pays his employee the amounts to which he is legally entitled (corresponding to the period of notice, the leaving grant and days of leave). This applies even when a collective agreement contains a special clause providing for the protection of union officials. According to existing case law, an employer who fails to respect this provision and dismisses trade union leaders is only required to pay the special indemnity which is provided for in the event of a violation of this clause.\n.The report mentions that there are at present proposals to amend the Labour Code, in particular section . The representative of the Director-General mentions the various drafts which have been prepared and adds:The President of the Republic has made a public appeal for a social truce. The representatives of the workers and employers are therefore in the process of negotiating an agreement through the Secretariat of State for Labour. One meeting was held during our mission, and the various inter-occupational Confederations whose officials I met took part in it along with the employers' associations.

They were originally submitted to the ILO prior to the change in the Brazilian regime in . The Government has since sent information on these cases in communications dated  April and  and  May .\n.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.The allegations in these cases refer to acts of violence committed by employers against workers, trade union activists and union leaders in the sugar cane plantations and alcohol distilleries of several States of Brazil, and specifically in Pernambuco and Sao Paulo, and to the failure of the Government to put a stop to them.\n.In the case of the State of Pernambuco in particular, the allegations concern the banning of union leaders from sugar plantations, the hindering of trade union activities, the burning of trade union premises, the interruption of the check-off system for union dues, death threats and even the assassination of union leaders or their relations simply for having demanded the implementation or renewal of collective agreements. Moreover, the complainants claim that a situation bordering on slavery and forced labour has developed in these regions, with workers being recruited clandestinely from other parts of the country to break the strikes called by the regular workers belonging to FETAPE.\n.The complainants explained that following a general strike in  the , rural workers of the sugar cane growing area secured a collective agreement on wages and labour standards and a guarantee that land would be made available to them for food crops. From  to  other collective agreements were signed under the aegis of the labour court and the workers became aware that they could take legal action to have them enforced. As from , however, the employers began to sabotage the agreements by recruiting huge numbers of unemployed labour from the drought-stricken areas of Sertao and Agreste. They got rid of the regular workers and replaced them by large numbers of underpaid, non-unionised clandestine workers from those areas. After the harvest, these workers returned to their home districts and had no way of demanding that their rights be respected before a labour court.\n.According to the complainants, these illegal manoeuvres by the employers were facilitated by the inertia of the regional labour delegation which, after the  elections, relaxed its supervision. In order to secure the departure en masse of the regular workers from the Meta area, the employers suddenly imposed a substantial increase in the workload, doubling or tripling the daily volume of work provided for in the collective agreements. They brought private militia onto the sugar plantations, armed with revolvers and rifles, to ""pay a visit"" on the inhabitants and ""supervise"" the payment of the workers. Some workers who had been granted land for their own use were no longer allowed to grow food crops on it; the land was laid waste and turned into cane-fields. The employers forbade the workers to mention the trade union and the labour standards stipulated in the collective agreements and ceased deducting union dues from their pay. The private militia denied trade union officials access to the plantations and punished workers who, as union delegates, attempted to keep in touch with their union. Some whose names were communicated by CONTAG and the ICFTU received death threats, were locked up in private prisons or were even assassinated, especially in the Goias area.\n.In the State of Sao Paulo the FTIC is unable to organise the workers of the state alcohol distilleries and is being prevented from establishing occupational associations that could subsequently become trade uninons. In Gantus , for instance, an agro-industrial enterprise with a distillery in Tupa, the employer has circulated a petition among the staff stating that the workers recognise that the enterprise is well run and rejecting the ""inopportune"" remarks of Pedro GonUales da Silva, a union leader responsible for unionisation in the State of Sao Paulo. The remarks referred to were a call to strike, and workers who did not sign the petition were liable to be placed on a ""black list"". The vast majority of the workers of Gantus therefore signed the petition.\n.In its reply the Government states that it has sought clarification from the President of FETAPE and that the instances of violence in the Meta area have now declined considerably, particularly those connected with the exodus of the regular plantation workers. Moreover, disputes between the employers and the regular workers and rural workers\' trade union are now confined to specific, localised areas. The situation that had arisen stemmed from the lack of laws and regulations governing labour relations, the disillusionment of the workers with the effectiveness of trade union action and, ultimately, the country\'s land-ownership structure. The Government is currently drafting two Bills to settle this kind of dispute. One is being prepared by the Ministry of Labour and governs the working conditions of temporary workers in sugar plantations, and the other is designed to implement the President of the Republic\'s solemn undertaking to undertake an agrarian reform that will bring about a viable and healthy solution to issues of this kind. The Bills are currently before the national Congress.\n.The Government notes that in May  collective agreements based on the ""Guariba agreement"" on labour relations in sugar plantations in the State of Sao Paulo were signed. It encloses a copy of the agreements between the Federation of Agriculture of the State of Sao Paulo and the Federation of Agricultural Workers, the Sugar Industries\' Trade Union and the Alcohol Industries\' Trade Union of the State of Sao Paulo. It adds that the Ministry of Labour has decided to set up a special group to enforce the agreements and encloses a copy of the relevant Decree No.  of  March . The Decree specifies that the special group is to be tripartite and must submit its first conclusions and recommendations within  days of the entry into force of the collective agreements. A collective agreement was signed on l September l between the rural workers and sugar cane plantation employers in the East of Pernambuco.\n.In addition, on  September  the Ministry of Labour set up a special tripartite committee to examine complaints of infringements of freedom of association made against the Government of Brazil through the ILO. The committee was required to submit its conclusions to the Labour Rights Commission of the Ministry of Labour. The tripartite committee met on  January  and concluded that the facts that had been denounced were of the utmost gravity. They concern the assassination of rural workers, death threats, acts of violence against rural workers and union leaders, the holding of persons in private prisons, the existence of private militias, the practice of torture by the federal police of Goias, attacks and other violations of human rights. The committee concluded that it could not reach any conclusion without concrete information as to whether or not steps had been taken by the competent authorities to deal with each complaint, how far the inquiries had advanced and whether the State Prosecutor\'s office had been informed. The committee therefore asked the Ministry of Labour\'s legal adviser to request the Office of the Ministry of Justice for detailed information on each case. Thereafter, on  March , the Minister of Labour requested the Minister of Justice to investigate all the complaints submitted in Case No. . As soon as it has received the necessary information on this case, the committee will be in a position to reach definitive conclusions.\n.With respect to Case No. , the regional labour delegation of the State of Sao Paulo has called for an investigation of the matter. This delegation indicated that on  August l the Federation of Workers of the Chemical and Pharmaceutical Industries accepted that the matter was now closed. The Government attaches to its reply communication No. .-./, signed on  August l by the said Federation, from which it appears that the conflict which had developed at the TUPA-SP enterprise had been resolved.\n.The Committee observes that the complaints were submitted prior to the change in the Brazilian regime in . Nevertheless, they contain extremely serious allegations concerning acts of violence by employers in sugar plantations in the States of Pernambuco and Sao Paulo and in alcohol distilleries. The allegations refer to the banning of trade union leaders from sugar plantations, the hindering of trade union activities, the burning of trade union premises, the interruption of the check-off system for union dues, death threats and the assassination of union leaders.\n.The Committee has noted the very specific information submitted by the Government', "".The allegations presented by complainants in these two cases werecontained in the following communications: from the InternationalConfederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) dated  June and  November \n.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection ofthe Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but it has ratified the Rightto Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.In its initial complaint of  June , the ICFTU explains thatworkers in the service of the State launched several protest actions at thenational level in April  against Government Decree No.  of freezing for two months (April-May) the salaries of federal public employeesand of workers in state enterprises. In view of the Government's refusal toenter into discussions with the trade unions, the trade union organisations inthe public sector and state enterprises decided to call a -hour strike on \n.The ICFTU goes on to say that the strike was called by  trade unionorganisations, representing  / million workers, and that it paralysed fullyor partly all the sectors affected by the Decree, namely oil, metallurgy, theports, electricity, chemicals, banks, railways, mining and telephones. Thestriking trade union organisations appointed a national co-ordinationcommittee of representatives of workers in state enterprises and of publicemployees. On  May the co-ordinating committee requested a meeting with theMinisters of Labour and of the Economy. The former did not open negotiationsand the latter refused to receive the workers' representatives.\n.The Government called in the army to repress the strike and to occupythe Petrobras and Duque de Caxias oil refineries in the State of Rio deJaneiro. At the Cubatao refinery in Sao Paulo,  workers coming off a shiftwere forced by the army to stay and work the following shift - which meantsleeping and eating in the refinery.\n.At EMBRAER, an aeronautics enterprise at San Jos dos Campos in theState of Sao Paulo,  workers were dismissed, including the works committeeand trade union leaders. The aeronautics police forced the strikers at bayonetpoint to return to work.\n.At the Jaguariri copper mines in the State of Bahia,  workers,including  trade union leaders, eight members of the works committee and tendirectors of the Public Employees' Association were dismissed.\n.Still in the mining sector, at Carajs in the State of Par,  tradeunion leaders of the local association were dismissed and expelled from theiraccommodations (which belong to the enterprise); they were warned that theywould be expelled on  May. Twelve workers from Puerto de Santos were alsodismissed.\n.In a subsequent communication dated  November , the ICFTU furtherindicates that since  November , , workers from the MetallurgicalTrade Union of the Volta Redonda National Iron and Steel Company are on strikeand are occupying the plant to secure the recovery of the  per cent wagelosses of recent months, a wage readjustment of . per cent for the monthof July, the reinstatement of  of their colleagues who were dismissedfollowing an earlier strike, and a six-hour working day on the basis of threedaily shifts.\n.On  November , the ICFTU continues, the police and the army raidedthe plant at  p.m., using tear-gas and sub-machine guns; they killed fiveworkers and left dozens seriously injured. The trade unionists who were killedare Joao Carlos Barroso, William Fernandez Leita, Wladimir Freitas Monteiro,Victor Adriani and Vincente Silva. According to the ICFTU, the plant is stilloccupied by over , armed soldiers and surrounded by tanks.\n.The WFTU, in its complaint of  November , denounces the events atVolta Redonda and claims that , workers are on strike and that, inaddition to the five workers who were killed (and it cites the same names asthose given by the ICFTU),  were injured and four persons - Mauricio Plata,Jos de Almayda, Osvaldino Gmez and Marcelino Alvez - are missing. The WFTUadds that on  November ,  workers from the National Iron and SteelCompany of Rio de Janeiro, together with workers from the Casa Piedra MiningCompany in the State of Minas Gerais, came out on strike in solidarity withthe workers of Volta Redonda and that five workers were injured inconfrontations with the army.\n.The ICFTU, however, in a letter dated  January , amends itsprevious letter stating that three, not five, workers were killed: Mr.Fernandes Filho and Mr. Freitas Monteiro who were shot, and Mr. Barroso whodied after his skull was broken by blows.\n.The WCOTP, in its letter of  November , denounces the violentintervention by the police (with tear-gas and cavalry charges) on  October\n.In its first reply of  February , the Government furnishes acertain amount of information and observations concerning the allegations madeby the WCOTP concerning the alleged anti-union reprisals against teachers,students and employees of the University of Sao Paulo on  October during a demonstration in respect of pay claims. In this connection theGovernment states that the Regional Delegation for Labour of Sao Paulo, whichit consulted on the matter, had informed it that employees of the universityhad indeed organised a campaign in front of the headquarters of the Governorof the state with a view to obtaining better salaries within the framework ofthe municipal election campaign of .

In view of the Government's refusal toenter into discussions with the trade unions, the trade union organisations inthe public sector and state enterprises decided to call a -hour strike on \n.The ICFTU goes on to say that the strike was called by  trade unionorganisations, representing  / million workers, and that it paralysed fullyor partly all the sectors affected by the Decree, namely oil, metallurgy, theports, electricity, chemicals, banks, railways, mining and telephones. Thestriking trade union organisations appointed a national co-ordinationcommittee of representatives of workers in state enterprises and of publicemployees. On  May the co-ordinating committee requested a meeting with theMinisters of Labour and of the Economy. The former did not open negotiationsand the latter refused to receive the workers' representatives.\n.The Government called in the army to repress the strike and to occupythe Petrobras and Duque de Caxias oil refineries in the State of Rio deJaneiro. At the Cubatao refinery in Sao Paulo,  workers coming off a shiftwere forced by the army to stay and work the following shift - which meantsleeping and eating in the refinery.\n.At EMBRAER, an aeronautics enterprise at San Jos dos Campos in theState of Sao Paulo,  workers were dismissed, including the works committeeand trade union leaders. The aeronautics police forced the strikers at bayonetpoint to return to work.\n.At the Jaguariri copper mines in the State of Bahia,  workers,including  trade union leaders, eight members of the works committee and tendirectors of the Public Employees' Association were dismissed.\n.Still in the mining sector, at Carajs in the State of Par,  tradeunion leaders of the local association were dismissed and expelled from theiraccommodations (which belong to the enterprise); they were warned that theywould be expelled on  May. Twelve workers from Puerto de Santos were alsodismissed.\n.In a subsequent communication dated  November , the ICFTU furtherindicates that since  November , , workers from the MetallurgicalTrade Union of the Volta Redonda National Iron and Steel Company are on strikeand are occupying the plant to secure the recovery of the  per cent wagelosses of recent months, a wage readjustment of . per cent for the monthof July, the reinstatement of  of their colleagues who were dismissedfollowing an earlier strike, and a six-hour working day on the basis of threedaily shifts.\n.On  November , the ICFTU continues, the police and the army raidedthe plant at  p.m., using tear-gas and sub-machine guns; they killed fiveworkers and left dozens seriously injured. The trade unionists who were killedare Joao Carlos Barroso, William Fernandez Leita, Wladimir Freitas Monteiro,Victor Adriani and Vincente Silva. According to the ICFTU, the plant is stilloccupied by over , armed soldiers and surrounded by tanks.\n.The WFTU, in its complaint of  November , denounces the events atVolta Redonda and claims that , workers are on strike and that, inaddition to the five workers who were killed (and it cites the same names asthose given by the ICFTU),  were injured and four persons - Mauricio Plata,Jos de Almayda, Osvaldino Gmez and Marcelino Alvez - are missing. The WFTUadds that on  November ,  workers from the National Iron and SteelCompany of Rio de Janeiro, together with workers from the Casa Piedra MiningCompany in the State of Minas Gerais, came out on strike in solidarity withthe workers of Volta Redonda and that five workers were injured inconfrontations with the army.\n.The ICFTU, however, in a letter dated  January , amends itsprevious letter stating that three, not five, workers were killed: Mr.Fernandes Filho and Mr. Freitas Monteiro who were shot, and Mr. Barroso whodied after his skull was broken by blows.\n.The WCOTP, in its letter of  November , denounces the violentintervention by the police (with tear-gas and cavalry charges) on  October\n.In its first reply of  February , the Government furnishes acertain amount of information and observations concerning the allegations madeby the WCOTP concerning the alleged anti-union reprisals against teachers,students and employees of the University of Sao Paulo on  October during a demonstration in respect of pay claims. In this connection theGovernment states that the Regional Delegation for Labour of Sao Paulo, whichit consulted on the matter, had informed it that employees of the universityhad indeed organised a campaign in front of the headquarters of the Governorof the state with a view to obtaining better salaries within the framework ofthe municipal election campaign of .

On that occasion, the Committee indicated that it would proceed with the examination of this case in relation to the specific allegations of violations of the principles of freedom of association and collective bargaining arising from protection agreements and to the issues concerning anti-union discrimination. The Committee requested the Government to provide all supplementary and relevant up-to-date information on the various allegations made by IndustriALL of specific situations involving the use of protection agreements, so that the Committee would have access to all relevant information when it next examined the follow-up of the case. In addition, the Committee referred the legislative aspects of the case on the application of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), to the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.\n.In its communication of  February , the Government sent information regarding the follow-up given to the Committee s recommendations in relation to the specific situations raised by IndustriALL in its previous communications:(a)\tHonda Mexico United Workers' Union (STUHM): the Federal Conciliation and Arbitration Board (JFCA) heard the case related to the title to the collective agreement filed by the STUHM, carrying out in due time and form each step of the procedure established in legislation: (i) the vote recount was conducted on  October  in the best possible conditions, without any duly substantiated or validated objections and in the presence of three JFCA certifying officers, the Secretary-General for Agreements, Conciliation and Collective Issues, two federal labour inspectors, eight observers representing foreign trade unions, the secretaries general and representatives of the unions and representatives of the company; (ii) the recount was carried out in accordance with the law in a peaceful and orderly manner, and of the , workers present,  voted for STUHM and , for the defendant trade union; (iii) when it discovered that the recount was not in its favour, the STUHM filed direct amparo proceedings with the first district labour court of the federal district, which were dismissed, confirming that the JFCA had acted in strict compliance with the law; and (iv) regarding the alleged existence of a presumed conflict of interest on the part of the individual who acted as coordinator for the advisers to the President of the JFCA, the board advised on  May  that the individual in question did not perform that public function and there was therefore no conflict of interest.(b)\tCommercial, Office, Retail, Similar and Allied Workers' Union (STRACC): (i) on  March , STRACC was granted the title to the collective agreement; and (ii) the parties who had been sued by STRACC lodged appeals for amparo (Nos DT /, DT / and DT /), which were unsuccessful and therefore did not adversely affect the STRACC.(c)\tNational Union of Petroleum Technicians and Professionals (UNTyPP): (i) since  March , Petrleos Mexicanos (PEMEX, hereinafter the oil company) and the UNTyPP have held more than  meetings in which issues raised by the UNTyPP have been addressed, including the dismissal of workers ' agreeing to discuss the possibility of rehiring those worker members of the UNTyPP who were affected by the aforementioned movements; (ii) this case was analysed as part of the round table discussions held since  by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security (STPS) with the National Union of Workers ' the STPS has facilitated meetings between the UNTyPP and the management of the company in which employment files were analysed, leading to the reinstatement and retirement of several UNTyPP members, in the interest of mediating a settlement to the disputes, on  July  the Deputy Minister for Labour addressed a communication to the chief executive officer of the company voicing the UNTyPP s concerns regarding the new collective labour agreement; (iii) there is a collective labour agreement between the company and the Petroleum Workers Union of Mexico (STPRM), which was last revised on  July  and is valid until  July .(d)\tWith regard to the BMW plant (hereinafter the first car manufacturer) located in San Luis Potos: (i) on  July , a collective labour agreement was presented to the JFCA between the company and the Mexican National Automotive Industry, Similar and the Allied Workers' Union of the Confederation of Mexican Workers (CTM); (ii) the labour authority verified the legitimacy of the Union to assemble automotive industry workers and that the contractual agreement complied with the requirements set out in section  of the Federal Labour Act, the collective labour agreement was consequently registered; and (iii) on  November , under the protocol on free collective bargaining, an extraordinary inspection was carried out at the company s San Luis Potos plant during which it was found that  workers ( men and  women) worked in the workplace, those workers knew the representative of the union of which they were a member, were aware of the collective labour agreement that applied to them and had access to it (both in the workplace and online); in that respect, it was confirmed that the company had hard copies of the collective agreement governing labour relations that were provided to workers and were made available in freely accessible spaces.(e)\tWith regard to the KIA Motors Corporation plant (hereinafter the second car manufacturer) in Nuevo Len: (i) on  August , a collective labour agreement was presented to the JFCA between the company and the Mexican National Automotive Industry, Similar and Allied Workers' Union; (ii) the labour authority verified the legitimacy of the Union to assemble automotive industry workers and that the contractual agreement complied with the requirements set out in section  of the Federal Labour Act, and, having fulfilled the jurisdiction and legal requirements and those for the right to represent others, the agreement was registered;

Furthermore, it recalls that new efforts have been undertaken to make the work of the labour authorities more efficient and timely and to consolidate the prompt and unimpeded administration of labour justice, including through national coordination mechanisms to improve the pursuit and administration of day-to-day justice in Mexico and the recent update to the labour regulations framework by means of the  constitutional reform on labour justice administration.\n.In communications dated  and  July , IndustriALL provides its observations and further information regarding the follow-up of the case. IndustriALL reports that, despite the reforms and other measures announced by the Government, the practice of employer protection agreements is continuing and expanding, as evidenced by the specific situations it presents in relation to the complaint. As a reminder, IndustriALL condemns the system under which such protection agreements reportedly continue to operate, emphasizing that: (i) the agreements are a clear result of cooperation between the Government (which would approve employer protection agreements in return for political favours ' while acting as employer, judge and litigant in the authorities responsible for administering justice), corporate federations (which are deeply embedded in political and economic decision making bodies) and certain companies (which maintain lower operating costs and control over their workforce as these agreements protect the employer from having to negotiate with genuine unions), thus preventing workers from exercising their right to freedom of association; (ii) the protection union that will administer the collective agreement is selected before the employer even begins operations; and (iii) if workers try to organize themselves, the authorities, employers and corporate federations work together to ensure they are not successful, using methods which range from postponing proceedings to dismissals and all types of threats and assaults. In addition, it challenges the effectiveness and authenticity of the measures announced by the Government to combat this deep-rooted practice, alleging that these changes are designed to allow the situation to remain unchanged, emphasizing that: (i) union information and collective agreements are not published or available, as reported by the Government; (ii) proceedings continue to last for an average of five years; (iii) meetings with Mexican unions in relation to the complaint did not address the issue of protection unions; (iv) while the constitutional reform is presented as a panacea, in reality it is an illusion, as demonstrated by the bill formulated"", 'as No. IV-/. At the hearing, ASPA confirmed its request and evidence, indicating the issues that needed to be addressed and stating the justification for a ballot to be held among the pilots alone, pointing to similar cases, such as those of AEROCANCUN, SARO and AEROMEXPRESS. The respondents, for their part, contested the application and produced their own evidence; they argued that the ballot should include all of the company s workers. They also stated that ASPA did not have the authority to take over from an industrial trade union the collective agreement for an occupational group when the collective labour agreement was indivisible. ASPA s application was accompanied by another, submitted by a different trade union and processed as No. IV-/. On  August , the Federal Council for Conciliation and Arbitration issued a ruling that the trial ballot should be held on  August  and cover the entire AVIACSA workforce, including pilots, cabin crew, mechanics and other ground crew and rejecting ASPA s proposal for an occupational ballot for pilots only. Given the illegal nature of such a company-wide ballot and the impossibility of winning (even if the majority of pilots voted for ASPA it would lose the case because it would not have the overall majority of votes, and if the majority of the company s workforce voted for ASPA it would also lose, because it only covers pilots and cannot offer membership to other categories). ASPA decided not to support the ballot and instructed pilots not to vote, or, if they did, to give their vote to another union in order to avoid being dismissed unjustly.\n.It adds that, following ASPA s decision to apply for a collective agreement for pilots at AVIACSA, a number of pilots had been unfairly dismissed purely because they supported ASPA, including Captain Emilio Alberto Zrate Gonzlez, Captain Andrs Flores Lpez, Captain Gerardo Gorra Carmona, Captain Ismael Cruz Romn, Captain Marcos Guillermo Mendoza Escobar, Captain Luis Fernando del Ro Leal, Captain Manuel Tostado Almazn, Captain Jos Eduardo Rodrguez Normanda, Captain Gerardo Serrato Sala, Captain Jorge Eduardo Moreno Aguirre, Captain Ari Rafael Rose Errejn and Captain Mario Rafael Escalera Crdenas. As a consequence of the unfair dismissals, individual appeals against dismissal were lodged and are being processed by Special Council No.  of the Federal Council for Conciliation and Arbitration under case numbers /, /, /, / and /.\n.The complainant states that, on  October , the Federal Council for Conciliation and Arbitration absolved the respondents of ASPA s demand to be allowed to conclude a collective agreement, ruling that it was not appropriate for the pilots of AVIACSA to have their own collective agreement. ASPA disagreed and launched an appeal, which was upheld by the Sixth Collegiate Tribunal on Labour of the First Circuit in document DT /. In granting the appeal and the protection of federal justice on  May , it ordered the Federal Council for Conciliation and Arbitration not to execute the ruling of  October  and to disregard the results of the ballot held on  August . It ruled that a new ballot should be held because of the illegality of the ballot for the entire AVIACSA workforce. Article  of the Federal Labour Law provides that, in the conclusion of collective labour agreements within a company, there may be both an industrial and an occupational trade union involved and that a collective agreement should be signed with the occupational trade union for its members and with the other trade union for the remaining categories of workers. Article , for its part, stipulates that the loss of the majority referred to in article  entails the loss of the collective labour agreement. The provisions of article  read as follows:Article . ... III. If occupational and enterprise or industrial trade unions are competing, the occupational trade unions shall be allowed to conclude a collective agreement for their occupational group, as long as the number of their members is greater than that of workers in the same occupational group holding membership of the enterprise or industrial trade union.\n.Article  provides that:The loss of the majority referred to by the previous article, as declared by the Council for Conciliation and Arbitration, entails the loss of the collective labour agreement.The Federal Council for Conciliation and Arbitration applied the principles contained in articles  and  of the Federal Labour Law and it was hence taken that, where conflicts over the right to sign the collective agreement arose because an occupational trade union wished to take over from an industrial union the professional representation of a given category, it was appropriate to take action. In recognition of the greater professional interest of the occupational trade union, it was decided to hold an occupational ballot in which only the members of the disputed category would participate. That rule had been applied by the Federal Council for Conciliation and Arbitration in all such conflicts over the right to sign in the airline industry, where, because of the industry s special nature, workers were organized in occupational unions on the basis of a natural division of activities.\n.The complainant states that the Federal Council for Conciliation and Arbitration suddenly amended its rules for the airline industry. In order to protect the unions favoured by the employers and the employers themselves, and since the current collective agreements were of a company-wide nature, it adopted a new rule, namely that the right to sign a collective agreement could not be claimed on behalf of a specific occupational group, but only on behalf of all categories covered under the agreement, which left the occupational trade unions without any rights at all. However, this rule, put forward by the Federal Council for Conciliation and Arbitration, was declared illegal by the High Court of Justice, which ruled that it was appropriate for an occupational trade union to claim from an industrial trade union the right to sign the collective agreement on behalf of a specific occupational group and that the trial ballot should be held only among the workers in that category.\n.Despite the fact that ASPA s appeal was upheld and it was deemed illegal to hold a company-wide ballot on a conflict over the right to sign on behalf of only one occupational group, on  May  the Federal Council for Conciliation and Arbitration once again ordered a general ballot, to be held on  June , dismissing ASPA s representations to the effect that an occupational ballot should be held for pilots only.\n.In every country, airline-industry workers are organized into occupational trade unions corresponding to the different occupational groups, namely ground crew, cabin crew and pilots. This is the general rule because each of these occupations has its own features, on the basis of which its workers have sought to organize their own unions, and the respective unions are affiliated to international federations for each of the relevant occupations. In the case of pilots, both in the Americas and in Asia, Europe, Africa and the Pacific Rim, there are occupational unions, which in turn belong to supra-national organizations of a regional or global nature, such as the OIP or IFALPA.\n.In its communications dated  October  and  March , the Government states that, according to the Trade Union Association of Airline Pilots of Mexico (ASPA), the alleged violation took place during the legal case over the right to sign the collective agreement, brought against Consorcio Aviaxsa, S.A. de C.V. (AVIACSA) and the Trade Union of Workers in Aeronautics, Similar and Related Industries of the Mexican Republic (STIAS).\n.It adds that the events related by ASPA took place during the legal dispute over the right to sign a collective agreement, and, as such, fall under the provisions governing collective bargaining rights contained in the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), which has not been ratified by Mexico.\n.In connection with the dispute, the Government states that on  March  AVIACSA concluded a collective labour agreement with STIAS in order to regulate worker-employer relations, which, according to the agreement, should be conducted through a trade union. The clauses of the contract were applicable to all AVIACSA workers. The only distinction drawn among workers was the basic salary payable to each category. The latest version of the salary scale contained  different post types.\n.The Government adds that, on  March , an agreement was concluded on the revision of the salaries contained in the collective labour agreement between AVIACSA and STIAS. This established the categories of ground crew and air crew and laid down different working conditions for each category. The only reference to grades of workers is in the scale of minimum salaries payable according to post, which includes different types of pilots.\n.The collective labour agreement between AVIACSA and STIAS and the salary revision agreement were not divided into occupations. The salary revision agreement drew a distinction between ground crew and air crew in order to be able to provide benefits over and', ""to implement the reform, which was presented by senators who are members of corporate federations and therefore reproduces the system of collective protection agreements; and (v) the  protocol on free collective bargaining is no more than a sham as: the inspection dates are decided in advance with the company; the workers questioned during the inspection are selected by the trade union representative and/or the employer (questions simply regarding whether the worker in question is aware of their union and its statutes, whether he or she is aware of the collective agreement and whether the agreement is accessible to workers, in a clear location in the workplace). IndustriALL considers that if a collective employer protection agreement is in place in that workplace (as, according to the complainant, is the case for  per cent of workplaces) the replies are controlled by the protection union, rendering the protocol useless. In addition, in order to demonstrate the deficiencies of the public mechanisms, IndustriALL reports that, in response to the impunity and passivity of the labour authorities, a committee of civil society organizations has been established in the textile industry that includes  international brands and which carried out a  Campaign for freedom of association in Mexico' with the objective of  challenging the use of protection agreements in their supply chains'  These brands have worked on their own initiative to implement independent monitoring and audits to verify the compliance of their internal codes of conduct with the ILO fundamental Conventions, in particular to address the issue of protection agreements and ensure that the supplier companies with which they have production contracts understand and respect the right to freedom of association. In several cases these private initiatives have managed to resolve serious issues related to rights, dismissals and harassment in factories where protection unions operated.\n.In addition, IndustriALL provides further information regarding specific situations highlighted in the Committee s previous examination of the complaint and on new cases. With respect to previously presented cases, on which the Government has provided its observations, the complainant indicates that:(a)\tRegarding the STUHM, challenging the Government s report, it emphasizes that: (i) the JFCA ordered the recount within the company and without reliable documentation on the voter register; (ii) during the recount entry was denied to the team of national and international observers and STUHM representatives (union representatives were threatened with firearms by the plant s security personnel when they demanded to be granted entry and they were only permitted to enter following heated arguments and complaints); (iii) throughout the whole procedure inside the plant representatives of the union in question, the Union of Employees and Workers in the Vehicle Manufacturing and Assembly Industry (SETEAMI), and the company continuously threatened the workers with dismissal if they lost the recount; (iv) the list of voters contained persons who should not have voted and company personnel selected those who could access the voting area, which was isolated from the rest of the plant and surrounded by internal security personnel; and (v) the irregularities were reported by the STUHM but they were not addressed by JFCA officials; (vi) the SETEAMI legal representative acted as the representative of the SETEAMI (of the CTM) during the trial before the JFCA and as the coordinator for the advisers of the president of that board, when the STUHM reported this conflict of interest, the individual ceased to represent SETEAMI, but reassumed that role in June ; (vii) despite all of the aforementioned irregularities in the recount, the STUHM received  per cent of the vote; however, the company refused to grant it the facilities to represent its members, including entry into the plant, office space to meet with members, recognition of its representative and the deduction of trade union dues, and (viii) the executive board of the STUHM remains dismissed and its request for reinstatement is in process.(b)\tRegarding the STRACC: (i) in several stations where it is the titleholder of the collective agreement, employer representatives and protection unions threaten workers in order to coerce them into resigning with a view to hiring new personnel from third party companies; (ii) STRACC leaders, members and representatives have been threatened, attacked, kidnapped and illegally imprisoned as a result of false accusations from employers in collusion with the local and federal Government, in this context, organizing in a union poses a risk for the personal safety of workers and their families; (iii) in the legal action to seek title initiated on  June  by the STRACC against the Union of Employers and Workers in the Federal District General Trade Sector and the company, the recount was not held until  August , owing to a series of irregularities instigated by the company, the protection union and the Local Conciliation and Arbitration Board (JLCA) of the federal district; (iv) it was not until March  that, after repeated appeals lodged by the company, the STRACC was recognized as the titleholder for this workplace, but in the meantime the majority of workers who had expressed a preference for the STRACC as their trade union had been dismissed and the company is currently dismissing more workers in order to hire new employees through a third party company which operates its own collective protection agreements; (v) in June  in the La Laguna petrol station, after STRACC had obtained the title to the collective labour agreement and had attained various related achievements, first the company threatened the Secretary-General to coerce him into cancelling the collective agreement and subsequently the Secretary-General of a trade union of a federation considered to be corporate contacted him asking how much money he wanted for the collective agreement, an offer which the STRACC representative declined; then armed thugs from the federation concerned hired by the company appeared during each shift change, attempted to oust workers and STRACC members using threats and demanded that they resigned from their jobs and the trade union ' the STRACC issued a call to strike to the company to protect its members, which is pending before the JLCA.(c)\tRegarding the UNTyPP: (i) the oil company held several meetings with the UNTyPP in  and  that did not resolve the key issues such as union representation, the refusal to engage in collective bargaining, open and aggressive interference in trade union operations and the refusal to reinstate those dismissed; (ii) the small number of meetings that have taken place with the company have been held on the insistence of the UNTyPP and the replies were sent electronically to avoid a record being kept of the meetings or of the recognition of the trade union;

I have a few', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']","['.In a communication dated  September , the ICFTU submitted a complaint of infringement of trade union rights in Ecuador. The complainant organisation provided additional information in support of its complaint in a communication of  November .\n.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  and  October  and  January .\n.Ecuador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No.) and the Right to Organise in Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No.).\n.In its complaint, the ICFTU explains that its affiliate organisation in Ecuador, the Ecuadorian Confederation of Free Trade Union Organisations (CEOSL), organised, together with other national trade union confederations, a peaceful  hour strike on  September  with a view to doubling the basic subsistence wage and condemning the Government\'s economic and social policy. Fifteen trade unionists were arrested on that day, including Julio Chang Crespo, Secretary-General of the CEOSL and member of the Executive Committee of the Inter-American Regional Organisation of Workers (ORIT), a regional organisation belonging to the ICFTU. The ICFTU states that it supports its affiliate organisation\'s claims for wage increases and the repeal of governmental economic and social measures.\n.Together with its communication of  November , the ICFTU encloses a report from its affiliate, the CEOSL, on the causes which gave rise to the national general strike called by the Ecuadorian trade union movement and the course it took. The CEOSL explains in this document that the Government has carried out a policy aimed at giving a boost to exporters of agricultural products, banks and large undertakings at the expense of small and medium-sized enterprises, resulting in the worsening of the social and economic situation of the majority of the population. This policy has brought about, for instance, price increases in stable commodities, public services (transport, electricity, water and telephones) and medicines, the freezing of budgetary expenditure for education and an increase in unemployment and underemployment.\n.According to the CEOSL, the Government systematically infringes Conventions Nos.  and  and the right to strike. For example, it refuses to register trade union executives which have been democratically and legally elected and to approve the rules of new organisations by laying down administrative requirements not stipulated by law. The CEOSL quotes the case of several trade unions who have been confronted with such difficulties (the Ecuadorian Railway Workers Union, the Works\' Council of Cubiertas and Mzov S.A., the Federation of Free Workers in the Ecuadorian Sugar Sector, the Santa Elena Agricultural Workers\' Trade Union).\n.As regards collective bargaining, the CEOSL states that collective agreements are not applied either in the public or in the private sector; bargaining is obstructed and agreements negotiated with public undertakings or bodies are challenged by the Ministry of Finance. In many cases, according to the CEOSL, strikers are subjected to police repression although the strikes have been called in strict conformity with the law.\n.The CEOSL also points out that the Executive does not apply the decisions adopted by the National Congress. For instance, the Government submitted a Bill to increase wages by , sucres per month (equivalent to  US dollars ) accompanied by a tax programme to finance the wage increase. The Congress refused this Bill on the grounds that the increase was derisory. The Executive nevertheless, implemented this Bill, refusing to apply the Congress\'s decision to increase wages by , sucres per month (equivalent to . US dollars).\n.According to the CEOSL, the President of the Republic also approved an Executive Decree restricting the right to call solidarity strikes, which is contrary to Ecuadorian law. This Decree, of which the CEOSL provides a copy, limits solidarity strikes to five days, stipulating that they may not be called upon more than twice in one year by workers in the same undertaking. The CEOSL has lodged an appeal against this Decree with the Tribunal of Constitutional Guarantees.\n.In these circumstances, the national trade union confederations called a national strike on  September , in which wide sectors of the economy throughout the country took part. This movement was harshly put down by the police which, according to the CEOSL, arrested about  workers.\n.The CEOSL headquarters were also brutally attacked by the police and the trade unionists inside were dealt blows.\n.In its communications of  and  October , the Government states that Julio Chang Crespo, mentioned in the ICFTU\'s complaint, was arrested on  September  and sentenced to two-days\' imprisonment for breach of the peace and not for having exercised the right to strike, which is legally recognised. The person in question was released on  September and, two days later, left the country to attend a trade union meeting being held in Buenos Aires.\n.The Government adds that strikes linked to industrial disputes are protected by the Ecuadorian legal system but that, on the other hand, collective work stoppages and political strikes are specifically banned by Act No.  adopted by the National Assembly in . Under this Act, a collective work stoppage is defined as being the collective cessation of activity, the imposing of a lock-out outside the cases allowed by law, the paralysis of lines of communication and other similar anti-social occurrences. The instigators and authors of such stoppages are liable to a fine of , to , sucres and to two- to five-years\' imprisonment; those taking part in the work stoppage are liable to a fine of  to , sucres and to three-months\' to one-year\'s imprisonment. In its communications issued before the strike, the Government informed the population that this Act was still fully in force.\n.In the text of the sentence handed down by the Sixth Police Court on the persons arrested on  September , it is stated that those concerned took part in demonstrations not authorised by the police, which disrupted law and order and blocked the public highway, and that they shouted protests against the Government and public officials. In accordance with section , paragraph  of the Penal Code, they were sentenced to two days\' imprisonment.\n.The Government also encloses press cuttings containing statements by the Minister of Labour to the effect that the strike of  September was of a political nature and attempted to destabilise the regime.\n.In its communication of  January , the Government considers that the critisisms levelled by the complainants at the economic and social policy conducted in Ecuador are merely subjective statements of an arbitrary nature and divorced from reality. Admittedly, like many developing countries, Ecuador is undergoing a crisis, but the Government is attempting to ensure that the nation overcomes it unscathed and with the least social and political consequences. It is incumbent upon the public authorities to guarantee peace in the country and uphold national law and order.\n.The Government strongly denies the allegation that, by controlling the seditious actions of  September, it infringed ILO Conventions Nos.  and . It widely respects trade union rights and guarantees the exercise of these rights provided that this is lawful and moral and does not infringe legislation or disrupt law and order. The ""general strike"" of  September, wrongly described as ""peaceful"", was neither of a social nor trade union nature but was a seditious act: groups of rioters set up barricades in the streets and on the highways, caused fires, attacked members of the police force and private and official vehicles, damaged private property and injured individuals. The Government was prudent in the way it controlled the situation. Only several people actually instigating the disturbances or involved in violent action were arrested after being caught in the act. These agitators, who were imprisoned, were immediately released once the disturbances had ended and after serving a very short sentence of two-days\' imprisonment, in accordance with the penalties for offences laid down in the Penal Code. The only reason behind all the international proceedings was therefore to prolong a meticulously organised scandal and to exaggerate the importance of incidents brought rapidly brought under control. According to the Government, even an opposition paper described the general strike as being political. Furthermore, the Government points out that the so-called ""evidence"" of the ""repression"" carried out by the Government consists of cuttings from this same opposition paper.\n.The Government quotes several articles from the National Constitution: article , which lays down the functions and duties of the President of the Republic, including the upholding of national law and order, the use of the police force when security and public services warrant this and the declaration of the national state of emergency; article , which states that the role of the police force is to uphold national sovereignty, defend the integrity and independence of the nation and to guarantee its judicial system. The Government also provides a copy of the provisions of the Penal Code pertaining to offences against national state security. The Government points out that the rights of the individual and of society are protected by Ecuadorian legislation, in particular by Title II of the Constitution, of which it provides a copy.\n.The Government adds that', ""E.P. PETROECUADOR, have forfeited their legal personality by failing to renew their statutes when their employer became defunct, in accordance with the second transitory provision of Decree No. . The Government states that, in the light of these facts, FETRAPEC is not currently a representative organization, nor does it have legal personality.\n.As to recommendation (b), the Government states that the employment relationship of public officials who are subject to the regulations laid down in the Labour Code may be terminated by means of unfair dismissal, which is provided for in and regulated by section  of the Labour Code, which applies to workers in both the public and private sectors without distinction. Trade union members and officials do not fall under a special category of workers who enjoy privileges that other workers do not, just as unfair dismissal is not used to harm members of trade union movements. The Government states that, in Ecuador, a dismissal is only illegal when the worker is not compensated in accordance with the law, for which reason, no enterprise that has fulfilled the obligations set out in section  of the Labour Code is obliged to reinstate dismissed workers.\n.As to recommendation (c), the Government states that all the dismissed workers, of whom only a tiny percentage were trade union officials, were duly compensated in accordance with section  of the Labour Code. The Government reaffirms that none of the dismissals was anti-union in nature, as the Labour Code applies to all workers without distinction, and that trade union members and officials do not enjoy privileges that other workers do not, just as unfair dismissal is not used to harm members of trade union movements. Ecuadorian legislation does not consider the unilateral termination of an employment relationship to be illegal, provided that the worker is duly compensated. Furthermore, it should be noted that the current Government has approved three times more trade union organizations than other governments and that the proposed new Labour Code, which has been developed with the technical assistance of the ILO, guarantees the right to freedom of association by branch without interference from employers. These facts demonstrate the current Government s wholehearted support for the trade union movement in Ecuador.\n.As to recommendation (d) on the alleged violation of the collective agreement in force regarding compensation owed to workers who voluntarily ended their employment at the aforementioned enterprise, the Government states that the ruling of the National Court establishes that the workers who elected to end their employment voluntarily freely accepted their dismissal and signed the relevant severance agreement, thereby accepting the severance pay provided for therein. The Government indicates that, in the light of these facts, promoting dialogue between the enterprise and the workers as an alternative administrative measure to resolve the conflict is no longer necessary, given that the ruling of the national court has resolved the conflict through the judicial system, which has followed the correct procedure in accordance with the Constitution and the law.\n.As to recommendation (e) on the alleged dismissals at the Unidad Elctrica de Guayaquil enterprise and the ongoing criminal proceedings against the workers, the Government indicates that under Decree No. , issued by the President of the Republic and published in Official Journal No.  of  August , the then Board of the Temporary Electrical Power Administration of Guayaquil became the Unit for the Generation, Distribution and Commercialization of Electrical Energy of Guayaquil (Unidad Elctrica de Guayaquil), which, according to article  of the aforementioned Decree, comes under the authority of the Executive, which is part of the central public administration. In the light of these facts and with regard to the alleged dismissals, the Government states that, on the morning of Wednesday  November , the aforementioned Unidad Elctrica de Guayaquil workers arbitrarily stopped work for no legitimate reason and began shouting slogans against the authorities of the enterprise. According to the Government, it became clear from the numerous press articles on the incident that the workers had even resorted to the unauthorized use of automobiles to block the entrances to the enterprise s premises in order to carry out the stoppage. It should be noted that those automobiles are public property and should only be used for work purposes. The Government states that, in this way, the workers endangered the safety and physical integrity of all the persons present at that time by committing acts that are expressly prohibited by section , paragraphs (a) and (b), of the Labour Code. In the light of these facts and as is reflected in the documentation in the possession of the Guayaquil Department of the Ministry of Labour Relations, the dismissals were approved in accordance with the third reason listed in section  of the Labour Code, which led the labour inspector, who was acting on behalf of the administrative authority and using the powers conferred on him by section , paragraph , of the Labour Code, to approve the dismissal of the workers in question.\n.As to recommendation (f), the Government indicates that Ministerial Order No. , published in Official Journal No.  of  August , was issued with the aim of automatically adjusting the clauses of the collective agreements in question to ensure their compliance with the provisions of Constituent Resolution No. . The aforementioned ministerial order is understood as being an instrument for regulating the transition from the former collective agreements in place prior to Constituent Resolution No.  to ensure their compliance with its provisions. Therefore, the ministerial order has served its purpose, is final and complies with Ecuadorian legislation without violating the principle of free and voluntary collective bargaining enshrined in Convention No.  for the reasons detailed below. Ecuador respects the principles enshrined in Convention No.  and has on no occasion prohibited free collective bargaining, rather it has regularized such bargaining so that it takes place within the framework of established parameters, which are in keeping with the limitations of the State of Ecuador, its fiscal budget and its constitutional principles, such as those established in article  of the Constitution, which provides that:  At all levels of Government, public funds shall be managed in a sustainable, responsible and transparent manner and shall seek to achieve economic stability. Permanent expenditure shall be funded with permanent sources of income. Permanent expenditure on health care, education and the judicial system shall take priority and, in exceptional circumstances, shall be funded with non-permanent sources of income'  In this connection, the Government also refers to Ministerial Order No. A, which was published in Official Journal No.  of  October  and lays down the regulations for revising collective labour agreements, in accordance with the provisions of Constituent Resolution No. , but which does not prevent free collective bargaining, provided that it takes place within the established parameters and is in keeping with the principle enshrined in article  of the Constitution and the principles of equality and transparency. Ministerial Order No. A also seeks to ensure equal pay for equal work in the public sector by respecting differences but not excesses and privileges, which cannot be sustained by the budget of the State of Ecuador and which undermine the principle of equity. Thus, Ministerial Order No. A is also final and complies with Ecuadorian legislation.\n.As to the Committee s request for the Government to indicate whether Constituent Resolution No.  is compatible with an exclusively judicial control, the Government states that the fourth transitory provision of Constituent Resolution No.  provides that the Executive that shall be responsible for establishing the criteria that shall govern the collective labour agreements of all public sector institutions, and that the third transitory provision of the regulations governing the application of Constituent Resolution No.  provides that the Ministry of Labour shall lay down the regulations and procedures for revising the aforementioned collective labour agreements and that  judges, courts and the administrative authorities shall enforce this provision' \n.The Committee recalls that the allegations that were still pending in this case related to union dues being returned to the workers who are members of FETRAPEC; to the adoption of legislation that was contrary to trade union independence and the right to bargain collectively; and to the dismissal of trade unionists [see th Report, para. ].\n.As to the recommendation requesting the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that the trade union dues are immediately returned to the workers who are members of FETRAPEC, the Committee takes note of the Government s statement to the effect that the Ministry of Labour Relations has taken note of the recommendation and undertakes to adopt the necessary measures to ensure that the union dues are returned to the members of FETRAPEC, and to inform the Committee of the progress made towards that end. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any developments in that regard.\n.As to the recommendation requesting the Government to encourage without delay the initiation of discussions between FETRAPEC and the"", '.The Committee on Freedom of Association examined this case at its November  meeting and presented an interim report to the Governing Body (see rd Report, paragraphs  to ), which was approved at its th Session (November ).\n.The Government sent additional information on the outstanding allegations in a communication dated  December .\n.Ecuador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.The Committee notes the detailed information provided by the Government concerning this case, in particular that Julio Chang Crespo, the trade union officer who is the subject of this complaint, and other trade unionists have been released after serving a sentence of two days\' imprisonment handed down by the trial judge for disseminating false information and rumours concerning the order currently prevailing in Ecuadorian society and for offending national honour. The sentence accords with the provisions of section () of the Ecuadorian Penal Code.\n.The Committee would nevertheless recall the principle that the full exercise of trade union rights calls for a free flow of information, opinions and ideas and to this end workers, employers and their organisations should enjoy freedom of opinion and expression at their meetings, in their publications and in the course of other trade union activities. However, the Committee recalls in general terms that in expressing their opinions trade union organisations should respect the limits of propriety and refrain from the use of insulting language. (See th Report, Case No.  (Grenada), para.  and th Report, Case No.  (Chile), para. (f).)\n.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee notes that Julio Chang Crespo and the other trade unionists who are the subject of this complaint have been released after being sentenced to two days\' imprisonment. The Committee further considers that the matter does not call for further examination.\n.In a communication dated  March , the ICFTU submitted a complaint of infringement of trade union rights in Ecuador.\n.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  July .\n.Ecuador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.In its communication dated  March , the ICFTU explains that its affiliate organisation in Ecuador, the Ecuadorian Confederation of Free Trade Union Organisations (CEOSL), together with other national trade union confederations, called a national strike on  March  to protest against the excessive increase in fuel prices and transport costs. According to the ICFTU, the Government, on the grounds of this national strike, ordered the arrest of the Secretary-General of the CEOSL, Julio Chang and other trade unionists.\n.In its communication of  July , the Government points out that on  and  March , there were three serious earthquakes which affected a large part of the country, resulting in loss of life and property and bringing oil production (the country\'s major trade export) to a halt, as a large stretch of the trans-Ecuadorian pipeline was destroyed; this caused a sudden situation in which the national economy threatened to collapse. The Government, the communication continues, coped with the emergency situation as best it could to ensure that the country could continue functioning in spite of the immediate consequences of the disaster.\n.The Government adds that, in view of the disasterous situation which had occurred and which threatened to paralyse the national economy, it was bound, in fulfilling its obligations to govern, to take some measures to create emergency resources (so to be able to pay the salaries of public servants, amongst other things) and improve the capacity of the remaining system of production. As part of these measures, it was necessary to raise the price of petrol to the equivalent of  American cents or  Swiss centimes per gallon ( litres), i.e.  American cents or  Swiss centimes per litre. Furthermore, it was vital to release foreign currency and float the bank interest rate, because the State was incapable of continuing to subsidise exchange rates and the fixed interest rate.\n.The Government\'s communication adds that confronted with this situation, the ""executive"" of the trade union confederations did not adopt a responsible attitude. Mr. Fausto Dutn, substitute member of the National Congress, representing the Broad Left Front (FADI), took over the presidency of the Workers\' Unitarian Front (FUT) and announced the list of claims of the forthcoming strike which advocated: i)there should be no payment of the foreign debt; (ii) the oil industry should be nationalised; (iii) primary commodities should only be marketed by ENAC and ENPROVIT (state marketing enterprises) in order to maintain a price balance; (iv) land should be handed over to the peasants. Furthermore, it demanded that the Head of State should be put on trial and resign and that the decision to increase fuel prices should be revoked.\n.The Government points out that this case has nothing to do with a ""strike"", because in Ecuadorian labour law a strike means ""a collective suspension of work by employees acting in combination""; a strike is authorised ""if a dispute arises between an employer and his employees"", and this is submitted to the conciliation and arbitration tribunal. It may only be declared in the following cases: ""() if the employer, after being notified of the employees\' demands, fails to reply within the statutory time or gives a negative reply; () if the employer, after being notified, dismisses or gives notice of dismissal to one or more employees, or gives notice of the termination of an agreement ..."", except ""in the case of the dismissal of an employee who has committed an act of violence against the property of the undertaking or factory or against the person of the employer or his agent; () if no conciliation and arbitration tribunal is appointed within the time specified in section  or if, having been appointed, the tribunal for any reason does not meet within three days of its appointment, on condition in either case that the failure is not the fault of the members designated by the employees; () if conciliation proves impossible or no award is issued within the time allowed by section "". Strikes are only guaranteed by the Constitution and the Labour Code subject to these conditions. However, this concept of strike action is so wide that it authorises strikers to remain in the factories, workshops or workplaces concerned (unique in world labour legislation), under police protection against the entry of agitators and strike breakers; it entitles strikers to receive remuneration and authorises solidarity strikes: ""The law also recognises the right to strike where the object is to support a lawful strike declared by the employees of another undertaking."" A lawful general strike might arise because employees in one undertaking support a strike in another undertaking, which is being conducted in accordance with the law, and this spreads to all undertakings throughout the country.\n.But this is not the case here, the Government continues in its communication, because on  March  political leaders of various opposition parties illegally interpreted ""freedom of association"" in their own way. These same political leaders head trade union confederations grouped together in the Workers\' Unitarian Front, whilst also participating in the Ecuadorian Revolutionary Youth Movement, the Workers\' Revolutionary Movement, the General Union of Workers or the Popular Front. Similarly, they collaborate with these real or fictitious organisations, with the FEUE and the UNE and various clandestine groups who are openly committed to violence. These persons, in interpreting freedom of association in their own way, prevented the free movement of vehicles and pedestrians and normal activities within the city by raising obstacles and barricades in the streets, destroying traffic signs, public clocks and rubbish bins and tearing up the paving on the streets.\n.The Government\'s communication also describes the outcome of the above-mentioned strike; in particular, it notes that: citizens and members of the police and their vehicles were stoned; tyres were burnt, in Esmeralda, stores and private houses were stormed and several establishments burnt; in Quito, as a result of the storming of the Hotel Coln Internacional and the Finance Corporation with incendiary bombs, there was a threat of fire in the first floors of the hotel and the windows of both buildings were shattered; the premises of the Employers\' and Workers\' Association of the Ministry of Labour and Human Resources were attacked with incendiary bombs; and in Quito, an incendiary bomb was thrown at a van transporting a group of young conscripts doing their national military service, some of whom suffered injuries and burns. In the capital city, the strikers killed hundreds of dogs, scorching them in the fire and then hanging them from the branches of trees and on lamp-posts. At the end of the day of  March, the strikers declared that the ""tenth general strike"" organised by the FUT had been ""victorious"". Several FUT officials tried,']"

The World Federation of TradeUnions, in a communication dated  September , and the PIT-CNT supportedSUA-VESTIMENTA\'S complaint. The Government replied in communications dated October  and  June and  October .\n.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of theRight to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise andCollective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.The Single National Trade Union of Workers in the Clothing Industry(SUA-VESTIMENTA) makes a series of allegations concerning infringements offreedom of association by the Chamber of Employers in the Clothing Industry(CIV) during a long labour dispute which has been growing more acute since.Although it recognises the democratic character of the Government andpoints out that civil and political freedoms are recognised in the country andthat as a consequence the principles of freedom of association are respected,SUA-VESTIMENTA states that the competent authorities have not taken effectivemeasures to prevent, in the manner prescribed in Articles  and  ofConvention No. , the very serious infringements of trade union rights whichhave occurred. Given the intransigence and anti-trade union attitude ofemployers in negotiations in the wage councils of June  (which fix minimumwages) the Executive Power decreed a  per cent wage increase with thesupport of the employers and which was rejected by SUA-VESTIMENTA on the basisof the percentage of the increase and the failure to respect the legalprovision contained in section  of Act No.  which prescribes that wagesshould be fixed by categories of workers in such a way that they areremunerated in accordance with the degree of specialisation required for theirjob. In the same way the use of homeworkers and small-scale clothing workshopsresults in over-exploitation which is compounded by the practice of employersof placing their trade union staff on unemployment insurance or dismissingworkers on the pretext that there is a shortage of work when jobs are in factbeing carried out in the above-mentioned workshops. In an attempt to pressurethe CIV into respecting the legislation, work stoppages were organised withinworkplaces extending throughout the working day. The CIV responded by:- establishing blacklists which make it impossible for trade union leadersand militant members to obtain stable employment. This is the case of RamnCceres, Secretary-General of SUA-VESTIMENTA, Harlem Olivera, DeputySecretary-General, the union leader Hugo Bergalta (a victim of slander by theemployers who accused him of discriminatory attitude based on race) and of per cent of the trade union leadership (the complainant organisation includesin an annex a list of those persons appearing on the blacklists);- dismissing or placing on unemployment insurance during the July dispute or as a result of it more than half of the  members of the nationaldirectorate of SUA-VESTIMENTA. Hundreds of workers were suspended and  weredismissed for having participated actively in the trade union measures on thepretext of alleged acts of misconduct committed during the strikes(SUA-VESTIMENTA encloses the list of persons dismissed);- assigning uniformed police to more than ten factories; when the publicclerks recruited by the employers interviewed workers to see whether they weregoing to join the strike, those who answered affirmatively were prevented fromentering;- locking in more than six undertakings those workers who were peacefullyoccupying factories without any measures being taken by the publicauthorities;- using fixed-term recruitment as a means of anti-trade union discriminationand preventing workers from joining the trade union;- misusing the unemployment insurance scheme as a means of dischargingunionised workers and subsequently recruiting other workers or giving out workto small and often clandestine workshops;- carrying out a preliminary investigation of workers seeking employment inthe clothing industry by means of agencies or undertakings which interviewedpersons close to the applicants concerning their participation in strikes,their political tendencies, etc. This occurs in several undertakings in thesector and, in particular, in Milton S.A. and OROLON S.A.;- the establishment of collective agreements between undertakings andworkers behind the backs of the trade union organisation (in the Milton S.A.undertaking a collective agreement was established which grants greater wagebenefits to workers on the condition that they do not participate in thecentral wage negotiations carried out by the trade union). SUA-VESTIMENTA thenillustrates these allegations by referring to anti-trade union acts which haveoccurred in the following undertakings: Milton, CIMPEX, EVERFIT, EL MAGO,RELOS, RODOY, ROMINA, SIDEX, CUBACAN, MOISES FELD, PAUL SHARK, FARGO,BERNALESA, RINSY, DYMAC, PRAKER, DAKAR and MANTEL..In its communication of  May , the Inter-Union Workers\' Assemblyand the National Workers\' Convention (PIT-CNT) point out that the return todemocracy in the country has led to a recognition of trade union organisationswhich play a proper role in the life of the country. They allege, however,that the provision contained in Article  of Convention No.  that ""machineryappropriate to national conditions shall be established ... for the purposeof ensuring respect for the right to organise"" has not been respected. InUruguay it is possible to keep active trade unionists out of employment bydismissing them since all the employer has to do is to dismiss the worker(without giving reasons) and pay the corresponding compensation. Thissituation, which is known to and ignored by the Ministry of Labour, is givingrise to a growing number of blatant acts of anti-trade union persecution.Decree No. / dated  February  establishes regulations to prohibit andimpose sanctions on anti-trade union discrimination, but does so in a purelyformal manner since it fixes very low fines (up to  or  times the dailywage) and the imposition of the fine is a matter for the discretion of theadministrative authority. It is not adequate machinery in the sense used inConvention No.  but rather one which facilitates discrimination. The Chamberof Deputies has approved a bill on the subject which does not satisfy theaspirations of the trade union movement since it results in excessiveinterference in the internal life of the trade union organisations by imposingvoting systems in the election of trade union officials. In addition to theclothing industry, trade union rights are also violated in the leatherindustry; the PIT-CNT makes the following allegations:- the dismissal of several dozen workers most of whom were works\' councildelegates and several members of the trade union executive. These events havebeen denounced to the Ministry of Labour without any solution being found orany stop being put to repression by the employers. In the AZADIAN undertakingan active trade unionist was dismissed for having gone to the Ministry ofLabour and Social Security to make a formal denunciation concerning tradeunion repression by an employer. In the EXXON and SAN LUIS undertakingsworkers have been dismissed for having demanded the implementation of specificstandards issued by the competent authority in this branch of activity. Inpractice, in both the leather and the clothing industries, trade unionactivity has become a secret or clandestine activity because the simpleknowledge by the undertaking that a worker is a trade unionist results in hisimmediate dismissal or other kinds of discrimination;- in several undertakings workers are required to sign a form stating thatthey have never been a member of the leather industry trade union and thatthey will not become a member in the future. These documents must be signedbefore the worker joins the undertaking;- the unlawful and abusive use of the unemployment insurance scheme. Thus inundertakings such as OROCUER, because of an alleged shortage of work, all themembers of the works\' council were placed on unemployment benefits at a timewhen work was being sent out to small workshops. The purpose of placingcertain workers - all leaders of the works\' council - on unemploymentinsurance is to damage the trade union organisation and make it impossible formilitant leaders to establish contact with workers in the factory. In the sameway, in the MILENI undertaking, all the workers were placed on unemploymentbenefits and then the same workers were offered work in another undertakingwhich refused to grant them the more advantageous conditions which they hadacquired in the undertaking which had placed them on unemployment benefits. Inthis case all the workers were accepted in the undertaking with the expressexception of all the members of the works\' council who remained onunemployment benefits awaiting the notification of their dismissal..In a communication dated  July , which was supported by the WorldFederation of Trade Unions, SUA-VESTIMENTA alleges that during the wagecouncil negotiations of June , employers continued to refuse to applydifferent wage rates based on wage categories despite the fact that theExecutive Power had adopted, in principle, a positive attitude by acceptingthe workers proposal to establish a preliminary categorisation which wouldupdate the text of a  arbitration award (the term ""precategorisation"" isused because rates are based on minimum wages). The trade union proposal wasincluded on an open agenda proposing a  per cent increase in the holidaywage, a  per cent increase in the Christmas bonus, the reinstatement ofdismissed workers and', ""consultation.\n.When it refers to the duration of the collective agreement in its article , the Bill provides that  a collective agreement whose term has expired shall remain fully in force with respect to all its clauses until substituted by a new agreement'  In this regard, we must recall that, as the Committee has said, any extension of collective agreements should be following tripartite analysis of the ensuing consequences for the sector to which it applies.\n.As regards Chapter V on prevention and settlement of disputes, the complainants state that articles '  are clearly in violation of international Conventions signed by Uruguay (these articles refer to the occupation of the workplace during a strike; these articles were withdrawn by the Government).\n.The complainant organizations indicate that, in short, the Bill does not enshrine a system, but a set of laws which partially regulate certain aspects in favour of only one of the parties. They assert that the Bill in question contains deliberate omissions: it regulates only workers' rights, but does not subject them to obligations of any nature or kind, it does not refer to employers' rights, it gives legal status to a manifestly unlawful action which violates rights enshrined in the Constitution, and it confers on the Executive Power a maximum degree of intervention in collective bargaining between employers and workers. All of this ultimately gives rise to dangerous imbalances in the system, and one-sided and thus arbitrary solutions. In conclusion, the complainants consider that the Government is acting on the fringes of what is lawful in contravention of the provisions of the international Conventions to which it is a party, namely Conventions Nos , ,  and .\n.In their communication of  October , the complainant organizations report the approval on  August  by the national Parliament, of the Collective Bargaining Act, which is the subject of this case. They draw the attention of the Committee on Freedom of Association to the failure by the Government of the Oriental Republic of Uruguay to fulfil the obligations it assumed when it ratified Conventions Nos , ,  and , by passing the Bill which is the subject of the case.\n.The complainants state that the recently passed Act, despite certain specific changes introduced in it, is in flagrant breach of the international Conventions signed by Uruguay. They state that, as has been explained, there were no  discussions' that were  free'   detailed'  in  good faith'  in a  framework of trust' and  mutual respect' with  sufficient time to express their points of view and discuss them in depth with a view to reaching a satisfactory compromise' \n.The Bill passed by Parliament and promulgated by the Executive Power as Act No.  enshrines direct intervention by the Government in collective bargaining in accordance with the articles described below. Article  of the Act creates the Higher Tripartite Council as the  body responsible for the coordination and governance of labour relations'  With regard to its composition, the Act provides that the Council shall consist of nine delegates of the Executive Power, six of the most representative employers' organizations and six of the most representative workers' organizations.\n.According to the complainants, the above warrants the following considerations. Firstly, it is a body which will interfere directly ( coordination and governance'  in the principal aspect of labour relations, which is collective bargaining. Secondly, the greater number of delegates from the Executive Power ensures that, in nominal voting, decisions will be in accordance with the interests and vision of the Government. Indeed, article  establishes an absolute majority of members, in which the sectors do not have equal representation with the Government. This is unquestionably a violation of tripartism, the guiding principle of the ILO.\n.One of the most worrying aspects for the complainant organizations, however, is that the Council has an ex officio power of convocation which allied to the quorum, transforms it into a powerful executing agency of the policies which the Government wishes to implement. Notwithstanding the above, special attention should be paid to article  which refers to the powers of the Council. The complainant organizations indicate that special consideration should be given to paragraphs (d) and (e). Indeed, paragraph (d) provides that the Council s powers will include  to consider and pronounce on questions relating to tripartite and bipartite bargaining levels'  In addition, paragraph (e) provides that it may  study and adopt initiatives on subjects which it considers pertinent to promote consultation, bargaining and the development of labour relations' \n.The concern of the complainant organizations is that the new body will be able to decide on any question related to bargaining levels and adopt initiatives to develop labour relations. As conceived, with the ex officio right of convocation, the greater number of delegates of the Executive Power, nominal voting, and powers defined in a broad, ambiguous, confused and ill-defined manner, this is undoubtedly a case of a body whose objective is clear: state intervention and dirigisme in labour affairs and collective bargaining. It thereby violates the autonomy of the actors and parties and the principle of free and voluntary collective bargaining enshrined in Convention No. . In a nutshell, moreover, the provisions of the abovementioned articles are contrary to the many pronouncements of the Committee on Freedom of Association which establish that public authorities must refrain from interfering to limit the right of the parties to free negotiation.\n.Article  of the Act provides that  a collective agreement whose term has expired shall remain fully in force with respect to all its clauses until substituted by a new agreement'  It is clear from this that it establishes a compulsory extension of the term of collective agreements, which is an interference in free collective bargaining. In article , when it refers to tripartite wages councils, whose functioning, according to a report of the Committee on the Application of Standards of the International Labour Conference , has been the subject of observation, it provides that  decisions of wages councils shall take effect for the respective group of activity once they have been registered and published by the Executive Power'  The requirement of publication for an agreement to enter into force is not fully in conformity with the principles of voluntary negotiation established in Convention No. , as the Committee has stated clearly.\n.Most importantly, however, is that this Act ultimately enshrines something that was precisely a reason for observation by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations in  when it examined the application by Uruguay of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ). According to the complainants, the observation of the Committee of Experts acquires special relevance since it was in response to the considerations of the Government itself. In short, the Act ultimately enshrines intervention and interference by the public authorities in clear violation of the abovementioned international Conventions. In conclusion, according to the complainant organizations, the Collective Bargaining Act passed by the national Parliament constitutes a violation of those Conventions.\n.In its communication of  December , the Government states that it must respond to the complainant proceeding filed by the IOE, the CIU and the CNCS for alleged violations of Conventions Nos , ,  and . The Government states that the focus of the complaint is linked to the Collective Bargaining Bill submitted by the Executive Power to the national Parliament and that the complainant organizations consider that the process of amending Uruguayan labour legislation, which began in , took place with total disregard of the employers' sector or their contributions, and thus in an absence of tripartism and social dialogue.\n.The Government states that it will demonstrate the lack of justification of the action, and the eventual benefits of the Bill which, as is natural in any democratic process, was subject to countless amendments from its submission to its final approval by the national Parliament, which is a crucible of all the political forces in the country and where the various sectors were invited to expound their positions.\n.The Government indicates that, before analysing the Bill, a clarification must be made which the complainants omitted to mention. Namely, the President of the Republic gave an undertaking to the employers' sector and the public (in that it was communicated to the press) to withdraw articles ' ; i.e. those which referred to occupation of workplaces, from the original Bill. In addition, the Minister of Labour and Social Security conveyed that decision on more than one occasion to the parliamentary authorities (Committee on Labour Legislation of the Chamber of Deputies), several meetings with employers and the press in general. Consequently, the employers (by which we mean exclusively the CIU and the CNCS) should not have omitted to mention that information to the Committee. It does not seem an appropriate practice for a proceeding governed by principles so dear to democratic institutions and justice as good faith and fairness.\n.In"", ""uncertainty of government policy.\n.The Government indicates that another of the allegations is the criticism of the Act based on the false dichotomy of dirigisme nterventionism versus free and voluntary negotiation. The Government indicates that this is a false comparison. The State must, on some occasions, intervene in the system of labour relations (bearing in mind that to fail to do so, as did previous governments, is also a form of intervention which can be called inaction) to ensure fulfilment of workers' fundamental human rights, for example, respect for freedom of association, the right of collective bargaining, moral conscience, private life, right to limits on working time, etc. Many of these rights are grounded in the Constitution of the Republic itself; others in international obligations assumed by the Uruguayan State, for example, with the ILO. Intervention may also fall into a third category; i.e. creating legislation and conditions to foster the promotion of freedom of association, collective bargaining, the right to organize, etc. First, by constitutional mandate and secondly, by taking a decision and adopting a policy which finds in this system healthy, constructive and strong labour relations. One such obligation is to fix minimum wages for workers, with periodic adjustments and as far as possible to allow workers, employers and the State itself to participate on an equal footing.\n.At the second level of collective bargaining (article  and following), it is established that wages councils shall comply with these international obligations, as they are responsible for  fixing the minimum amount of wages and conditions of work of all workers in the private sector ...'  The third level establishes bipartite collective bargaining (article  and following), where bargaining is free, voluntary and has the characteristics of collective autonomy. The Government considers that it is therefore tendentious and reflects an erroneous interpretation, aimed at confusing the Committee, to assert that in all cases where a bilateral agreement is not reached (typical collective agreement), wage councils will resort to wage fixing. Bilateral collective bargaining, i.e. classic collective agreements will continue, as they do now, to be free and voluntary, but in the matter of fixing minimum wages, when there is no agreement, when the bargaining in a branch of activity fails or in the absence of a collective bargaining framework, the State will convene the wages councils, which are tripartite bodies, to fix minimum wages and thus comply with Article  of ILO Convention No. .\n.The Government indicates that, the comments that the decisions of the Council will not be properly balanced because the Government has more representatives than the professional sectors, shows that they are not familiar with or reject the way in which the major ILO organs function, where delegations do not have the same number of delegates by sector. In general, the State has twice as many as the professional sectors.\n.As regards the objections to Chapter III, that the convocation to wages councils is in violation of free and voluntary bargaining, the Government states that the Bill, on the one hand, provides for classic collective bargaining, and on the other hand, through the socalled atypical collective bargaining, fulfils the obligation to fix minimum wages, in accordance with Convention No. . The proposed wording clearly draws on the abovementioned international instrument, thereby overcoming the observation that has been made against the country by the ILO s own supervisory bodies (Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations and the Conference Committee on the Application of Standards of the International Labour Conference) which had repeatedly pointed out that the provisions of the Convention concerned were not being applied, because the public authorities were not consulting the most representative workers' organizations in the case of establishing, applying and modifying minimum wages.\n.Furthermore, the collective bargaining that takes place in the wages councils continues to be free and voluntary. Although the State convenes the parties to this sphere of bargaining, it does so in order to fix minimum wages and their modifications. The professional organizations are free not to participate, but if they do not do so, they are the ones who fail to take advantage of or recognize this space for negotiation and consultation. In that case, the State can fix minimum wages without listening to them because they did not attend, or listening to only one of the parties. Attending wages councils does not involve an obligation to agree, as was said in the rounds that took place from  to now, where the percentage of unanimity was over  per cent and those agreed by a majority,  per cent. In the remaining average of  per cent where there was no form of agreement, the State made orders setting the minimum wages, but after having been present throughout the bargaining round, mediating to try and reach agreement. In this way, it fulfilled its obligation to fix minimum wages and create mechanisms for collective bargaining and consultation. The curious thing about the whole of this complaint is that the employers are apparently opposed to the way the system of wages councils operated, yet at local level they demanded vehemently to be involved in them and, when the moment of the bargaining reached an overwhelming majority, they signed collective agreements in those bodies.\n.As regards the objections to Chapter IV on bipartite collective bargaining, and specifically the objection to the provisions that one of the defects lies in company collective bargaining ' .. in the absence of a workers' organization, bargaining authority passes to the most representative higher level organization ...'  The Government explains that it arises because in Uruguay almost all companies are micro-, small or medium-sized enterprises. Trade unions are essentially organized not at company level but by branch of activity. In other words, the workers join this branch union, because there is no union in their company. Thus there are a great many federations, such as the Commercial and Industrial Workers' Federation of Uruguay (FUECI), the Federation of Beverage Sector Workers (FOEB) and the Uruguayan Health Federation (FUS). That is why, historically, collective bargaining in the country has basically been by branch of activity. It also means that the collective interests of workers in a company who belong to a branch trade union may be represented by that organization.\n.As regards the other criticism that  administrative checks to test representativeness and consultation are missing'  the Government states that the criteria used are in line with those established by the ILO itself. However, the criticism may be addressed in the regulations which will undoubtedly ensue from the Act. As regards Chapter V on prevention and resolution of disputes, the Government reiterates that articles '  on occupations of workplaces were excluded from the Bill by decision of the President of the Republic, as duly communicated to the employers and announced to the public.\n.Lastly, the Government states that the complaint is based on assumptions that can be clearly seen as untrue and fallacious. To deny that social dialogue and tripartism exist in Uruguay is to deny reality, or perhaps it is to seek to confuse those who need to understand the situation. For  years, wages councils were not convened, with the obvious consequences for workers' wages, which undoubtedly had an effect on social values. The impoverishment of the workers undermined the social fabric, concentrating wealth in a few sectors, increasing levels of informal work and weakening the unionized social actor.\n.In its communication of  January , the Government indicates that although it had already sent its observations concerning the case, it considered it of crucial importance to explain the reasons why the Government was delayed in formulating its observations. The Committee on Freedom of Association in its th Report, relating to the th Session held in November , made an urgent call to the Government, as at the time it still had not received the requested information. In this regard and bearing in mind that the Government has always endeavoured to submit a prompt reply to cases raised, it wishes to express with respect to the present case that it relates to a Collective Bargaining Bill submitted to the national Parliament in October , which since then has been the subject of various amendments.\n.Among these amendments, special mention should be made of the undertaking given by the President of the Republic to withdraw articles ' , which refer to occupations of workplaces, from the original Bill; a commitment made to the employers' sector and the public, in that it was communicated to the national press, and was in turn transmitted by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security to the parliamentary authorities, the employers and the various media. In addition, as regards the parliamentary processing of the Bill, it should be mentioned that it was analysed by the Committee on Labour Legislation in the Chamber of Representatives (item No.  of ) and by the Committee of Labour Affairs and Social Security in the Senate (item No.  of ), after hearing representations from the Merchant""]"

Moreover, with respect to the  election of the executive committee which was later recognised by the authorities, the Committee had implicitly considered that acts of interference contrary to the principles of Convention No.  had been committed (see th Report, Case No.  (Honduras), para. ).\n.With respect to the  teachers who are still dismissed because of the  strike, the Committee notes the detailed information provided by the Government from which it concludes that a number of the teachers mentioned by the complainant organisation were teaching in State schools, and that the rest had given up teaching to take up other non-teaching jobs or activities of a political nature, or for legally sanctionable reasons not connected with the above-mentioned strike were not employed in the service. The Committee observes that the executive committee of COLPROSUMAH which was not recognised by the authorities told the mission that the problem of the dismissed teachers had not been resolved: one of the persons interviewed by the mission (Mr. Marcelino Borjas) said that he was still dismissed and that others were teaching in private schools.\n.Since the unrecognised COLPROSUMAH executive committee undertook, during the mission, to send the ILO a precise account of the position of the persons dismissed, the Committee adjourns examination of this allegation pending receipt of this information.\n.Regarding the arrest of Mr. Ambrosio Sabio (ex-President of COLPROSUMAH), the Committee notes that, according to the Government, the proceedings that began in  against Mr. Sabio for the offences of forging private documents, usurpation of functions and persistent embezzlement of COLPROSUMAH, are at the indictment stage. The Committee also notes that according to the Government Mr. Sabio was arrested on  December  and provisionally released on  January , certain proceedings having been declared invalid and there being insufficient grounds for the issue of a warrant of arrest.\n.The Committee also notes the statement made by Mr. Sabio to the mission, particularly the fact that the accusation against him dates from  and that already then the First Criminal Court found no grounds for his arrest. He was arrested some days after the regular congress of COLPROSUMAH which had been convened by the unrecognised board on  December . Since  four judges have been dealing with the matter without issuing a warrant of arrest for lack of grounds. Inexplicably, in the course of a very short substitution in December , the warrant was issued by a judge, who, in total disregard for legality, certified that in November  the officially recognised executive committee of COLPROSUMAH had been properly elected.\n.In these circumstances, the Committee, noting that Mr. Sabio was released  days after his arrest since there were no grounds for his imprisonment, concludes that the measures taken to deprive Mr. Sabio of his freedom were of an anti-union nature. The Committee deplores Mr. Sabio's imprisonment and at the same time draws the Government's attention to the fact that the arrest or detention of trade union leaders or trade unionists because of their functions or their activities as such are contrary to the principles of Convention No. .\n.The Committee had requested the Government to communicate the results of the investigation being carried out concerning the whereabouts of the trade union leaders Mr. Rolando Vindel Gonzlez (see th Report, Case No. , para. ) and Mr. Gustavo Morales (see st Report, Case No. , para. ).\n.The Committee notes that, as mentioned in the mission report, the investigations are continuing, but that as yet the whereabouts of the leaders are still not known. In these circumstances, the Committee expresses its concern at the length of time that has elapsed since the disappearance of these leaders, and requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in the investigations being carried out to discover their whereabouts.\n.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:a) The Committee takes note of the report of the representative of the Director-General on the mission carried out from  to  January  in Honduras. The Committee notes with interest that the representative of the Director-General received every facility from the authorities of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare in carrying out the mission.b) With respect to the murder of a leader of ANACH, the murder of four leaders of SITRACOAGS and the attempted murder of three leaders of that organisation, the Committee observes that trials are under way and that two of the alleged perpetrators have been identified although they are fugitives from justice. The Committee expresses the hope that the trials under way will be concluded as soon as possible and that they will enable the guilty parties to be punished; it requests the Government to keep it informed of the final results.c) As regards  teachers who are still dismissed because of the  strike, the Committee notes the information provided by the Government but adjourns examination of this allegation pending receipt of information on the present position of the dismissed teachers which, during the direct contacts mission, the unrecognised COLPROSUMAH executive committee undertook to send.d) Concerning the arrest of two trade union leaders who have now been released (Mr. Jos Manuel Guerrero and Mr. Ambrosio Sabio), the Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that the arrest or detention of trade union leaders or trade unionists because of their functions or activities as such are contrary to the principles of Convention No. .e) The Committee expresses its concern at the long period that has elapsed since the disappearance of the trade union leaders Messrs. Roldando Vindel and Gustavo Morales, and requests the Government to keep it informed of developments of the investigations under way to ascertain their whereabouts.\n.The complaint of the World Confederation of Organisations of the Teaching Profession was presented in a communication dated  March . At its meeting in February  the Committee, having noted that despite several requests the Government had still not sent the information and observations requested from it appealed to it to supply its observations as a matter of urgency. The Committee also drew the Government's attention to the fact that, in accordance with the rule of procedure established in paragraph  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body, the Committee could submit a report on the substance of the matter even if the Government's observations had not been received by its next session (th Report of the Committee, para. ). Since then the Government has still not furnished information or observations on the matter.\n.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No.) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No.) .\n.The complaint of violation of freedom of association is lodged against the Government of Honduras by the World Confederation of Organisations of the Teaching Profession (WCOTP) on behalf of its affiliate, the Professional College for the Advancement of Teaching in Honduras (COLPROSUMAH). According to the WCOTP, the Government has interfered with the right of organisations to draw up their rules and to elect their representatives by adopting legislative measures, and with the right of the most representative organisation to elect its representatives to advisory bodies by withdrawing this right of representation from genuine representatives of the teaching personnel of Honduras and giving it to a dissident group set up with the support of the Government and of the police and military.\n.The WCOTP explains that on  September  the Government adopted Legislative Decree No. - to promulgate an Act respecting the Professional College for the Advancement of Teaching in Honduras (COLPROSUMAH) , repealing the previous Act of  December  on the matter. The new Act was published in the Official Gazette on  October . It was prepared without the participation of this trade union organisation and, in drafting it, Parliament established new standards for the election of the executive committee of the organisation stipulating that trade union leaders may not be re-elected until two two-year periods had elapsed (sections  and  of the Act). According to the WCOTP, this text was adopted with a view to prejudicing the trade union executive of the COLPROSUMAH and in order to favour a group of teachers who have taken over the organisation with the support of the Government.\n.The WCOTP states that the adoption of this legislation and the change of trade union representatives on the various advisory bodies must be seen against the background of the events"", "" July , presented further allegations (Case No. ). The Government provided additional information in two letters dated  May  and in letters dated  and  August .\n.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.The allegations arise, in part, from events which took place on  March  in .he Bemis Handal textile plant in San Pedro Sula. According to the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the intervention of the police and security forces to break up the workers' strike and their occupation of the plant resulted in the burning down of the plant and the death of several workers. Also according to the complainants, many workers were arrested. For its part, the WCL provided a list of  workers, members of the National Peasants' Union, who were said to be detained in various prisons in the country. The WFTU in its letter of  July  provides a list of  trade unionists and  professors who have been allegedly arrested for organising a strike in Honduras.\n.The Government, in its previous replies, stated that during the incidents on  March , the fire was deliberately started in the Bemis Handal undertaking by the occupants with the intention of destroying this work centre. The authorities therefore immediately had undertaken investigations to find the authors of the arson and bring them to trial in order to determine their participation in the matter. These investigations led to the detention of  persons who remained at the disposal of the criminal judge. The Government stated that these arrests were carried out in the course of the judicial inquiry on the case and that no account had been taken of the eventual trade union affiliation of those concerned. The Government confirmed the death of one worker, indicating that he had been shot with a . calibre weapon not used by the public security forces. It also stated that judicial proceedings were underway into the death of this worker.\n.The Committee noted that in view of the largely contradictory nature of the complainants' allegations and the Government's replies, it could not at that stage come to any conclusions in full knowledge of the facts. Nevertheless, it expressed its concern over the seriousness of the events resulting from the intervention of the police, and deplored the death of a worker, confirmed by the Government. It noted that the inquiries carried out concern the origin of the fire in the factory and the circumstances of the death of the worker, and asked the Government to provide information on the results of these inquiries, the texts of the judgements handed down and the reasons adduced therefore. The Committee also requested the Government to transmit its observations about the  agricultural trade unionists who were allegedly detained.,\n.In its letters of  May , the Government indicates that of the  agricultural trade unionists named by the WCL,  had been arrested in connection with the investigation of various offences of attempted murder, robbery or theft, in , and were set free by the courts in April and May  because there was no sufficient reason to continue their detention. Two others, Messrs. Emilio Arguijo Mencias and Eleuterio Nolasco Varela, are still detained by order of the criminal court, charged with theft and damages punishable under the Penal Code; and one, Mr. Genaro Medina Varela, remains detained by order of the judge of Yoro, charged with arson. The judicial proceedings regarding these three persons are continuing in accordance with the penal procedures of the country. The Government indicates that it has no record of the other two persons mentioned by the WCL, Messrs. Asuncin Cruz Miranda and Venancio Ramirez, ever having been held in detention. Attached to one of the letters are statements from various judges confirming the situation of the detainees. The Government adds that agricultural workers in the country enjoy the same rights and guarantees as do other citizens and it stresses that social justice can only be built on a democratic base.\n.The Government, in its letters of  and  August , supplies information on the results of the inquiry into the death of one worker and the fire at the Bemis Handal plant. It states that on  March ,  men (whose names are given) were ordered to be held in preventive detention for these offences in accordance with the law. Two of them, Messrs. Antonio de Jests Hernndez Mendoza and Jorge Rodriguez Calderon, leaders of the Honduras General Central of Workers, appealed against this decision before the Appeal Court which, on  July , confirmed it. However, they requested and were granted medical examinations which resulted in their release on bail, on  July . The Government provides a photocopy of the judicial order setting them free, along with Luis Adolfo Portillo who was involved in the same affair.\n.The Government states that the judicial inquiry is continuing as regards the  accused, and that at this stage it cannot supply any information or judicial decisions.\n.Regarding the list of  trade unionists and  professors whose detention had been alleged by the WFTU, the Government states that  of them were amongst those detained on  March  for their involvement in the incidents at the Bemis Handal plant. Amongst them are Messrs. Antonio de Jests Hernndez Mendoza and Jorge Rodriguez Caldern who were set free on bail as indicated above.\n.In its letter of  August , the Government stresses that there is in Honduras a well-organised, strong and independent trade union movement, led for the most part by people who have acquired much experience in trade union matters. Nevertheless, it points out, some union leaders carry out activities which are punishable under criminal law, and the Government does not accept the notion that their status as trade union leaders excuses them from criminal responsibility. It states that this is the case in the proceedings arising from the events which took place at the Bemis Handal plant.\n.The Committee notes the information supplied by the Government.\n.Regarding the WCL's allegation that  agricultural trade unionists were detained in various prisons in the country, the Committee notes the Government's statement and supporting information to the effect that these persons were arrested for suspected criminal offences. It also notes that, in support of their allegation, the complainants have presented no information indicating that they had been detained for their trade union activities. In these circumstances, the Committee considers that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.\n.As regards the results of the inquiry into the death of one worker and the fire during the incidents at the Bemis Handal plant, the Committee takes note of the Government's statements that  workers were ordered to be held in preventive detention on  March  by the criminal court judge and that  of them were released on bail pending trial. The Committee hopes that the text of the judgements will be provided in due course, as previously requested.\n.The Committee also notes that the Government has not provided information on  of the  persons listed in the WFTU's complaint, namely, Messrs. Juan Emilio Oliva, treasurer of a trade union organisation, Alejandro Vallecillo, trade union delegate and member of a strike Committee, Professor Herminio Deras, Pedro Brizuela, trade union counsellor, and Professor Victor Baillon.\n.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the detention of  agricultural trade unionists:(i) to note that according to the information provided by the Government, these persons were accused of criminal offences and brought before the courts, which released  of them;(ii) also noting that the complainant did not supply particulars in support of its allegation, to decide that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination;(b) as regards the results of the inquiry into the death of one worker and the fire at the Bemis Handal plant, to note that the criminal proceedings are still underway and request the Government to provide the texts of the judgements and the reasons adduced therefore, when they are available;(c) to request the Government to transmit its observations about the alleged detention of five other trade unionists listed in paragraph  above;(d) to take note of this interim report."", "" July , presented further allegations (Case No. ).

Emilio Arguijo Mencias and Eleuterio Nolasco Varela, are still detained by order of the criminal court, charged with theft and damages punishable under the Penal Code; and one, Mr. Genaro Medina Varela, remains detained by order of the judge of Yoro, charged with arson. The judicial proceedings regarding these three persons are continuing in accordance with the penal procedures of the country. The Government indicates that it has no record of the other two persons mentioned by the WCL, Messrs. Asuncin Cruz Miranda and Venancio Ramirez, ever having been held in detention. Attached to one of the letters are statements from various judges confirming the situation of the detainees. The Government adds that agricultural workers in the country enjoy the same rights and guarantees as do other citizens and it stresses that social justice can only be built on a democratic base.\n.The Government, in its letters of  and  August , supplies information on the results of the inquiry into the death of one worker and the fire at the Bemis Handal plant. It states that on  March ,  men (whose names are given) were ordered to be held in preventive detention for these offences in accordance with the law. Two of them, Messrs. Antonio de Jests Hernndez Mendoza and Jorge Rodriguez Calderon, leaders of the Honduras General Central of Workers, appealed against this decision before the Appeal Court which, on  July , confirmed it. However, they requested and were granted medical examinations which resulted in their release on bail, on  July . The Government provides a photocopy of the judicial order setting them free, along with Luis Adolfo Portillo who was involved in the same affair.\n.The Government states that the judicial inquiry is continuing as regards the  accused, and that at this stage it cannot supply any information or judicial decisions.\n.Regarding the list of  trade unionists and  professors whose detention had been alleged by the WFTU, the Government states that  of them were amongst those detained on  March  for their involvement in the incidents at the Bemis Handal plant. Amongst them are Messrs. Antonio de Jests Hernndez Mendoza and Jorge Rodriguez Caldern who were set free on bail as indicated above.\n.In its letter of  August , the Government stresses that there is in Honduras a well-organised, strong and independent trade union movement, led for the most part by people who have acquired much experience in trade union matters. Nevertheless, it points out, some union leaders carry out activities which are punishable under criminal law, and the Government does not accept the notion that their status as trade union leaders excuses them from criminal responsibility. It states that this is the case in the proceedings arising from the events which took place at the Bemis Handal plant.\n.The Committee notes the information supplied by the Government.\n.Regarding the WCL's allegation that  agricultural trade unionists were detained in various prisons in the country, the Committee notes the Government's statement and supporting information to the effect that these persons were arrested for suspected criminal offences. It also notes that, in support of their allegation, the complainants have presented no information indicating that they had been detained for their trade union activities. In these circumstances, the Committee considers that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.\n.As regards the results of the inquiry into the death of one worker and the fire during the incidents at the Bemis Handal plant, the Committee takes note of the Government's statements that  workers were ordered to be held in preventive detention on  March  by the criminal court judge and that  of them were released on bail pending trial. The Committee hopes that the text of the judgements will be provided in due course, as previously requested.\n.The Committee also notes that the Government has not provided information on  of the  persons listed in the WFTU's complaint, namely, Messrs. Juan Emilio Oliva, treasurer of a trade union organisation, Alejandro Vallecillo, trade union delegate and member of a strike Committee, Professor Herminio Deras, Pedro Brizuela, trade union counsellor, and Professor Victor Baillon.\n.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the detention of  agricultural trade unionists:(i) to note that according to the information provided by the Government, these persons were accused of criminal offences and brought before the courts, which released  of them;(ii) also noting that the complainant did not supply particulars in support of its allegation, to decide that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination;(b) as regards the results of the inquiry into the death of one worker and the fire at the Bemis Handal plant, to note that the criminal proceedings are still underway and request the Government to provide the texts of the judgements and the reasons adduced therefore, when they are available;(c) to request the Government to transmit its observations about the alleged detention of five other trade unionists listed in paragraph  above;(d) to take note of this interim report.\n.By communications dated  and  March and  April  respectively, the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) presented allegations of violations of trade union rights in Honduras. The ICFTU supplied additional information in support of its complaint on  April . On its part, the WCL sent a new communication to the ILO on  April . The Government made its observations in communications dated  April and  and  May .\n.Honduras has ratified the Freedom""]"

The complaints are contained in the following communications: two from the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), dated  and  January , one from the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions (CLASC), dated  January , one from the International Federation of Secondary Teachers (FIPESO), dated  February , one from the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of the Workers of Latin America dated  March , one from the Trade Unions International of Workers of the Building, Wood and Building Materials Industry, dated  June  and one from the National Federation of Christian Peasants dated  September .\n.As these communications were received they were transmitted to the Government for its observations. These were presented in two communications dated  and  January .\n.Panama has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.In its communication dated  January  the WCL alleged that the following leaders of the Isthmian Federation of Christian Workers and the Peasant Federation were detained in prison: Jorge Emilio Chapote, Pedro Flix Montaez, Teodoro Martinez, Maximino Rodriguez, Domingo Castrelln, Pedro Snchez, Apolinario Snchez, Juan Senz, Rufino Snchez, Carlos Solis, Andrs Snchez, Victor Soto and Raimundo Snchez. In its communication dated  January  the WCL added that the Government was intercepting correspondence, censoring all communications and searching the trade union headquarters of the two organisations mentioned above. For its part, the CLASC confirmed the detention of some of the persons mentioned and added to the list the names of Jos Fiel Senz and Domingo Snchez. The CLASC stated that the Military Junta in power since October  had the headquarters of the Isthmian Federation of Christian Workers and the National Christian Peasant Federation searched and that applications for writs of habeas corpus made on behalf of the prisoners were rejected, some of the prisoners being given the alternative of being deported or remaining in prison.\n.The International Federation of Secondary Teachers alleged in its communication of  February  that Mr. Clarence Beecher, Secretary for International Affairs of the Panama Teachers' Association, had been imprisoned, together with other teachers, since  December . The FIPESO added that teachers' public meetings and the publication of their professional journal had been banned.\n.The Permanent Congress on Trade Union Unity of the Workers of Latin America stated in its communication dated  March  that since taking power the Military Junta had created a permanent state of repression directed against the trade union movement, behind the shield of the suspension of Constitutional guarantees. The complainants went on to say that the Federation of Workers' Unions of Panama had been the subject of a search by the National Guard, as well as other trade union premises, including those of the tailors', building workers' and bus drivers' unions, etc. On the occasion of these searches, members of the National Guard destroyed and seized trade union property and kept the trade union premises closed, thus obstructing all union activity. The complainants further alleged that the trade union leaders Angel Gmez, Jos del Carmen Tun, Florencio de Gracia, Sixto Valarezo, Ramn Diaz, Efigenio Arauz and Pedro Gonzlez, had already been in prison for more than three months.\n.The Trade Unions International of Workers of the Building, Wood and Building Materials Industries alleged in its communication of  June  that the Military Government had closed down the headquarters of the Trade Union Federation of the Workers of Panama and a number of affiliated organisations, including the premises of the Federation of Building Workers. The complainants added that several trade union leaders were being kept in prison and referred to the names of some of the persons mentioned in the preceding paragraph, in particular Mr. Angel Gmez, who was said to be critically ill with pneumonia and had been taken as a matter of urgency to a hospital but had since been taken back to prison.\n.Lastly, the National Federation of Christian Peasants of Panama stated in its complaint dated  September  that on  October  individual guarantees had been suspended by the Government with the result that rural and urban trade union leaders were being persecuted and imprisoned. The persons arrested were: Natividad Martinez, arrested on  September  in the district of Palmar in Cocl province, charged with possessing arms, after his house had been searched by the army; Bernab Reyes, Secretary General of the El Palmar Agrarian League, arrested on  September, the reason for his arrest not having been made known; Leonardo Montero, Secretary General of the Cao El Rey Agrarian League, accused by the judge and the mayor of the district of Donoso, Coln Province, as an act of reprisal. The complaining organisation added that pressure had been brought to bear on the peasants' organisations to give up any trade union activity not controlled by the Government and that every day more trade union leaders were being arrested.\n.In its communications dated  and  January  the Government stated that after careful examination of the various complaints presented, it had reached the conclusion that the allegations were unfounded and that the trade union organisations of the country had without interruption been functioning in accordance with the provisions of the law in force. The labour authorities had always been motivated by concern that the trade union movement should be vigorous and managed by the workers themselves. For its part, the Government had on no occasion arrested any citizen on account of his being a trade union leader, but only for participation in political activities entirely unrelated to trade union matters. The persons arrested on various occasions after  October  had been set at liberty, and the complaint relating to the present detention of trade union leaders was therefore inadmissible. The allegations relating to the persecution and imprisonment of leaders and pressure that had been exercised against the peasant organisations were also rejected, since the Government had placed at the disposal of the inhabitants of the interior of the country adequate facilities for them to organise and carry on proper trade union activities.\n.The Committee observes that the various complaints allege the detention of trade union leaders since the Military Government came into power and suspended Constitutional guarantees in October . Some of the allegations also refer to searches of the premises of various trade union organisations, in particular the Isthmian Federation of Christian Workers, the National Christian Peasants' Federation, the National Trade Union Federation of the Workers of Panama and the Building Workers' Federation, and in certain cases the closing of the premises affected. The complaints also refer to the persecution of trade union leaders and pressure exercised against the peasants' organisations.

It has also examined more recent complaints concerning events occurring from November  onwards. These latter allegations related mainly to the legislation on trade unions adopted at that time and to the trade union situation in the mining industry. At its May-June  session, the Governing Body, on the Committee\'s recommendation, requested the Government to communicate detailed information on the measures which it was urgent to take concerning the mineworkers still under arrest or in exile, the adoption and the application of new trade union legislation, and the miners\' radio stations. The Governing Body also decided, pending receipt of this information, and taking into account the fact that two missions of direct contacts had already been carried out in Bolivia, to suspend its decision on the desirability of setting up a commission of inquiry in connection with the complaint submitted under article  of the ILO Constitution.\n.More specifically, the allegations relating to the legislation adopted in  were concerned mainly with Legislative Decree No.  (establishing the Basic Statutes of Government), Presidential Decree No.  (concerning labour co-ordinators and the freezing of trade union funds), and Legislative Decree No.  (establishing the compulsory civil service), promulgated in November . Legislative Decree No.  provided, inter alia, that ""pending the reorganisation of the executive Committees of employers\' associations, trade unions, professional associations, craft unions, students\' unions and university staff unions, in accordance with rules to be laid down in due course by the National Government, it is hereby ordered that the term of office of the officials of the aforementioned organisations and their respective federations and Confederations shall be at an end, and that strikes, stoppages, lockouts and all other forms of suspension and paralysis of work and production shall be prohibited"". The Government had replaced the trade union executives by labour co-ordinators which it appointed itself (pending the enactment of a labour code) in each centre of production and in each occupational sector. The main function of the labour co-ordinators was to represent the workers in submitting individual and collective claims. Acceptance of this office was compulsory, any person refusing to accept being liable to sanctions under the provisions of Legislative Decree No. , establishing the compulsory civil service. Wages were frozen in January , but in practice the Government tolerated collective bargaining on wages, provided that it took place without publicity. In addition, trade union meetings and finances were subjected to various restrictions.\n.The complaint filed under article  of the ILO Constitution referred to observations made by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations with respect to the application of Convention No. . Mention was made in particular of the comments of  concerning the provisions in the General Labour Act dealing with trade unions.\n.A special national Committee drafted a new labour code and rules of procedure, designed to replace in particular the General Labour Act. At the request of the Government, the Office sent its comments on this text, especially the provisions dealing with trade union rights. In April , the Government stated that the National Drafting Committee had endeavoured to bring the guiding principles of its draft into line with the ILO\'s opinion in order to make the two documents concord as closely as possible. The Government had also sought the views of certain employers\' and workers\' representatives, but considered that a more thorough analysis would need to be made by all the employers\' and workers\' sectors involved. It therefore had plans for consultations to take place before the new legislation was adopted. Nevertheless, not wishing to create a vacuum during this interim period, the Government had taken a series of measures. In particular, it cited the measures taken to facilitate the election of workers\' local Committees and the holding of national assemblies in the various sectors of activity to enable them to analyse their specific problems and appoint co-ordinators. This had been done mainly in the following sectors: mines, railways, telecommunications, electric light and power, telephones and airports. In addition, continued the Government, the new Act respecting labour procedure should enable the recognition of workers\' rights to be speeded up and facilitate their action before labour jurisdictions.\n.In May  the Committee noted in particular that the Labour Code, and especially its provisions as regards trade unions, had still not been adopted. In consequence the Governing Body, on the Committee\'s recommendation, urged the Government to do everything possible to expedite the adoption and application of the new trade union legislation.\n.As concerns the trade union situation in the mining industry, the Committee has examined in particular allegations concerning events which took place throughout this industry in June and July . According to the complainants, wage claims presented again following the XVIth National Mineworkers\' Congress (May ), and a strike that was planned if these demands were not satisfied, had provided the Government with an opportunity to represent the action not as an economic claim by the workers, but as a political manoeuvre. Consequently, before the strike had been declared in support of the workers\' demands, the armed forces had occupied most of the mining sectors and a series of repressive measures - including the closing down of the FSTMB and of local trade unions in mining areas, the occupation of the miners\' radio stations and the arrest, banishment and dismissal of trade union officials and workers - had been taken against the workers and their leaders. The Government argued that it was really a question of political and even subversive activities by leaders in the mines and other sectors, which had been made to look like action in support of economic claims. The wage demands - which, as was known by the miners\' leaders, were totally unacceptable to the Government - had to be met within a fixed period, according to a decision taken at the Congress in question. The Congress had also adopted resolutions and declarations of a political character in which the Government had been strongly attacked. According to the Government, all these facts, together with others, were proof of the existence of a plan whose ultimate aim was to bring about its overthrow.\n.In November  the Committee felt that it did not possess sufficient information to take a decision on the basic questions involved in full knowledge of the facts, but nevertheless noted the exceptional circumstances of a political nature which had arisen in Bolivia and which had accompanied demands for wage increases which were long overdue. The Committee reached various conclusions and, on its recommendation, the Governing Body urged the Government, inter alia, to re-establish normal trade union conditions in the mining sector as soon as possible, to re-examine the question of closing of the miners\' broadcasting stations, and to reconsider, in particular, the situation of the workers and leaders in this sector who were still imprisoned or exiled.\n.In February  the Government stated that pending the adoption of the new labour legislation, the miners had democratically elected genuinely representative bodies which, under the name of local Committees, performed all trade union functions and had deserved full recognition by the Government. The Comibol mining enterprise had already implemented one-third of the obligations undertaken in the collective agreement negotiated with the local Committees, and it was hoped that the agreement could be fully implemented within the agreed time limit. The Government mentioned that it had adopted a Presidential Decree, No.  of  December , whereby a high-level mining advisory council was set up to prepare and co-ordinate labour and social policy on behalf of the miners.\n.The case of the mine radio transmitters, added the Government, had been brought before the competent judicial authorities, who were to take the final decision as to whether or not mines might retain their broadcasting licences in the light of their abuses of freedom of expression and other offences under the General Telecommunications and Broadcasting Act. Nevertheless, stated the Government, in order to create a favourable climate, it had returned the radio transmitters to the administrative Committees formed by the local Committees and works delegates after replacing the parts which had been carried off by the trade union leaders who had fled, and all these transmitters were operating. Radio Llallagua, which according to the Government was a special case, had been returned to the municipality, its rightful owner. In April , the Government added that the intervention of the authorities was due to the fact that these radio stations did not have the necessary authorisation to operate under the general regulations governing radio-electrical services, but that the stations in question were now fulfilling all the necessary requirements for the purpose of legalising their situation, which would enable them to resume normal operations. At its May-June  session,', '.The Committee has already examined allegations relating to the years immediately following the change of regime on  August  (closing down of the COB, the La Paz Departmental Central of Workers and the FSTMB; takeover of the National Urban Schoolteachers\' Federation; arrest and banishment of trade unionists). It has also examined more recent complaints concerning events occurring from November  onwards. These latter allegations related mainly to the legislation on trade unions adopted at that time and to the trade union situation in the mining industry. At its May-June  session, the Governing Body, on the Committee\'s recommendation, requested the Government to communicate detailed information on the measures which it was urgent to take concerning the mineworkers still under arrest or in exile, the adoption and the application of new trade union legislation, and the miners\' radio stations. The Governing Body also decided, pending receipt of this information, and taking into account the fact that two missions of direct contacts had already been carried out in Bolivia, to suspend its decision on the desirability of setting up a commission of inquiry in connection with the complaint submitted under article  of the ILO Constitution.\n.More specifically, the allegations relating to the legislation adopted in  were concerned mainly with Legislative Decree No.  (establishing the Basic Statutes of Government), Presidential Decree No.  (concerning labour co-ordinators and the freezing of trade union funds), and Legislative Decree No.  (establishing the compulsory civil service), promulgated in November . Legislative Decree No.  provided, inter alia, that ""pending the reorganisation of the executive Committees of employers\' associations, trade unions, professional associations, craft unions, students\' unions and university staff unions, in accordance with rules to be laid down in due course by the National Government, it is hereby ordered that the term of office of the officials of the aforementioned organisations and their respective federations and Confederations shall be at an end, and that strikes, stoppages, lockouts and all other forms of suspension and paralysis of work and production shall be prohibited"". The Government had replaced the trade union executives by labour co-ordinators which it appointed itself (pending the enactment of a labour code) in each centre of production and in each occupational sector. The main function of the labour co-ordinators was to represent the workers in submitting individual and collective claims. Acceptance of this office was compulsory, any person refusing to accept being liable to sanctions under the provisions of Legislative Decree No. , establishing the compulsory civil service. Wages were frozen in January , but in practice the Government tolerated collective bargaining on wages, provided that it took place without publicity. In addition, trade union meetings and finances were subjected to various restrictions.\n.The complaint filed under article  of the ILO Constitution referred to observations made by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations with respect to the application of Convention No. . Mention was made in particular of the comments of  concerning the provisions in the General Labour Act dealing with trade unions.\n.A special national Committee drafted a new labour code and rules of procedure, designed to replace in particular the General Labour Act. At the request of the Government, the Office sent its comments on this text, especially the provisions dealing with trade union rights. In April , the Government stated that the National Drafting Committee had endeavoured to bring the guiding principles of its draft into line with the ILO\'s opinion in order to make the two documents concord as closely as possible. The Government had also sought the views of certain employers\' and workers\' representatives, but considered that a more thorough analysis would need to be made by all the employers\' and workers\' sectors involved. It therefore had plans for consultations to take place before the new legislation was adopted. Nevertheless, not wishing to create a vacuum during this interim period, the Government had taken a series of measures. In particular, it cited the measures taken to facilitate the election of workers\' local Committees and the holding of national assemblies in the various sectors of activity to enable them to analyse their specific problems and appoint co-ordinators. This had been done mainly in the following sectors: mines, railways, telecommunications, electric light and power, telephones and airports. In addition, continued the Government, the new Act respecting labour procedure should enable the recognition of workers\' rights to be speeded up and facilitate their action before labour jurisdictions.\n.In May  the Committee noted in particular that the Labour Code, and especially its provisions as regards trade unions, had still not been adopted. In consequence the Governing Body, on the Committee\'s recommendation, urged the Government to do everything possible to expedite the adoption and application of the new trade union legislation.\n.As concerns the trade union situation in the mining industry, the Committee has examined in particular allegations concerning events which took place throughout this industry in June and July . According to the complainants, wage claims presented again following the XVIth National Mineworkers\' Congress (May ), and a strike that was planned if these demands were not satisfied, had provided the Government with an opportunity to represent the action not as an economic claim by the workers, but as a political manoeuvre. Consequently, before the strike had been declared in support of the workers\' demands, the armed forces had occupied most of the mining sectors and a series of repressive measures - including the closing down of the FSTMB and of local trade unions in mining areas, the occupation of the miners\' radio stations and the arrest, banishment and dismissal of trade union officials and workers - had been taken against the workers and their leaders. The Government argued that it was really a question of political and even subversive activities by leaders in the mines and other sectors, which had been made to look like action in support of economic claims. The wage demands - which, as was known by the miners\' leaders, were totally unacceptable to the Government - had to be met within a fixed period, according to a decision taken at the Congress in question.

The Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) presented the complaint corresponding to Case No.  in a communication dated  April .\n.Having received certain observations from the Government, the Committee examined Cases Nos.  and  at its meeting in November , and submitted interim reports to the Governing Body (see th Report of the Committee, paras.  to  and  to , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November )).\n.The Government representative at the st Session of the International Labour Conference (June ) subsequently handed in a number of documents containing certain information relating to Cases Nos. ,  and .\n.At the st Session (Geneva, ) of the International Labour Conference, the Government representative of Paraguay informed the Committee on the Application of Standards that his Government had requested a direct contacts mission to deal specifically with the application of Conventions Nos.  and  (both ratified by Paraguay).\n.Following the discussion of the case of Paraguay in the Committee on the Application of Standards, the Government presented a communication dated  June  to the Office, expressly requesting that the forthcoming direct contacts mission would also examine the cases pending before the Committee on Freedom of Association.\n.The Director-General of the ILO appointed Mr. von Potobsky, a former official of the ILO, as his representative to carry out this mission, which took place from  to  September  in Asuncin, and which also included a visit to Buenos Aires on  September for the purpose of contacting and discussing with the Paraguayan Confederation of Workers in Exile (CPTE). The representative of the Director-General was accompanied on the mission by Mr. Alberto Odero, a member of the Freedom of Association Branch of the Department of International Labour Standards, and Mr. Luis Zamudio, Regional Adviser on Standards. The report on the mission is attached.\n.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.Following the mission, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the International Federation of Plantation, Agricultural and Allied Workers (IFPAAW), in communications dated respectively  and  October , presented new allegations in connection with Case No. . These organisations alleged in their communications that Marcelino Corazn Medina, chairman of the Co-ordination Committee of Agricultural Producers, has been detained for over ten days, having been arbitrarily imprisoned in the police station in Asuncin, where he is being subjected to physical and psychological torture and deprived of visiting rights. He is now on a hunger strike and, since he is in a fragile state of health, it is feared that his life is in danger. In a communication dated  October , the ICFTU states that Mr. Corazn Medina has been transferred, in a serious condition, to the prison hospital. In addition, it alleges that for about  days the Government has arbitrarily imprisoned Sebastin Rodrguez (Secretary General of the Drivers\' Trade Union of ""Asuncin-Fernando de la Mora"" Line ) for the sole reason of having organised a musical festival to raise funds for his unemployed colleagues. The Government sent certain information in a communication dated  October  in which it states, in particular, that Mr. Marcelino Corazn Medina has been released.\n.The Committee would first like to thank Mr. Geraldo von Potobsky for having accepted to carry out the direct-contacts mission, and for his detailed report on the cases under consideration, which has enabled the Committee to examine them. The Committee considers that the report of the representative of the Director-General demonstrates the usefulness of missions of this kind in clarifying the issues raised in the allegations of the complainant organisations.\n.Since the contents of the allegations and the information supplied by the Government, as well as the information obtained by the representative of the Director-General during the mission, are covered in the report on the mission, the Committee may proceed directly with its conclusions on each case.\n.The Committee takes note of the report of the representative of the Director-General on the mission carried out from  to  September  in Paraguay. The Committee also notes that, as the report on the mission states, the representative of the Director-General was provided with every facility by the authorities of the Ministry of Justice and Labour to enable him to carry out the mission. The Committee observes in this respect that information was obtained during the mission on all of the cases under consideration. It regrets, however, that it was not possible to arrange an interview between the representative of the Director-General and the Minister of the Interior or a high official of that ministry, in connection with certain specific allegations falling within its sphere of competence which were made in the context of Cases Nos.  and .\n.Regarding the allegations as to detentions, the Committee observes that all of the persons concerned (nine) have been released. The Committee regrets that the Government has failed to state the specific reasons for the detention of these persons, except in the case of Mr. Aldo Zuccolillo (detained for systematically and crudely harassing the Government in the publication ""ABC Color"") and of Mr. Jorge Alvarenga (a doctor detained for acts unrelated to trade unionism, according to the information supplied by the Government). The Committee also observes that the Government denies in every case, either explicitly or implicitly, that the detentions were connected with trade union activities. In these circumstances, in view of the lack of information in most cases on the specific reasons for the detentions, and given the time which has elapsed since the allegations were presented (May and October ), and the fact that all of the persons concerned have been released, the Committee draws attention in general terms to the principle that the arrest or detention of trade union leaders and trade unionists for activities connected with the exercise of trade union rights is contrary to the principles of freedom of association (see, for example, th Report, Case No.  (Nicaragua), para. ).\n.As regards the difficulties encountered by the Union of Journalists of Paraguay (SPP) for several years in its attempts to obtain legal personality, the Committee observes that in  the Labour Directorate notified the trade union that it could not be set up because of defects of substance such as the existence of another association for the same purposes. The Committee also notes that there seems to have been a shift in the Government\'s position since then, since while it states that the SPP has not taken any steps since  for its establishment, it affirms expressly that, from the legal standpoint, there is no reason why it should not be set up. While the Committee regrets that the present secretary-general of the SPP did not attend the appointment arranged with the representative of the Director-General, it hopes that the Union of Journalists of Paraguay will apply for and be granted legal personality in the near future. In addition, the Committee recalls that the existence of an organisation in a determined occupation should not constitute an obstacle to the establishment of another organisation, if the workers so wish.\n.As regards the allegation of dismissal of workers from the ""Amrica Textil"" undertaking, the Committee observes that there is a discrepancy between the contents of the allegations and the Government\'s statements. While both agree that dismissals occurred in this undertaking, the complainant organisation alleged that they had taken place after the presentation of requests in the trade unions\' list of claims. The Government, however, stated that the dismissals (affecting  workers) had taken place a month before the trade union had applied to the authorities for recognition. The Committee regrets that the Amrica Textil undertaking has refused to meet with the representative of the Director-General of the ILO and that it has not been possible to obtain information which would clarify the facts. In these circumstances, in view of the lack of sufficient information and given the proximity in time between the dismissals and the steps taken to set up a trade union in the undertaking concerned (a trade union which was not recognised because it failed to attain the number of members required by legislation, owing to the dismissals which took place), the Committee merely draws attention to the principle that no worker should be dismissed or subjected to other acts of discrimination in employment for carrying out trade union activities.\n.Finally, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, there is no undertaking called ""FRISA S.A."" and that Radio anduti was closed down not for the reasons given by the complainant organisation, but for political reasons.\n.The Committee notes that, according to the mission report, the Labour Appeals', '.The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions presented the complaints corresponding to Cases Nos.

The Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) presented the complaint corresponding to Case No.  in a communication dated  April .\n.Having received certain observations from the Government, the Committee examined Cases Nos.  and  at its meeting in November , and submitted interim reports to the Governing Body (see th Report of the Committee, paras.  to  and  to , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November )).\n.The Government representative at the st Session of the International Labour Conference (June ) subsequently handed in a number of documents containing certain information relating to Cases Nos. ,  and .\n.At the st Session (Geneva, ) of the International Labour Conference, the Government representative of Paraguay informed the Committee on the Application of Standards that his Government had requested a direct contacts mission to deal specifically with the application of Conventions Nos.  and  (both ratified by Paraguay).\n.Following the discussion of the case of Paraguay in the Committee on the Application of Standards, the Government presented a communication dated  June  to the Office, expressly requesting that the forthcoming direct contacts mission would also examine the cases pending before the Committee on Freedom of Association.\n.The Director-General of the ILO appointed Mr. von Potobsky, a former official of the ILO, as his representative to carry out this mission, which took place from  to  September  in Asuncin, and which also included a visit to Buenos Aires on  September for the purpose of contacting and discussing with the Paraguayan Confederation of Workers in Exile (CPTE). The representative of the Director-General was accompanied on the mission by Mr. Alberto Odero, a member of the Freedom of Association Branch of the Department of International Labour Standards, and Mr. Luis Zamudio, Regional Adviser on Standards. The report on the mission is attached.\n.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.Following the mission, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the International Federation of Plantation, Agricultural and Allied Workers (IFPAAW), in communications dated respectively  and  October , presented new allegations in connection with Case No. . These organisations alleged in their communications that Marcelino Corazn Medina, chairman of the Co-ordination Committee of Agricultural Producers, has been detained for over ten days, having been arbitrarily imprisoned in the police station in Asuncin, where he is being subjected to physical and psychological torture and deprived of visiting rights. He is now on a hunger strike and, since he is in a fragile state of health, it is feared that his life is in danger. In a communication dated  October , the ICFTU states that Mr. Corazn Medina has been transferred, in a serious condition, to the prison hospital. In addition, it alleges that for about  days the Government has arbitrarily imprisoned Sebastin Rodrguez (Secretary General of the Drivers\' Trade Union of ""Asuncin-Fernando de la Mora"" Line ) for the sole reason of having organised a musical festival to raise funds for his unemployed colleagues. The Government sent certain information in a communication dated  October  in which it states, in particular, that Mr. Marcelino Corazn Medina has been released.\n.The Committee would first like to thank Mr. Geraldo von Potobsky for having accepted to carry out the direct-contacts mission, and for his detailed report on the cases under consideration, which has enabled the Committee to examine them. The Committee considers that the report of the representative of the Director-General demonstrates the usefulness of missions of this kind in clarifying the issues raised in the allegations of the complainant organisations.\n.Since the contents of the allegations and the information supplied by the Government, as well as the information obtained by the representative of the Director-General during the mission, are covered in the report on the mission, the Committee may proceed directly with its conclusions on each case.\n.The Committee takes note of the report of the representative of the Director-General on the mission carried out from  to  September  in Paraguay. The Committee also notes that, as the report on the mission states, the representative of the Director-General was provided with every facility by the authorities of the Ministry of Justice and Labour to enable him to carry out the mission. The Committee observes in this respect that information was obtained during the mission on all of the cases under consideration. It regrets, however, that it was not possible to arrange an interview between the representative of the Director-General and the Minister of the Interior or a high official of that ministry, in connection with certain specific allegations falling within its sphere of competence which were made in the context of Cases Nos.  and .\n.Regarding the allegations as to detentions, the Committee observes that all of the persons concerned (nine) have been released. The Committee regrets that the Government has failed to state the specific reasons for the detention of these persons, except in the case of Mr. Aldo Zuccolillo (detained for systematically and crudely harassing the Government in the publication ""ABC Color"") and of Mr. Jorge Alvarenga (a doctor detained for acts unrelated to trade unionism, according to the information supplied by the Government). The Committee also observes that the Government denies in every case, either explicitly or implicitly, that the detentions were connected with trade union activities. In these circumstances, in view of the lack of information in most cases on the specific reasons for the detentions, and given the time which has elapsed since the allegations were presented (May and October ), and the fact that all of the persons concerned have been released, the Committee draws attention in general terms to the principle that the arrest or detention of trade union leaders and trade unionists for activities connected with the exercise of trade union rights is contrary to the principles of freedom of association (see, for example, th Report, Case No.  (Nicaragua), para. ).\n.As regards the difficulties encountered by the Union of Journalists of Paraguay (SPP) for several years in its attempts to obtain legal personality, the Committee observes that in  the Labour Directorate notified the trade union that it could not be set up because of defects of substance such as the existence of another association for the same purposes. The Committee also notes that there seems to have been a shift in the Government\'s position since then, since while it states that the SPP has not taken any steps since  for its establishment, it affirms expressly that, from the legal standpoint, there is no reason why it should not be set up. While the Committee regrets that the present secretary-general of the SPP did not attend the appointment arranged with the representative of the Director-General, it hopes that the Union of Journalists of Paraguay will apply for and be granted legal personality in the near future. In addition, the Committee recalls that the existence of an organisation in a determined occupation should not constitute an obstacle to the establishment of another organisation, if the workers so wish.\n.As regards the allegation of dismissal of workers from the ""Amrica Textil"" undertaking, the Committee observes that there is a discrepancy between the contents of the allegations and the Government\'s statements. While both agree that dismissals occurred in this undertaking, the complainant organisation alleged that they had taken place after the presentation of requests in the trade unions\' list of claims. The Government, however, stated that the dismissals (affecting  workers) had taken place a month before the trade union had applied to the authorities for recognition. The Committee regrets that the Amrica Textil undertaking has refused to meet with the representative of the Director-General of the ILO and that it has not been possible to obtain information which would clarify the facts. In these circumstances, in view of the lack of sufficient information and given the proximity in time between the dismissals and the steps taken to set up a trade union in the undertaking concerned (a trade union which was not recognised because it failed to attain the number of members required by legislation, owing to the dismissals which took place), the Committee merely draws attention to the principle that no worker should be dismissed or subjected to other acts of discrimination in employment for carrying out trade union activities.\n.Finally, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, there is no undertaking called ""FRISA S.A."" and that Radio anduti was closed down not for the reasons given by the complainant organisation, but for political reasons.\n.The Committee notes that, according to the mission report, the Labour Appeals']"

The virtual participation of ASIC leaders was planned. However, the internet connections were individually and selectively cut off to prevent their participation (communications dated  and  September ).\n.As regards recommendation (a) of the Committee s last report (recognition and free operation of ASIC), the Government once again states, in its communication dated  October , that: (i) the members of the organization that calls itself ASIC are neither workers nor employers; they do not belong to any labour collective and therefore have not been elected or appointed by the members as trade union representatives; they do not have the objective of promoting or defending workers' interests, nor do they have the genuine support of the membership or any labour collective; and (ii) its supposed members answer to a foreign government, which provides them with funds in the political aim of subverting the internal order legitimately established by the Cuban people. The complainants operate under the agendas of the International Group for Corporate Social Responsibility in Cuba and the American organization National Endowment for Democracy to engage in internal subversion that constitutes an affront to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law, particularly the principles of sovereignty, self-determination and non-interference in internal affairs.\n.Regarding recommendation (b) (investigations into the allegations of acts of aggression and restrictions on public freedoms with respect to certain union activists and officials), the Government indicates in its communication dated  October  that: (i) as undertaken each time a communication is received from the ILO or another United Nations mechanism, an investigative action plan was devised and implemented immediately, coordinated by different entities and using the necessary measures and established procedures, in order to verify each of the allegations against the individuals mentioned in the recommendation; and (ii) action taken included: searches in Ministry of the Interior automated records used for monitoring detained persons and other persons prosecuted in connection with alleged criminal acts; use of data intelligence procedures to establish the identity of persons; consultation of databases of bodies such as the Ministry of Justice; locating persons in places of residence; and interviews. The investigations involved heads and specialists from different bodies of the Ministry of the Interior, the General Prosecutor's Office, the People s Supreme Court and the Ministry of Labour and Social Security. The Government reiterates that: (i) none of the persons arrested were genuine trade unionists, let alone trade union leaders; (ii) none of them were tried or sentenced for any act or activity relating to the defence of workers' interests and, less still, with the exercise of trade union freedoms; (iii) the criminal proceedings brought against these individuals were in response to activities constituting offences provided for and sanctioned under the Cuban Criminal Code in force at the time; and (iv) the Cuban legal system, in particular the Constitution, protects and respects the guarantees of due process. Trials are public, oral and adversarial and in accordance with criminal procedural law, and final rulings are communicated to the public prosecutor and the accused person or his or her counsel, who are also provided with a copy. Each of the complainants could provide the Committee with these rulings, if they really have an interest in having them reviewed by the Committee.\n.While considering that sufficient information has been provided to refute the reported allegations of attacks, harassment, disrespect for freedoms and restrictions against these persons, the Government indicates that: (i) some of the citizens mentioned in recommendation (b) no longer reside in the national territory. One of their main objectives in engaging in activities against the Cuban constitutional order has been precisely to obtain the corresponding  endorsement' in order to be able to emigrate and more easily obtain immigration status to reside in the United States of America in particular; and (ii) investigations have shown on several occasions that some of these persons have never been subjected to police or any other type of action. They simply fabricate unsubstantiated allegations that the Government is then required to respond to and prove to be false, when they did not even occur. In its communication dated  October , the Government reports on each of the individuals mentioned in recommendation (b):() Mr lvn Hernndez Carrillo: The Committee has been informed on several occasions that this person has no employment relationship and that he has engaged in making false accusations to the ILO supervisory bodies in order to denigrate the country s record on labour and trade union rights. It has been reported on numerous occasions that this citizen has been granted parole and is currently serving the remainder of his sentence in freedom, which ends in the first half of . This means that, under existing criminal legislation in the country, he must comply with certain obligations imposed by law.() Mr Osvaldo Arcis Hernndez: The investigation reiterated that he had been declared  unfit to work' by the Expert Occupational Medical Examination Commission owing to his schizophrenia. His social and moral behaviour is despised by society and he lacks any support in his community.() Mr Brbaro Tejeda Snchez: He displays appalling social behaviour and has been prosecuted on  occasions for the offences of theft, leaving the national territory illegally, public disorder, making threats, speculation, hoarding and handling stolen goods. He left Cuba for Nicaragua in  and has not returned.() Mr Pedro Scull: He has had no employment relationship and no links to ASIC since . It has been reported that this person died in .() Mr Felipe Carrera Hernndez: His activities have been aimed at seeking financial gain, with no credibility in his area of operation. No police action has been taken against him. Since , he has made five trips abroad, three to Panama and two to Colombia.() Ms Ariadna Mena: She has no relationship with ASIC, from which she was separated due to conflicts with Mr Ivn Hernandez Carrillo, who expelled her from the organization. Since , she has made eight trips abroad, including three to Colombia, two to Panama, two to Peru and one to France. On  June , she left the country for Guyana, to make the journey to settle permanently in the United States. No police action was ever taken against her.() Ms Hilda Ayln Lpez Salazar: She has been living abroad since  April . Between  and  she made four trips abroad, three to Panama and one to the United States.() Mr Pavel Herrera Hernndez: He has been living abroad since  June  and was previously the subject of a criminal prosecution for the offence of theft.() Mr Emilio Gottardi Gottardi: Several allegations have been received by the Committee about this citizen, which have been answered after the corresponding investigations.() Mr Ral Domingo Zerguera Borren: He has not been subjected to measures of any kind, nor has any regulation been imposed on his movements outside the territory. He has complete freedom of movement, precisely because he works as a taxi driver. He is not linked to ASIC at the moment, as he is focused on his arrangements for leaving the country, as he was accepted in the  visa lottery' of the United States embassy.() Mr Reinaldo Cosano Aln: He is unemployed due to his advanced age. No police action has been taken against him. From  to date he has made three trips to Panama and two to Colombia.() Mr Lzaro Ricardo Prez: Since , he has made ten trips to Colombia and Mexico, three to Panama and five to the United States. Since  he has lived in the United States with his family.() Mr Hiosvani Pupo: He currently resides outside Cuba. During his stay in the country, he worked as a bicycle taxi driver in the municipalities of Centro Habana and Habana Vieja, illegally and without applying for the required licence.() Mr Daniel Perea Garca: On  August  he was charged with the offence of receiving and selling electrical transformer oil. He currently has no links with ASIC. He has not been subjected to threats or harassment.() Mr Yisan Zamora Ricardo: He was arrested on  July , charged with the offence of public disorder for holding demonstrations obstructing the public highway. After  hours, he was released, with no other charges against him.() Mr Willian Cruz Delgado: He has an extensive criminal record, which has been previously reported to the Committee. Between  and  he was sanctioned for the offences of assault, making threats, contempt of court and public disorder. On  August , he was fined for contravening the provisions of Decree Law No. / and failing to carry with him his personal identification papers. Between  and , he was reported on four occasions for less serious injury, contempt and public disorder; he was also taken on nine occasions to a National Revolutionary Police station for engaging in the illicit sale of goods and foreign currency. It was ascertained that this person has never been prosecuted for"", ""dialogue and cooperation for the effective promotion of workers' rights, undermine tripartism and do not help improve the situation of workers in the world. Furthermore, it considers that these negative practices are inconsistent with the principles of objectivity, impartiality and non-selectiveness that should prevail in the handling of trade union freedoms. The Government therefore anticipates that it will be possible, on the basis of the elements submitted in its observations, to dismiss all of the allegations relating to the present case as baseless.\n.With regard to recommendation (a), the Government states once again that ASIC is not a trade union organization, given that: (i) it does not have the objective of promoting or defending workers' interests; (ii) it does not have the genuine support of any labour collective and is not a grouping of Cuban workers; (iii) the supposed leaders or activists referred to in the complaint do not represent labour collectives and are not workers themselves, as they do not have fixed employment relationships with entities or employers in Cuba, thus they do not come within the purview of the ILO, and the labour laws are therefore not applicable to them; (iv) the Government of the United States, through the International Group for Corporate Social Responsibility and the American organization National Endowment for Democracy, funds ASIC leaders, who, in exchange for a sum of money, have to pose as independent trade union activists, dissidents or critics of the Government and report false violations of workers' rights; (v) the  Labour Code (Act No.  of ) includes as its fundamental principles the right of workers to organize voluntarily and establish trade unions; (vi) the trade union organizations that make up the Confederation of Workers of Cuba (CTC) are autonomous and their members approve their own statutes and regulations, discuss and reach agreements democratically, and elect or dismiss their executives; (vii) national unions have ,, members and . per cent of Cuban workers are unionized; and (viii) Cuban workers are the beneficiaries of participatory and democratic social dialogue at all decision-making levels.\n.With regard to recommendation (b), the Government indicates that the persons mentioned in the complaint have engaged in antisocial and criminal behaviour. It denies that any arbitrary or temporary detentions or arrests are carried out because these are effected in conformity with the criminal procedure in force and are strictly in line with the guarantees of due process that are recognized in the domestic legal system. It further indicates that institutions and security forces perform their duties in strict accordance with the law and it is not their practice to repress, intimidate, harass, torture or mistreat citizens. It recalls that the internal system provides procedures and resources to punish any authority or official overstepping its powers.\n.Concerning the individual cases mentioned by the complainant, the Government states that:(a)\tit is untrue that Mr Ivn Hernndez Carrillo is a political prisoner: (i) the chamber for crimes against state security of the People s Provincial Court of Havana found him guilty in  of the offence of acts against the independence and territorial integrity of the State, provided for in the Act on the Protection of National Independence and the Economy of Cuba (Act No.  of ), and sentenced him to  years' imprisonment; (ii) on  March , he was granted parole (his conviction will expire in the first half of ); (iii) he cannot travel outside the country under article (b) of the Migration Act (Act No.  of , as amended by Decree Law No.  of ); and (iv) in July , September  and March , three charges were brought against him for disobedience, incitement to commit a crime and contempt, which are offences provided for in the Criminal Code (Act No.  of ), which the Cuban authorities decided to handle as minor offences (with the imposition of administrative measures, including fines and specific obligations and prohibitions);(b)\tMr Carlos Reyes Consuegras, who also has no employment relationship, was prosecuted for illegal gambling and administrative proceedings were also filed against him for the illegal rental of a home and a fine imposed for the illegal possession of psychotropic substances. In addition, he was twice prosecuted for illicit economic activities. With regard to action taken against him by the immigration authorities, this was because of his past record of antisocial and criminal behaviour. He has never been arrested, but simply interviewed, fully respecting the guarantees provided by law;(c)\tMr Jorge Anglada Mayeta was not beaten up by a police officer while trying to defend a self-employed worker. Mr Anglada pounced on and assaulted a police officer carrying out his duties without prior warning or legitimate cause, which constitutes an offence in criminal legislation throughout the world. On  February , the Municipal People s Court of La Habana Vieja, having respected all guarantees of due process, found him guilty of assault and sentenced him to two years' imprisonment with a restriction of liberty order for an equal period of time;(d)\tMr Vctor Manuel Domnguez Garca, Mr Wilfredo lvarez Garca, Mr Brbaro de la Nuez Ramrez, Mr Alexis Gmez Rodrguez, Mr Roberto Arsenio Lpez Ramos and Mr Charles Enchris Rodrguez Ledezma were prosecuted following allegations relating to acts classified as offences under Cuban legislation (illicit economic activities, illegal gambling, possession of psychotropic substances, speculation and hoarding, possession, production and sale of instruments for the purpose of committing crimes, usurpation of public office, handling stolen goods, contempt, causing serious injury, damage, forgery of documents and public disorder). Given that domestic legislation allows for conduct of low risk to society to be subject to administrative proceedings, the authorities handled the above as minor offences;(e)\tcriminal proceedings were not instituted against Mr Eduardo Enrique Hernndez Toledo because he was allegedly exercising his trade union rights, and neither did the authorities commit any acts of persecution or harassment against him. The aforementioned person is not a trade union leader and has never been subjected to harassment or pressure by the authorities. He was prosecuted by the People s Municipal Court of Trinidad for contempt and sentenced to a one-year prison term with custodial hard labour, and is currently out on parole;(f)\tMr Yoanny Limonta Garca, who is also not a union official and has no employment relationship, was subjected to police checks because of his repeated commission of acts classified as offences and other antisocial behaviour (in  for speculation, in  for possession, production and sale of instruments for the purpose of committing crimes, and in  for usurpation of public office);(g)\tMr Mateo Moreno Ramn and Mr Leandro Vladimir Aguilera Pea were not arrested; they simply received warnings from the relevant authorities, in strict compliance with the law, to prevent them from carrying out their criminal intentions;(h)\tthe restrictions on the right to free movement of Mr Osvaldo Rodrguez Daz and Mr Alejandro Snchez Zaldvar were implemented in accordance with current migration legislation. Mr Snchez Zaldvar has had no employment relationship since  and has a long history of violation of existing rules, regulations and laws, including allegations of illegal economic activities and disobedience. The allegations of threats and harassment against him and his wife are also untrue. Mr Snchez Zaldvar has participated in several trade union events and workshops abroad funded by a foreign power. In , as part of his activities against Cuba, he travelled to Geneva in the context of the th International Labour Conference. During the current year, his freedom to travel has not been arbitrarily restricted and the authorities have acted only in accordance with migration law(i)\tMs Magela Garcs Ramrez wrote and disseminated an article in which she made serious and groundless accusations against a significant number of artists and art institutions and, given the seriousness of the allegations, her employer decided that she should work for a different art collection, which is why she decided to resign from her post; and(j)\tMs Sara Cuba Delgado was not subjected to surveillance and harassment by state officials.\n.With respect to the restrictions on ASIC members and officials travelling and participating in international events, the Government indicates that current migration legislation determines the grounds on which the authorities may restrict the right of a citizen to leave the country and this power is exercised by the relevant authorities in a non-arbitrary manner and respecting legal guarantees. It also denies preventing certain persons from leaving their homes during the  May celebrations or imposing house arrests.\n.With regard to recommendation (c) concerning the exercise of the right to strike in practice, the Government states that current legislation does not include any prohibition of this right and that criminal legislation does not provide for any penalty for exercising this right. The fact that workers do not use this mechanism is not due to a legislative prohibition but to the fact that they have the option of resorting to other more effective means at their disposal, including a number of different forms of meaningful participation and the exercise of genuine decision-making power on matters that concern them. Furthermore, the protection of trade"", 'whatsoever, to establish independent trade union organizations of their own choosing, outside any existing trade union structure if they so desire (Article  of the Convention), and the right to elect their representatives in full freedom (Article  of the Convention)"".\n.The complaint is contained in a communication of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) dated  October . This organization sent additional information in a communication dated  July .\n.At its meeting of June , noting that it had not received any reply to the allegations from the Government, the Committee made an urgent appeal and indicated that in accordance with procedure it would examine the case at its next meeting even if the Government\'s reply had not been received (see th Report of the Committee, para. ).\n.The Government replied to the allegations contained in the first communication from the ICFTU in a communication dated  July .\n.Cuba has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.In its communication of  October , the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) alleges that Mr. Rafael Gutierrez, one of the leaders of the Union of Workers of Cuba (USTC), was twice refused permission to leave Cuba to attend meetings of the ICFTU Committee on Human and Trade Union Rights, held in November  and June . The Government alleged that Mr. Gutierrez was still subject to a sentence resulting from his opposition to the Government; the real reason for the refusal was that for the last two years he had been trying to secure official recognition of the USTC, and had been imprisoned for that reason, but released following pressure brought to bear by the international trade union movement. The non-recognition of the USTC was examined by the Committee in its th Report (Case No. ), paras. -). In protest against the Government\'s refusal to let him leave Cuba, Mr. Gutierrez went on a hunger strike on  June, which he ended on  July, due to the solidarity expressed by the international trade union movement.\n.The ICFTU adds that according to the Confederation of Democratic Workers of Cuba (CTDC), Mrs. Edith Lupe, organization secretary of the Trade Union Front of the CTDC, was summoned to appear on  May  at the Department of State Security, located in Reparto Capri, in the Havana municipality of Arroyo Naranjo, by the commander of this body. Inside the aforementioned premises, the official threatened her with offensive and gross language. He told her he ""was going to make her disappear or imprison her for three years"" if she did not relinquish her organizational activities in the CTDC ranks. After this verbal aggression, a body search was carried out and Mrs. Lupe was stripped and subjected to a thorough examination. She was then threatened once again and placed in a cell which the Cuban agents use to carry out further acts of intimidation. Before she left the cell, officer Cortina delivered a stern warning to the effect that her home might be attacked by ""mobs"" throwing stones and that she might be attacked and beaten by ""neighbours from the district"".\n.The ICFTU also alleges during the week of - July  that CTDC officials were the victims of a violent demonstration by the so-called ""Rapid Response Brigades"" outside the residence of Mrs. Edith Lupe, organization secretary of the Trade Union Front of the CTDC. The dissidents Juan Jos Lpez Diaz and Welmen Lazaro Noa were also at her residence at the time. Officials of the Ministry of the Interior and members of the Communist Party of Cuba participated in this demonstration.\n.Furthermore, on  August , in the Avenida  del Rpto. Siboney, in the municipality of Playa, Havana, Mr. Lazaro Corp Yeras, general secretary of the Union of Cuban Workers (USTC) and his younger son, Ray Corp Morales, were severely beaten up with sticks by three men. Both suffered serious injuries. The ICFTU states that it has reason to believe that the aggressors had links with the Cuban security forces. This assault, the fifth in less than three months against Mr. Lazaro Corp, once again shows the flagrant violation by the Government of Cuba of internationally recognized trade union rights and principles.\n.After condemning the terrible harassment to which independent trade unionists in Cuba are subject, and which has often been denounced by the ICFTU, this organization emphasizes the total lack of freedom of association in Cuba.\n.In its communication of  July , the ICFTU alleges that the Department of State Security is severely harassing members of the National Executive Committee and the Trade Union Fronts which make up the Confederation of Democratic Workers of Cuba (CTDC). This is especially the case of Juan Guarino Martinez Guillen (president), Jesus Crdenas Lpez (vice-president) and Rene Jos Montero Garay (secretary responsible for international relations). This organization has also submitted the necessary documentation in order to obtain its legal personality but to date it does not seem to have the slightest chance of obtaining its registration.\n.The ICFTU states that on  September , at  p.m., Mr. Rene Jos Montero Garay was ordered to appear at the Unit of the National Revolutionary Police (PNR) in calle Dragones esquine Lealtad, in the centre of Havana. He was questioned by several officials of this repressive body, who threatened him and warned him that both he himself and Martinez Guillen and Jesus Crdenas would be sentenced to - years\' imprisonment if they pursued their militant activities in the CTDC and if they continued their defence of the Cuban working class. Moreover, on  November , at . p.m., Messrs. Juan Guarino Martinez Guillen, President of the CTDC, and Jesus Crdenas Lpez, vice-president of the same organization, were arrested by the Department of State Security. They were taken to the nearest police station, where they were subjected to brutal and offensive interrogation.\n.The ICFTU also states that, according to its sources, Mr. Eduardo Lamas Campos, a member of the Trade Union Front of the ""Julio Antonio Mella"" central organization, in Santiago de Cuba, Oriente, was expelled from his workplace simply because he had called for improvements in working conditions and food, since the food available was both small in quantity and of very poor quality.\n.In its communication of  July , the Government explains that the delay in sending its reply was due mainly to the difficulties of locating information concerning the persons mentioned in the communication from the ICFTU, since none of these persons has trade union status, the events in question are not of a trade union nature, the persons concerned do not represent any group of workers, nor do they themselves have any employment relationship with any enterprise or labour body in Cuba, all of which places the Committee on Freedom of Association in a situation of having to deal with events which have no relationship with the laudable task which it carries out of defending trade union freedoms.\n.That being said, the Government adds that the inquiries carried out on the basis of the scant information contained in the complaint have shown that Mr. Rafael Gutierrez could not complete his plans to travel to a foreign country since at that time he was on bail pending legal proceedings against him in the criminal courts. Mr. Rafael Gutierrez subsequently left the country on the dates given by the ICFTU in its communication.\n.The Government adds that the ICFTU complaint mentions the name of Edith Lupe. This name, as well as the description of the events, are incorrect. On the basis of some of the elements contained in the communication, it was possible to determine the real identity of the person, and to ascertain what really happened. The matter concerns Enid Amelia Luque Rosales, and not Edith Lupe, as stated by the ICFTU. On  May, she was summoned to the ninth station of the National Revolutionary Police, located in Reparto Capri, and was given a warning for having carried out provocative activities against public order, in accordance with the applicable legislation. She was summoned and received in one of the offices of the above-mentioned police station, not in the Department of State Security, as erroneously stated by the ICFTU. She remained in this office for a short period of time, and was not placed in any cell or subjected to any body search. The Government adds that, according to statements made by Enid Amelia Luque Rosales, the intention of the provocative acts which were carried out in the company of four delinquents was to obtain favours and guarantees from the Section of United States Interests in Havana, with a view to obtaining a visa for permanent residence in the United States. The Government states that it is incorrect that Juan Jos Lpez Diaz and Wilmer Lazaro Mora Beltran were the victims of a violent demonstration or that they were at the residence of the said Enid Amelia Luque when a group of neighbours']"

The Committee hopes that the necessary arrangements will be able to be made shortly so that this mission can take place as soon as possible.""\n.In a communication received on  November  the Salvadorian Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the ILO that the direct contacts mission could visit the country.\n.The Director-General of the ILO appointed Mr. Andrs Aguilar, member and former president of the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights and member of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights as his representative to conduct the mission. The mission took place in San Salvador from  to  January . During the mission the Director-General\'s representative was accompanied by Mr. Alberto Odero, member of the Freedom of Association Branch of the International Labour Standards Department, and Mr. Luis Zamudio, Regional Adviser on Standards.\n.The mission was received by the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare, His Excellency Miguel Alejandro Gallegos, by Dr. Lzaro Tadeo Bernal Lizama, Vice Minister of Labour and Social Welfare, and Dr. Antonio Lara Gavidia, Head of the International Affairs Department of the Ministry, by the members of the Labour and Social Welfare Committee of the Legislative Assembly, by senior officials of the Ministry of Justice, and by representatives of employers"" and workers\' organisations.\n.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.In the first place, the Committee wishes to thank Mr. Andrs Aguilar for having agreed to carry out the direct contacts mission, as well as for his detailed report on the pending cases, which has allowed the Committee to examine them. The Committee considers that the report of the Director-General\'s representative attests to the usefulness of missions of this kind in clarifying matters arising from allegations by the complainant organisations.\n.Since the content of the allegations and the information supplied by the Government, as well as the information obtained by the Director-General\'s representative during the mission are contained in the mission report (see Annex), the Committee can proceed directly to formulate its conclusions on the various cases.\n.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:General recommendations(a) The Committee takes note of the report of the Director-General\'s representative on the mission carried out in El Salvador from  to  January . The Committee also notes that the mission enjoyed full freedom of action and movement and that the authorities of the Ministries of Labour and Justice with which it came into contact gave it every facility and co-operated actively in obtaining the information requested by the Committee on Freedom of Association.(b) The Committee notes that, according to the mission report, although there has been a marked drop in the frequency of attempts on lives and physical integrity and in the number of disappearances and arrests of persons connected with the trade union movement since the elections of May , there is continued insecurity.(c) The Committee also notes that the mission ascertained that a wide variety of trade union organisations representing all tendencies exist and operate in the country and that they play an active and militant role in national life and resort to strikes. The organisations having recourse to such action include public-sector workers\' organisations, despite the fact that such action is illegal for this category of workers. Nevertheless, according to the mission report, trade union activities are often conducted in an atmosphere of fear which has an unfavourable effect on their exercise, and according to the organisations interviewed, such activities are viewed with hostility in many employers\' circles - particularly in the private sector - which oppose the formation of organisations and the exercise of their rights.(d) In general, the Committee concludes from the mission report that there is still a need to make much progress in El Salvador to achieve genuine respect for human rights in general and trade union rights in particular. The Committee notes that according to the authorities of the Ministry of Labour, this is one of the main objectives of Government policy, and concrete measures to this effect have been and are being taken.(e) While the Committee is aware of the serious difficulties El Salvador is facing, it calls on the Government to adopt appropriate measures to guarantee that trade union rights may be exercised in a normal fashion; this will only be possible in conditions in which fundamental human rights are respected and in a climate free of violence, pressures and threats of any kind.Cases Nos. , ,  and (a) The Committee regrets that the proceedings relative to the homicide of Manuel Antonio and Jos Antonio Carrillo Vzquez and of Santiago Hernndez have failed to identify those responsible for the crime, and that they have been dropped.(b) The Committee requests the Government to take steps with a view to the opening of an investigation into the alleged homicide of Toms Rosales, Jos Santos Tiznado and Pedro Gonzlez, in respect of whom there is no record of proceedings having been opened. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments concerning the disappearance of the trade union leader Rafael Hernndez Olivo, as well as of the final outcome of the proceedings concerning the wilful homicide of the trade unionists Rodolfo Viera, Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer, indicating whether the investigation has been able to establish who instigated the crime committed by the two defendants.Case No. (a) The Committee regrets that the trade unionist Marta Imelda Dimas remained in prison for over two months.(b) The Committee draws the Government\'s attention to the fact that the detention of trade unionists for trade union activities or membership is contrary to the principles of freedom of association.Case No. (a) The Committee requests the Government to undertake an investigation to determine the whereabouts of the trade union leaders Elsy Mrquez and Jos Snchez Gallegos, and to keep it informed thereof.(b) The Committee notes that some of the trade unionists mentioned by the complainants are free, and awaits the information promised by the Government concerning another  trade unionists whose arrest has been alleged and whose names are listed in the conclusions (concerning these  trade unionists, the Government reported that none of the persons listed is at present imprisoned in any of the detention centres in the country, but that further investigations will be carried out to determine whether they had been imprisoned at some stage in police centres).Case No. (a) As regards the murder of trade union leader Juan Pablo Meja Rodriguez, the Committee notes that proceedings have reached the stage of examination of witnesses, and that no one has yet been arrested.

According to the ICFTU, hundreds of people, including many trade unionists, were murdered or disappeared following the coup d\'tat. Many other trade union leaders and activists saved their lives by fleeing the country or by going into hiding. Trade union offices were ransacked and closed. The few trade union offices which stayed open were only able to do so because they remained extremely discreet. All the same, normal trade union activity was impossible, and it was necessary for personal reasons to recall the representative of the ICFTU in Haiti.\n.The list of specific cases provided by the ICFTU is, according to this organization, in no way exhaustive in light of the fact that obtaining information and testimony in Haiti was extremely difficult because of the risk of jeopardizing the safety of the people concerned. These examples none the less demonstrate the brutal and merciless repression carried out against the democratic trade union movement by the illegitimate Government and the military authorities in Haiti:- On  October , Joseph Manucy Pierre, the information secretary of the Autonomous Confederation of Haitian Workers (CATH), was arrested in the Confederation\'s premises by army officers. Following a quick international reaction, the army released him and withdrew the charges against him. To protect his life, Mr. Manucy went into hiding.- The General Independent Organization of Haitian Workers (OGITH) closed its offices on  September  and reopened them only recently for limited activities. Following an interview given by Mr. Schiller Marcelin, the General Secretary of the OGITH, to an American radio station in November , army officers warned the leaders of the OGITH that Mr. Marcelin\'s remarks were ""stupid and dangerous"". Mr. Marcelin decided to remain in the United States. Mr. Andr Franois, the Treasurer of the OGITH, also took refuge in the United States after he was threatened by the military.- Teachers affiliated with the National Confederation of Haitian Teachers (CNEH) have been harassed and intimidated by the military. Many have been transferred to other schools, and the homes of some others have been burned in arson attacks. The trade union leaders of the CNEH have gone into hiding and the Confederation\'s headquarters have been closed.- On  November  soldiers tried to abduct Daniel Lubin, one of the trade union leaders of the CNEH, who was outside the headquarters. He was able to flee.- On  January , Jean-Claude Museau, a member of the CNEH and a teacher in Les Cayes, was abducted by army officers when they discovered that he had in his possession literature in favour of President Aristide. They tortured him, forcing him to swallow the documents in question. Mr. Museau died on  January  as a consequence of this torture.- On  March , Parnel Boyer, a member of the CNEH, narrowly escaped from his house, which was burned down in an arson attack. Witnesses said that members of the army set the fire.- On  March, a demonstration organized by the FENEH (students\' federation) at the Education Faculty (State University) was violently dispersed by the army. Messrs. Bernard Canatus and Edrice St. Amand, teachers who supported the FENEH action, were wounded.- On  May, a number of students who were members of the FENEH gathered at the Faculty of Human Sciences (a department of the State University) to express their grievances. Several military squads broke into the campus, fired shots and seriously injured some of the demonstrators. Many students were arrested. During the incident, some soldiers searched for Mr. Camille Chalmers in the buildings of the university. Mr. Chalmers is known as an adviser to the Trade Union of Electricity Workers and was accused of being the instigator of the students\' gathering. He was badly beaten in front of witnesses and subsequently arrested. After three hours of interrogation, he was released. He suffered head injuries.- On  May, Patrick Morisseau, a teacher and trade unionist, was arrested by the police in Port-au-Prince. The same night, his mother, Mrs. Claire Eduard, was murdered. Her sister Suzette, as well as the Secretary of the women\'s branch of the OGITH, Marie Carline Philisias, were threatened and harassed.- In a radio programme on the night of  May, the government radio station divulged the names of five teachers. The government employees working at this radio station accused them of being the main instigators of demonstrations organized by students at public schools and of supporting the political opposition. These accusations were a serious and deliberate threat for the people concerned, who have since gone into hiding. Because of this threat, Jean Raynold Pierre, Robert Beausil, Wilfrid Menthor, Daniel Fignole, Saint Amour Firmin and Mrs. Henri fear for their lives.- In a memorandum published in July  in the newspaper Le Matin, the National Confederation of Haitian Teachers (CNEH) condemned acts of violence committed at universities, and in particular the violent incidents which took place at the Faculty of Medicine, during which some students were taken hostage and a number were beaten. Mr. Blaise, a young member of the Executive Committee of the National Federation of Students (FENEH), was seriously injured. According to the CNEH, the repression had never been so serious.- The military government reportedly set up a new ""union"" of workers under the name of ASTRE at Teleco, the telephone company, to replace the legitimate trade union already existing there. Trade union leaders and trade unionists of the democratic trade union SOETEL were dismissed.- The military government also forcibly replaced the trade union leaders of the journalists\' union, AJH. The union was dismantled through acts of harassment and intimidation committed against its leaders, and the new pro-military leaders condemned the legitimate leaders in speeches made on the radio.- The Trade Union of Electricity Workers (FESTREDH) was particularly singled out by the army. Its members were harassed, threatened and dismissed. One of its members was murdered. Jean Delince Josma, a member of the FESTREDH, was reportedly murdered by the army in October. Shortly after the coup d\'tat of September, the army broke into buildings of the National Electric Company, threatening and harassing members of the FESTREDH. The director of the company, who had just been named, refused to follow the army\'s orders to dismiss the trade union leaders, and was dismissed himself. Subsequently,  members of the FESTREDH were dismissed in mid-December . On  December , two trade union leaders of the FESTREDH, Abel Pointdujour and Evans Saintune, were arrested when they tried to negotiate compensation for the company\'s workers who had been dismissed after the coup d\'tat. They were only released three days later, after having been interrogated about their supposed political links and been advised that they should, in the interest of their own safety, leave the country. During these three days, their homes were also searched. Two months later, they were able to take refuge in Canada, where they requested political asylum. The General Secretary went into hiding after having discovered that his name was on a list of trade union leaders and leaders of grass-roots organizations sought by the army. A jeep belonging to the trade union and used by trade union leaders to maintain contact with their members in the countryside was destroyed by the army.- In January, two other leaders of the FESTREDH were arrested and harassed by the army. Delamain Ambroise and Raynald Garnier were abducted by unidentified policemen and beaten during their detention. They were subsequently released and dismissed from their jobs. On  April , several members of the executive and two trade union representatives, Patrice Cantave and Jonas Desinor, were severely beaten by the army. From the month of September on, all the members of the executive and the FESTREDH were dismissed because of their trade union activities.- Farmers\' trade unions have also been subjected to intimidation and harassment from the military. On  May , Jacques Joseph, the President of the CLAM, a farmers\' trade union affiliated with the OGITH, and his wife were arrested and severely beaten. They were accused of leading a demonstration calling for the return of President Aristide. They were later released.- At the beginning of May, Daniel Pierre, the President of the UDTL, a trade union of farmers in Boukan Michel which is affiliated with the OGITH, was detained by the section chief, Yvon Verdieu. Mr. Pierre was threatened and prohibited until further notice from holding trade union meetings in the absence of the section chief.- On  May, Thermilien Pierre, a member of an agricultural workers\' organization affiliated with the OGITH, was arrested and beaten for having shouted: ""Yes to the embargo!""- The Association of Agricultural Workers of Artibonite, which is affiliated with the Federation of Haitian Workers (FTH), was warned that it was no longer authorized, until further notice was given by the police, to', '.In Case No. , the initial complaint of the ICFTU of  November  concerned violations of human rights and trade union rights resulting from the military coup d\'tat of September  which overthrew the democratically elected Government of Haiti.
