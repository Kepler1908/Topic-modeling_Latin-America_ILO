All the same, normal trade union activity was impossible, and it was necessary for personal reasons to recall the representative of the ICFTU in Haiti.\n.The list of specific cases provided by the ICFTU is, according to this organization, in no way exhaustive in light of the fact that obtaining information and testimony in Haiti was extremely difficult because of the risk of jeopardizing the safety of the people concerned.

During these three days, their homes were also searched. Two months later, they were able to take refuge in Canada, where they requested political asylum.

Mr. Ivo Adio Garca Rivera, an official of the Trade Union of Electricity and Energy Workers was abducted and freed the following day after being submitted to severe psychological pressure and that these events were related to a work stoppage in August . Furthermore, the ICFTU alleges the assassination of Mr. Eric Osberto Berganza Pacheco, an official of the Trade Union of Workers of the National Electrification Institute on  July , which the trade union says was the result of his trade union activities. Further threats were also made against the trade unionist Dbora Guzmn and against the child which she was expecting, to make her force her husband, Flix Hernndez, an official of the Lunafil Trade Union, to leave the trade union. The ICFTU adds also that Mr. Ernesto Bol, an official of the Trade Union of the Workers of the City of Coban was severely beaten and insulted on  November  by unknown people; furthermore it was not possible for him to be reinstated in his post even with the existence of a judicial order to this effect.\n.Finally, the ICFTU alleges that in the Las Delicias farm, in Retalhuleu, which belongs to the Good Year S.A. Rubber Plantations multinational enterprise, attempts have been made for many years to destroy the Trade Union of Rubber Plantation Workers in the Las Delicias farm through radical anti-union measures designed to intimidate workers, such as the systematic dismissal of workers who were trade union members, violations of the fundamental right to engage in collective bargaining (the enterprise has appointed a group of non-unionized workers to represent all the workers) and the unacceptable measures of reprisal taken by the enterprise, such as the closing down of the school and clinic which depend on the enterprise and the recent refusal to pay wages for the last two months to unionized workers.\n.The Committee notes the willingness of the Government to reply to all the allegations and the extensive report of the Presidential Commission for the Coordination of Executive Policy on Human Rights and observes that it contains some information on most of the pending allegations concerning deaths, disappearances, acts of violence against trade unionists and anti-union dismissals. The Committee notes that proceedings or investigations have been initiated concerning the death of the trade unionists Juan Tarax and Lilian Elizabeth Jurez Escobar (the responsible official was placed before the competent court), Camilo Ajqui Gimon (who the Government denies as a unionist), Adrin Miranda Lpez and Velizario Lpez Rojas, the arrests of the trade unionists Silvio Pastor, Pablo Itzel, Teodoro Pastor, Rolando Pastor and Francisco Pastor (which resulted in the dismissal of a captain), the abduction of Walter Njera Molina (who was released), the disappearance of Gustavo Rosalio Vsquez Lpez and the attacks against Ernesto Bol. However, the Committee deeply regrets that the information supplied by the Government gives no indication that significant progress has been made in the investigations of the numerous cases of alleged violence. The Committee therefore requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard. The Committee also notes the information from the Government categorically denying the alleged police repression of strikers at the Social Security Institute on  February  (no force was used and the police presence was confined to guaranteeing freedom to work), and that the detention of officials of the STIGSS during a strike was for a short period and due to the unlawful seizure of vehicles, and that the guilty parties were fined by the magistrates court; the Government also denies that there has been any detention or arrest of trade unionists in the Mahler y Sucesoras enterprise on  March  and states that there was only a meeting held during working time and which resulted in the signing of documents in an agreement reached between the parties on the existing labour dispute.\n.The Committee notes that the Government requests clarification from the complainants on the following allegations: the death of Messrs. Jos Mara Incuyat, Julio Csar Prez and Pedro Genovevo Escobar, the armed attack against Mr. Victor Alfredo Chacoj and the attacks against Werner Coc Ramrez. The Committee therefore requests the complainants to provide the information available to them on these allegations to enable the Government to reply.\n.As regards the"", 'members of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and social organizations. The Committee notes the Government\'s statement that none of the different forms of violence that Colombia is suffering may be imputed to the State as its policy or as the conduct of its responsible organs and agents. Thus, if occasionally, by way of an exception, persons in state service should have become involved in conduct in violation of human rights, deviating from their duties and going against the permanent instructions of those responsible for guiding the actions of public servants, their crime has invariably met with strong censure from society and an inexorable response from the State in terms of punishment. The Government indicates that according to the information provided by the Office of the High Counsellor for Human Rights that the majority of human rights violations come from self-defence groups followed by members of the paramilitary forces and subversives. The Committee takes note of the intimidatory pamphlets reproduced in the Government\'s reply in which the self-defence forces threaten trade union activists and leaders. It also takes note of the data furnished by the High Commissioner for Peace on the convictions, detentions and trials against the members of these self-defence forces. Finally, the Committee takes notes of the Government\'s statement that the armed conflict has killed over , people in the past decade of whom some  were involved in trade unions and some  were trade union officials and that these figures are very different from the statistics provided by the complainants.\n.While taking note of the important difficulties encountered by the Government and its efforts in accelerating the peace process and eliminating violence, the Committee deplores the fact that, since the previous examination of the case in March , more acts of violence have been committed against trade union officials and members ( murders, three attempted murders, disappearances and death threats) and more acts of anti-union discrimination. Additionally, the Committee deeply deplores the fact that none of the investigations under way has identified the perpetrators, which confirms the existence in Colombia of a climate of impunity favouring further acts of violence and the fact that holding trade union office involves risk to the safety of the individuals involved particularly in regions where the conflict is more acute. The Committee also regrets to note that the Government has only sent observations on part of the allegations, failing to reply to the vast majority of the prior requests for information.\n.The Committee reiterates that ""the killing, disappearance or serious injury of trade union leaders and trade unionists requires the institution of independent judicial inquiries in order to shed full light, at the earliest date, on the facts and circumstances in which such actions occurred and in this way, to the extent possible, determine where responsibilities lie, punish the guilty parties and prevent the repetition of similar events"" and that ""the absence of judgements against the guilty parties creates, in practice, a situation of impunity, which reinforces the climate of violence and insecurity, and which is extremely damaging to the exercise of trade union rights""(see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , paras.  and ).\n.In these circumstances, noting that the situation remains alarming, the Committee urges the Government to take immediate measures to determine where responsibilities lie, try and punish the guilty parties, and prevent the repetition of acts of violence and anti-union acts against union leaders and unionists.Acts of violence concerning which the Committee requested at its March  meeting to be kept informed of the development of investigations\n.Concerning the allegations regarding which the Government had reported at the March  meeting or earlier that investigations and legal proceedings were under way, the Committee regrets to note that the Government has not sent any new information on the development of proceedings concerning the individuals mentioned in the following two paragraphs and urges the Government to provide information in that respect without delay.Murders\n.() Antonio Moreno Asprilla ( August ); () Manuel Ballesta ( August ; () Francisco Mosquera Crdoba (February ); () Carlos Arroyo de Arco (February ); () Francisco Antonio Usuga ( March ); () Pedro Luis Bermdez Jaramillo ( June ); () Armando Umanes Petro ( May ); () William Gustavo Jaimes Torres ( August ); () Jaime Eliacer Ojeda; () Alfonso Noguera Cano; () Alvaro Hoyos Pabn ( December ); () Nstor Eduardo Galndez Rodrguez ( March ); () Erieleth Barn Daza ( May ); () Jhon Fredy Arboleda Aguirre; () William Alonso Surez Gil; () Eladio de Jess Chaverra Rodrguez; () Luis Carlos Muoz ( March ); () Nazareno de Jess Rivera Garca ( March ); () Hctor Gmez ( March ); () Gilberto Casas Arboleda; () Norberto Casas Arboleda; () Alcides de Jess Palacios Casas ( February ); () Argiro de Jess Betancur Espinosa ( February ); () Jos Isidoro Leyton ( March ); () Eduardo Enrique Ramos Montiel ( July ); () Libardo Cullar Navia ( July ); () Wenceslao Varela Torrecilla ( July ); () Abraham Figueroa Bolaos ( July ); () Edgar Camacho Bolaos ( July ); () Flix Avils Arroyo ( December ); () Juan Camacho Herrera ( April ); () Luis Orlando Camao Galvis ( July ); () Hernando Cuadros Mendoza (); () Freddy Francisco Fuentes Paternina ( July ); () Vctor Julio Garzn ( March ); () Isidro Segundo Gil Gil ( December ); () Jos Silvio Gmez ( April ); () Enoc Mendoza Riasco ( April ); () Luis Orlando Quiceno Lpez ( July ); () Arnold Enrique Snchez Maza ( July ); () Camilo Surez Ariza ( July ); () Mauricio Tapias Llerena ( July ); () Atilio Jos Vsquez (July ); () Odulfo Zambrano Lpez ( October ); () Alvaro Jos Taborda Alvarez ( January ) (mentioned in the allegations as having disappeared); () Elkin Clavijo ( November ); () Alfonso Nio ( November ); () Luis Emilio Puerta Orrego ( November ); () Fabio Humberto Burbano Crdoba ( January ); () Osfanol Torres Crdenas ( January ); () Fernando Triana ( January ), () Francisco Hurtado Cabezas ( February ), () Misael Daz Ursola ( May ); () Sabas Domingo Socadegui Paredes ( June ); () Jess Arley Escobar Posada ( July ); () Jos Ral Giraldo Hernndez ( November ); () Bernardo Orrego Orrego; and () Jos Eduardo Umaa Mendoza ( April ).Disappearances\n.() Rodrigo Rodriguez Sierra ( February ); () Ramn Osorio Beltrn ( April ); () Alexander Cardona ( July ); and () Mario Jimnez ( July ).Acts of violence outstanding at the March  meeting of the Committee concerning which the Government sent observations\n.Concerning the allegations which remained outstanding at the examination of this case in March , the Committee notes that the Government reports that it has opened judicial investigations into the following cases: murders: Jos Vicente Rincn (murdered on  January  in Barrancabermeja); Jorge Boada Palencia (murdered on  April ); Jorge Duarte Chvez (murdered in Barrancabermeja on  May ); Carlos Rodrguez Mrquez (murdered on  May ); Arcngel Rubio Ramrez Giraldo; Orfa Ligia Meja (murdered on  October ); Macario Herrera Villota; Vctor Eloy Mieles Ospino and Rosa Ramrez; attempted murders: Virgilio Ochoa Prez; Eugeniano Snchez; Benito Rueda Villamizar. The Committee expresses its grave concern and repudiates these acts and requests the Government to keep it informed as a matter of urgency on the results of the investigations and prosecutions under way.\n.Concerning the allegations of the attempted murders of the trade union leaders Tarcisio Mora, Jess Antonio Gonzlez Luna and Jos Domingo Tovar Arrieta, the Committee notes that the Government refutes the allegations of these incidents and denies, in the three cases, that such attacks took place, presenting police reports which support its position.Recent acts of violence concerning which the Government is awaiting information\n.As concerns the alleged murders of trade union leaders and members regarding which the Government reports that it is awaiting specific information from the Office of the Procurator-General (Oscar Artunduaga Nuez, Jess Orlando Arvalo, Moiss Canedo Estrada, Gladys Pulido Monroy, Oscar David Calandn Gonzales, Oswaldo Rojas, Julio Alfonso Poveda, Pedro Alejandrino Melchor Tapasco and Manuel Avila Ruiz), the Committee notes that concerning Jess Orlando Arvalo, Julio Alfonso Poveda, Vctor Eloy Mieles Ospino and Rosa Ramrez, the Government discounts any connection between the murders and the trade union activities of the deceased. In order to be able to pronounce itself in this regard, the Committee urges the Government without delay to ensure that investigations have been opened and to keep it informed in this respect.Acts of violence into which the investigations have been adjourned\n.Concerning the eight murder cases where the investigations have been adjourned by the competent Procurator\'s Office (Ernesto Emilio Fernndez Pezter, murdered on  November ; Libardo Antonio Acevedo, murdered on  July ; Magaly Pearanda, murdered on  July ; David Quintero Uribe, murdered on  August ; Aurelio Arbelez, murdered on  March ; Jos Guillermo Asprilla Torres, murdered on  July ; Carlos Arturo Moreno Lpez, murdered', 'serious injuries sustained by Tarciso Mora, president of the Colombian Federation of Teachers (FECODE) and Osvaldo Rojas Arvalo, president of the Trade Union of Employees of the Department of Cali. The Committee urges the Government promptly to communicate its observations on all these allegations.(q) In regard to death threats against trade union officials and trade union members of CUT, FECODE, USO, UNEB, SINTRAEMCALI contained in the new allegations and additional information, the Committee asks the Government to continue to provide protection for all trade union officials and trade union members in a situation of risk, and to proceed with investigations to identify and convict the guilty parties and to inform the Committee of the action taken in this regard.\n.The Committee last examined this case at its March  meeting (see th Report, paras. -). The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) sent additional information in communications dated  March,  June,  August and  October . The World Federation of Trade Unions sent additional information in a communication dated May . The Single Confederation of Workers of Colombia (CUT) and the Trade Union Association of Civil Servants of the Ministry of Defence, Armed Forced, National Police and related bodies (ASODEFENSA), submitted new allegations relating to this case in communications dated  April,  and  October, and  June  respectively. The Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) presented new allegations in communications of  and  October . The General Confederation of Democratic Workers (CGTD) presented allegations relating to this case in communications of  and  October .\n.The Government sent partial observations in communications dated  and  March and  May .\n.Colombia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.Before analysing the allegations and observations communicated by the Government, the Committee wishes to reiterate the grave concern it had expressed when it examined this case in its meetings of March  and March  (see th and th Reports, paras.  and ), regarding the allegations which relate principally to murders (over ), disappearances, physical aggression, detentions and death threats against trade union officials and members and raids on trade union premises.\n.The Committee recalls that the report of the direct contacts mission to Colombia in  stated that ""an impressive amount of violence is targeted against persons holding trade union office or whose physical integrity and personal freedom are attacked solely on account of their trade union activity"" (see th Report, op. cit., p. ). The Committee deplores that it must acknowledge not only that violence against trade unions has not declined, but that the allegations communicated in recent years (-) appear to indicate that it has increased. Similarly, the Committee is deeply concerned and notes with consternation that there is no indication that any perpetrators of the alleged acts of violence against trade union officials and members have been arrested, tried and sentenced, thereby demonstrating the ""total impunity"" reported by the National Procurator to the direct contacts mission (see th Report, report on the mission to Colombia, p. ). Moreover, taking into account the nature of the allegations and that it was mentioned in the report of the last direct contacts mission that the Public Defender in his  report to Congress affirmed that ""there are still people in the armed forces and police who commit illegal and arbitrary acts in the course of their military and police activities"" and ""today thousands of Colombians are still terrorized by paramilitary groups"" (see th Report, p. of the English version), the Committee, observing that the situation has not improved since that time, condemns the progressive deterioration of the situation and points out that it is the responsibility of the Government to guarantee the correct comportment of its security forces which, in any event and at all times, must respect human rights.\n.Similarly, the Committee notes with deep concern that the acts of violence against trade union officials and members have extended to persons close to them, by reason either of family ties, or of their professional activities. In this regard, the Committee deeply regrets the murder of Dr. Jos Uma a Mendoza on  April  in the city of Bogot. Dr. Uma a Mendoza was the defence attorney of the officials and members of the Workers\' Trade Union (USO), some of whom feature on the list of persons in detention appearing in the annex to this report. Consequently, the Committee urges the Government to put an end to all acts of violence against trade union officials and members and those close to them.\n.The Committee emphasizes that ""the killing, disappearance or serious injury of trade union leaders and members requires the institution of independent judicial inquiries in order to shed full light, at the earliest date, on the facts and on the circumstances in which they occurred and in this way, to the extent possible, determine where responsibilities lie, punish the guilty parties and prevent the repetition of similar events"", and that ""the absence of judgements against the guilty parties creates, in practice, a situation of impunity which reinforces the climate of violence and insecurity, and which is extremely damaging to the exercise of trade union rights"" (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , paras.  and ).Allegations of acts of violence regarding which investigations have been instituted\n.Regarding the allegations pending after examination of the case in the March  version, the Committee notes that the Government states that judicial investigations have been initiated in connection with the following cases: Aurelio Arbelez (murdered on  March ); Guillermo Asprilla (murdered on  July ); Flix Avils Arroyo (murdered on  December ); Juan Camacho Herrera (murdered on  April ); Luis Orlando Camao Galvis (murdered on  July ); Hernando Cuadros (murdered in ); Freddy Francisco Fuentes Paternina (murdered on  July ); Nstor Eduardo Galindo (murdered on  March ); Vctor Julio Garzn (murdered on  March ); Isidro Segundo Gil Gil (murdered on  December ); Jos Silvio Gmez (murdered on  April ); Enoc Mendoza Riasco (murdered on  April ); Carlos Arturo Moreno (murdered on  June ); Luis Orlando Quiceno Lpez (murdered on  July ); Nazareno de Jess Rivera (murdered on  March ); Arnold Enrique Snchez Maza (murdered on  July ); Camilo Surez Ariza (murdered on  July ); Mauricio Tapias Llerena (murdered on  July ); Atilio Jos Vsquez (murdered in July ; while the complainant organization lists him as disappeared, the Government includes him on the list of murder victims); Luis Abel Villa Len (murdered on  July ); Odulfo Zambrano Lpez (murdered on  October ); Pedro Acosta Uparela (disappeared on  December ); Rodrigo Rodrguez Sierra (disappeared on  February ); Alvaro Taborda (disappeared on  January ). Death threats: Aguirre Restrepo Oscar, Arango Alvaro Alberto, Barrio Castao Horacio, Cadavid Martha Cecilia, Franco Jorge Humberto, Giraldo Hctor de Jess, Gutirrez Jairo Humberto, Jaramillo Carlos Hugo, Jaramillo Galeano Jos Luis, Ramos Zapata Rangel, Restrepo Luis Norberto, Jorge Sliecer Marn Trujillo, Vctor Ramrez. Detentions: Edgar Riao, Marcelino Buitrazo, Felipe Mendoza, Monarge Snchez, Guillermo Crdenas, Rafael Estupin, Hernn Vallejos, Luis Rodrigo Carreo, Leonardo Mosquera, Fabio Livano, Csar Carrillo. The Committee expresses its deep concern over these acts of violence and murders and condemns them. It requests the Government to keep it informed, as a matter of urgency, of the judicial investigations and proceedings under way.\n.Likewise, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the judicial investigations under way, as stated during the previous meeting of the Committee (March ), in connection with murders, disappearances and death threats against the following trade union officials and members: Murders: Antonio Moreno ( August ); Manual Ballesta ( August ); Francisco Mosquera Crdoba (February ); Carlos Arroyo de Arco (February ); Francisco Antonio Usuga ( March ); Pedro Luis Bermdez Jaramillo ( June ); Armando Umanes Petro ( May ); William Gustavo Jaimes Torres ( August ); Ernesto Fernndez Pezter; Jaime Eliacer Ojeda; Alfonso Noguera; Alvaro Hoyos Pabn ( December ); Libardo Antonio Acevedo ( July ); Nstor Eduardo Galndez Rodrguez ( March ); Erieleth Barn Daza ( May ); Jhon Fredy Arboleda Aguirre, William Alonso Surez Gil and Eladio de Jess Chaverra Rodrguez ( February  to  March ); Luis Carlos Muoz ( March ); Nazareno de Jess Rivera Garca ( March ); Hctor Gmez ( March ); Gilberto Casas Arboleda, Norberto Casas Arboleda, Alcides de Jess Palacios Arboleda and Argiro de Jess Betancur Espinosa ( February ); Bernardo Orrego Orrego ( March ); Jos Isidoro Leyton ( March ); Magaly Pearanda ( July ); David Quintero Uribe ( August ); Eduardo Enrique Ramos Montiel ( July ); Libardo Cullar Navia ( June ); Wenceslao Varela Torrecilla ( July ); Abraham Figueroa Bolaos ( July ); Edgar Camacho Bolaos ( July ); Disappearance: Ramn Osorio (disappeared']"

Mr. Ivo Adilio Garca Rivera, an official of the Trade Union of Electricity and Energy Workers, was abducted and freed the following day after being submitted to severe psychological pressure and that these events were related to a work stoppage in August .
