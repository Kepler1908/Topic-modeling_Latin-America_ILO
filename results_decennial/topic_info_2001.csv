While regretting that the proceedings currently pending at the Office of the Attorney-General with respect to four workers have not been concluded despite the fact that the events go back to December  or January , the Committee firmly hopes that the authorities will rapidly conclude the investigations and requests the Government to keep it informed of any decision that is taken;' the Committee requests the Government to send it the decision adopted by the labour inspectorate regarding the reassessment of the dismissal of trade unionist Gustavo Silva and draws attention to the delays in the conduct of these proceedings;' with regard to the dismissal of FEDEUNEP trade unionist Cecilia Palma, the Committee requests the Government to inform it whether she has appealed against the ruling of  September  and, if so, to keep it informed of the outcome of her appeal; and' in general, the Committee deeply regrets the excessive delay in the administration of justice with regard to several aspects of this case and emphasizes that justice delayed is justice denied and that this situation prevents the trade unions and their members from exercising their rights effectively.\n.Furthermore, at its March  session, the Committee urged the Government to send the requested information urgently and without delay, and to give effect to those recommendations [see th Report, para. ].\n.Furthermore, the Committee requested the Government to respond specifically to the following allegations by UNAPETROL, which were submitted in its communications of  March and  September . The complainant organization UNAPETROL indicated that the auditing body of the PDVSA summoned around  dismissed workers ' including union officials ' who participated in the '  work stoppage in the petroleum sector as part of investigations into the losses of millions of dollars incurred during the stoppage. According to UNAPETROL, these were undefined and vague accusations, which lacked proof, and were another example of anti-union persecution.\n.UNAPETROL added that the public summons issued by the enterprise put forward conclusions relating to the national civic work stoppage which were not within its remit, when stating that  an analysis of the information contained in the written and audiovisual mass media showed that the prerequisites for workers to initiate strike procedures were not met  ?\n.The complainant organization noted furthermore that there was a substantial amount of proof, which was duly presented to the Attorney-General s Office ' as well as records of public statements made by UNAPETROL spokespersons and public hearings in which they participated ' relating to inappropriate operational procedures, acts of negligence, incompetence and the use of physical violence at various operational sites of the enterprise just after the dismissals had taken place and once members of the national armed forces had taken control of the facilities, and that this proof attests to the absolute innocence of all the dismissed workers. The evidence has been completely overlooked and ignored by the Tax Auditor s Office, the PDVSA Operational Audit Unit and even the Attorney-General s Office. In this connection, UNAPETROL enclosed the following:' copies of the document presented by a group of lawyers and representatives of these workers to the Attorney-General s Office in April , containing certificates of safe transfer for installations that were later found to be damaged, once officials of the regime had taken control of operations; and' documents presented to the Tax Auditor s Office and the PDVSA Operational Audit Unit by Vctor Ramos and Horacio Medina, the internal control secretary and the president of UNAPETROL, who were summoned to meetings on  and  December , respectively. According to UNAPETROL, the documents demonstrate how these workers were subjected to an act of persecution and retaliation while they were totally defenceless. Furthermore, union officials Edgar Quijano and Rodolfo Moreno, the labour assistance secretary and the vice-president of the disciplinary tribunal of UNAPETROL, were publicly summoned to meetings on  April and  June ; Horacio Medina, president of UNAPETROL, was also summoned.\n.In its communication dated  October , the Government reiterates the content of the communications that it has submitted to the Committee on Freedom of Association on previous occasions ' since  February  ' especially Communication No. /, dated  October , in which it requested that the case be closed, as it considered that the statements and arguments it had provided in response to the Committee s requests were not only sufficient, relevant and sound but also demonstrated that those of the complainants were groundless. Lastly, the Government reiterates its request with regard to the appraisal of the allegations put forward by the parties in this case and the consideration and fair assessment of the information provided by the Government.\n.The Committee regrets that the Government has not provided the specific information that it requested in the recommendations that it made in March  and March , which it therefore reiterates. Furthermore, the Committee once again requests the Government to respond specifically to the allegations by UNAPETROL, which were submitted in its communications of  March and  September , given that it has merely reiterated information that has already been examined. Given the seriousness of the pending issues, the Committee ultimately trusts that the Government will fully cooperate with the procedure and will respond in detail to the questions that have been asked.\n.Lastly, given the time that has elapsed since the presentation of the complaints and the Government s failure to communicate the requested information, the Committee invites the complainant organizations to communicate any relevant information on the matters that are pending.\n.At its March  meeting, the Committee regretted that, despite the seriousness of the case, the Government had not sent information relating to the following recommendations [see th Report, paras ' ]:' bearing in mind the importance of due process of law being respected, the Committee trusts that the trade union leader, Carlos Ortega, will be released without delay and requests the Government to send it the decision handed down by the authority hearing the appeal. The Committee also requests the Government to send it a copy of the sentence handed down by the court of first instance (with all the reasons and conclusions therefor) in respect of the trade union leader Carlos Ortega (the Venezuelan Workers' Confederation (CTV) has sent only a copy of the record of the public hearing at which the decision of the court and the sentence were made public);' the Committee requests the Government to recognize FEDEUNEP and to take steps to ensure that it is not the object of discrimination in social dialogue and in collective bargaining, particularly in the light of the fact that it is affiliated to the CTV ' another organization that has encountered problems of recognition which the Committee has already examined in the context of this case. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any invitation it sends to FEDEUNEP in the context of social dialogue. The Committee recalls the principle that both the government authorities and employers should refrain from any discrimination between trade union organizations, especially as regards recognition of their leaders who seek to perform legitimate trade union activities [see Digest, , para. ];' with regard to the dismissal of over , workers from PDVSA and its subsidiaries in  for having taken part in a strike during the national civic work stoppage, the Committee notes the Government s statements, and specifically that only  per cent of the appeals lodged with the labour inspectorate and other judicial authority have not yet been ruled upon. The Committee deeply regrets that the Government has disregarded its recommendation that it enter into negotiations with the most representative workers' federations in order to find a solution to the dismissals at the PDVSA and its subsidiaries as a result of the organization of or participation"", ""of violence against trade union members and acts of anti-union discrimination, as well as obstacles to the exercise of trade union rights and social dialogue, denial of legal status to several unions and system failures leading to impunity with regard to criminal and labour matters.\n.For the fifth time, the Committee deeply deplores the numerous acts of violence denounced in the complaint and expresses its deep and growing concern for the high number of murdered union leaders and members. The Committee once again draws the Government s attention to the fact that union rights can only be exercised in a climate free from violence, intimidation and threats of any kind against trade union members, and that it is for governments to ensure that this principle is respected [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ].\n.The Committee observes that since this case was last examined, a complaint regarding Guatemala s breach of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), has been filed by several Workers' delegates at the st Session () of the International Labour Conference under article  of the Constitution of the ILO. The Committee notes that at its March  session, the ILO Governing Body decided, in view of the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding between the Government of Guatemala and the Workers' group of the ILO Governing Body on  March , to defer its decision on the appointment of a Commission of Inquiry to its October  session.\n.The Committee notes with interest that in this Memorandum of Understanding, the Government of Guatemala pledges, inter alia: to institute, through the competent bodies of the state, independent and expeditious inquiries at the earliest date to determine responsibilities and punish the intellectual and material authors of murders of trade unionists; and to guarantee the safety of workers, and through effective protection measures, that of trade union officials and leaders as well as union property, against violence and threats so that they can carry out their trade union activities. The Committee firmly hopes that the commitments made by the Government in the Memorandum of Understanding will translate into concrete actions and results. In this regard, the Committee notes with interest the information provided by the Government on the first actions it has taken to apply the Memorandum of Understanding signed on  March , and in particular: the creation of a permanent policy committee of State ministers and union leaders to be held every month; the setting up of a technical committee made up of representatives from the represented federations and confederations and authorities from the Ministry of Interior, to find out about and address specific acts of violence; the establishment of specific meetings between the Ministry of Interior and specific federations and confederations to address the particular security problems of their leaders; and the establishment of a hotline to the Ministry of Interior for immediately reporting threats and crime in order to prevent and combat these issues. The Committee urges the Government to keep it informed at the earliest opportunity of the full range of actions taken to apply the Memorandum of Understanding and of the results achieved.\n.The Committee notes the statements made by the MSICG relating to the complete inefficiency of the criminal investigation agencies, the weakness of the Special Public Prosecutor for Offences against Trade Union Members and the practice of the Public Prosecutor s Office of dismissing the possibility that the crime was motivated by anti-union sentiment from the outset.\n.The Committee notes that the Government of Guatemala indicates that the Public Prosecutor s Office of Guatemala has decided to institutionalize a high-level working group with the country s main trade union federations to analyse cases of violence against trade union members, which will meet every month after March  and that, in addition, the Public Prosecutor s Office reiterates its request for ILO technical assistance to more effectively tackle anti-union violence.\n.The Committee notes the information provided by the Government on the progress of the investigations and criminal prosecutions concerning  murders examined by the Committee on Freedom of Association, most of them in the context of this case. The Committee observes that the Special Public Prosecutor for Offences against Trade Union Members deals with a minority of the murders identified, that the Public Prosecutor s Office considers that a substantial number of victims do not have trade union links, and that most of the murders are cases of ordinary crime. The Committee also observes that judicial sentences have been handed down in six cases, one of which was a prison sentence, that the investigations had stalled in  cases and that the investigations or next steps of the criminal proceedings of the other murders will continue.\n.Regarding the murders of Mr Diego Gustavo Chite Pu and Mr Sergio Alejandro Ramrez Huezo, the Committee notes the information provided by the Government stating that they died as a result of the use of excessive force by the municipal police who fired upon informal traders who had refused to be removed on  May , and that the Criminal Court for Narcotics Offences and Crimes against the Environment of the municipality of Coatepeque sentenced the chief of the municipal police to a prison term of  years and six months.\n.Regarding the murders of Mr Pedro Zamora and Mr Pedro Ramrez de la Cruz, the Committee notes criminal courts' acquittals of the possible perpetrators of these murders. The Committee deeply regrets the situation of impunity that results from this situation. The Committee recalls that the absence of judgments against the guilty parties creates, in practice, a situation of impunity, which reinforces the climate of violence and insecurity, and which is extremely damaging to the exercise of trade union rights [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. The Committee urges the Government to reopen the investigations so that all those who took part in these murders (perpetrators and instigators) as well as the motives for the crimes are identified, and that those responsible are prosecuted and held to account by the courts. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any developments in this regard.\n.The Committee notes the information provided by the Government regarding the initiation of criminal proceedings in connection with the murders of Mr Romero Estacuy, Mr Vctor Glvez, Mr Jorge Humberto Andrade and Mr Adolfo Ich and of the ongoing investigations concerning the murders of Mr Mario Caal, Mr Pedro Antonio Garca, Mr Manuel de Jess Ramrez, Ms Vctor Alejandro Soyos Suret, Mr Juan Fidel Pacheco Curec, Ms Evelinda Ramrez Reyes, Mr Salvador del Cid, Ms Mara Juana Chojln Pelic, Mr Miguel ngel Felipe Sagastume and Mr Idar Joel Hernndez Godoy. Recalling the need, in a case in which judicial inquiries connected with the death of trade unionists seemed to be taking a long time to conclude, of proceedings being brought to a speedy conclusion [see Digest, op. cit., para. ], the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the progress and results of these proceedings and investigations.\n.With regard to the ongoing investigation into the murder of Mr Idar Joel Hernndez Godoy, a SITRABI leader, the Committee observes that the Public Prosecutor s Office is not considering the possibility that the crime was motivated by anti-union sentiment even though another leader from the same union was murdered in recent years (Mr Marco Tulio Ramrez Portela), the union reported receiving death threats against its leaders and members, and the victim was travelling in a union-owned vehicle. The Committee therefore urges the Government to explain at the earliest opportunity the reasons why the Public Prosecutor s Office disregarded the possible anti-union motive behind the murder and that the necessary steps be taken to identify and bring to justice those responsible for the murder.\n.With regard to the murders of Marco Tulio Ramrez Portela, Jaime Nery Gonzlez, Julin Capriel Marroqun, Lisinio Aguirre Trujillo, Julio Csar Ixcoy Garca, Rosalio Maldonado Lorenzo, Norma Jeannette Zente Ordoez, Julio Pop Choc, Inmer Orlando Borror Set, Samuel Ramrez Paredes, Hctor Garca, Walter Anbal Ixcaquic Mendoza, Norma Jeannette Zente Ordoez, Wilson Morales and Olga Marina Ramrez Sane, the Committee notes with the utmost concern the Government s information that the investigations have stalled. The Committee observes with particular concern that, in the majority of cases, the Public Prosecutor s Office does not supply substantial amounts of information about the steps taken to identify possible links between the victims' union activities and their murder.\n.With regard to the murder of Ms Maura Antonieta Hernndez, named by the complainant as a member of the prison service union executive committee (being formed), the Committee observes that the Government states that the victim could not have been a trade unionist because she worked in the prison service where there are no unions by law. While also noting the Government s indication that the present case is the result of a retaliation by the Salvatrucha gang against the prison service, the Committee nevertheless wishes"", ""considers it essential that there will be legislation to ensure that in the future certain  excesses' of  abuses' are avoided, but questions whether the amendments have been in accordance with normal and rational practice, i.e. through collective bargaining, and that resort was made instead to the subjective and arbitrary government authority through public officials. The Committee observes that the complainant organization emphasizes that nowhere in Constituent Resolution No.  does it state that the revising commission (of collective agreements) is composed solely of officials of the Ministry of Labour and Employment. That was defined, emphasizes FETRAPEC, by the Ministry of Labour and Employment in Ministerial Order No. , which grants discretionary powers to that commission and excludes any administrative or judicial appeal; the  contributions' of workers' organizations and the employer, according to that order, will be appraised by the commission applying the principle of  healthy criticism' \n.To the extent that this case involves legal instruments (Constituent Resolutions, regulations, ministerial orders) which affect conditions of work, the Committee wishes to emphasize the importance of prior consultation of employers' and workers' organizations before the adoption of any legislation in the field of labour law [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth edition, , para. ]. The Committee highlights that it is important that consultations take place in good faith, confidence and mutual respect, and that the parties have sufficient time to express their views and discuss them in full with a view to reaching a suitable compromise [see Digest, op. cit., fifth edition, , para. ]. In the present case, nothing indicates either the Government s statements or the content of the legal texts to which the complainants object, that in-depth consultations were held in advance and allowing sufficient time with the workers' organizations concerned (which deplore the unilateral nature of the legal instruments in question) and for that reason, the Committee requests the Government in future to take into account the aforementioned principles in order, as far as possible, to reach shared solutions.\n.As regards the provisions in the Constituent Resolutions which set a cap on remuneration in the public sector (No. ), compensation for unfair dismissal and other causes of termination of the employment relation (No.  and No. ) or prohibit supplementary private pension schemes which involve contributions of State resources (Executive Decree No.  of  October , which provides that State resources shall not be contributed to funds of a private nature), the Committee does not doubt the expressed will of the Government to look after the general interest, ensure equality, avoid unreasonable excesses in collective agreements and ensure financial and budgetary balance, but wishes to emphasize that these are permanent and unalterable limitations on the right of collective bargaining of workers' organizations incompatible with Convention No. , which provides for free and voluntary bargaining of conditions of work and if the Government wishes to pursue a policy which seeks those objectives which, moreover, are legitimate, it can do so in the framework of collective bargaining without resorting to impositions which limit the content of bargaining by the parties to that bargaining. The Committee recalls that limitations on the free determination of wages in collective bargaining are only acceptable in exceptional circumstances. In this respect, the Committee has indicated that  If, as part of its stabilization policy, a government considers that wage rates cannot be settled freely through collective bargaining, such a restriction should be imposed as an exceptional measure and only to the extent that is necessary, without exceeding a reasonable period, and it should be accompanied by adequate safeguards to protect workers' living standards' [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. Furthermore, the Committee has taken the view that the parties involved in collective bargaining can improve the legal provisions on pensions [see rd report, Case No. , para. ].\n.Furthermore, the Committee recalls the principle that repeated recourse to legislative restrictions on collective bargaining can only, in the long term, prejudice and destabilize the labour relations climate if the legislator frequently intervenes to suspend or terminate the exercise of rights recognized for unions and their members. Moreover, this may have a detrimental effect on workers' interests in unionization, since members and potential members could consider useless joining an organization, the main objective of which is to represent its members in collective bargaining, if the results of such bargaining are constantly cancelled by law [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. The Committee also recalls that the right to bargain freely with employers with respect to conditions of work constitutes an essential element in freedom of association, and trade unions should have the right, through collective bargaining or other lawful means, to seek to improve the living and working conditions of those whom the trade unions represent. The public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof. Any such interference would appear to infringe the principle that workers' and employers' organizations should have the right to organize their activities and to formulate their programmes [see Digest, op. cit., para. ].\n.The Committee has considered that measures taken unilaterally by the authorities to restrict the scope of negotiable issues are often incompatible with Convention No. ; tripartite discussions for the preparation, on a voluntary basis, of guidelines for collective bargaining are a particularly appropriate method of resolving these difficulties [see Digest, op. cit., para. ].\n.In particular, the Committee also emphasizes the principle that the reservation of budgetary powers to the legislative authority should not have the effect of preventing compliance with collective agreements entered into by, or on behalf of, that authority [see Digest, op. cit., para. ].\n.The Committee requests the Government to restore the right of collective bargaining on conditions of work and living standards of workers and to inform it accordingly.\n.With respect to the alleged declaration of absolute nullity or the imposition of the revision of clauses of collective agreements by administrative means (in those cases where the administrative authority considers that the clauses of such agreements contain excesses and unreasonable privileges which conflict with the general interest in the numerous cases listed indicatively in Constituent Resolution No.  and its regulations for application), the Committee observes that the administrative procedure is regulated by Ministerial Order No.  and Order No. A, both of the Ministry of Labour. The Committee emphasizes that control of clauses of public sector agreements for possible abuse should not be up to the administrative authority, since it cannot be both judge and party, but a matter for the judicial authority, and then only in extremely serious cases, and not for just any significant benefit which has been agreed. The Committee therefore requests the Government that control of allegedly abusive clauses of collective agreements should only be carried out through the courts, so as to ensure impartiality, the right of defence and due process. The Committee observes that in the present case, the decisions of the administrative authorities are not subject to any appeal whatsoever, whether administrative or judicial and considers that the current regulations, especially the instruments of the Ministry of Labour and Employment, which allow it unilaterally to declare void or reduce a wide range of clauses of collective agreements, is a serious violation of the principle of free and voluntary bargaining. Therefore, the Committee requests the Government to annul those ministerial texts and their effects and to indicate whether Constituent Resolution No.  is compatible with exclusively judicial control (not administrative) of the possible abusive character of certain clauses of collective agreements in the public sector. The Committee requests the authorities that, if it is wished to amend the result of collective bargaining, it should wait until the expiry of the collective agreements and the respective employers should renegotiate their content with the trade union organizations.\n.More specifically, with respect to the revision of the clauses of the collective agreements of the Petroecuador company and its subsidiaries and the health sector, by decision of the commission on the revisions of collective agreements in the public sector, the Committee notes the excesses of some of the clauses highlighted by the Government, and that the complainant organization FETRAPEC implicitly recognizes some excesses in certain clauses. The Committee considers that, in conformity with the principles and considerations expressed in the foregoing paragraphs, the revisions made by the Ministry of Labour and Employment should be cancelled. The Committee understands that the FETRAPEC organizations would be disposed to engage in renegotiation with their employers and that this would probably also be the case in the health sector, where, for example, the clause on working hours and days, and other clauses, were declared void.\n.The Committee requests the Government to take steps to ensure that these collective agreements are renegotiated if the trade union organizations confirm the wish to do so.\n.The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of measures taken to give effect to its recommendations and, noting the request of the complainant organizations, invites the Government to""]"

The Committee reiterates the importance of ensuring that the perpetrators receive sentences that are in proportion to the seriousness of their crimes, with a view to preventing any recurrence of the latter, and that FEDECAMARAS and the leaders concerned are compensated for the damage caused by these illegal acts. The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the issues raised by FEDECAMARAS with regard to the bomb attack on its headquarters.(c) As regards the allegations of the seizure of farms, land recoveries, occupations and expropriations to the detriment of current or former employers' leaders, the Committee requests that those current or former leaders of FEDECAMARAS be compensated in a just manner. At the same time, the Committee refers to the decision of the Governing Body in March , in which it  urged the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to develop and implement the Plan of Action as recommended by the high level tripartite mission, in consultation with national social partners'  which involved, as mentioned by the mission,  the establishment of a round table between the Government and FEDECAMARAS, with the presence of the ILO, to deal with all pending matters relating to the recovery of estates and the expropriation of enterprises and other related problems arising or that may arise in the future'  and regrets that the Government stated in its last communication that establishing a dialogue round table on questions of recovery of estates and holding consultations on legislation are not viable. The Committee urges the Government to implement this request along the lines described in the conclusions and to report thereon. Finally, like the high-level tripartite mission, the Committee emphasizes  the importance of taking every measure to avoid any kind of discretion or discrimination in the legal mechanisms governing the expropriation or recovery of land or other mechanisms that affect the right to own property' (d) As regards the structured bodies for bipartite and tripartite social dialogue which need to be established in the country, and the plan of action in consultation with the social partners, involving the establishment of stages and specific time frames for its implementation with the technical assistance of the ILO, as recommended by the Governing Body, the Committee notes the Government s indication that it has not yet concluded the process of consultation with different sectors and organizations and requests the Government to ensure that FEDECAMARAS is included in all these processes. The Committee recalls that the conclusions of the mission refer to a round table between the Government and FEDECAMARAS, with the presence of the ILO, and a tripartite dialogue round table, with the participation of the ILO and an independent chairperson. The Committee urges the Government to immediately adopt tangible measures with regard to bipartite and tripartite social dialogue as requested by the high level tripartite mission. Noting that the Government has not yet provided the requested plan of action, the Committee urges the Government to implement without delay the conclusions of the high-level tripartite mission endorsed by the Governing Body and to report thereon. The Committee urges the Government to promote social dialogue and initiatives taken in this area, such as the meeting held between the authorities and FEDECAMARAS in February , and to immediately implement tripartite consultations.(e) Finally, the Committee, in line with the conclusions of the high-level tripartite mission, urges the Government to take immediate action to create a climate of trust based on respect for employers' and trade union organizations with a view to promoting solid and stable industrial relations. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of any measures taken in this regard. The Committee further requests the Government, as a first step in the right direction that should not pose any problem, to enable a representative of FEDECAMARAS to be appointed to the Higher Labour Council.(f) The Committee notes with concern the new allegations by the IOE and FEDECAMARAS of  November  concerning: (i) the detention of Mr Eduardo Garmendia, president of CONINDUSTRIA, for  hours; (ii) the shadowing and harassment of Mr Jorge Roig, president of FEDECAMARAS; (iii) an escalation of the verbal attacks on FEDECAMARAS by high-level state officials in the media; and (iv) the adoption by the President of the Republic, in November , of  decree laws on important economic and production-related matters without consultation of FEDECAMARAS. The Committee requests the Government to send complete observations on these allegations.(g) The Committee notes with concern the new allegations from the IOE and FEDECAMARAS and takes note of the recent Government observations on some of the allegations. The Committee requests the Government to complete its response and intends to review the issues raised therein in a detailed manner at its next meeting in May .(h) The Committee draws the special attention of the Governing Body to the extremely serious and urgent nature of this case.\n.In respect of recommendation (g), the report on the previous examination of the case only contains a very brief summary of the allegations and the responses from the Government as these were only received shortly before the Committee s March  meeting. Accordingly, a detailed account of the said allegations and the responses from the Government is provided below.\n.In a communication of  March , the IOE and the Venezuelan business association FEDECAMARAS denounce once again the continuing harassment of the country s free employers by the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and protest to the Committee on Freedom of Association of the ILO about new attacks on the private sector and on private Venezuelan companies, many of which are members of FEDECAMARAS, the county s most representative employers' organization. This tactic comprises new acts of aggression and public vilification by the Venezuelan Government targeted against Venezuelan companies and employers, which in the month of February  alone resulted in the sudden detention of more than  employers and managers of companies distributing food and medicines and of private union organizations providing in-patient care, supermarket servicing and meat distribution, along with the de facto seizure, by the Government, of a private food-distribution company, accusing it of conspiring against the Government, without due process or respect for their right to defence, incidents which have been widely publicized by the media.\n.The complainant organizations recall that, one year ago, in March , the ILO officially requested the Venezuelan Government to urgently adopt an action plan to launch a social dialogue in the country based on respect and the absence of intimidation against independent and representative employers' and trade union organizations. This insistent request was prompted by concerns relating to violation of the right to freedom of association and the freedom to form trade unions of employers and workers in the"", ""Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) While once again expressing its deep concern at the various and serious forms of stigmatization and intimidation by the Bolivarian authorities, groups and organizations directed against FEDECAMARAS, its member organizations, their leaders and affiliated companies, including threats of imprisonment, statements of incitement to hatred, accusations of conducting economic warfare, the occupation and looting of shops and the seizure of FEDECAMARAS headquarters, the Committee draws the Government s attention to the urgency of taking strong measures to prevent such actions and statements against individuals and organizations that are legitimately defending their interests under Conventions Nos  and , which have been ratified by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. The Committee strongly urges the Government to take all necessary measures to ensure that FEDECAMARAS is able to exercise its rights as an employers' organization in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind against its leaders and members and to promote, together with that organization, social dialogue based on respect.(b) As regards the abduction and mistreatment in  of FEDECAMARAS leaders Mr Noel lvarez, Mr Luis Villegas, Mr Ernesto Villamil and Ms Albis Muoz (the latter sustained three bullet wounds), while noting the sentencing of one of the accused to  years and eight months' imprisonment, the Committee requests the Government to send a copy of the ruling issued and to continue providing additional information concerning any penalties imposed on the perpetrators of these crimes, and concerning any compensation to FEDECAMARAS and to the leaders concerned for damage caused by those illegal acts. Furthermore, the Committee reiterates its request to the Government to send its observations concerning the points raised by FEDECAMARAS with regard to the bomb attack on its headquarters on  February .(c) As regards the allegations of the seizure of farms, land recoveries, occupations and expropriations to the detriment of current or former employers' leaders, the Committee insists that those current or former leaders of FEDECAMARAS be compensated in a just manner. At the same time, the Committee refers to the decision of the Governing Body in March , in which it  urged the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to develop and implement the Plan of Action as recommended by the high-level tripartite mission, in consultation with national social partners'  which in turn refers to  the establishment of a round table between the Government and FEDECAMARAS, with the presence of the ILO, to deal with all pending matters relating to the recovery of estates and the expropriation of enterprises and other related problems arising or that may arise in the future'  The Committee regrets that the Government stated in previous communications that establishing a dialogue round table on questions of recovery of estates and holding consultations on legislation are not viable and that, in its latest communication, it merely indicates that it proceeded in compliance with the law. The Committee firmly urges the Government to implement this request along the lines described in the conclusions and to report thereon. Lastly, like the high-level tripartite mission, the Committee emphasizes  the importance of taking every measure to avoid any kind of discretion or discrimination in the legal mechanisms governing the expropriation or recovery of land or other mechanisms that affect the right to own property' (d) As regards the structured bodies for bipartite and tripartite social dialogue which need to be established in the country, and the plan of action in consultation with the social partners, involving the establishment of stages and specific time frames for its implementation with the technical assistance of the ILO, as recommended by the Governing Body, the Committee regrets the lack of information and further progress in this regard. The Committee recalls that the conclusions of the mission also refer to a round table between the Government and FEDECAMARAS, with the presence of the ILO, and a tripartite dialogue round table, with the participation of the ILO and an independent chairperson. The Committee urges the Government to immediately adopt tangible measures with regard to bipartite and tripartite social dialogue as requested by the high-level tripartite mission. Observing that the Government has not yet provided the requested plan of action, the Committee urges the Government to implement fully without delay the conclusions of the high-level tripartite mission endorsed by the Governing Body and to report thereon. The Committee urges the Government to promote social dialogue and initiatives taken in this area, such as the meetings held between the authorities and FEDECAMARAS in February and October , and to implement tripartite consultations immediately.(e) The Committee, in line with the conclusions of the high-level tripartite mission, urges the Government to take immediate action to create a climate of trust based on respect for employers' and trade union organizations with a view to promoting solid and stable industrial relations. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of any measures taken in this regard. The Committee regrets that the Government has not appointed a representative of FEDECAMARAS to the Higher Labour Council or the social dialogue body fulfilling its functions, and urges the Government to do so as soon as possible.(f) The Committee, having noted the Government s observations concerning the allegations of detention and trial of employers and leaders in various sectors, regrets that once again a full answer has not been provided in relation to the individuals who are the subject of investigation procedures. As regards the cases of Corporacin Crnica and the  Da a Da Practimercados' chain, the Committee urges the Government to indicate the specific allegations against the people under investigation or trial by the judicial authorities, and not merely give an indication of general criminal offences, and to provide information on the progress of the respective judicial proceedings and their compliance with precautionary or detention measures. The Committee again requests the authorities to consider lifting any preventive detention measures imposed on employers' and business leaders pending trial. As regards the allegation of the detention of the managers of the FARMATODO pharmacy chain, the Committee requests the Government to confirm whether the charges against these individuals have been dropped or, if not, to indicate the specific allegations against them and to provide information on the progress of the respective judicial proceedings; and, in view of the complainants' allegation that four of the owners and managers of this pharmacy chain had been arrested, the Committee urges the Government to indicate whether any other individuals are currently under arrest or trial, and it invites the complainant organizations to provide the Government and the Committee with any detailed information that they may have on this matter.(g) As regards the allegations of the detention of the president of CONINDUSTRIA, Mr Eduardo Garmendia, the president of ANSA, Mr Luis Rodrguez, and the president of the Venezuelan Association of Clinics and Hospitals, Mr Rosales Briceo, and allegations of shadowing and harassment of the president of FEDECAMARAS, Mr Jorge Roig, given the divergences between the allegations and the Government s reply, the Committee invites the complainants to provide the Government and the Committee with additional information, including any evidence they may have, and it urges the Government, on the basis of such information, to carry out any relevant additional investigations and to keep the Committee informed on this matter.(h) As regards the adoption by the President of the Republic, in November , of  decree-laws on important economic and production-related issues without consulting FEDECAMARAS, the Committee regrets that the Government has not made any observation concerning their impact on social dialogue and, deeply deploring the persistence of this situation, it firmly expects that full consultations will be held in the future with the most representative organizations of workers and employers, including FEDECAMARAS, on draft legislation covering labour or social matters that affect their interests and those of their members.(i) The Committee expresses its deep concern at the lack of information and progress on the above issues and urges the Government to take all the requested measures without delay.(j) The Committee notes with great concern the new allegations of the IOE and FEDECAMARAS dated  May , in which it is alleged: (i) the enactment in December , without consultation with the social partners, of  national laws, including the law on job security; (ii) semblance of dialogue through communications to FEDECAMARAS by the Government, when it has already announced or adopted the measures concerned; (iii) the unilateral promulgation without prior consultation of the Decree of the President of the Republic declaring a state of emergency for economic hardship; (iv) new acts of intimidation against FEDECAMARAS; (v) approval without consultation of a new increase in the minimum wage and the value of the socialist Cestaticket in February ; and (vi) failure by the Government to implement the road map presented to the Governing Body of the ILO in March . The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on these allegations without delay so that the Committee can examine all the relevant elements.(k)"", ""Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.In its previous examination of the case in March , the Committee made the following recommendations on the matters still pending [see rd Report, para. ]:(a)\tRegarding the abduction and maltreatment of the FEDECAMARAS leaders, Messrs Noel lvarez, Luis Villegas, Ernesto Villamil and Ms Albis Muoz (Employer member of the Governing Body of the ILO), the latter being wounded by three bullets, the Committee deplores the offences that were committed, emphasizes their seriousness and requests the Government to take all the steps within its power to arrest the other three persons involved in the abductions and wounding, and to keep it informed of developments in the investigations. The Committee notes the Government s statement that a public hearing was scheduled for  October  and expresses the hope that the persons guilty of these crimes will soon be convicted and sentenced in proportion to the seriousness of the offences in order that such incidents will not be repeated and requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect. At the same time, the Committee notes with concern the IOE s statement in its additional information that Ms Albis Muoz, employers' leader and one of the victims of aggression, has asserted that neither of the suspects arrested (Mr Antonio Jos Silva Moyega and Mr Jason Manjares) were the instigators of the aggression, as well as the IOE s reservations as to the idea that the motive of the aggression was car theft.(b)\tRegarding the criminal investigation ordered by the Public Prosecutor s Office into the public declarations by the President of FEDECAMARAS, Mr Noel lvarez, the Committee wishes to state that, in the context described by the IOE, the declarations do not in its opinion appear to contain any criminal content and should not normally have given rise to a criminal investigation. However, so that it can reach its conclusions in full possession of the facts, the Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the allegation.(c)\tRegarding the alleged attacks on FEDECAMARAS headquarters in , the Committee had requested FEDECAMARAS to file an official complaint on the subject with the Public Prosecutor s Office. The Committee reiterates that recommendation and indicates that if the organization has not done so by the Committee s next meeting, it will not pursue its examination of this allegation any further; noting however that an environment of harassment and lack of confidence in the public authorities is not conducive to the proposed lodging of its official complaints.(d)\tRegarding the alleged bomb attack on FEDECAMARAS headquarters on  February , the Committee notes the Government s statement that the persons charged, Mr Juan Crisstomo Montoya Gonzlez and Mrs Ivonne Gioconda Mrquez Burgos, have confessed in full to the crimes of public intimidation and unlawful use of identity papers, that a preliminary public hearing was set for  November  and that, as soon as a final ruling on the case was handed down, the Committee would be duly informed. The Committee emphasizes the importance that the guilty parties should be punished in proportion to the seriousness of the crimes committed and the employer organization compensated for the loss and damage on account of these illegal acts. The Committee is waiting to be informed of the sentence handed down.(e)\tObserving the various acts of violence committed against FEDECAMARAS or its officials, the Committee again draws the attention of the Government to the fundamental principle that the rights of workers' and employers' organizations can be exercised only in a climate free of violence, intimidation and fear, as such situations of insecurity are incompatible with the requirements of Convention No. .(f)\tRegarding the Committee s recommendation that the Government restore the La Bureche farm to the employers' leader, Mr Eduardo Gmez Sigala, and compensate him fully for all the damage caused by the authorities in occupying the farm, the Committee notes that there is a contradiction between the allegations and the Government s judgment that the expropriated farm of employers' leader Mr Eduardo Gmez Sigala was idle. Be that as it may, the Committee observes that the Government does not deny the IOE s allegation that the farm is currently a military training centre (as opposed to the Government s statement that the purpose of the land rescue procedure is to encourage the agricultural use of the Valle del Ro) or the allegation that Mr Eduardo Gmez Sigala has not received any compensation. The Committee therefore once again calls on the Government to respond fully to the allegations, return the farm property without delay to the employers' leader and compensate him fully for all losses sustained as a result of the intervention by the authorities in seizing his farm.(g)\tThe Committee requests the complainant organizations to send their comments on the information and observations presented by the Government concerning the expropriation of Agroislea SA, Owen Illinois and the Turbio steel plant.(h)\tThe Committee invites the complainants to provide their observations on the Government statement on the livestock farmer Mr Franklin Brito.(i)\tRegarding the alleged confiscation ( rescue'  according to the Government) of the farms owned by the employers' leaders, Mr Egildo Lujn, Mr Vicente Brito, Mr Rafael Marcial Garmendia and Mr Manuel Cipriano Heredia, the Committee considers that it is impossible to discount the possibility of discrimination. The Committee requests the Government to ensure that they are granted fair compensation without delay and to initiate a frank dialogue with those affected and with FEDECAMARAS on the confiscations/rescues referred to and to keep it informed of developments. The Committee also requests the Government to send its observations on the attacks on the buildings owned by Mr Carlos Sequera Ypez, former President of FEDECAMARAS.(j)\tRegarding the alleged lack of bipartite and tripartite social dialogue with FEDECAMARAS, the Committee notes with concern the IOE s new allegations concerning the approval without any tripartite consultation of laws that affect the interests of employers and their organizations. The Committee regrets that the Government has not responded specifically to these allegations of the IOE and urges it to do so without delay. Moreover, observing that the serious shortcomings in social dialogue continue to exist, the Committee reiterates its earlier recommendation, as follows:' deeply deploring that the Government has ignored its recommendations, the Committee urges the Government to establish a high-level joint national committee in the country with the assistance of the ILO, to examine each and every one of the allegations and issues in this case so that the problems can be solved through direct dialogue. The Committee trusts that the Government will not postpone the adoption of the necessary measures any further and urges the Government to keep it informed in this regard;' the Committee expects that a forum for social dialogue will be established in accordance with the principles of the ILO, having a tripartite composition which duly respects the representativeness of workers' and employers' organizations. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard and invites it to request technical assistance from the ILO. The Committee also requests it once again to convene the tripartite commission on minimum wages provided for in the Organic Labour Act;' observing that there are still no structured bodies for tripartite social dialogue, the Committee emphasizes once more the importance that should be attached to full and frank consultation taking place on any questions or proposed legislation affecting trade union rights and that it is essential that the introduction of draft legislation affecting collective bargaining or conditions of employment should be preceded by detailed consultations with the most representative independent workers' and employers' organizations. The Committee once again requests the Government to ensure that any legislation concerning labour, social and economic issues adopted in the context of the Enabling Act be first subject to genuine, in-depth consultations with the most representative independent employers' and workers' organizations, while endeavouring to find shared solutions wherever possible;' the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed with regard to social dialogue and any bipartite or tripartite consultations in sectors other than food and agriculture, and also with regard to social dialogue with FEDECAMARAS and its regional structures in connection with the various sectors of activity, the formulation of economic and social policy and the drafting of laws which affect the interests of the employers and their organizations;' the Committee requests the Government to ensure that as part of its policy of inclusive dialogue (including within the Legislative Assembly), FEDECAMARAS is duly consulted in the course of any legislative debate that may affect employer interests, in a manner commensurate with its level of representativeness.The Committee deeply deplores that the Government has once again ignored these recommendation despite the fact that the Committee has been insisting on them for years.(k)\tRegarding the alleged discrimination by the authorities against FEDECAMARAS and the allegations of favouritism vis--vis parallel organizations close to the Government and lacking in independence,""]"
